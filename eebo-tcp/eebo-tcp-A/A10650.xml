            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, when I was first perswaded to communicate some of my poore labours to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, my purpose was to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto those Treatises which were extant before so much of these which I now present unto thy view, as concerneth the Elogies of the Gospell of Christ, the instrument of begetting the <hi>life of Christ in us:</hi> for little reason had I considering mine owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the frequent returnes of that service wherein these pieces were delivered, and the groning of the presse of late under writings of this nature, to trouble the world a second time with any more of my slender provisions towards the worke of the Sanctuary, in this abundance which is on every side brought in. But finding that worke grow up under mine hand into a just volume, and conceiving that it might bee both more acceptable and usefull to handle a whole Scripture together (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being both of so noble a nature, and at first view of so difficult a sense, as this Psalme is) than to single out some verse and fragment by it selfe; I therefore resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved once more to put in my Mite into the Treasurie of the Temple, which (though for no other reason) may yet I hope be for this cause accepted, because it beareth the Image and Inscription of <hi>Christ</hi> upon it. Some passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges therein are inserted which were delivered in another

order, and on other Scriptures, and some likewise which were delivered in other places, and on other occasions; which yet being pertinent to the series of the discourse, I thought might justly seeme as naturall parts, and not as <gap reason="foreign">

Now that Christ is the substance of the whole <hi>New Testament,</hi> containing the Historie, Doctrine, and Prophesies of him in the administration of the latter ages of the Church, is very manifest to all. The old Scriptures are againe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the Law and Prophets (for the historicall parts of them doe containe either typicall prefigurations of the Evangelicall Church, or inductions and exemplary demonstrations of the generall truth of Gods justice and promises, which are set forth by way of Doctrine and Precept in the Law and Prophets.) Now Christ is the summe of both these, they waited upon him in his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, to note that in him they had their accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. First, <hi>for the Law,</hi> hee is the substance of it, hee brought <hi>Grace</hi> to fulfill the exactions, and <hi>Truth</hi> to make good the prefigurations of the whole Law. The
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16264:10"/>
               <hi>ceremoniall Law</hi> he fulfilled and abolished, the <hi>morall Law</hi> hee fulfilled and established; that his obedience thereunto might be the ground of our <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> and his Spirit and grace therewith might bee the ground of our <hi>Obedience.</hi> And therefore it is called <hi>the Law of Christ.</hi> 2 For <hi>the Prophets,</hi> he is the Summe of them too,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.2. Act 10.43. 1 Pet. 1.10.11. Ioh. 5.39.</note> for to him they give all witnesse. He is the Author of their Prophesies, they spake by his Spirit; and he is the object of their Prophesies, they spake of the grace and salvation which was to come by him. So that the whole Scriptures are nothing else but a Testimonie of Christ, and faith in him, of that absolute and universall necessitie which is laid upon all the world to beleeve in his name. It is not onely <hi>necessitas praecepti,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh 3.23.</note> because wee are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto commanded, but <hi>necessitas medii</hi> too, because he is the onely Ladder betweene earth and heaven, the alone mediator betweene God and man, in him there is a finall and unabolishable covenant established,<note place="margin">Act. 4.12.</note> and <hi>there is no name but his under heaven by which a man can be saved.</hi>

For this Psalme is one of the cleerest and most compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious prophesies of the Person and Offices of Christ in the whole Old Testament, and so full of fundamentall truth, that I shall not shunne to call it <hi>Symbolum Davi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Davids Creed.</hi> And indeed there are very few, if any, of the Articles of that Creed, which we all generally professe, which are not either plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, or by most evident implication couched in this little modell. First, the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinitie</hi> is in the first words; <hi>The Lord said unto my Lord.</hi> There is <hi>Iehovah the Father,</hi> and <hi>My Lord,</hi> the Sonne, and the

sanctification or consecration of him, which was by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; by whose fulnesse he was anointed unto the Offices of King and Priest, for so our Saviour himselfe expounds this word <hi>Said,</hi> by the sealing &amp; sanctification of him to his office, Ioh. 10.34, 35, 36. Then wee have the <hi>Incarnation of Christ,</hi> in the word, <hi>My Lord,</hi> together with his dignitie and honor above <hi>David</hi> (as our Savior himselfe expounds it, Matth. 22.42.45.) <hi>Mine,</hi> that is, my Sonne by descent and genealogie after the flesh, and yet my Lord too, in regard of a higher sonship.

Wee have a <hi>Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> gathered together by the Scepter of his Kingdome, and holding in the parts thereof a blessed, and beautifull <hi>Communion of Saints, The Lord shall send forth the Rod of thy strength out of Sion; Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power in the beauties of holinesse, from the wombe of the morning, thou hast the dew of thy youth.</hi> Wee have the <hi>last Iudgment,</hi> for <hi>all his enemies must bee put under his feete,</hi> (which is the Apostles argument to prove the end of all things, 1 Cor. 15.25.) and there is the <hi>day of his wrath,</hi> wherein he shall accomplish that judgment over the heathen, and that victorie over the Kings of the earth, (<hi>who take counsell and bandie themselves against him,</hi>) which he doth here in his word beginne. We have the <hi>Remission of sinnes,</hi> comprised in his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> for hee was to offer <hi>Sacrifice for the remission of sinnes, and to put away sinne by the Sacrifice of himselfe,</hi> Eph. 1.7. He. 9.26.

And lastly, wee haue <hi>life everlasting,</hi> in <hi>the everlasting merit and vertue of his Priesthood,</hi> Thou art a <hi>Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek,</hi> and in his <hi>sitting at the right hand of God,</hi> whither he is gone as our forerunner, and to prepare a place for us, Heb. 6.20.

So from his fulnesse did there runne over a share and portion of all his graces unto his Church, Ioh. 1.16.

Revel. 1.16.2.16. Psal. 2.9. Esai. 16.1. Heb. 3.1. Ioh. 1.18. Ioh. 3.11, 12.32, 34. 5 Hee hath <hi>honoured him</hi> with many Ambassadors, and servants to negotiate the affaires of his Kingdome, <hi>some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the worke of the Ministerie, and for the Edifying of his Bodie,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20.

Ioh. 17.6. 7 Hee hath given him a <hi>power</hi> concerning the Lawes of his Church. A power to make Lawes, the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> cals it, Rom. 3.27.) Mark. 16.15, 16. A power to expound Lawes, as the <hi>morall Law,</hi> Matt. 5. A power to abrogate Lawes, as <hi>the Law of Ordinances,</hi> Col. 2.14. 8 Hee hath given him a <hi>power of judging</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16264:13"/>
condemning enemies, Ioh. 5.27. Luk. 19.27. Lastly, hee hath given him a <hi>power of remitting sinnes,</hi> and <hi>sealing pardons,</hi> which is a roiall prerogative, Matth. 9.6. Ioh. 20.23. And these things belong unto him as hee is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as well Man as God, Ioh. 5.27. For the workes of Christs mediation were of two sorts. <hi>Opera ministerii,</hi> workes of service, and ministerie, for he tooke upon himselfe the forme of a servant, and was a Minister of the Circumcision, Phil. 2.8. Rom. 15.8. and <hi>Opera Potestatis,</hi> workes of Authoritie and government in the Church. <hi>All power is given unto me in heaven and earth,</hi> Matth. 28.18.</p>
            <p>The Qualitie of this Kingdome is not Temporall or Secular, over the naturall lives or civill negotiations of men; He came not to be ministred unto, but to minister, his Kingdome was not of this World, he disclaimed any civill power in the distribution of lands and possessions, he with-drew himselfe from the people when by force they would have made him a King, and himselfe, that in this point hee might give none offence, payed tribute unto <hi>Cesar,</hi> Matth. 20.28. Ioh. 18.36. Luk. 12.13, 14. Ioh. 6.15. Matth. 17.27. But his Kingdome is Spirituall, and heavenly over the soules of men, to binde and loose the conscience, to remit and retaine sinnes, to awe and over-rule the hearts, to captivate the affections, to bring into obedience the thoughts, to subdue and pull downe strong holds, to breake in pieces his enemies with an iron rod, to hew and slay them with the words of his mouth, to implant fearfulnesse and astonishment in the hearts of hypocrites, and to give peace, securitie, protection and assurance to his people.</p>
            <p>The way wherby hee enters upon his Kingdome is ever by way of Conquest. For though the Soules of the Elect are his, yet his enemies have the first possession, as <hi>Canaan</hi> was <hi>Abrahams</hi> by Promise, but his seeds by Victorie. Not but that Christ proclaimes peace first, but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16264:14"/>
because men will not come over nor submit to him without warre. The strong man will not yeeld to bee utterly spoiled and crucified upon termes of peace.</p>
            <p>Hence then wee may first learne the great Authoritie and Power of this King, who holds his Crowne by immediate tenure from heaven, and was after a more excellent manner than any other Kings therunto decreed and anointed by God himselfe. Much then are they to blame who finde out wayes to diminish the Kingdome of Christ, and boldly affirme, that though a King hee could not but bee, yet hee might have been a King without a Kingdome, a King in personall right, without subjects or territories to exercise his regall power in; A King onely to punish enemies, but not a King to governe or to feed a people. But shall God give his Sonne the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession, and shall men withhold it? shall God give men unto Christ (<hi>Thine they were &amp; thou gavest them unto me.</hi> Ioh. 17.6.) and shall they detaine themselves from him? what is it that he gives unto his Sonne but the soules, the hearts, the very thoughts of men to bee made obedient unto his Scepter? 2 Cor. 10.5. and shall it then bee within the compasse of humane power to effect, as it is in their pride to maintaine, <hi>fieri posse ut nulla sit Ecclesia?</hi> We know one principall part of the Kingdome and power of Christ is to cast downe imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it selfe against the knowledge of God, and that not onely unto conviction, but unto obedience, as the Apostle shewes: to send such gifts of the Spirit unto men as should benefit the very Rebellious, that God might dwell amongst them, Psal. 68.18. for in as much as Christ came <hi>to destroy the workes of the devill, that is, sinne</hi> (as the Apostle shewes, 1 Ioh. 3.8. Ioh. 8.41.44.) and in their place to bring in the worke of God, which is <hi>faith in him</hi> (for so that grace is frequently sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, Ioh. 6.29. Phil. 1.29. Col. 2.12.) Therfore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16264:14"/>
that none of Satans instruments, and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, such as the hearts of naturall men are, should be to strong for the grace of Christ.</p>

Psal. 72.1. and is therefore frequently attributed unto the <hi>Messias,</hi> Esai. 42.1.4. Ier. 23.5. Ier. 33.15.) And from thence our Saviour inferres that <hi>all men should honour the Sonne, even as they honour the Father,</hi> Iob. 2.22, 23. with the same worship, reverence &amp; subjection. For God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name, <hi>That at the name of Iesus,</hi> that is, unto that holy thing, unto the power and Scepter of that divine Person, which is unto us so comfortably ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in a name of salvation, <hi>Every knee should bow, &amp;c.</hi> Phil. 2.9, 10.

And this likewise is a dutie which wee owe unto Christ to be obedient to him, to bee ruled by his mouth, and by the Scepter of his mouth, that is, by his word, which is therefore called the <hi>Law of Christ,</hi> because it hath a binding power in it. Wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from heaven to heare him, Matt. 17.5. And that too under paine of a curse, every soule which will not heare that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people, Act. 3.23. Wee should learne therefore to take his Commands as from God, for he speaketh his Fathers words, and in his name, Deut. 18.19. Ioh. 3.34. When <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> Commanded <hi>Haman</hi> to put on the Crowne upon <hi>Mordecai,</hi> hee presently executed the Kings pleasure, and honored his greatest enemie, because the King required it: Now God hath made Christ our King, and hath crowned him with honor and Majestie (as the Apostle speakes) and requires of us to kisse this his Sonne, and to bow unto his name; and therefore bee wee what wee will, Princes, or Judges, or great men of the world, (who rejoyce in nothing more than in the name of wisedome) this is our Wisedome, and dutie, Psal. 2.10, 12. It is too ordinary with great men to bee regardlesse of God and of his waies. Yet wee see the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16264:16"/>
wrath of God in his creatures, fire, tempest, pestilence, sword, sicknesse, makes no distinction between them and others, how much lesse will God himselfe make, when all crownes, and scepters, and dignities shall be resigned to him, and all men shall stand in an equall distance and condition before the tribunall of Christ, when no titles of honor, no eminencie of station, no treasures of wealth, no strength of dependencies, no retinue &amp; traine of servants will accompany a man into the presence of the Lamb, or stand betweene him and the judgment of that great day. Wee know hee was a King that feared the presence of a persecuted Prophet, and hee was a Prince that trembled at the preaching of an Apostle in chaines. The word of God cannot bee bound, nor limited, it is the Scepter which his Father hath given him, and wee cannot without ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contestation against God resist his govern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment therein over us. <hi>Hee that despiseth you despiseth me, and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me,</hi> saith our Saviour. It is Christ himselfe whose Ambassadors wee are, and with whom men have to doe in our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie. And hee will have it so: First, <hi>For our Peace:</hi> If God should speake againe by the Ministerie of Angels, in thunder, and fire (as he did on mount Sina) we would quickly call for <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; Ministers againe, Exod. 20.19. Secondly, <hi>For his owne glorie,</hi> that the Excellencie may be of God and not of men, 2 Cor. 4.7. That it may not be in him that planteth, nor in him that watereth, but in God which giveth the blessing, and increase, 1 Cor. 3.7. That it may not bee in him which willeth, nor in him which runneth, but in God which sheweth mercy, Rom. 9.16. That the service, cooperation, and helpe of the Churches joy might bee ours, but the Dominion over mens faith, and the teaching of their inner man might be Christs, 2 Cor. 1.24. Eph. 4.20, 21. Very bold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and desperate is the contumacie of those men who stand at defiance with the power of Christ speaking in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16264:16"/>
his servants. The Apostle saith, there is no escape left for those who neglect so great salvation, Heb. 2.3. And yet this is the constant folly and cry of naturall men, <hi>We will not have this man to raigne over us. Let us breake their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But First, Every man must be subject to some King, either Christ or sinne (for they two divide the world, and their Kingdomes will not consist.) And the subjects of sinne are all slaves and servants, no liberty amongst them, Ioh. 8.34. Whereas Christ makes all his subjects Kings, like himselfe, Revel. 1.6. and his is a Kingdome of Righteousnesse, peace, and joy, Rom. 14.17. Secondly, If men by being the subjects of sinne could keepe quite out from the judgment and Scepter of Christ, it were something:<note place="margin">

               </note> but all men must one way or other be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued unto him, either as sonnes or as captives, either under his grace, or under his wrath. <hi>As I live saith the Lord every knee shall bow to mee,</hi> Rom. 14.10, 11. Hee must bee either a savor of life or of death, either for the rising or the fall of many in Israel, either for a sanctuary or for a stumbling block; All must either bee saved by him, or judged by him. There is no refuge, nor shelter of escape in any Angle of the World, for his Kingdome reacheth to the uttermost corners of the earth, and will finde out, and fetch in all his enemies.

            <p>The Second particular in the description of Christs Kingdome is the greatnesse, and neernesse of his person unto <hi>David. My Lord. David</hi> calleth him <hi>my Lord</hi> upon a double reason, by a Spirit of <hi>Prophesie,</hi> as foreseeing his incarnation and nativitie out of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and stock of <hi>Iesse</hi>; and so hee was <hi>Davids</hi> Sonne: and by a Spirit <hi>of Faith</hi> as beleeving him to be his redeemer, and salvation: and so hee was <hi>Davids Lord.</hi> A virgin shall conceive and beare a Sonne, there we see his incarnation and descent from <hi>David</hi>; and shall call his name <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> God with us, there wee see his Dominion over <hi>David.</hi> As man so he was his Sonne, and as Mediator so he was his Lord. As Man so he was subject unto <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother; and as Mediator so hee was the Lord and Savior of his Mother, Luk. 2.51. Luk. 1.46, 47. As Man hee was made for a little while lower than the Angels, that hee might suffer death, but as Mediator, God and Man in one person, so he was made much better than the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16264:17"/>
Angels, all the Angels of God were his subjects to worship him, and his Ministers to waite upon him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.4.6.7. So then the pronoune <hi>Mine,</hi> leads us to the Consideration of Christs Consanguinity with <hi>David,</hi> as he was his Sonne: and of his Dignity above <hi>David,</hi> as hee was his <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence wee learne, That though Christ was Man, yet hee was more than a bare man. For <hi>jure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae</hi> no Sonne is Lord to his Father; Domination doth never ascend. There must be something above nature in him to make him his Fathers Soveraigne, as our Savior himselfe argueth from these words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.42, 45. Christ then is a <hi>Lord</hi> to his people; he had Dominion, and was the salvation of his owne fore-fathers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Lord.</hi>] First, By right of the <hi>Creation.</hi> For hee is before all things, and by him all things consist, Col. 1.17. which the Apostle makes the argument of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignitie. <hi>To us there is but one Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are all things and wee by him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By a right of <hi>Sonship</hi> and Primogeniture, as the chiefe, the first borne, the Heire of all things. Hee is not in the House as <hi>Moses</hi> was, a Servant, but a Sonne over his owne House, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.5, 6. That is, hee was not a Servant but Lord in the Church, as the Apostle else where gives us the same distinction. <hi>We preach Christ Iesus the Lord, and our selves Servants,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. For in the Scripture phrase the first borne notes Principality, Excellencie, and Dominion. I will make him, saith God, <hi>my first borne, higher than the Kings of the earth,</hi> Psal. 89.27. So in <hi>Iob,</hi> The first borne of death is the same with the King of terrors, <hi>Iob</hi> 18.13, 14. and so the Apostle saith, That the Heire is the Lord of all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. and therefore from his <note n="a" place="margin">

As the same Sun illightens the starres above, and the earth beneath, so the same Christ was the Righteousnesse and salvation both of his fore-fathers, and of his seed. They without us could not be made perfect, that is, (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) their faith had nothing actually extant amongst themselves to perfect it, but received all its forme and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment from that better thing which was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, and exhibited unto us. For the Law, that is, the carnall Commandement, and outward Ceremonies therein prescribed, made nothing, no grace, no person perfect; but the bringing in of a better hope, that is, of Christ, (who as hee is unto us the hope of glory, so hee was unto them the hope of deliverance, for he alone it is by whom wee draw nigh unto God,) doth perfect for ever those that are sanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14.</p>
            <p>If Christ then be our Lord wee must trust in him, and depend upon him for all our present subsistence, and our future expectations. For he never faileth those that wait upon him. He that beleeveth in him shall not bee asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And indeed faith is necessary to call Christ Lord. No man can call Iesus Lord but by the Spirit. Because
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16264:19"/>
other Lords are present with us, they doe with their own eye oversee, and by their owne visible power order and direct us in their service. But Christ is absent from our senses; <hi>Though I have knowne Christ after the flesh, yet henceforth</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>know I him no more.</hi> Therefore to feare, and honor, and serve him with all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, to yeeld more absolute and universall obedience to his commands, though absent, though tenderd unto us by the Ministerie of meane and despicable persons, than to the threates, and Scepters of the greatest Princes, to labour that not only present, but absent we may bee accepted of him, to doe his hardest workes of selfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, of overcomming, and rejecting the assaults of the World, of standing out against principalities, &amp; powers, and spirituall wickednes, of suffering and dying in his service, needs must there bee faith in the hart to see him present by his Spirit, to set to our seale to the truth, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and Majesty of all his commands, to heare the Lord speaking from heaven, and to finde by the secret and powerfull revelations of his Spirit out of the word to the soule, evident and invincible proofes of his living by the power of God, and speaking mightily in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of his Word to our consciences. Therefore when the Apostle had said, <hi>Wee are absent from the Lord,</hi> hee presently addes, <hi>We walk by faith,</hi> That is, we labor to yeeld all service and obedience to this our Lord, though absent, because by faith (which giveth presence to things unseen, and subsistence to things that are yet but hoped) wee know that hee is, and that hee is a rewarder of those that diligently seeke him.</p>
            <p>And indeed though every man call him <hi>Lord,</hi> yet no man doth in truth and sincerity of heart so esteeme him, but those who doe in this manner serve him, and by faith walke after him. If <hi>I be a Master, saith the Lord, where is my feare? Malach.</hi> 1.6. It is not every one that saith <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> but hee that doth my will, that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16264:19"/>
at my word, that laboureth in my service, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himselfe to be mine indeed. For the heart of man cannot have two Masters, because which way ever it goes, it goes whole and undivided. Wee cannot serve Christ and any thing else which stands in Competition with him: First, because they are <hi>Contrary Masters,</hi> one cannot bee pleased, or served, without the disallowance of the other. The Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy, that is, grudgeth, and cannot endure that any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice should be done to the Lord. For the Friendship of the World is enmitie against God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.4, 5. And therefore saith the Apostle, <hi>If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him</hi>; and the reason is,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2.15.</note> because they are contrarie principles, and have contrary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and lusts, and therefore must needs over-rule unto contrary services. Secondly, because both Masters have employments enough to take up a whole man. Satan and the World have lusts to fill the whole head and heart of their most active and industrious servants; for the Apostle saith, that all which is in the World is lusts. And the heart of man is wholy, or most greedily set in him to doe that evill which it is tasked withall, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 8.11. The <hi>(all)</hi> that is in man, all his faculties, all his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the whole Compasse of his created abilities, are all gone aside, or turned backward, there is no man, no part in man, that doth any good, no not one, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14.3.53.3.

more than enough to take up all the might, strength, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, abilities, times, callings of all his servants. Businesses towards God and himselfe, worship, feare, Communion, love, prayer, obedience, service, subjection: businesses to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and for our selves, watchfulnesse, repentance, faith, sincerity, sobriety, growth in grace: businesse towards other men as instruments and fellow members, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reproofe, direction, instruction, mourning, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, restoring, releeving, helping, Praying, Serving in all wayes of love.

               </note> for the oeconomie and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his office, so farre it was readvanced againe; Now he emptied and humbled himselfe, not by putting off any of his divine glory, but by suffering it to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaddowed with the similitude of sinfull flesh and to be humbled under the forme of a Servant, as the light of a candle is hidden in a darke and close Lanterne. So that Declaratorily, or by way of Manifestation, he is in that respect magnified at Gods right hand, or as the Apostle speakes, declared to be that Sonne of God by Power in rising from the dead, and returning to his glory againe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. Againe, how ever in <hi>Abstracto</hi> wee cannot say that the Deitie or Divine nature was exalted in any other sense than by evident manifestation of it selfe in that man who was before despised, and accused as a blasphemer, for that he made himselfe equall with God: yet in <hi>Concreto,</hi> and by reason of the Communication of properties from one nature to another in the unitie of one person, it is true that as God saved the World by his bloud, and as it was the Prince of life that was crucified, and the Lord that lay in the grave; so God likewise was in the forme of a servant humbled, and at the right hand of Majestie exalted againe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the humane nature of Christ is most highly exalted by sitting at Gods right hand;<note place="margin">

So that though during the time of his conversation amongst men, the exigence and oeconomie of the Office which he had for us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken made him a man of sorrowes, and intercepted the beames of the Godhead and Divine glorie from the other nature; yet having finished that dispensation, there
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16264:21"/>
was in the vertue of that most intimate association of the natures in one person, a communicating of all glory from the deitie which the other nature was capeable of. For as by the Spirit of Holinesse he was filled with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of wisdome and knowledge, and grace, and thereby fitted for the Office of a Mediator, and made the first fruits, the first borne, the heire of all things, the head, and Captaine of the Church; furnished with a residue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancie of the Spirit to sanctifie his brethren, and to make them joynt heirs, and first borne with himselfe; so by the Spirit of glory is he filled with unmatchable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, beyond the capacitie or comprehension of all the Angels of Heaven; being not onely full of glory, but having in him all the fulnesse of glory, which a created nature joyned to an infinitie and bottomlesse fountaine could receive.</p>
            <p>From hence therefore wee should learne to let the same minde bee in us which was in Christ, to humble our selves first that wee may bee exalted in due time, to finish our workes of selfe-deniall, and service which wee owe to God, that so wee may enter into our Masters glory. For he himselfe entred not but by a way of bloud. Wee learne likewise to have recourse and dependance on him for all supplies of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.19. Phil. 4.13. Eph 4.16.</note> for all strength of grace, for all influences of life, for the measure of every joynt and member, He is our treasure, our fountaine, our head; it is his free grace, his voluntarie influence which habituateth and fitteth all our faculties, which anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us unto a heavenly being, which giveth us both the strength and first act, wherby we are qualified to worke, and which concurreth with us in <hi>actu secund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to all those workes which wee set our selves about. As an instrument, even when it hath an edge, cutteth nothing, till it be assisted and moved by the hand of the artificer; so a Christian when hee hath a will, and an habituall fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to worke, yet is able to doe nothing without the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16264:22"/>
constant supply, assistance, and concomitancie of the grace of Christ, exciting, moving, and applying that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall power unto particular actions. He it is that giveth us not onely to will but to doe, that goeth through with us, and worketh all our works for us by his grace. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him wee can doe nothing, all our sufficiencie is from him. But it may bee objected, if wee can doe nothing without a second grace, to what end is a former grace given? or what use is there of our exciting that grace and gift of God in us which can doe nothing without a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concourse of Christs Spirit? To this I answer, first, that as light is necessarie and requisite unto seeing, and yet there is no seeing without an eye: so without the assisting grace of Christs Spirit concurring with us unto every holy Dutie, wee can doe nothing, and yet that grace doth ever presuppose an implanted, seminall and habituall grace, fore-disposing the soule unto the said Duties. Secondly, as in the Course of naturall Effects, though God bee a most voluntary Agent, yet in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Concurrence of a first Cause hee worketh <hi>ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum naturae,</hi> measuring forth his assistance proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Condition and Preparation of the second Causes: so in supernaturall and holy operations (albeit not with a like certaine and unaltered constancy) though Christ bee a most voluntary head of his Church, yet usually he proportioneth his assisting and second grace, unto the growth, progresse and radication of those Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall habits which are in the soule before. From whence commeth the difference of holinesse, and profitablenesse amongst the Saints, that some are more active, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied in all holy conversation than others, as in the naturall bodie some members are larger, and more full of life and motion than others, according to the different distribution of Spirits from the heart, and influences from the head. This then affords matter enough both to humble us, and to comfort us. To humble us that wee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16264:22"/>
can doe nothing of our selves, that wee have nothing in our selves, but sinne. All the fulnesse of grace is in him, and therefore whosoever hath any must have it from him; as in the Egyptian famine whosoever had any corn had it from <hi>Ioseph,</hi> to whom the granaries and treasures of Egypt were for that purpose committed. And this Lowlinesse of heart, and sense of our owne Emptinesse is that which makes us alwayes have recourse to our fountaine, and keepe in favor with our head, from whom wee must receive fresh supply of strength for doing any good, for bearing any evill, for resisting any temptation, for overcomming any enemie. For beginning, for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, and for perfecting any Dutie. For though it bee mans heart that doth these things, yet it is by a forraigne and impressed strength; as it is iron that burnes, but not by its owne nature (which is cold) but by the heate which it hath received from the fire. <hi>It was not I,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>but that grace of God which was with mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To comfort us likewise when wee consider that all fulnesse and strength is in him as in an Officer, an <hi>Adam,</hi> a treasurer and dispencer of all needfull supplies to his people, according to the place they beare in his bodie, and to the exigence and measure of their condition, in themselves, or service in his Church. Sure wee are that what measure soever hee gives unto any, hee hath still a residue of Spirit, nay hee still retaineth his owne fulnesse, hath still enough to carry us through any condition, and according to the difficulties of the service hee puts us upon, hath still wisedome to understand, compassion to pitie, strength to supply all our needs. And that all this hee hath as a mercifull and faithfull depositarie, as a Guardian, and husband, and elder brother, to imploy for the good of his Church; that he is unto this office ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the will of him that sent him, to lose nothing of all that which is given him, but to keepe, and perfect it unto the resurrection at the last day. That God hath
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16264:23"/>
planted in him a Spirit of faithfulnesse, and pittie for the cheerfull discharge of this great Office, given him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety unto us, made us as neere and deare unto him as the members of his sacred body are to one another; and therfore whosoever commeth to him, with emptines, and hunger, and faith, he will in no wise cast them out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is as possible for him to hew off, and to throw away the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his naturall body, to have any of his bones bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as to reject the humble and faithfull desires of those that duly waite upon him.</p>
            <p>Againe, from this <hi>Exaltation</hi> of Christ in his humane nature wee should learne to keepe our vessels in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and in honor, as those who expect to bee fashioned at the last like unto him. For how can that man truly hope to bee like Christ hereafter, that labors to bee as unlike him here as hee can? <hi>Shall I take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot?</hi> saith the Apostle. So may I say, shall I take the nature of Christ, that nature which he in his person hath so highly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and make it in my person the nature of a devill? If a Prince should marry a meane woman, would he endure to see those of her neerest kindred, her brethren and sisters live like scullians or strumpets under his owne eye? Now Christ hath taken our nature into a neerer union with himselfe than marriage; for man and wife are still two persons, but God and man is but one Christ. Death it selfe was not able to dissolve this union; for when the soule was separated from the body, yet the Deitie was separated from neither: it was the Lord that lay in the grave, and he that ascended, was the same that descended into the lower part of the earth, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10. and shall we then defile this nature by wantonnesse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and vile affections, which is taken into so indissoluble an unitie with the Sonne of God? Christ tooke it to advance it, and it is still by his Spirit in us so much the more advanced, by how much the neerer it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16264:23"/>
comes to that holinesse which it hath in him. We should therefore labour to walke as becommeth those that have so glorious a head, to walke worthy of such a Lord unto all well pleasing, in fruitfulnesse and knowledge; to walke as those that have received Christ, and expect his appearing againe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10.2.6.3.4, 5.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the sitting of Christ on the right hand of God notes unto us the <hi>Consummation</hi> of all those Offices which hee was to performe here on the earth for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. For till they were all finished hee was not to returne to his glorie againe. <hi>Hee that hath entred into his rest hath ceased from his owne workes,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.10. first he was to execute his Office before hee was to enter into his rest. Though he were a Sonne, and so <hi>Iure naturali</hi> the inheritance were his owne before, yet he was to learne <hi>Obedience</hi> by the things which hee was to suffer before hee was made perfect againe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>After hee had offered one Sacrifice for sinnes for ever,</hi> that is, after he had made such a compleat expiation as should never need bee repeated, but was able for ever to perfect those that are sanctified, hee then sate downe on the right hand of God, expecting till his enemies bee made his footstoole, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12, 13, 14. This is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument our Savior useth when hee prayeth to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againe with his Father; <hi>I have glorified thee on earth,</hi> or revealed the glorie of thy truth and mercy to thy Church, <hi>I have finished the worke which thou gavest mee to doe, and now O Father glorifie thou me with thine owne selfe, &amp;c. Ioh.</hi> 17.4, 5. <hi>Hee humbled himselfe,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>and became obedient to death, even the death of the crosse, wherefore God hath highly exalted him, &amp;c. Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. Noting unto us the Order of the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs Offices, some were workes of Ministrie and service in the Office of Obedience and suffering for his Church: Others were workes of power and Majestie in the protection and exaltation of his Church, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16264:24"/>
those necessarily to precede these. <hi>He ought to suffer, and to enter into his glory, Luk.</hi> 24.26, 46. Necessarily I say; First, by a <hi>Necessity of Gods Decree,</hi> who had so fore-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23, 24. Secondly, by the <hi>Necessity of Gods Iustice,</hi> which must first be satisfied by obedience, before it could bee appeased with man, or in the person of their head and advocate exalt them to his glory againe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6, 11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5, 6. Thirdly, by the <hi>Necessity of Gods Word and will,</hi> signified in the predictions of the Prophets, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.46. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. Fourthly, by the <hi>Necessity of Christs infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> which being equall with God, could not possibly be exalted without some preceding descent and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>That hee ascended,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>what is it but that hee descended first into the lower parts of the earth, Eph.</hi> 4.9. Therefore it is that our Savior saith, <hi>The Spirit should convince the World of Righteousnesse, because hee was to goe to the Father, and should bee seen here no more, Ioh.</hi> 16.10. The meaning of it is, that the Spirit shall in the Ministery of the Word reveale unto those who are fully convinced of their sinfull condition, and humbled in the sense thereof, a treasure of full and sufficient Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse by my obedience wrought for sinners. And the reason which is given of it stands thus. Our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse consists in our being able to stand in Gods presence. Now Christ having done all as our suretie here, went up unto glory as our head and advocate, as the first fruits, the Captaine, the Prince of life, the author of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the forerunner of his people, so that his going thither is an argument of our justification by him. First, because it is a signe that hee hath finished the worke of our redemption on earth, a signe that hee overcame death, and was justified by the Spirit, from the wrongs of men, and from the curse of the Law. Therefore hee said to <hi>Mary</hi> after his resurrection, <hi>Goe tell my Disciples, I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16264:24"/>
your God, Ioh.</hi> 20.17. that is, by my death, and victory over it, you are made my brethren, and reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God againe. Secondly, because hee hath Offices in heaven to fulfill at the right hand of his Father in our behalfe, to intercede, and to prepare a place for us, to apply unto us the vertue of his death and merits. If hee had ascended without fulfilling all Righteousnesse for the Church, hee should have been sent downe, and seen againe, but now, saith he, you see me no more, for by once dying, and by once appearing in the end of the world, I have put away sin by the Sacrifice of my selfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26.7.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9, 10. He was taken, saith the Prophet, from Prison and judgment, to note that the whole debt was payed, and now who shall <hi>declare his generation?</hi> That is, hee now liveth unto numberlesse ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, he prolongeth his dayes, and hath already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled Righteousnesse enough to justifie all those that know him or beleeve in him, <hi>Esai.</hi> 53.8, 10. Thus wee see that Christs deliverance out of prison, and exaltation at the right hand of God is an evident argument, that he is fully exonerated of the guilt of sinne, and curse of the Law, and hath accomplished all those workes which he had undertaken for our Righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>And this likewise affords abundant matter both to <hi>humble, and to comfort the Church of Christ.</hi> To humble us in the evidence of our disabilities, for if we could have finished the workes which were given us to doe, there would have been no neede of Christ. It was weaknesse which made way for Christ. <hi>Our weaknesse to fulfill obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and that <hi>weaknesse of the Law to justifie sinners, Rom.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18, 19. All the strength we have is by the power of his might, and by his grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. and even this God dispenceth unto us in measure, and by degrees, driving out our Corruptions as he <hi>did the Canaanites before his people, by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Exo.</hi> 23.30. because while we are here he wil have us
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16264:25"/>
live by faith, and fetch our strength, as we use it, from Christ, and waite in hope of a better condition, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the patience and forbearance of God who is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked every day. To comfort us likewise; First, <hi>against all our unavoidable and invincible infirmities</hi>; every good Christian desires to serve the Lord with all his strength, desires to be enriched, to be stedfast, unmoveable, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in the worke of the Lord, <hi>to doe his will as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heaven doe it:</hi> yet in many things they faile, and have daily experience of their owne defects. But here is all the comfort, though I am not able to doe any of my duties as I should, yet Christ hath finished all his to the full, and therefore though I am compassed with infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so that I cannot doe the things which I would, yet I have a <hi>compassionate advocate with the Father,</hi> who both giveth and craveth pardon for every one that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth his heart to seeke the Lord, <hi>though he be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cleansed,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18, 19. Secondly, <hi>Against the pertinacie, and close adherence of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which cleave as fast unto us as the very powers and faculties of our soule, as heat unto fire, or light unto the Sunne. Yet sure we are that he who forbad the fire to burne, and put blacknesse upon the face of the Sunne at midday, is able likewise to remove our corruptions as farre from us as he hath removed them from his owne sight. And the ground of our expectation hereof is this, Christ when he was upon the earth, in the forme of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant accomplished <hi>all the Offices</hi> of suffering and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for us: <hi>Therefore being now exalted farre above all heavens,</hi> at the right hand of Majestie and glory, he will much more fulfill those Offices of <hi>Power</hi> which he hath there to doe. Which are by the supplies of his Spirit to purge us from sinne, by the sufficiencie of his grace to strengthen us, by his word to sanctifie and cleanse us, and <hi>to present us to himselfe a glorious Church without spot or wrinckle. He that brought from the dead the Lord Iesus,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16264:25"/>
and suffered not death to hold the head, is able by that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and for that reason, to make us perfect in every good worke to doe his will, and not to suffer corruption for ever to hold the members.</hi> It is the frequent argument of the Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. Thirdly, against all those <hi>firie darts of Satan,</hi> wherby he tempteth us to despaire, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake our mercie. If he could have held Christ under when he was in the grave, <hi>then indeed our faith would have been vaine, we should be yet in our sinnes,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 17. But he who himselfe suffered, being tempted, and overcame both the sufferings and the temptation, <hi>is able to succor those that are tempted, and to shew them mercie and grace to helpe in time of need, Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15, 16. Lastly, <hi>against death it selfe.</hi> For the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of Christs Office of redemption in his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, was both the <hi>Merit,</hi> the <hi>Seale,</hi> and the <hi>first fruits of ours,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.20, 22.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The sitting of Christ on the right hand of his Father</hi> noteth unto us <hi>the actuall Administration of his Kingdome.</hi> Therefore that which is here said <hi>sit at my right hand untill I make thine enemies thy footstoole, the Apostle</hi> thus expoundeth, <hi>He must raigne till he hath put all enemies vnder his feete,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. <hi>And he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of dead and living,</hi> namely, by being exalted unto Gods right hand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. Now this Administration of Christs Kingdome implies severall particulars: First, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The publication of established Lawes.</hi> For that which is in this Psalme called the <hi>sending forth of the rod of Christs strength out of Sion,</hi> is thus by the Prophets expounded, <hi>Out of Sion shall goe forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Ierusalem, Esai.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.2. Secondly, <hi>The conquering and subduing of subjects to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> by converting the hearts of men, and bringing their thoughts into the obedience of his Kingdome.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16264:26"/>
               <hi>Ministerially,</hi> by the word of reconciliation, and <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,</hi> by the power of his Spirit, writing his Lawes in their hearts, and transforming them into the image of his word from glorie to glorie. Thirdly, <hi>Ruling,</hi> and leading those whom he hath thus converted in his way, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing unto their hearts his heavenly voice, never utterly depriving them of the exciting, assisting, cooperating grace of his holy Spirit, but by his divine power giving unto them all things which pertaine unto life and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, after he had once called them by his glorious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, <hi>Esai.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 8. <hi>Esai.</hi> 30.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. Fourthly, <hi>Protecting,</hi> upholding, succouring them against all temptations and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. By his compassion pittying them, by his power and promises helping them, by his care and wisedome proportioning their strength to their trials. By his peace recompencing their conflicts, by patience and experience establishing their hearts in the hope of deliverance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. Fifthy, <hi>Confounding all his enemies.</hi> First, <hi>Their projects,</hi> holding up his Kingdome in the midst of their malice, and making his truth, like a tree, settle the faster, and like a torch, shine the brighter for the shaking. Secondly, <hi>Their Persons.</hi> Whom he doth here gall and torment by the Scepter of his word, constraining them by the evidence thereof to subscribe to the Iustice of his wrath; and whom he reserveth for the day of his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, till they shall be put all under his feete.

            <p>Fourthly, <hi>the sitting of Christ on the right hand of God</hi> noteth unto us his <hi>giving of gifts, and sending downe of the Holy Ghost upon men.</hi> It hath been an universall custome both in the Church, and elsewhere, in dayes of great joy and solemnitie to give gifts and send presents unto men.

Thus Christ in the day of his Majestie and Inauguration, in that great and solemne triumph, <hi>when he ascended up on high and led captivity captive, he did withall give gifts unto men, Eph.</hi> 4.10.</p>
            <p>Christ was notably typified in the <hi>Ark of the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> In it were <hi>the Tables of the Law,</hi> to shew that the <hi>whole Law was in Christ fulfilled,</hi> and that he was <hi>the end of the Law for Righteousnesse to those that beleeve in him.</hi> There was the golden pot which had <hi>Manna,</hi> to signifie that heavenly, and abiding nourishment which from him the Church receiveth. There was the <hi>Rod of Aaron which budded.</hi> Signifying either the miraculous incarnation of Christ in a Virgin, or his sufferings which are expressed by stripes, <hi>Esai.</hi> 53.5. and our resurrection with him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the budding of a dry rod. Or lastly, noting the sanctifying and fruitfull vertue of his word which is the rod of his strength. Vpon it also was the <hi>Mercie seate,</hi> to note that in Christ is the foundation of all that mercie and atonement which is preached unto men. But in <hi>two things principally</hi> did it signifie Christ unto our present purpose: First, It was overlaid within and without with gold, and had a Crowne of gold round about it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.11.37.2. denoting the plentifull and glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ, who was crowned with glorie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7. Secondly, it had rings by which it was carried up and downe, till at last it rested in <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, with glorious and triumphall solemnitie,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16264:27"/>
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 132.89. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.13. So Christ while he was here upon earth, <hi>being anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power, went about doing good, Act.</hi> 10.38. <hi>and having ceased from his workes did at last enter into his rest, Heb.</hi> 5.10. <hi>which is the heavenly Temple, Revel.</hi> 11.19.</p>
            <p>Now this carrying of the <hi>Ark</hi> into his resting place denotes <hi>two things:</hi> First, <hi>a finall conquest</hi> over the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God. For as the moving of the Ark signified the acting and procuring of victorie, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 6.11, 20. So the Resting of the <hi>Ark</hi> noted the <hi>Consummation of Victorie.</hi> And therefore the Temple was built, and the <hi>Ark</hi> set therein in the dayes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> when there was not an emendicated or borrowed peace, depending upon the courtesie of the neighbor nations, but a victorious and triumphall peace, after the great victories of <hi>David,</hi> and tributarie subjection and homage of all the Canaanites which were left in the Land, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 8.7, 8.9.26. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.9.12. <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.29. Secondly, it notes <hi>the conferring of gifts,</hi> as we see in that triumphall song at the removall of the Arke, being also a prediction both of that which literally hapned in the raig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and was mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally verified in Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.18. Thus Christ our Prince of peace, being now in the Temple of God in heaven, hath bound hell, sinne and death captive, and hath demolished the wals of <hi>Iericho,</hi> or the Kingdom of <hi>Satan,</hi> throwne him downe from heaven like lightning, and passed a sentence of judgment upon him. And hath received of the Father <hi>the promise of the Holy Ghost, and given gifts unto men, Act.</hi> 2.32, 35. before his entring into his rest it was but <hi>a promise,</hi> and they were to waite at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for it, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4 but after his departure, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession at his Fathers right hand it was powred forth <hi>in abundance upon them, Ioh.</hi> 14.16.16.7.</p>
            <p>And we are to note that as it began with his sitting there, so it continueth as long as he shall there sit. It is true all Holy Scripture which God ordained for the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16264:27"/>
gathering of his people, and for the guidance of them in the militant Church, is already long since by the Spirit dictated unto holy and selected instruments, for that purpose inspired with more abundance of grace, and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a full, and infallible Spirit: but yet we must note, that in those holy writings there is such a depth of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wisedome, such a sea of mysteries, and such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable treasure of puritie and grace, that though a man should spend the longest life after the severest and most industrious manner to acquaint himselfe with God in the revelations of his word, yet his knowledge would be but in part, and his holinesse after all that come short of maturity; as the enemies are not all presently under Christs feete, but are by degrees subdued: so the Spirit is not presently conferred in fulnesse unto the members of Christ, but by measure and degrees according to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary influences of the head, &amp; exigences of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. So much of the Spirit of grace and truth as we have here is but the earnest and hansell of a greater summe, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.14. The seed and first fruits of a fuller harvest, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. Therefore the Apostle mentions <hi>a growing change from glorie to glorie by the Spirit of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Wee must not expect a fulnesse till the time of the restitution of all things, till that day of redemption and adoption wherein the light, which is here but <hi>sowen</hi> for the Righteous, <hi>shall grow up into a full harvest of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here ariseth a question out of the seeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of Holy Scripture. It is manifest that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ was in the Church long before his Ascension. The Prophets spake by him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. The ancient Iews vexed him, <hi>Esai.</hi> 63.10. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was even filled with the Spirit, to note a plentifull measure for the discharge of his Office, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.15. and yet <hi>S. Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>That the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Christ was not yet glorified, Ioh.</hi> 7.39. To this I answere, that the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16264:28"/>
Fathers were sanctified by the same Spirit of Christ with us, difference there is none in the substance, but onely in the accidents and circumstances of effusion and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation. As light in the Sunne, and light in a starre, is in it selfe the same originall light, but very much varied in the dispensation. It was the same truth which was preached by the Prophets, and by Christ, but the Apostle observes in it a difference, <hi>sundry times, and in sundry manners hath God spoken by the Prophets, but unto us by his Son,</hi> that is, more plentifully, and more plainly unto us than unto the Fathers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.25. Therefore though it be true that <hi>Abraham</hi> saw Christs day, as all the Fathers did (though he haply being the Father of the faithfull more than others) in which respect <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith of them that they were Christians really and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect though not in name:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Euseb. hist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> yet it is true likewise, that many Prophets and Righteous men did desire to see and heare the things which the Apostles saw and heard, but did not, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.17. namely, in such plaine and plentifull measure as the Apostles did. They saw in glimpses and morning stars, and prefigurations, but these the things themselves. They saw onely the promises and those too but afarre off, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. these the substance and gospell it selfe, neere at hand, in their mouth, and before their eyes, and even amongst them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.2, 3. They by Prophets who testified before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, these by eye-witnesses, who declared the things which they had seen and heard, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.8.22.10.41. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said that Christ was a Lambe slaine from the beginning of the world, and yet in the end of the world that he appeared to take away sinne by the Sacrifice of himselfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. to note that the Fathers had the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but not the perfection of the promises, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.40. for the Apostle every where makes perfection the worke of the Gospell, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.</p>
            <p>So then after Christs sitting on the right hand of power
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16264:28"/>
the Holy Spirit was more completely sent both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of manifestation and efficacie, than ever before. The difference is chiefly in three things: First, In the <hi>manner of his mission.</hi> To the old Church <hi>in dreames and visions, in figures and latent waies:</hi> But to the Evangelicall Churches <hi>in power, evidence and demonstration,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4, 5. Therefore it is called the <hi>spirit of revelation, and knowledge,</hi> which discovereth, and that unto principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers by the Church, the manifold and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious wisedome of God in Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17.3.10. Therefore the Spirit was sent in the latter dayes <hi>in wind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2.2, 3. Act. 4.31.</note> 
               <hi>and fire, and tongues,</hi> and earthquake, all which have in them a selfe-discovering propertie, which will not be hidden. Wheras in the time of the Prophets God did not in any such things, save onely in a low and still voyce reveale himselfe, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 19.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>In the subjects unto</hi> whom he was sent.<note place="margin">Ioel 2.28.</note> Before onely upon the inclosed garden of the Iewes did this winde blow, but now is the Spirit powred upon all flesh, and this heavenly dew falleth not upon the fleece, but upon the whole earth. And therefore our Savior opposeth <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Spirit,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.29.</note> 
               <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.21, 23. Every beleever is of the Israel of God, every Christian a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Holy Ghost; no people of the earth secluded, <hi>But in every nation he that feareth God and worketh Righteousnesse is accepted</hi>; no place uncleane,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.15, 16.</note> but every where pure hands may be lifted up.<note place="margin">Coloss. 2.11. Phil. 3.3. 1 Cor. 6.19. Act. 10.35. 1 Tim. 2.8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the <hi>measure of his grace.</hi> At first he was sent onely <hi>in drops and dew,</hi> but after he was <hi>powred out in showres and abundance, Tit.</hi> 3.6. and therefore (as I have before observed) the grace of the Gospell is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expressed by the name of <hi>Riches,</hi> to note not onely the pretiousnesse,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.7.2.7 3.</note> but the plentie thereof in the Church. And it is here worth our observation that the Spirit under the Gospell is compared to things of a spreading, multiplying, and operative nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:16264:29"/>First, <hi>To water,</hi> and that not a little measure to <hi>sprinckle or bedew,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Col. 1.27.</note> but to <hi>Baptize</hi> the faithfull in, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.5. and that not in a font or vessell, which growes lesse and lesse, but in a springing and living river, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.39. Now water besides its purging propertie, is first of a spreading nature: It hath no bounds nor limits to it selfe, as firme and solid bodies have, but receives its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint by the vessell or continent which holds it: so the Spirit of the Lord is not straightned in himselfe, but onely by the narrow hearts of men into which he comes. <hi>Ye are not straitned,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>in us,</hi> that is, in that ministerie of grace, and dispensation of the Spirit which is committed to us, <hi>but in your owne bowels,</hi> which are not in any proportion enlarged unto that abundance and fulnesse of heavenly grace, which in the Gospel of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is offered unto you. Secondly, Spring water is a growing and multiplying thing; which is the reason why rivers which rise from narrow fountaines, have yet by reason of a constant and regular supply a great breadth in remote channels, because the water lives. Wheras in pits and torrents it groweth lesse and lesse: so the graces of the Spirit are living and springing things, the longer they continue, the larger they grow, (like the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the sanctuary, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25.) and the reason is, because they come from a fountaine which is all life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. Thirdly, as water multiplies in it selfe, so by insinuation and mollification it hath a fructifying vertue in other things. Fruitfull trees are planted by the waters side; so the Spirit searching and mollifying the heart, maketh it fruitfull in holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19, 20. Fourthly, water is very strong in its owne streame: we see what mighty engines it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, what huge vessels it rouleth like a ball, what walls and bulwarkes it overthrowes: so the spirit of God is able to beate downe all strong holds, which the wit of man, or the malice of Satan, can erect against the Church.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16264:29"/>
               <hi>The horses of Egypt are flesh, &amp; not Spirit,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,</hi> noting that that which might and created power could not doe, the Spirit of the Lord was able to effect. And this strength of water serves to carry it as high as its owne spring and levell: so the Spirit will never cease to raise the hearts of his people, till it carries them up to their fountaine and spring-head in heaven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Spirit is compared to the <hi>rushing of a mighty winde.</hi> The learned observe that before Christs time God spake unto men in a soft still voyce, which they called <hi>Bath Koll</hi>; but after in the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell by a <hi>mighty wind:</hi> noting thereby both the Abundance of his Spirit which he would powre out in the latter dayes; and the strength thereof, as of a rushing winde. Though a man have walls of brasse, and bars of iron upon his conscience, though he set up fortifications of fleshly reason, and the very gates of hell to shut out the Spirit of grace, yet nothing is able to withstand the power of this mighty rushing winde. <hi>Who art thou, O great mountaine? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plaine, &amp;c. Zech.</hi> 4.7. No mountaines, no difficulties can prevent the power of Gods Spirit. He hath strength to pull downe the strongest oppositions, and to enable the weakest condition unto the service which he will have done. Though there be mountaines betweene Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and their deliverance, yet the blinde, and the lame, and the woman with childe, and her that travelleth with childe together, will he strengthen to climbe over the precipices of the highest mountaine, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.8.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Spirit is compared to <hi>Fire,</hi> noting likewise both the multiplying or diffusive property thereof, turning every thing into its owne nature: and the mighty strength thereof, wherby it either cleanseth or consumeth any thing that it meets with. If thou art stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it will devoure thee, if stone it will breake; if gold it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16264:30"/>
will purge thee. The hard heart it can melt, and the foule heart it can purifie. Lay downe thine heart under the word, and yeeld it to the Spirit, who is as it were the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer which doth manage the word, he can frame it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a vessel of honour: but if thou resist and be stubborne against the Spirit in the word, know that it is but the crackling of a leafe in the fire, if thou wilt not suffer it to purge thee, thou canst not hinder it to torment thee; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more comfortable, nothing more consuming than fire; nothing more comfortable than the light, warmth, and witnesse of the Spirit, nothing more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the conviction, condemnation, and bondage of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now this difference in the measure of the Spirit, may be seen in <hi>two things.</hi> First, in a greater measure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; <hi>They shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest of them,</hi> saith the <hi>Lord, Ier.</hi> 31.34. <hi>And the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the sea, Esai.</hi> 11.9. Our Saviour told his Disciples that <hi>all things, which he had heard of his Father he had made knowne unto them, Ioh.</hi> 15.15. and yet a little after he telleth them that <hi>many other things he had to say unto them, which they could not beare, till the Spirit of truth came who should guide them into all truth, Ioh.</hi> 16.12, 13. noting that the Spirit when hee came should enlarge their hearts to a capacity of more heavenly wisedome than they could comprehend before. For we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve before how ignorant they were of many things, though they conversed with Christ in the flesh. <hi>Philip</hi> ignorant of the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Thomas</hi> of the way unto the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Peter</hi> of the necessity of his sufferings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.22. The <hi>two Disciples</hi> of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.45. all of them of the quality of his Kingdome, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.6. Thus before the sending of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, the Lord did not require so plentifull know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge unto salvation, as after; as in the valuations of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16264:30"/>
money, that which was plentie two or three hundred years since, is but penurie now. Secondly, in a greater measure of strength for Spirituall obedience. They who before fled from the company of Christ in his sufferings, did after rejoyce to be counted worthy of suffring shame for his name, or as the elegancie of the originall words import, to be <hi>dignified with that dishonor of Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Act.</hi> 5.41. For suffering of persecution for Christ, and the triall of faith by diverse temptations is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures reckoned up amongst the gifts, and hundred fold compensations of God to his people, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.30. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>No man,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>putteth new wine into old bottles,</hi> that is, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth rigid and heavie services of weake and unqualified Disciples, and therefore my Disciples fast not while I am amongst them in the flesh: <hi>But the dayes will come when I shall be taken from them in body,</hi> and shall send them my holy Spirit to strengthen and prepare them for hard service, and then they shall fast, and performe those parts of more difficult obedience unto me, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.15, 17.</p>
            <p>Now farther touching this <hi>sending of the Holy Spirit</hi> (which together with Christs intercession was one of the principall ends of his ascending up unto the right hand of power) it may be here demanded, why the Holy Spirit was not before this exaltation of Christ sent forth in such abundance upon the Church? The maine reason wherof, next unto the purpose and decree of God into which all the acts of his wil are to be resolv'd, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. is given by our Savior, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.7. Because he was to supply the corporall absence of Christ, and to be another comforter to the Church. Of which Office of the Spirit, (because it was one of the maine ends of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and that one of the chiefe workes of Christs sitting at Gods right hand) I shall here, without any unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or impertinent digression, speake a little.</p>
            <p>First, then the Spirit is a <hi>comforter,</hi> because an <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16264:31"/>
to his people</hi>; for so much the word signifies, and is else where rendered, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1. Now he is called <hi>another comforter or Advocate,</hi> to note the difference betweene Christ and the Spirit in this particular. There is then an <hi>Advocate by Office,</hi> when one person takes upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the cause of another, and in his name pleads it. Thus Christ by the Office of his Mediation, and intercession is an Advocate for his Church, and doth in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in heaven apply his merits, and further the cause of our salvation with his Father. There is likewise an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate by <hi>energie</hi> and <hi>operation,</hi> by instruction and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which is, not when a worke is done by one person in the behalfe of another, but when one by his counsell, inspiration, and assistance enableth another to manage his owne businesse, and to plead his owne cause. And such an Advocate the Spirit is,<note place="margin">

            <p>First then, the Spirit as our <hi>Advocate</hi> justifieth our persons, and pleadeth our causes against the accusations of our spirituall enemies. For as Christ is our Advocate at the tribunall of Gods justice to plead our cause against the severitie of his Law, and that most Righteous and undeniable charge of sinne which he layeth upon us: so the Holy Spirit is our Advocate at the tribunall of Gods mercie, enabling us there to cleere our selves against the temptations, and murtherous assaults of our Spirituall enemies. The world accuseth us by false and slanderous calumniations, laying to our charge things which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did; the Spirit in this case maketh us not onely plead our innocencie, but to rejoyce in our fellowship with the Prophets which were before us, to esteeme the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches

of Christ greater riches than the treasures of the world, to count our selves happy in this, that it is not such low markes as we are which the malice of the world aimeth at, but the Spirit of glory and of God which resteth upon us, who is on their part evill spoken of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Satan,</hi> that <hi>grand accuser of the brethren,</hi> doth not onely load my sinnes upon my conscience, but further endeavoreth to exclude me from the benefit of Christ by charging me with impenitencie and unbeliefe. But here the Spirit enableth me to cleere my selfe against the Father of lies. It is true indeed I have a naughty flesh, the seeds of all mischiefe in my nature; but the first means which brought me hereunto was the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thy lies, and therefore I will no longer entertaine thy hellish reasonings against mine owne peace. I have a Spirit which teacheth me to bewaile the frowardnesse of mine owne heart, to denie mine owne will &amp; workes, to long and aspire after perfection in Christ, to adhere with delight and purpose of heart unto his Law, to lay hold with all my strength upon that pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck of salvation, which in this shipwrack of my soule is cast out unto me. These affections of my heart come not from the earthly <hi>Adam,</hi> for whatsoever is earthly, is sensuall and devillish too. And if they be holy and heavenly, I will not beleeve that God will put any thing of heaven into a vessell of Hell. Sure I am, he that died for me when I did not desire him, will in no wise cast me away when I come unto him. He that hath given me a will to love his service, and to leane upon his promises, will in mercy accept the will for the deed, and in due time accomplish the worke of holinesse which he hath begun. Thus the Spirit like an Advocate secureth his clients title, against the sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall exceptions of the adversarie, and when by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions our eye is dimmed, or by the mixture of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions our evidences defaced, he by his skill helpeth our infirmities, and bringeth those things which are blotted
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16264:32"/>
out, and forgotten, into our remembrance againe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an Advocate admonisheth and directeth his client how to order and solicite his owne businesse, what evidences to produce, what witnesses to prepare, what offices to attend, what preparations to make against the time of his hearing: so the Spirit doth set the hearts of beleevers in a right way of negotiating their Spirituall affaires, maketh them to heare a voyce behinde them, furnishing them with wisedome and prudence in every condition. How to grapple with temptations, how to serve God in all estates, when to reprove, direct, counsell, comfort, when to speake and when to be silent, when to let out and when to chaine up a passion, when to use, and when to forbeare libertie, how to prosecute occasions, and apply occurrences unto Spirituall ends, every where, and in all things strengthning and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting us to mannage our hearts unto the best advantages of peace to our selves, and of glory to our Master, <hi>Esai.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.20, 21.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, an Advocate maketh up the failings of his client, and by his wisedome, and observation of the case, picketh out advantages beyond the instructions, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth arguments to further the suite which his client himselfe observed not. So the Spirit, when we know not what to pray, when with <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> we know not what to doe, when it may be in our owne apprehension the whose businesse of our peace and comfort lieth a bleeding, doth then helpe our infirmities, and by dumbe cries, and secret intimations, and deepe, and unexpressible gronings, presenteth arguments unto him who is the searcher of hearts, and who knoweth the minde of the Spirit, which we our selves cannot expresse. Thus as an infant crieth and complaineth for want of sleepe, and yet knoweth not that it is sleepe which he wanteth: as a sick man goeth to the physitian, and complaineth that some physick he wanteth, but knoweth not the thing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16264:32"/>
which he asketh for: so the soule of a Christian by the assistance of the Spirit is enlarged to request things of God which yet of themselves doe passe the knowledge and understandings of those that aske them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Spirit is a <hi>comforter by applying and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting Christ absent unto the soule againe.</hi> For first, the Spirit carrieth a Christian heart up to Christ, in heavenly affections, and conversation, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. as a piece of earth when it is out of its place, doth ever move to the whole earth: so a sparkle of Christs Spirit will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally move upward unto him who hath the fulnesse in him. A stone, though broken all to pieces in the motion, will yet through all that perill and violence move unto the center: so though the nature of man abhorre, and would of it selfe dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine the passages of death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. yet the Apostle desired <hi>to be dissolved, and to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken asunder, that by any meanes he might be with Christ,</hi> who is the center of every Christians desire, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. Secondly, the Spirit bringeth Christ downe to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, formeth him in his heart, evidenceth him, and the vertue of his passion, and resurrection, unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in the powerfull dispensation of his holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Therefore when our Savior speakes of sending the holy Spirit, he addeth, I will not leave you comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, I will come to you when the world seeth me not, yet ye see me. This noteth the presence of Christ by his Spirit with the Church: but there is more than a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, there is an <hi>inhabitation, At that time you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you, Ioh.</hi> 14.18, 20.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Spirit is a <hi>comforter</hi> by a worke of <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>fruitfull illumination,</hi> not onely giving the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but the love and comfort of the truth unto a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, making him with open face behold as in a glasse the glory of God, and therby transforming him into the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16264:33"/>
same image from glory to glory. The light of other sciences is like the light of a candle, nothing but light: but the knowledge of Christ by the Spirit is like the light of the Sun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, which hath influences and vertue in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And this is that which the <hi>Apostle</hi> cals the <hi>Spirit of Revelation in the knowledge of God,</hi> for though there be no Propheticall, nor extraordinary revelations, by dreames, visions, extasies, or enthusiasmes; yet according to the measure of spirituall perspicacie, and diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of holy Scriptures, there are still manifold reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or manifestations of Christ unto the soule. The secret and intimate acquaintance of the soule with God, the heavings, aspirings, and harmony of the heart with Christ, the sweete illapses and flashes of heavenly light upon the soule, the knowledge of the depths of God and of Satan, of the whole armor of God and the strong man, of conflicts of Spirit, protection of Angels, experiences of mercie, issues of temptation, and the like, are heavenly and constant revelations out of the word manifested to the soules of the faithfull by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Lastly and principally, the Spirit is <hi>a comforter in those effects of joy and peace</hi> which he worketh in the heart. For joy is ever the fruite, and Companion of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.52. and the joy of the Spirit is like the intercession of the Spirit, unspeakable and glorious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. not like the joy of the world, which is empty, false, and deceitfull, full of vanity, vexation, insufficiency, unsu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eablenesse to the soule, mingled with feares of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment and miscarriage, with tremblings and guilt of conscience, with certainty of period and expiration: but cleere, holy, constant, unmixed, satisfactory, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the compasse of the soule, more gladnesse than all the world can take in the increase of their corne and wine, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.7.</p>
            <p>And this joy of the Spirit is grounded <hi>upon every pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of a Christian condition,</hi> from the entrance to the end.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16264:33"/>
First, the Spirit worketh <hi>joy</hi> in discovering, and bending the heart to mourne for corruption. For it is the Spirit of grace and supplications which maketh sinners mourne, and loath themselves,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10, 11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27.31. and such a sorrow as this is the seed, and the matter of true joy; our <hi>Iosephs</hi> heart was full of joy, when his eyes powred out tears upon <hi>Benjamins</hi> neck. As in wicked laughter the heart may be sorrowfull, so in holy mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heart may rejoyce, for all Spirituall afflictions have a peaceable fruite. This was the first glimpse and beame of the Prodigals joy that he resolv'd with teares and repentance to returne to his Father againe. For there is a sweete complacencie in an humble and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall heart to be vile in its owne eyes, as to the hungry soule every bitter thing is sweete. Sacrifices we know were to be offered up with joy, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.13. <hi>and of all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices a broken heart is that which God most delighteth in, Psal.</hi> 51.16, 17. <hi>there is joy in heaven at the repentance of a sinner,</hi> and therefore there must needs be joy in the heart it selfe which repenteth, in as much as it hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly affections begunne in it. Therefore as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>Let a man become a foole that he may be wise,</hi> so may I truly say, let a man become a mourner, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>
            <p>If it be objected how one contrary affection can be the ground and inducement of another, and that he who feeleth the weight of sinne, and displeasure of God can have little reason to boast of much joy. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, First, that we doe not speake of those extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary combates, and grapplings with the sense of the wrath of God, breaking of bones, and burning of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, which some have felt, but of the ordinary humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and courses of repentance, which are common to all. Secondly, that such Spirituall mourning and joy are not contrary in regard of the Spirit, nor doe one extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish or expell the other. As black and white are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16264:34"/>
in the wall, but meete without any repugnancie in the eye, because though as qualities they fight, yet as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects they agree <hi>in communi conceptu visibilis:</hi> so joy and mourning though contrary in regard of their immediate impressions upon the sense, doe not onely agree in the same principle the grace of Christ, and in the same end the salvation of man, but may also be subordinated to each other; as a darke and muddie color is a fit ground to lay gold upon; so a tender and mourning heart is the best preparation unto spirituall joy. Therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior compareth <hi>Spirituall sorrow unto the paines of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in travell</hi>; other paines growing out of sicknesse and distempers, have none but bitter ingredients, and anguish in them; but that paine groweth out of the matter of joy, and leadeth unto joy: so though godly sorrow have some paine in it, yet that paine hath ever joy both for the roote, and fruit of it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.21. and though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it may haply intercept the exercise, yet it doth strengthen the habit and ground of joy: as those flowers in the spring rise highest and with greatest beautie, which in winter shrinke lowest into the earth. <hi>I trembled,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>in my selfe, that I might rest in the day of trouble, Hab.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Spirit doth not onely <hi>Discover,</hi> but <hi>heale the corruptions of the soule,</hi> and there is no joy to the joy of a saved and cured man. The lame man when he was restored by <hi>Peter,</hi> expressed the abundant exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his heart, <hi>by leaping, and praising God, Act.</hi> 3.8. for this cause therefore amongst others the Spirit is called <hi>the oile of gladnesse,</hi> because by that healing vertue which is in him, he maketh glad the hearts of men. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>is upon me, because the Lord anointed me to preach good tydings to the meeke, he hath sent me to binde the broken hearted, Esai.</hi> 61.6. and againe, <hi>I will binde that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick, Ezek.</hi> 34.16. Now this healing vertue of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16264:34"/>
Christ is in the dispensation of his word and Spirit; and therefore the Prophet saith, <hi>the Sunne of Righteousnesse shall arise with healing in his wings, Mal.</hi> 4.2. where the Spirit in the word, by the which he commeth, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth unto men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. is called the <hi>wing of the Sunne,</hi> because he proceedeth from him, and was sent to supply his absence, as the beame doth the Suns; and this Spirit the Apostle calleth <hi>the strengthner of the inner man, Eph.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Spirit doth not onely <hi>heale,</hi> but <hi>renew,</hi> and <hi>revive againe:</hi> when an eye is smitten with a sword there is a double mischiefe, a wound made, and a faculty perished: and here though a Chirurgian can heale the wound, yet he can never restore the faculty, because totall privations admit no regresse or recovery: but the Spirit doth not onely <hi>heale,</hi> and repaire, but <hi>renew,</hi> and reedifie the spirits of men. As he healeth that which was torne, and bindeth up that which was smitten, so he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viveth and raiseth up that which was dead before, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.1, 2. and this the <hi>Apostle</hi> cals <hi>the Renovation of the Spirit, Tit.</hi> 3.5. whereby old things are not mended and put together againe, (<hi>for our fall made us all over unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and little worth, Rom.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20.) but are done quite away, and all things made new againe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. The heart, minde, affections, judgment, conscience, members, changed from stone to flesh, from earthly to heavenly, from the image of <hi>Adam</hi> to the image of <hi>Christ, Ezek.</hi> 11.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. Now this renovation must needs be matter of great joy. For so the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth his afflicted people, <hi>Esai.</hi> 54.11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Spirit doth not renew and set the frame of the heart right, and then leave it to its owne care and hazards againe; but being thus restored, <hi>he abideth with it</hi> to <hi>preserve,</hi> and <hi>support it</hi> against all Tempests and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. And this further multiplieth the joy and comfort of the Church that it is <hi>established in Righteousnesse,</hi> so
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16264:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that no weapon which is formed against it can prosper, <hi>Esai.</hi> 54.14.17.<note place="margin">

               </note> Victory is ever the ground of joy. <hi>Esai.</hi> 9.3. And the Spirit of God is a victorious Spirit.

            <p>Fifthly, the Spirit doth not onely <hi>preserve</hi> the heart which he hath renewed, but maketh it <hi>fruitfull and abundant</hi> in the workes of the Lord, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. And <note n="a" place="margin">

For though the motions of lust which are in our members, are so close, so working, so full of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and life, that we can see no power nor probabilities of prevailing against them; yet we know Christ hath a greater fulnesse of Spirit than we can have of sinne, and it is the great promise of the new covenant, <hi>that God will put his Spirit into us, and thereby save us from all our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanesses, Ezek.</hi> 36.27, 29. for though we be full of sin, and have but a seed, a sparkle of the Spirit put into us, and upheld and fed by further, though small supplies, yet that little is stronger than legions of lust; as a little salt or leven seasoneth a great lump, or a few drops of Spirits strengthen a whole glasse full of water. Therefore the <hi>Spirit</hi> is called a <hi>Spirit of judgment and of burning,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as one Iudge is able to condemne a thousand pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, and a little fire to consume abundance of drosse: so the Spirit of God in and present with us, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16264:36"/>
and supplied but in measure, though but a smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and suppressed fire, shall yet breake forth in victory and judgment against all that resist it. In us indeed there is nothing that feeds, but onely that which resists and quencheth it. But this is the wonderfull vertue of the Spirit of Christ in his members, that it nourisheth it selfe. Therefore sometimes the <hi>Spirit</hi> is called <hi>fire, Esai.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. and sometimes <hi>Oyle, Heb.</hi> 1.9. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27. to note that the Spirit is nutriment unto it selfe, that that grace which we have received already, is preserved and excited by new supplies of the same grace. Which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies we are sure shall be given to all that aske them, <hi>by the vertue of Christs prayer, Ioh.</hi> 14.16. by the <hi>vertue</hi> of <hi>his</hi> and <hi>his Fathers promise, Ioh.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4. and by the <hi>vertue of that Office</hi> which he still beares, which is to be the head, or vitall principle of all holinesse and grace unto the Church. And all these are permanent things, and therefore the vertue of them abideth, their effects are never totally interrupted.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and lastly, <hi>this sitting of Christ at the right hand of God</hi> noteth his <hi>intercession in the behalfe of the whole Church,</hi> and each member thereof. <hi>Who is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth?</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle, it is Christ that is dead, yea rather that is risen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us, Rom.</hi> 8.34. But of this Doctrine I shall speake more fitly in the fourth verse, it being a great part of the <hi>Priesthood of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now proceed to the last thing in this first verse, the continuance and <hi>Victories of Christs Kingdome,</hi> in these words, <hi>untill I make thy foes thy footstoole:</hi> Wherin every word is full of weight. For though ordinarily subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of holy Scripture, and crumbling of the bread of life, be rather a loosing than an expounding of it; yet in such parts of it as were of purpose intended for models and summaries of fundamentall Doctrine, (of which sort this Psalme is one of the fullest and briefest in the whole
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16264:37"/>
Scriptures,) as in little maps of large countries, there is no word wherupon some point of weighty consequence may not depend. Here then is considerable the <hi>terme of duration</hi> or <hi>measure of Christs Kingdome; Vntill.</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> of subduing Christs enemies under him; <hi>I, the Lord.</hi> The <hi>manner</hi> thereof, <hi>ponam,</hi> and <hi>ponam scabellum</hi>; Put thy foes as a stoole under thy feete. Victory is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive word, and presupposeth enemies, and they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the text. I will but touch that particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have handled it more largely upon another Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and their enmitie is here not described, but onely presupposed. It shews it selfe against Christ in all the Offices of his Mediation. There is <hi>enmity</hi> against him as a <hi>Prophet. Enmity</hi> against his <hi>Truth. In opinion,</hi> by adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terating it with humane mixtures and superinduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, teaching for Doctrines the traditions of men: <hi>In affection,</hi> by wishing many divine truths were razed out of the Scriptures, as being manifestly contrary to those pleasures which they love rather than God. <hi>In conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> by keeping downe the truth in unrighteousnesse, and in those things which they know, as brute beasts, corrupting themselves. <hi>Enmity</hi> against his <hi>Teaching,</hi> by quenching the motions, and resisting the evidence of his Spirit in the word, refusing to heare his voyce, and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the counsell of God against themselves. There is <hi>Enmitie</hi> against him as <hi>a Priest,</hi> by undervaluing his Person, Sufferings, Righteousnesse, or Merits. And as a <hi>King; Enmity</hi> to his <hi>Worship,</hi> by profanesse neglecting it, by idolatry communicating it, by superstition corrupting it. <hi>Enmity</hi> to his wayes and service, by ungrounded prejudices, mis-judging them as grievous, unprofitable, or unequall wayes; and by wilfull disobedience forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to walke in the wayes of our owne heart.</p>
            <p>And this is a point which men should labour to trie themselves in, for the enemies of Christ are not onely out of the Church, but in the midst where his kingdome
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16264:37"/>
is set up. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Esay</hi> 8.14. And indeed by how much the more dangerous it is, by so much the more subtil wil Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and a sinfull heart be to deceive it selfe therein; for this is a certaine truth, that men may professe and falsly beleeve <hi>that they love the Lord Iesus,</hi> and yet be as reall enemies unto his Person and Kingdome, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> that accused, and the Heathen that crucified him: <hi>Hee was set up for a signe to be spoken against, for a rocke of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and a stone of stumbling, which the very builders themselves would reject.</hi> False brethren amongst the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians there were, who professed the name of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and yet by their sensuall walking and worldly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dednesse, declared themselves to bee enemies to the crosse of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. To honour the bodies of the Saints departed with beautifull sepulchres, is in it selfe a testimoniall of sincere love and inward estimation of their persons and graces; and therefore the Holy Ghost hath recorded it for the perpetuall honour of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, that they embalmed the body of Iesus, and laid it in a new sepulcher, Ioh.</hi> 19.38-41. yet our Saviour pronounceth <hi>a woe against the Scribes and Pharisees, because they built the tombe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Prophets, and garnished the sepulchres of the righteous, Matth.</hi> 23.29. The fault was not in the fact it selfe, but in the hypocrisie of the heart, in the incongruitie of their other practices, and in that damned protection, which by this plausible pretext of honour to the Prophets, they laboured to gaine to their persons, and approbation to their attempts against Christ, in the mindes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who yet ordinarily esteemed Christ (whom they persecuted) a Prophet sent from God. They professe, If we had beene in the dayes of our Fathers, <hi>wee would not have done as they did:</hi> But our Saviour reproves this hypocriticall perswasion, by shewing first, that it was no strange thing with them to persecute Prophets, but a nationall and hereditary sinne, and therefore they had
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16264:38"/>
no reason to boast of their descent (as their manner was, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.8. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.39.) or to thinke that Gods mercies were entail'd unto them, since, by their owne confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were the posteritie of those that had killed the Prophets; and secondly, that they did fulfill the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their Fathers, that is, that which their Fathers had beene long and leasurely a doing, they now did altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one blow; for it was the same Christ whom they persecuted in his person, and their fathers in his Prophets; and therefore though they seemed to honour and revive the memory of those holy martyrs, yet upon them should light the guilt of all the righteous bloud which had ever beene shed in the Land, inasmuch as their malice was directed against that fulnesse, of which all the Prophets had but a measure: If by severall enemies a man be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally mangled, one cuts off a foot, another an hand, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other an arme, and after all this, there come one who cuts off the head, and yet bestows some honourable ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies upon those members which the rest had abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he shall justly suffer as if he had slaine a whole man, inasmuch as his malice did eminently containe in it the degrees of all the rest, and that pretended honour shall be so far from compensating the injury, that it shall adde thereunto an aggravation of base hypocrisie. Thus, as the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when they thought they did honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Prophets, did yet harbour in their brests that very root of fury, and had that selfe-same constitution of soule, which was in their fore-fathers who shed their bloud: so in our dayes, men may say and thinke that they love Christ, and court him with much out-side and emptie service, may boast that if they had lived in the dayes of those unthankfull <hi>Iewes,</hi> they would not have partaked with them in so execrable a murther, and yet interpretatively and at second hand shew the very same root of bitternesse, and rancorous constitution of heart against him in his Spirit and ordinances, which was in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16264:38"/>
those men when they cried, <hi>Away with him, crucifie him, crucifie him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many grounds there are of this grand misperswasion of the heart in its love to Christ, which I will but touch upon. The first is the <hi>generall acceptation</hi> and <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance which the Gospell of Christ</hi> receiveth amongst the Princes of this world, who in Christian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths doe both by their owne voluntary and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed subjection, and by the vigour of their publike lawes establish the same. Now this is most certain, that as in all other sciences there cannot be <hi>transitus à genere in genus,</hi> the principles of one will not serve to beget the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of another: so here especially, if a spirituall assent and affection be grounded upon no other than humane inducements, it is most undoubtedly spurious and illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. That reason which the Pharisees used to disswade men from beleeving in Christ, <hi>Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees beleeved on him? Ioh.</hi> 7.48. is one of the principall arguments which many men have now why they doe beleeve him, because the Rulers, whose exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and lawes they observe more upon trust than triall, doe lead them thereunto: and therefore wee finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that those very men, who when the Government of the whole twelve Tribes was one, did all consent in an unity of religion; upon the distraction of the kingdome under <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> were presently likewise divided in their observance of Gods worship; and they who before were zealous for the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were after as superstitious for <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel:</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet giveth the reason of it, <hi>They willingly walked after the commandement,</hi> namely, of <hi>Ieroboam, Hos.</hi> 5.11. no sooner did the Prince interpose his authoritie, but the people were willing to pin their opinions and practices upon his word: <hi>If Omri make statutes, and Ahab con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme idolatrous counsels by his owne practices</hi>; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet shewes how forward the people are to walke in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16264:39"/>
them, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.16. Therefore it is that our Saviour saith of the best sort of wicked men, <hi>Those who with gladnesse</hi> (and that is ever a symptome of love) <hi>received the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, that yet in time of persecution they were offended and fell away, Matth.</hi> 13.21. To note unto us that when Christ is forsaken because of persecution, the imaginary love which was bestowed upon him before was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supported by no other ground than that was, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to persecution, namely, the countenance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of publike power.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a great part of men professe faith and love to Christ meerely <hi>upon the rules of their Education.</hi> The maine reason into which their religion is resolv'd, is not any evidence of excellencie in it selfe, but onely the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and traditions of their fore-fathers, which is to build a divine faith upon an humane authoritie, and to set man in the place of God: certaine it is that contrary religions can never be originally grounded upon the same reason; that which is a true and adequate principle of faith or love to Christ, can never be sutable to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions of <hi>Mahumetisme</hi> or <hi>idolatry:</hi> now then when a <hi>professed Christian</hi> can give no other account of <hi>his love to Christ,</hi> than a <hi>Turke</hi> of his <hi>love to Mahumet</hi>; when that which moveth an Idolater to hate Christ, is all that one of us hath to say why he beleeveth in him, certainly that love and faith is but an empty presumption, which dishonoureth the Spirit of Christ, and deludeth our own soules. There is a naturall instinct in the minde of man to reverence and vindicate the traditions of their progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and at first view to detest any novell opinions which seeme to thwart the received doctrine wherein they had beene bred: and this affection is ever so much the stronger, by how much the tradition received is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the nobler and more necessary things. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it discovereth it selfe with most violence and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency, in matters of Religion, wherin the eternall welfare
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16264:39"/>
of the soule is made the issue of the contention. We finde with what hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Againe, as Christ is present with us in his poore members, so likewise in the power of his ordinances, and in the light and evidence of his Spirit shining forth in the lives of holy men; If then we are as impatient of the edge of his word, when it divides betweene the bone and the marrow, when it discerneth and discovereth our secret thoughts, our bosome sinnes, our ambitions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, and hypocriticall intents: if the lives and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Saints be in like manner an eye-sore unto us in shaming and reproving our formall and fruitlesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the same truth, as Christs was unto the Iewes;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16264:40"/>
certainly the same affections of hatred, reproach, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimation which we shew unto them, we would with so much the more bitternesse have expressed unto Christ himselfe, if we had lived in his dayes, by how much that Spirit of grace, against which the Spirit which is in us envieth, was above measure more abundantly in him than in the holiest of his members. <hi>If you were of the world</hi> (saith our Savior) <hi>the world would love their owne, but now I have called you out of the world,</hi> I have given to you a Spirit which is contrary to the Spirit of the World, <hi>therefore the world hateth you.</hi> And this is evident when men hate another meerly for that distinction which differenceth him from them, they much more hate him from whom the difference it selfe originally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth. We see then that they who openly professe Christ, may yet inwardly hate him, because the ground of their profession is not any experimentall goodnesse which they have tasted in him (for by nature men have no relish of Christ at all) but onely selfe-love and private ends, <note n="a" place="margin">

And may we not still observe amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians at this day many men who contrary to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their judgment, and peace of their consciences, conforme themselves unto the vanities, courses, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of this evill world, and like cowards are affraid to adventure on a rigorous and universall subjection to the truth of Christ, dare not keepe themselves close to those narrow rules of <hi>S.

This is a certaine rule in love, that the motions and desires thereof are strong, and therefore in any thing which the soule loves, it therin strives for excellency and perfection; and this rule holds most true in religion, because when the so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Nay suppose he meete not with such <hi>lenocinia</hi> to entice his affection, yet the very pacification of the conscience, which by a notorious
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16264:43"/>
neglect of Gods ordinances would haply be disquieted, or the credit of bearing conformity to Ecclesiasticall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the established service of God in his Church, or some other the like sinister respect may hold a man to such an externall faire correspondence, as by a deceitfull heart may easily be misconstrued a love of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Nay further, a man may externally glory in the priviledge of Gods oracles, hee may distinctly beleeve, and subscribe to the truth of them, he may therin heare many things gladly, and escape many pollutions of the world, and yet here hence conclude no cleerer evidence of his love to Christ in his word, than the unbeleeving Iews, or <hi>Herod,</hi> or <hi>Ahab,</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 7.4. Rom. 2.17.20. Hos. 2.2, 3. Mark. 6.20. 1 King. 21.27— 29.</note> or the foolish Virgins and apostates (all which have attained to some of these degrees) could have done.</p>
            <p>For the cleering then of this great case <hi>touching the evidence of a mans love to Christ,</hi> wee must first know that this is not a flower of our owne garden,<note place="margin">Act. 8.13. 2 Pet. 2.20.</note> for every man by nature is an enemie to Christ and his Kingdome, of the Iews minde, <hi>wee will not have this man to raigne over us</hi>; and the reason is because <hi>the image of the old Adam which we beare,</hi> is extremely contrary <hi>to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly image of the second Adam, unto which wee are not borne, but must bee renewed.</hi> And this is certaine, our love is according to our likenesse, he who hath not the nature and Spirit of Christ, can never love him or move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. For love is like fire, <hi>congregat homogenea,</hi> it carrieth things of a nature to one another. Our love then unto Christ must bee of a spirituall generation: and it is grounded upon two causes; First, upon the <hi>Proportion</hi> which is in him unto all our desires or capacities, upon the evidence of that unsearchable and bottomlesse good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which is in him, which makes him the <hi>fairest often thousand,</hi> even <hi>altogether lovely.</hi> For that heart which hath a spirituall view of Christ,<note place="margin">Ephes. 3.18, 19.</note> will bee able by faith to observe more dimensions of love, and sweetnesse in him
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16264:44"/>
than the knowledge of any creature is able to measure. In all worldly things though of never so curious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate an extraction, yet still even those hearts which swimme in them, and glut upon them, can easily discover more dregs than Spirits; nothing was ever so exactly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the soule of man, wherein there was not some defect, or excesse, something which the heart could wish were away, or something which it could desire were tempered with it. But in Christ and his kingdome there is nothing unlovely. For as in man the <hi>all</hi> that is, is full of corruption, so in Christ the <hi>all</hi> that hee is, is nothing but perfection. His fulnesse is the center and treasure of the soule of man, and therefore that love which is therupon grounded must needs be in the soule as an universall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and principle, to facilitate every service whereby we move unto this center, for love is the weight or spring of the soule,<note place="margin">

               </note> which sets every facultie on worke, neither are any of those commandments grievous which are obeyed in <hi>Love.</hi> And therfore it is called <hi>the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> True love unto Christ keepes the whole heart together, and carries it all one way, and so makes it universall, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and constant in all its affections unto God (for unstedfastnesse of life proceeds from a divided or double heart, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.8.) As in the motions of the heavens, there is one common circumvolution which <hi>ex aequo</hi> carrieth the whole frame daily unto one point from east to west though each severall spheare hath a severall crosse way of its owne, wherin some move with a swifter, and others with a slower motion: So though severall Saints may have their severall corruptions, and those likewise in some stronger than in others, yet being all animated by one and the same Spirit, they all agree in a steddy and uniforme motion unto Christ. If a stone were placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the concave of the moone, though there bee fire, and aire, and water between, yet through them all it would hasten to its owne place; so bee the obstacles never so
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16264:44"/>
many, or the conditions never so various through which a man must passe, through evill report and good report, through terrors and temptations, through a sea and a wildernesse, through firy Serpents and sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> yet if the heart love Christ indeed, and conclude that heaven is its home, nothing shall bee able totally to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it from hastning thither, whither Christ the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner is gone before.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.16. Ioh. 14.23. Ioh. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.21.23.</note> the true <hi>Love</hi> of Christ is grounded upon the evidence of that <hi>Proprietie</hi> which the soule hath unto him. And of that mutuall inhabitation and possession which is between them. So that our love unto him in this regard is a kinde of selfe love (and therefore very strong) because Christ and a Christian are but one. And the more perswasion the soule hath of this unity, the more must it needs love Christ. For <hi>wee love him because hee loved us first,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.16.19. And therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, from the womans apprehension of Gods more abundant love in the remission of her many and great sinnes, concludeth the measure and proportion of her love to him. But saith he, <hi>To whom little is forgiven the same loveth little, Luke</hi> 7.47.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>True Love</hi> of Christ and his Kingdome thus grounded will undoubtedly manifest it selfe, first in an <hi>universall extent</hi> unto any thing wherin Christ is present unto his Church. First, the soule in this case will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly love and cherish <hi>the Spirit of Christ.</hi> Entertaine with dearest embraces, as worthy of all acceptation, the motions, and dictates, and secret illapses of him into the soule; will bee carefull to heare his voice alwayes behinde him, prompting and directing him in the way he should walke, will endevour with all readinesse and pliablenesse of heart to receive the impression of his seale, and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie which hee giveth in the inner man unto all Gods promises; will feare and suspect nothing more than the frowardnesse of his owne nature, which daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoureth
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16264:45"/>
to quench, grieve, resist, rebel against this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and to fling off from his conduct againe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the soule in this case will abundantly love the <hi>Ordinances of God</hi> (in which by his Spirit hee is still walking in the midst of the Churches) for the Law is written in it by the finger of God, so that there is a sute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse and coincidencie betweene the Law of God and the heart of such a man. He will receive the word in the <hi>puritie</hi> thereof, and not give way to those humane inventions which adulterate it, to that spirituall treason of wit and fancie, or of heresie and contradiction, which would stampe the private image and superscription of a man upon Gods owne coine, and torture the Scriptures to confesse that which was never in them. Hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word in the <hi>power, majestie, and authority</hi> thereof, suffering it like thunder to discover the forrest, and to drive out all those secret corruptions which shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd themselves in the corners, or deceit of his heart. He will delight to have his imaginations humbled, and his fleshly reasonings non plus'd, &amp; al his thoughts subdued unto the obedience of Christ. Hee will receive the word as a <hi>wholsome potion,</hi> to that very end that it may search his secret places, and purge out those tough and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated lusts which hitherto hee had not prevailed against. Hee will take heed of hardning his heart that hee may not heare, of rejecting the counsell of God against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, of thrusting away the word from him, of setting up a resolved will of his owne against the call of Christ, as of most dangerous down-fals to the soule. Lastly, he will receive the word in <hi>the spiritualnesse thereof,</hi> subscribing to the closest precepts of the Law, suffering it to clense his heart unto the bottome, hee will let the consideration of Gods command preponderate and over-rule all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects of feare, love, profit, pleasure, credit, compliancy, or any other charme to disobedience; hee will bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to bee led in the narrowest way, to have his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretest
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16264:45"/>
corruption reveal'd and remov'd, to expose his conscience with patience under the saving, though se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest blowes of this spirituall sword. In one word hee will deny the pride of his owne wit, and if it bee the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truth of God which is taught him, though it come naked, and without any dressings, or contributions of humane fancie, hee will distinguish betweene the author and the instrument, betweene the treasure and the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell in which it comes, and from any hand receive it with such awefull submission of heart, as becommeth Gods owne word. Thirdly, the soule in this case will most dearly love <hi>every member of</hi> Christ. For these two, the love of Christ, and of his members, doe infallibly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany one another. For though there bee a farre higher proportion of love due unto Christ than unto men, yet our love to our brethren is <hi>quoad nos</hi> and <hi>à posteriori,</hi> not onely the evidences, but even the measure of our love to Christ. <hi>He that loveth not his brother whom hee hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seene?</hi> (saith the Apostle) 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.20. hee that hath not love enough in him for a man like himselfe, how can hee love God whose goodnesse being above our knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a transcendency in our love? This then is a sure rule; He that loveth not a member of Christ, loveth not him, and hee who groweth in his love to his brethren, groweth likewise in his love to Christ. For as there is the same proportion of one to five as there is of twenty to an hundred, though the numbers be farre lesse: as the motion of the shadow upon the diall, answereth exactly to that proportion of motion and distance which the Sunne hath in the firmament, though the Sunne goeth many millions of miles when the shadow it may bee moveth not the breadth of a hand: so though our love to Christ ought to be a far more abundant love, than to any of his members, yet certaine it is that the measure of our progresse in brotherly love is punctually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16264:46"/>
to the growth of our love to Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a true grounded <hi>love unto Christ</hi> will shew it selfe in the <hi>right manner</hi> or conditions of it. Which are principally these three: First, it must bee an <hi>incorrupt and sincere love. Grace bee upon all those that love the Lord Iesus <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in incorruption or sincerity,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.24. that is, on those who love not in word or outward profession and stipulation onely, but in deed and truth, or in the permanent constitution of the inner man; which moveth them to love him alwayes and in all things, to hate every false way, to set the whole heart, the studie, purpose, prayer and all the activity of our Spirits against every corruption in us which standeth at enmity with him and his Kingdome. Secondly, it must be a <hi>principall and superlative love,</hi> grounded upon the experience of the soule in it selfe, that there is ten thousand times more beautie and amiablenesse in him, than in all the honours, pleasures, profits, satisfactions which the world can afford; that in comparison or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with him, the dearest things of this world, the parents of our body, the children of our flesh, the wife of our bosome, the bloud in our veines, the heart in our brest, must not onely be laid downe and lost as <hi>sacrifices,</hi> but hated as <hi>snares</hi> when they draw us away from him. Thirdly, it must bee an <hi>unshared and uncommunicable love,</hi> without any corrivals; for Christ as he is unto us all in all, so he requireth to have all our affections fixed upon him: As the rising of the Sunne drowneth all those innumerable Starres which did shine in the firmament before; so must the beauty of this Sunne of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse blot out, or else gather together unto it selfe all those scattered affections of the soule, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cast away upon meaner objects.</p>
            <p>Lastly, true love unto Christ will shew it selfe in the naturall and genuine effects of so strong and spirituall a grace: some of the principall I before named, unto which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16264:46"/>
we may adde, First, <hi>An universall, cheerefull, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant obedience</hi> to his holy Commandements: <hi>If a man,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>love me, he will keepe my Commandements; and my Father will love him, and wee will come unto him, and make our abode with him, Iob.</hi> 14.24. There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold love, a love which descends, and a love which ascends, <hi>a love of Bounty</hi> and beneficence, <hi>and a love of Dutie</hi> and service: so then, as a father doth then only in truth love his childe, when with all care he provideth for his present education and future subsistence; so a childe doth then truly love his father, when with all reverence and submission of heart he studieth to please and to doe him service: And this love if it be free and ingenuous, by how much the more not only pure and equall in it selfe, but also profitable unto him the commandement is, by so much the more carefully will it endevour the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. And therefore since the soule of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an knowes that as God himselfe <hi>is good, and doth good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.68. Psal. 19.7-11. Mic. 2.7. Esay 45.19. Psal. 119.140.</note> so his Law (which is nothing but a ray and glimpse of his owne holinesse) is likewise good in it selfe, and doth good unto those which walke uprightly, it is hereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed to a more sweet and serious obedience thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in the keeping whereof, there is for the present so much sweetnesse, and in the future so great a reward: <hi>Thy Word,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>is very pure, therefore thy servant loveth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>A free, willing, and cheerefull suffering for him and his Gospell. Vnto you,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>it is given in the behalfe of Christ, not onely to beleeve on him, but also to suffer for his sake, Phil.</hi> 1.29.<note place="margin">Tertul. Apolog. cap. ult.</note> We see how far a humane love either of their countrey, or of vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath transported some heathen men to the devoting and casting away their owne lives: How much more should a spirituall love of Christ put courage into us <hi>to beare all things, and to endure all things</hi> (as the Apostle speakes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7.) for him, who bare our sinnes, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16264:47"/>
our stripes, and our burdens for us, which were heavier than all the world could lay on? And this was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of that holy martyr <note n="a" place="margin">

Nothing able to turne away his love from us, and therefore nothing should be able to quench our loue to him. <hi>Many waters,</hi> that is, by the usuall <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 69.1, 2.

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>A zeale and jealous contention for the glory, truth, worship and wayes of Christ:</hi> wicked men pretend much love to Christ, but they indeed serve onely their owne turnes; as Ivie, which claspes an Oake very close, but only to sucke out sap for its owne leaves and berries; but a true love is full of care to advance the glory of Christs kingdome, and to promote his truth and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, feares lest Satan and his instruments should by any meanes corrupt his truth, or violate his Church, as the Apostle to the Galatians professeth, the feare which his love wrought in him towards them; <hi>I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vaine, Gal.</hi> 4.11-16. So we finde what contention, and disputation, and strife of spirit the Apostles and others in their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery used, when Christ and his holy Gospell was any
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16264:47"/>
way either injured by false brethren, or kept out by the idolatry of the places to which they came, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 18.25. &amp; 19.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>Iude v. 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>A longing after his presence, a love of his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> a desire to be with him which is best of all, a see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after him, and grieving for him, when for any while he departs from the soule, a waiting for his salvation, a delight in his Communion, and in his spirituall refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a communing with him in his secret chamber, in his houses of wine, and in his galleries of love. By which lovely expressions the Wise-man hath described the fellowship which the Church desireth to have with Christ, and that abiding and supping of Christ with his Church, feasting the soule with the manifestations of himselfe and his graces unto it, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 42.3. &amp; 105.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6-8. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.18. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.131. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. &amp; 2.4. <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Ion.</hi> 14.21-23. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.20.</p>
            <p>Having thus by occasion of the enemies of Christ, spoken something of the true and false Love which is in the world towards him: we now proceed to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars mentioned before. And the first is the <hi>terme of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> or measure of time in the Text, <hi>Vntill.</hi> It hath a <hi>double relation</hi> in the words, unto Christs <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and unto his <hi>Enemies.</hi> As it looks to the kingdome of Christ, it denotes both the <hi>Continuance</hi> and the <hi>Limitation</hi> of his kingdome. The continuance of it in his owne person, for it is there fixed and intransient. He is a King without successours, as being subject to no mortality, nor defect which might be by them supplied. The kingdome of Christ (as I observed) is either <hi>Naturall,</hi> as he is God, or <hi>Dispensatory,</hi> and by <hi>Donation</hi> from the Father, as he is Mediator, and not onely of the former, but even of this likewise the Scripture affirmes that it is <hi>Eternall.</hi> It is a kingdome set up by the God of heaven, and yet it shall never be destroyed, but <hi>stand for ever, Dan.</hi> 2.44. I have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16264:48"/>
set my King upon my holy hill of Sion, that notes the unction and donation, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 2.6. and in mount Sion where God hath set him, hee shall reigne from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth even for ever, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.7. Though hee be a childe borne, and a sonne given, yet <hi>of the encrease of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and peace there shall be no end</hi>; upon the throne of <hi>David,</hi> and upon his Kingdome, to order it, and to establish it with judgement and justice, from henceforth for ever and ever, <hi>Esay</hi> 9.6, 7. unto the Sonne hee saith, <hi>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever, Heb.</hi> 1.8. And here wee must distinguish betweene the <hi>substance</hi> of Christs kingdome, and the <hi>forme or manner of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string</hi> and dispencing it. In the former respect it is <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely eternall,</hi> Christ shall bee a head and rewarder of his members, an everlasting Father, a Prince of peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for ever. In the latter respect it shall be <hi>Eternall according to some acception,</hi> that is, it shall remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the consummation of all things, as long as there is a Church of God upon the earth, there shall be no new way of spirituall and essentiall government prescribed unto it, no other Vicar, Successour, Monarch, or Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per upon his office by God allowed, but he onely by his Spirit in the dispensation of his ordinances shall order and over-rule the consciences of his people, and subdue their enemies: yet he shall so reigne till then, as that hee shall then cease to rule in <hi>such manner</hi> as now hee doth, when the end comes <hi>hee shall deliver up the kingdome to God the Father, and when all things shall be subdued unto him, he also himselfe shall be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24-28. He shall so returne it unto God, as God did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, and as it were, appropriate it unto him, namely, in regard of judiciary dispensation and execution, in which respect our Saviour saith, that as touching the present ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Church, <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement, and hath given autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

to execute it unto his Sonne, Ioh.</hi> 4.22, 27. Now Christ governeth his Church by the ministery of his Word and Sacraments, and by the effusion of his Spirit in measure and degrees upon his members; by his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, though secret, power he fighteth with his enemies, and so shall doe till the resurrection of the dead, when death, the last enemie shal be overcome, and then in these respects his kingdome shall cease, for he shall no more exercise the offices of a Mediator in compassionating, defending, interceding for his Church; but yet he shall still sit and reigne for ever as God, coequall with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and shall ever be the Head of the Church his body. Thus we see though Christs kingdome in regard of the <hi>manner of dispensation,</hi> and present execution thereof, it be <hi>limited</hi> by the consummation of all things; yet in it selfe it is a kingdom which hath neither <hi>within</hi> the seeds of mortality, nor <hi>without</hi> the danger of a concussion, but in the substance is immortall, though in regard of the commission and power which Christ had as Mediator to administer it alone by himselfe, and by the fulnesse of his Spirit, it be at last voluntarily resigned into the hands of the Father, and Christ as a part of that great Church become subject to the Father, that God may bee all in all.</p>
            <p>Now the grounds of the <hi>Constancy of Christs govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> over his Church, and by consequence of the Church it selfe which is his kingdome, are amongst others these: First, the <hi>Decree and promise of God</hi> sealed by an oath, which made it an adamantine and unbended purpose,<note place="margin">Iames 1.17. <hi>Non mutat vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem, sed vult mutatati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All Gods Counsels are immutable (though he may alter his workes, yet he doth never change his will,) but when he sealeth his Decree with an oath, that makes their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability past question or suspition. In that case it is impossible for God to change, because it is impossible for God to lye, or deny himselfe, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.18. Now upon
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16264:49"/>
such a Decree is the Kingdome of Heaven established. <hi>Once have I sworne by my Holinesse that I will not lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to David,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.35. <hi>Once,</hi> that notes the constancie and fixednesse of Gods promise; <hi>By my Holinesse,</hi> that notes the inviolablenesse of his promise; as if he should have said, Let me no longer be esteemed an Holy God than I keepe immutably that Covenant which I have sworne unto <hi>David</hi> in my truth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>free gift of God</hi> unto his Sonne Christ, whereby he committed all power and judgement unto him. And Power is a strong argument to prove the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a kingdome, especially if it bee on either side supported with wisedome and righteousnesse, as the power of Christ is: And therefore from his power hee argues for the perpetuitie of his Church to the end of the world, <hi>All power is given mee in heaven and earth; Goe yee therefore and preach the Gospell to all nations; and loe I am with you alwayes to the end of the world, Matth.</hi> 28.18-20. And the argument is very strong and emphaticall, for though kingdomes of great power have beene and may be subdued, yet the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause much power hath still remained in the adverse side; or if they have beene too vast for any smaller peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to root out, yet having not either wisdome enough to actuate so huge a frame, or righteousnesse to prevent or purge out those vitious humours of emulation,<note place="margin">

But now first, the power of Christ in his Church is universall, there is in him <hi>all power</hi> and no weaknesse, no power without him or against him; and therefore no wonder if from a fulnesse of power in him, and an emptinesse in his enemies, the argument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in his kingdome doth infallibly follow; for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16264:49"/>
what man, if hee were furnished with all sufficiencie, would suffer himselfe to be mutilated and dismembred, as Christ should, if any thing should prevaile against the Church, which is his fulnesse. Againe, this power of Christ is supported with <hi>wisdome,</hi> it can never miscarry for any inward defect, for the wisdome is proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the power; this, <hi>All power,</hi> and that, <hi>All the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of wisdome</hi>; Power able by weaknesse to confound the things which are mighty, and wisdome able by foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse to bring to nought the understanding of the prudent; and both these are upheld by righteousnesse, which is indeed the very soule and sinewes of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, upon which the thrones of Princes are establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and which the Apostle makes the ground of the perpetuitie of Christs kingdome, <hi>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever, a scepter of righteousnesse is the scepter of thy kingdome, Hebr.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the quality of Christs kingdome is to be a <hi>Growing kingdome,</hi> though the originals thereof be but like a graine of mustard-seed, or like <hi>Eliahs</hi> cloud to a humane view despicable, and almost below the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of subsistence, the object rather of derision than of terrour to the world; yet at last it groweth into a widenesse, which maketh it as catholike as the world. And therefore that which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> speakes of the Sunne, the Apostle applies to the Gospell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. to note that the Circle of the Gospell is like that of the Sunne, universall to the whole world. It is such a kingdome as groweth into other kingdomes, and eats them out. The little stone in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (which was the Kingdome of Christ, for so Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem is called a stone, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.3.) brake in peeces the great Monarchies of the earth, and grew up into a great mountaine which filled the world, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.34, 35. for the kingdomes of the earth must become the kingdomes of the Lord, and of his Christ, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.15. Therefore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16264:50"/>
the Prophets expresse Christ and his kingdome by the name of a <hi>Branch,</hi> which groweth up for a standard and ensigne of the people, <hi>Esay</hi> 11.1.10. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.8. A branch which growes, but never withers. It hath no principles of death in it selfe; and though it be for a while subject to the assaults of adversaries, and forren violence, yet that serves onely to trie it, and to settle it, but not to weaken or overturne it: The gates of hell, all the powers, policies, and lawes of darknesse, shall never prevaile against the Church of Christ: he hath bruized, and judged, and trodden downe Satan under our feet. He hath overcome the world; he hath subdued iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hee hath turned persecutions into seminaries and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections of the Church; he hath turned afflictions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to matters of glory and of rejoycing; so that in all the violence which the Church can suffer, it doth more than conquer, because it conquers not by repelling but by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
            <p>And this shewes the sacrilege and sawcinesse of the Church of Rome, which in this point doth with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impiety therefore pervert the Scriptures, that it may derogate from the honour of Christ and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: And those things which are spoken of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, authority, and fulnesse of power which Christ hath in his body, of the stability, constancie, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salitie of his Church upon earth, doth arrogate onely to the Pope and his See at Rome.

the Church by any dignity of their persons, as Christ the chiefe corner stone was, but by the vertue of their <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall</hi> office, which was <hi>universall jurisdiction</hi> in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the people of Christ, <hi>universall commission</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing them, and a Spirit of <hi>infallibility</hi> in revealing Gods will unto them throughout the whole world. And therefore as <hi>Peter</hi> had the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven to remit or retaine the sinnes of men; so likewise had the other Apostles, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.23. That Christs charge to <hi>Peter, feed my sheepe, feed my lambes,</hi> is no other in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance than his commission to them all, <hi>goe teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Sonne and the Holy Ghost.</hi> And that the particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of it unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and praying for him, was with respect unto his particular onely by way of comfort and confirmation, as being then a weake member, not by way of dignity, or deputation of Christs owne regall power to him in the visible Church. For all the offices of Christ are intransient and uncommunicable to any other, in as much as that administration and execution of them dependeth upon the dignity of his person, and upon the fulnesse of his Spirit, which no mortall man or immortall Angell is capable of. But all this is not enough to bee granted them for the raising their authority. But then thirdly, we must grant them too that <hi>Peter,</hi> thus qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was Bishop of Rome, for proofe wherof they have no Testimonie of Holy Scriptures, but onely humane tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Cui impossibile non est subesse falsum.</hi> So that in this which is one of the maine principles they build upon, their faith cannot bee resolved into the word of God,<note place="margin">

Fourthly, that hee did appoint that Church to bee the monarchicall and fundamentall see to all other Churches; for hee was Bishop as well of Antioch as of Rome, by their owne confession. And I wonder why some of his personall vertue should not cleave to his chaire at Antioch,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16264:53"/>
but all passe over with him to another place. Fifthly, that hee did transmit all his prerogatives to his successors in that chaire. By which assertion they may as well prove that they all (though some of them have been sorcerers, others murtherers, others blasphemous atheists) were inheriters of <hi>S. Peters</hi> love to Christ, for from thence our Savior inferres, feed my sheep, to note that none feed his sheepe, but those that love his person. Lastly, that that long succession from <hi>S. Peter</hi> untill now hath ever since been legall, and uninterrupted. Or else the Church must sometimes have been a monster without a head. Wee grant that some of the Ancients argue from succession in the Church; but it was while it was yet pure,<note place="margin">

               </note> and while they could by reason of the little space of time betweene them and the Apostles, with evidence resolve their Doctrine through every <hi>medium</hi> into the preaching of the Apostles themselves. But even in their personall succession who knoweth not what <hi>Simonies</hi> and <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries</hi> have raised divers of them unto that degree? and who is able to resolve, that every Episcopall ordination of every Bishop there hath been valid, since therunto is requisite both the intention and Orders of that Bishop that ordained him. These and a world of the like uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties must the faith of these men depend upon, who dare arrogate to themselves the prerogatives of Christ, and of his Catholike Kingdome. But I have been too long upon this argument.</p>
            <p>Againe this point of the stabilitie of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a ground of strong confidence &amp; comfort to the whole Church of Christ, against all the violence of any outward enemies wherwith sometimes they may seeme to bee swallowed upon. Though they associate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and gird to the battle, though they take counsell, and make decrees against the Lords anointed and against his spouse, yet it shall all come to nought, and be broken in pieces, all the smoake of hell shall not bee able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16264:54"/>
nor all the power of hell to overturne the Church of God, and the reason is, <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God is with us, <hi>Esai.</hi> 8.9, 10. That <hi>anointing</hi> which the Church hath received shall deliver it at last from the yoke of the enemie, <hi>Esai.</hi> 10.27. Though it seeme for the time in as desperate a condition as a dry stick in the fire, or a dead body in the grave, yet this is not indeed a sepulture, but a semination. Though it seeme to bee cast away for a season, yet in due time it will come up and flourish againe, <hi>Zechariah</hi> 3.2. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 37.11. And this is the assurance that the Church may have, that the Lord can save and deliver a <hi>second time, Esai.</hi> 11.11. that hee is the <hi>same God yesterday, and to day, and for ever</hi>; and therfore such a God as the Church hath found him heretofore, such a God it shall finde him to day, and for ever, in the returnes and manifestations of his mercy. Which discovers the folly, and foretels the confusion of the enemies of Christs Kingdome, they conceive mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, but they bring forth nothing but vanity, <hi>Iob</hi> 15.35. They conceive chaffe, and bring forth stubble, <hi>Esai.</hi> 33.11. They imagine nothing but a vaine thing, their malice is but like the fighting of briars and thornes with the fire, <hi>Esai.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.10. like the dashing of waves against a rock, like a mad mans shooting arrowes against the Sunne, which at last returne upon his owne head; like the puffing of the fanne against the corne, which driveth away nothing but the chaffe, like the beating of the winde against the saile, or the foming and raging of the water against a mill, which by the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the artificers are all ordered unto usefull and excellent ends. And surely when the Lord shall have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished his worke on mount Sion, when hee shall by the adversary, as by a fanne have purged away the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and taken away his sinne, hee will then returne in peace and beauty unto his people againe. Looke on the preparation of some large building, in one
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16264:54"/>
place you shall see heapes of lime, and morter, in another piles of timber, every where rude, and indigested mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and a tumultuary noise of axes and hammers, but at length the artificer sets every thing in order, and raiseth up a beautifull structure: such is the proceeding of the Lord in the afflictions and vastations of his Church, though the enemie intend to ruine it, yet God intends onely to repaire it. Thus farre as <hi>Donec</hi> respects Christs Kingdome in it selfe.</p>
            <p>Now as <hi>it respecteth the enemies of Christ,</hi> it notes, First, <hi>The present inconsummatenesse of the victories,</hi> and by consequence the <hi>intranquillity of Christs Kingdome</hi> here upon the earth. All his enemies are not yet under his feete, Satan is not yet shut up; the rage of hell, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions and policies of wicked men, the present immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of desperate sinners, are evidences that Christ hath yet much worke to doe in his Church. But doth not the Apostle say, that <hi>all things are put under his feete? Eph.</hi> 1.22. It is true <hi>quoad judiciariam potestatem,</hi> but not <hi>quoad exercitium potestatis.</hi> Hee shall not receive any new power to subdue his enemies, which hee hath not already; but yet hee can execute that power when and how hee will. And hee is pleased to suffer his enemies in this respite of their reprivall to rage, and revile, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute him in his members. Every wicked man is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already,</hi> and hath the wrath of God <hi>abiding upon him, Iob.</hi> 3.18.36. Onely Christ doth suspend the execution of them for many weighty reasons. As first, to shew his patience and long suffering towards the vessels of wrath, for hee ever comes first with an offer of peace, before hee drawes the sword, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.10-13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.5, 11. Secondly, to magnifie the power of his protection and providence over the Church in the midst of their enemies, for if the Lord were not on the Churches side when man riseth up against it, if hee did not rebuke the proud waves, and set
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16264:55"/>
them their bounds how farre they should goe, there could bee no more power in the Church to withstand them, than in a levell <note n="*" place="margin">

Thirdly, to reserve wicked men unto the great day of his appearing, and of the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his power and righteousnesse, wherin all the world shall bee the spectators and witnesses of his just and victorious proceedings against them, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. Fourthly, to shew forth his mighty power in destroying the wicked all together. They who here carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with that insolence as if every particular man meant to have plucked Christ out of his throne, shall there <hi>all together</hi> bee brought forth before him. That as the righteous are reserved to have their full salvation <hi>together,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.17. so the wicked may bee bound up in bundles, and destroied <hi>together, Psal.</hi> 37.38. <hi>Esai.</hi> 1.28. Fifthly, to fill up the measure, and to ripen the sinnes of wicked men: for the Lord puts the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of men into an Epha, and when they have filled up their measure, he then sealeth them up unto the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his righteous judgements. And hence it is that the Scripture calleth wicked men <hi>Vessels fitted for destruction,</hi> for they first fill themselves with sin, and then God filleth them up with wrath and shame. Sixthly, to fill up the number of his Elect, for hee hath many sheepe which are not yet within his fold, and they many of them the posterity of wicked men, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.16. Seventhly, to fill up the measure of his owne sufferings in his members, that they may follow him unto his kingdome through the same way of afflictions as he went before them, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.11. Eighthly, to exercise the faith of his Church, to drive the faithfull with the Prophet <hi>Habakuk</hi> into their watch-tower, and with <hi>David</hi> into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of the Lord, thereto waite upon him in the way of his judgements, to consider that the end of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man is peace, and that the pride and prosperity of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16264:55"/>
the wicked is but as the fat of Lambes, and as the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of grasse; that God hath set them in slippery places, and will cast them downe at the last, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.1, 3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.2.10.20. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.18. Lastly, to weane the faithfull from earthly affections, and to kindle in them the desires of the Saints under the altar, <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our bloud on them that dwell on the earth? Revel.</hi> 6.10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as <hi>donec</hi> notes the Patience of Christ to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his enemies, so it notes likewise that there are <hi>fixed bounds and limits unto that patience,</hi> beyond which he will no longer forbeare them. There is an <hi>appointed day, wherein hee will judge the world with righteousnesse, Act.</hi> 17.31. There is <hi>a yeere of vengeance,</hi> and of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences for the controversies of Sion, <hi>Esai.</hi> 34.8. The wilde asse that sucketh up the winde at her pleasure may be found in her <hi>moneth, Ier.</hi> 2.24. The Lord seeth that <hi>the day of the wicked</hi> is comming. It is an appointed time, though it tarry, yet if we waite for it, It will surely come, it will not tarry, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.13. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. Well then, let men goe on with all the fiercenesse and excesse of riot they will, let them walke in the way of their heart, and in the sight of their eyes, yet all this while they are in a chaine, they have but a compasse to goe, and God will bring them to judgement at the last. When the day of a Drunkard and riotous person is come, when he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so many hellish swallowes, and hath filled up the measure of his lusts, his marrow must then lie downe in the dust, though the cup were at his mouth, yet from thence it shall be snatch'd away, and for everlasting hee shall never taste a drop of sweetnesse, nor have the least desire of his wicked heart satisfied any more. A wicked mans sinnes will not follow him to hell to please him, but onely the memory of them to bee an everlasting scourge, and flame upon his conscience. O then take heed of ripening sinne, by custome, by security, by insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16264:56"/>
by impudence and stoutnesse of heart, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a mocke, a matter of glory and of boasting, by stopping the eare against the voice of the Charmer, and turning the backe upon the invitations unto mercy, by resisting the Evidence of the Spirit in the Word, and committing sinne in the light of the Sunne: for as the heat of the sunne doth wither the fruit which falls off, and ripen that which hangs on the tree; so the Word doth weaken those lusts which a man is desirous to shake off, and doth ripen those which the heart holds fast and will not part with. When was Israel over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, but when they mocked the Messengers of God, and despised his Word, and misused his Prophets, and rejected the remedy of their sinne? and when was Juda destroyed, but when they hardened themselves against the Word, and would not take notice of the day of their peace? Alas, what haste doe men make to promote their owne damnation, and to goe quickly to hell, when they will breake through the very Law of God, and through all his holy Ordinances, that they may come thither the sooner, as if the gate would bee shut against them, or as if it were a place of some great preferment; as if they had to doe with a blinde God which could not see, or with an impotent God which could not revenge their impieties. Well, for all this, the Wise mans speech will prove true at the last, <hi>Know, that God will bring thee unto judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>donec</hi> notes the infallible accomplishment of Christs victories and triumph over his enemies at the last, when the day is come wherein he will bee patient towards them no longer. The Prophet giveth three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent reasons hereof in one verse, <hi>Esai.</hi> 33.22. The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King, hee will save us. Hee is our Judge, and therefore certainely when the day of triall is come hee will plead our cause against our adversaries, and will condemne
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16264:56"/>
them, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.9. But a Judge cannot doe what pleaseth himselfe, but is bound to his rule, and proceedeth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to establish'd lawes. Therefore he is our Lawgiver likewise, and therefore hee may himselfe appoint Lawes according to his owne will, but when the Will of the Judge, and the Rule of the Law doe both consent in the punishing of offendors, yet then still the King hath a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of mercy, and hee may pardon those whom the Law and the Judge have condemned. But Christ, who shall judge the enemies of his Church according to the Law which himselfe hath made, is himselfe the King, and therefore when he revengeth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Oportet eum ad tantam eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam regnum su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um perducere, donec inimici eius nullo modo audeant negare quod regnat, Aug.</hi>
               </note> there is none besides nor above him to pardon. So at that day there shall bee a full manifestation of the Kingdome of Christ, none of his enemies shall moue the wing, or open the mouth, or peepe against him.</p>
            <p>The second thing formerly proposed in this latter part of the verse was, <hi>The Author</hi> of subduing Christs ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under his feet [<hi>I the Lord.</hi>] Wicked men will never submit themselves to Christs Kingdome, but stand out in opposition against him in his Word and wayes. When Gods hand is lifted up in the dispensation of his Word and threatnings against sin, men will not see, <hi>Esai.</hi> 26.11. And therefore he saith, <hi>My spirit shall not alwayes strive with men,</hi> to note that men would of themselves alwayes strive with the spirit, and never yeeld nor submit to Christ. Though the patience and goodnesse of God should lead them to repentance, and forewarne them to flye from the wrath to come, yet they after their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and impenitent heart do hereby treasure up against themselves the more wrath,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4, 5.</note> and because judgement is not speedily executed,<note place="margin">Eccles. 8.11.</note> their heart is wholly set in them to doe mischiefe. <hi>Let favour,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>be shewed unto a wicked man, yet will he not learne righteousnesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esai. 26.10.</note> 
               <hi>in the land of uprightnesse will he deale unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the Lord.</hi> Certainely if a wicked
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16264:57"/>
man could bee rescued out of hell it selfe, and brought backe into the possibilities of mercie againe, yet would he in a second life flie out against God, and while he had time take his fill of lusts againe. We see Clay will but grow harder by the fire, and that metall which melted in the Fornace, being taken thence will returne to its wonted solidity. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> saw that the raine, and the haile, and the thunders were ceased, (though in the time of them he was like melted metall,<note place="margin">Exod. 9.27, 28.34, 35.</note> and did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the righteousnesse of God and his owne sinne, and make strong promises that Israel should goe) yet then he sinned more, and hardened his heart, he and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and would not let the children of Israel goe. Doe wee not see men sometimes cast on a bed of sickenesse, brought to the very brinke of hell, and to the smell of that sulphurie lake, when by Gods wonderfull patience they are snatch'd like a brand out of the fire, and have recover'd a little strength to provoke the Lord againe, when they should now set themselves to make good those hypocriticall resolutions of amendement of life, wherewith in their extremity they flattered God, and deceived themselves, suddenly breake forth into more filthinesse than before, as if they meant now to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of God, and to fetch backe that time which sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse tooke from them by an extremity of sinning, as if they had made a Covenant with hell to doe it more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if they might then be spared? All the favours and methods which God useth are not enough to bring wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men home unto him of their owne wils. <hi>Though I redeemed them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 7.13, 14.</note> saith the Lord, <hi>yet have they spoken lyes against me, they have not cryed unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds. The people turneth not unto him that smiteth them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esai. 9.13. Amos 4.6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>neither doe they seeke the Lord of hosts.</hi> So many judgements did the Lord send upon Israel in the necke of one another, and yet still the burden of the Prophet is, <hi>Yet have you not returned unto me,</hi> saith
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16264:57"/>
the Lord. Damme up the passage of a river, and use all the Art that may be to over-rule it, yet you can never carry it backward in its owne channell; you may cut it out into other courses and diverticles, but no Art can drive it unto a contrary motion, and make it retire into its owne fountaine: So though wicked men may haply by divers reasons which their lusts will admit, be so farre wrought upon as to change their courses, yet it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to change themselves, or to turne them quite out of their owne way into the way of Christ. There is but a <hi>bivium</hi> in the world, a way of life, and a way of death, and the Lord in the Ministery of the Word gives us our option, <hi>I have set before you this day life and death, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and cursing,</hi> and <hi>hee that beleeveth shall be saved, hee that beleeveth not shall be damned.</hi> To the former he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, beseecheth, enticeth us with promises, with oathes, with engagements, with prevention of any just objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which might be made; <hi>We beseech you,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>in Christs stead that you be reconciled unto God.</hi> From the other he deterres us by forewarning us of the wrath to come, and of the period which death will put to our lusts with our lives. And as <hi>Tertullian</hi> once spake of the Oath of God, so may I of his entreaties, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. O blessed men whom the Lord himselfe is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to sollicite and entice unto happinesse, but, O misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men they who will not beleeve nor accept of Gods owne entreaties: And yet thus miserable are we all by nature. There is in men so much atheisme, infidelity and distrust of Gods Word, so close an adherencie of lust unto the soule, that it rather chooseth to runne the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and to goe to hell entire, than to goe halt and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto heaven; yea, to make God a liar, to blesse themselves in their sinnes, when he curseth, and to judge of him by themselves, as if he tooke no notice of their wayes.<note place="margin">Deut. 29.19.</note> It is not therefore without just cause that God so often threatneth to remember all the sinnes of wicked<note place="margin">Psal. 50.21.</note>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:16264:58"/>
men, and to doe against them whatsoever he hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.<note place="margin">Hos. 5.2, 3. Hos. 7.2, 12. Amos 8.7. Deut. 31.34, 35. Psal. 50.21. Ier. 17.1.</note> Wee see then that men will never submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the Scepter of Christ, nor prevent the wrath to come by a <hi>voluntary subjection.</hi> It remaines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God take the worke into his owne hands, and put them perforce under Christs feete. They will not submit to his kingdome of grace and mercy, they will not beleeve his kingdome of glory and salvation, but they shall be made subject to the sword of his wrath, and that without any hope of escape, or power of oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for God himselfe shall do it immediatly by his owne mighty power. Hee will interpose his owne hand, and magnifie the glory of his owne strength in the just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of wicked men. So the Apostle saith, that <hi>The Lord will shew his wrath, and make his power knowne in the vessels fitted for destruction, Rom.</hi> 9.22. Two meanes the Apostle sheweth shall be used in the destruction of the wicked, to effect it. <hi>The presence</hi> or countenance, and the glorious <hi>power</hi> of the Lord, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.9. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrour of his face, and the dreadfull Majesty of his presence shall slay the wicked. The kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chiefe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and the mighty men, those who all their life time were themselves terrible, and had beene acquainted with terrours, shall then begge of the mountaines and rockes to fall upon them and to hide them from the <hi>Face</hi> of him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.15, 16. <hi>Esai.</hi> 2.10. whence that usuall expression of Gods resolution to destroy a people, <hi>I will set my face against them.</hi> O then how sore shall the condemnation of wicked men bee, when therein the Lord purposeth to declare <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous strength of his owne almighty arme. Here when the Lord punisheth a people, he onely sheweth how much strength and edge he can put into the Creatures to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his displeasure. But the extreme terrour of the last
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16264:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
day shall be this, that men shall fall immediatly <hi>into the hands of God himselfe,</hi> who hath said, <hi>Vengeance belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth unto me, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will recompence, Heb.</hi> 10.30, 31. And therefore the Apostle useth this expostulation against Idolaters, <hi>Doe we provoke the Lord to jelousie? Are we stronger than he?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22. Dare we meete the Lord in his fury, doe we provoke him to powre out <hi>All his wrath? Psal.</hi> 78.38. He will at last stir up <hi>all</hi> his wrath against the vessels that are fitted for it. And for that cause he will punish them himselfe. For there is no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture able to bring <hi>all</hi> Gods wrath unto another, there is no vessell able to hold <hi>all</hi> Gods displeasure. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle telleth us that wee have to doe with God in his Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. but herein he useth the ministery of weake men, so that his Majesty is cover'd, and wicked men have a veile upon their hearts, that they cannot see God in his Word. <hi>When thy hand is lifted up,</hi> namely in the threatnings and predictions of wrath out of the word, <hi>they will not see:</hi> for it is a worke of faith to receive the word as Gods word, and therein before-hand to see his power, and to heare his rod, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9. Other men <hi>belye the Lord, and say it is not he.</hi> But though they will not acknowledge that they have to doe with God in his word, though they will not see when his hand is lifted up in the preparations of his wrath, yet they shall see and know that they have to doe with him in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when his hand falleth downe againe in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his wrath. So the Lord expostulateth with them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Can thine heart endure or thine hands bee strong in the dayes that I shall deale with thee?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> resolves that question, <hi>The sinners in Sion are affraid, fearefulnesse hath surprised the hypocrites,</hi> (namely a fearefull looking for of judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fiery indignation, as the Apostle speakes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27.) <hi>Who amongst us shall dwell with the devouring fire, who amongst us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16264:59"/>
Esai.</hi> 33.14. that is, in the words of another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fiercenesse of his anger. His fury is powred out like fire, and the rockes are throwne downe by him, Nahum</hi> 1.6.</p>
            <p>Confirmations of this point we may take from these considerations: First, the quarrell with sinners is Gods owne,<note place="margin">Levit. 26.25. Hos. 12.2. Psal. 2.2. Esai. 65.3.</note> the controversie his owne, the injuries and indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have beene done to himselfe and his owne sonne, the challenges have beene sent unto himselfe and his owne Spirit: And therefore no marvell if hee take the matter into his owne hands, and the quarrell so immediatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon him, if he be provoked to revenge it by his owne immediate power.</p>
            <p>Secondly, revenge is his royalty and peculiar prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35.41. from whence the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres, <hi>That it is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the living God, Heb.</hi> 10.30, 31. And there are these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of fearefulnesse in it; First, it shall be <hi>in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercy, Iam.</hi> 2.13. there shall be no mixture of any sweetnesse in the cup of Gods displeasure, but all poison and bitternesse; there shall not bee affoorded a drop of water to a lake of fire, a minute of eafe to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of torment. Secondly, it shall be <hi>in fury without compassion:</hi> In humane judgements where the law of the state will not suffer a Judge to acquit or shew mercy, yet the law of nature will force him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passionate &amp; grieve for the malefactor whom he must condemne. There is no Judge so senselesse of anothers miserie, nor so destitute of humane affections as to pronounce a sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation with laughter. But the Lord will condemne his enemies in vengeance without any pittie. <hi>I will laugh,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>at your calamity, I will mocke when your feare commeth, Prov.</hi> 1.26. Thirdly, it shall bee <hi>in revenge and recompence,</hi> in reward and proportion, that is, in a full and everlasting <hi>detestation</hi> of wicked men,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16264:59"/>
the weight whereof shall peradventure lye heavier upon them, than all the other torments which they are to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, when they shall looke on themselves as scorned and abhorred exiles from the favour and presence of him that made them. For as the wicked did here hate God, and set their hearts and their courses against him <hi>in suo aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> in all that time which God permitted them to sinne in: so God will hate wicked men, and set his face and fury against them <hi>in suo aeterno</hi> too, as long as he shall be Judge of the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this may be seene in the inchoations of hell in wicked men upon the earth. When the doore of the conscience is opened and that sin, which lay there asleepe before, riseth up like an enraged Lion to fly upon the soule, when the Lord suffers some flashes of his glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring sword to breake in like lightening upon the Spirit, and to amaze a sinner with the pledges and first fruits of hell, when he melteth the stout hearts of men, and grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them unto powder, what is all this but the secret touch of Gods owne finger upon the conscience? For there is no creature in the world whose ministerie the heart doth discerne, in the estuations and invisible wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of a guilty and unquiet spirit.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the torments of wicked angels whence can they come? there is no Creature strong enough to lay upon them a sufficient recompence of paine for their sinne against the Majestie of God. And for the disputes of Schoole-men touching corporall fire in hell, and the manner of elevating and applying corporall agents to worke upon spirituall substances, they are but the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate nicities of men ignorant of the Scriptures, and of the terrour of the Lord, who is himselfe a consuming fire. The divels acknowledge Christ their Tormentor, and that when hee did nothing but rebuke them: there was no fire, nor any other creature by him applied, but onely the Majesty of his owne word, power, and person,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16264:60"/>
which wrung from them that hideous cry, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time? Matth.</hi> 8.29.</p>
            <p>Lastly, consider the heavinesse of Christs owne soule, his agonie and sense of the curse due unto our sinne when he was in the garden,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.37. Luk. 22.44. Ioh. 12.27. Mark. 14.33, 34.</note> the trouble, astonishment, and extreme anguish of his soule, which wrought out of his sacred body that woefull and wonderfull sweat. Whence came it all? wee reade never of any divels let loose to torment him, they were ever tormented at his presence. We reade of no other Angels that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to afflict him, we reade of an Angell which was sent to strengthen him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43. There is no reason to thinke that the feare of a bodily death, which was the onely thing that men could inflict upon him, was that which squeezed out those drops of bloud, and extorted those bitter and strong cries from him. There were not in his innocent soule, in his most pure and sacred body any seeds or principles of such tormenting distempers; his compassion towards the misery of sinners, his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the guilt and cursednesse of sinne, was as great at other times as now: What then could it else be, but the weight of his Fathers justice, the conflict with his Fathers wrath against the sinnes of men, which wrought such extremity of heavinesse in his soule? And hee was our suretie, he stood in our stead, that which was done to the greene tree, should much more have beene done to the dry; If God layd upon him the strokes which were due unto our sinne, how much more heavie shall his hand be upon those whom he throughly hateth?</p>
            <p>But shall not the Angels then be executioners of the sentence of Gods wrath upon wicked men? I answere, The Angels shal have their service in the comming of the Lord. First, <hi>as Attendants,</hi> to shew forth the majestie and glory of Christ to the world, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.31. Secondly, <hi>as executioners of his will,</hi> which is to gather together the Elect and the reprobate, to binde
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16264:60"/>
up the wicked as sheaves or faggots for the fire. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.30.24.31. But yet still the Lord interposeth his owne power. As a Schoolemaster setteth one scholar to bring forth another unto punishment, but then hee layeth on the stripes himselfe.</p>
            <p>But why is it said that the Father shal put Christs ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under his feet? doth not Christ himselfe do it as well as the Father? yes doubtlesse. <hi>God hath given the Sonne authority to execute Iudgement also,</hi> and put into his hands a rod of iron, to dash his enemies to peeces like a potters vessell; for <hi>whatsoever things the father doth, these also doth the sonne likewise, Ioh.</hi> 5.19.27. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.9. But we are to note that the subjecting of Christs enemies under his feete is <hi>a worke of divine power.</hi> And therefore though it be attributed to Christ as an <hi>Officer,</hi> yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the <hi>Father, as the Fountaine of all divine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</hi> So God is said to have set forth his Sonne as a propitiation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and yet the Sonne came downe and manifested himselfe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. The Father is said to have raised him from the dead, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.32 <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. and yet the Sonne raised himselfe by his owne power, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.18. the Father is said to have set Christ at his owne right hand in heavenly places, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.20. and Christ is said to have sate downe himselfe on the right hand of the Majestie on high, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.10.12. The Father is said to give the holy Ghost, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.16. and yet the Sonne promiseth to send him himselfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.7. so here, though the Sonne have received power sufficient to subdue all his enemies under his feete (for he is able to subdue all things unto himselfe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.) yet the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shew his hatred against the enemies of Christ, and his consent to the victories of his Son, will likewise sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things unto him, 1 Cor. 15.27, 28.</p>
            <p>O then that men would be by the terrour of the Lord perswaded to fly from the wrath to come, to consider the weight of Gods heavie hand, and when they see such a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16264:61"/>
storme comming to hide themselves in the holes of that Rocke of mercy. It is nothing but Atheisme and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which bewitcheth men with desperate senselesnesse against the vengeance of God. And therefore as the Lord hath seconded his Word of Promise with an oath, that they might have strong consolation who flye for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to lay hold on the hope which is set before them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. So hath hee confirmed the Word of his threatnings with an oath too. <hi>If I lift up my hand to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and say, I live for ever — I will render vengeance to mine enemies, I will reward them that hate me, Deut.</hi> 32.40 41. and againe, <hi>The Lord hath sworne by the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Iacob, surely I will never forget any of their workes, Amos</hi> 8.7. and againe, <hi>I have sworne by my selfe, that unto me every knee shall bow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Esai.</hi> 45.23. and this he doth that secure and obdurate sinners might have the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger reasons to flye from the wrath which is set before them. <hi>O nos miseros, qui nec juranti Deo credimus!</hi> How wonderfull is the stupidity of men, that will neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the words, nor tremble at the oath of God? Hee warneth us to fly from the wrath to come, and we make haste to meete it the rather: wee fill up our measure, and commit sinne <hi>with both hands greedily,</hi> with uncleane and intemperate courses, we bring immature deaths up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our selves, that so we may hasten to hell the sooner, and make triall whether God be a liar or no. For this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the very direct issue of every profane exorbitancy which men rush into. Every man hath much Atheisme in his heart by nature, but such desperate stupidity doth wonderfully improve it, and bring men by degrees to the hellish presumption of those in the Prophets, <hi>The Lord will not doe good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 5.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>neither will he doe evill; It is not the Lord, neither shall evill come upon us, the Prophets shall become winde, and the word is not in them. The dayes are prolonged and the vision shall faile;</hi>

               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 23.</note> but shall come upon them soone enough, even like an armed man. <hi>Be not ye mockers,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>lest your bands be made strong.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esai. 28.22.</note> Atheisme, and scorne of Gods judgements will make him binde them the faster upon us, he will get the better of the proudest of his enemies. Wee may mocke, but <hi>God will not be mocked.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6.7, 8.</note> Hee that shooteth arrowes against the Sunne, shall never reach high enough to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it, but the arrowes shall returne upon his owne head.

Nay, there is no Atheist in the world, but some time or other feeleth by the horrours of his owne bosome, and by the records of his owne conscience, that there is a consumption decreed, and a day of slaughter comming for the buls of Bashan.</p>
            <p>Againe, others I have knowne acknowledge indeede the terrour of the Lord, but yet goe desperately on in their presumptions, and that upon two other dangerous downefals: First, they thus argue, peradventure I belong to Gods Election of Grace, and then he will fetch me in, in his time, and in the meane time his mercy is above my sinnes, and it is not for me to hasten his worke till he will himselfe. O what a perversenesse is this for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of man to perturbe the Order of God? His Rule is, that we should argue from a holy conversation to our Election, and by our diligence in adding one grace unto another to make it sure unto our selves; not to argue from our Election to our calling, nor to neglect all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence till our Election appeare. It is true, the mercy of Christ is infinitely wider than the very rebellions of men,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16264:62"/>
and it may be hee will snatch such a wicked disputer as this like a brand out of the fire. But then know with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that every desperate sin thou dost now wilfully run into, will at last cost thee such bitter throwes such blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy teares, as thou wouldest not be willing with the least of them to purchase the most sweete and constant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which thy heart can now delight in. And in the meane time it is a bloody adventure upon the patience of God,<note place="margin">

Tertull.</hi> Ion. 3.8, 9.</note> for any man upon expectation of Gods favour to steale time from his service, and to turne the possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the mercy of God into an occasion of sinning. The Ninivites gathered another conclusion from those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; <hi>Let man and beast be covered with sackecloth and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turne every one from their evill way, and from the violence which is in their hands:</hi> and the ground of this resolution was this, <hi>Who can tell if God will turne and repent, and turne away from his fierce anger that wee perish not?</hi> And the Prophets teach us to make another use of the possibility of Gods mercy; <hi>Rent your hearts and not your garments, and turne unto the Lord your God,</hi>

               <hi>for he is gratious and mercifull, slow to anger, and of great kindenesse, and repenteth him of the evill. Who knoweth if he will returne and repent, and leave a blessing behinde him, &amp;c.</hi> and againe, <hi>Seeke ye the Lord all ye meeke of the earth,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But then secondly, there are not wanting desperate wretches who will thus hellishly argue against the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. It may be the decree is gone forth, and I am rejected by God, and why should I labour in vaine, and goe about to repeale his will, and not rather, since I shall have no heaven hereafter, take the fill of mine owne wayes and lusts here?

man, who disputest against God? who rather choosest to abuse the secrets of God, that thou maiest dishonour him, than to bee ruled by his revealed will, that thou maist obey him? <hi>Let the potsheards strive with the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheards of the earth,</hi> but let not the Clay dash it selfe against him that made it. Remember and tremble at the difference which our Saviour makes even amongst the wicked in hell. <hi>It shall be easier for Sodome and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, and for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgement,</hi> than for those cities which have heard and despised him. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are treasuring up of wrath, and hoording up of destruction against their owne soules, every new oath or blasphemie heapes a new mountaine upon their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; every renewed act of any uncleannesse plungeth a man deeper into hell, giveth the divell more hold fast of him, adds more fuell unto his Tophet, squeezeth in more dregges and woefull ingredients into the cup of astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he must swallow. Doubtlesse a sinner in hell would account himselfe a blessed creature if hee did not feele there the weight and worme of such and such particular sinnes, which with much easinesse he might have forborne, nay which without paine and labour hee could not commit. We see <hi>Dives</hi> in hell begg'd for but a drop of water to coole his tongue in that mightie flame. Now suppose a man in a burning fornace; what great comfort could he receive from but a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against a fornace of fire? Certainely the abatement of so much paine as the abiding of one drop would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, could in no proportion amount to the taking away the punishment of the smallest sin, of the least idle word, or unprofitable thought; and yet in that extremity there shall not bee allowed a drop of refreshment against a lake of fire. O that men would therefore in time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what a woefull thing it is to fall into the hands, and to rowze up the jealousie of the living God; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he will doe thus and thus unto obdurate sinners,

they would therefore in time humble themselves under his mightie hand, and prepare to meete him in the way of his judgements. For certainely no sooner doth the heart of a Sinner yeeld to God, but hee meeteth him in his returne and preventeth him with goodnesse, his heart likewise is turned within him, and his repentings are kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled together.

            <p>The last thing observed was the <hi>Manner of this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> expressed in those words, <hi>Ponam,</hi> and <hi>ponam scabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi> To <hi>put,</hi> and to <hi>put as a stoole</hi> under Christs feet. Now this expression, that the conquest of Christs ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies shall bee but as the removing of a stoole into his place, noteth unto us two things:</p>
            <p>First, <hi>the easinesse of Gods victory</hi> over the enemies of Christ. They are before him as nothing, lesse than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,<note place="margin">Esai. 41.15.</note> the drop of a bucket, the dust of a ballance, a very little thing. What thing is heavier than a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, what thing easier than a touch, what lighter than chaffe, or softer than wax? and yet they who in the eyes of men are as strong and immoveable as mountaines, if God but touch them they shall bee turned into chaffe, and flow at his presence.<note place="margin">Esai 64.3.</note> If a man had a deadly pestilence and of infallible infection, how easily might that man be avenged on his enemy with but breathing in his face?

            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:16264:64"/>Not to insist long on so certaine and obvious a truth. Farre easier wee know it is to destroy than to build up, there is no such art required in demolishing,<note place="margin">

               </note> as there is in erecting of an edifice, those things which are long and difficultly growing up, are suddenly extinguished. Since therfore God had power and wisedome to make the creature, no wonder if hee can most easily destroy him.</p>
            <p>Againe, Gods power is as it were set on by his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie and fury against sinners. Anger wee know is the whetstone of strength, in an equality of other termes it will make a man prevaile. Nothing is able to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fire which is once enrag'd. Now Gods displeasure is kindled, and breaketh forth into a flame against the sinnes of men, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.20. like a devouring Lion, or a bereaved Beare, like the implacable rage of a jealous man, so doth the fire of the Lords revenge breake forth upon the enemies of his Sonne.</p>

But if the paw of a Beare meet with so thinne a substance as the kall of a mans heart, how easily is it torne to pieces? Every action is then most speedily fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed when the subject on which it workes is thereunto prepared. Farre easier is it to make a print in wax than in Adamant, to kindle a fire in dry stubble, than in greene wood. Now wicked men have fitted themselves for wrath, and are the procurers, and artificers of their owne destruction. They are vessels,<note place="margin">Rom. 9 22. Esai. 3.9. Ier. 2.17. Ier. 4.18. Hos. 13.9.</note> and God is never without treasures of wrath, so that the confusion of a wicked man is but like the drawing of water out of a fountaine, or the filling of a bag out of a heape of treasure.</p>
            <p>Lastly, adde hereunto our destitutenesse of all helpe &amp; succor. Even fire amongst pitch might bee quenched, if a man could powre downe water in abundance upon it.

But the wicked shall have no strength either in or about them to prevent or remove the wrath to come. Here indeed they have some helpes (such as they are) to stand out against God in his word. Weatlh and greatnesse to bee the provisions of their lusts, the countenance of the wicked world to encourage them in their wayes; Satan and the wisedome of the flesh to furnish them with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and to cast a varnish upon uncleanesse: but when the lion comes the shepheard can doe the sheepe no good, when the fire comes the rotten post shall perish with the varnish which cover'd it.

            <p>There is a foolish disposition in the hearts of men to thinke that they shall ever continue in that estate which they are once in. The proud and wicked man hath said in his heart,<note place="margin">Psal. 10.6.11.</note>

Againe, every thing out of its owne place is out of order, but when things are all in their proper places and due proportions, then there results a beauty and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse from them. In a great house there are many ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, some of wood and brasse, others of gold and silver. some for honorable, others for base and sordid uses; Now if all these were confusedly together in one roome a man would conclude that things were out of order, but when the plate is in one place, the brasse and wood in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16264:67"/>
another, wee acknowledge a decency and cleanlinesse in such a house. Let a body bee of never so exact tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and delicate complexion, yet if any member therin bee misplaced, the eye in the roome of the eare, or the cheeke of the forehead, there can bee no beauty in such a body: So in the Church, till God set every one in his right place, the order thereof is but imperfect. Therefore when <hi>Iudas</hi> was put under Christs feete, hee is said to have gone <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, unto his owne place, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.25.</p>
            <p>Why then should any man murmure at the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of wicked men,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.25. Mal. 3.14, 15.</note> or conceive of Gods proceedings as if they were irregular and unequall, as if there were no profit for those who walke mournfully, but the proud, and wicked workers were set up? This is to revile the workman while hee is yet in the fitting of his worke. The pieces are not yet put together in their proper joints, and therefore no marvell if the evennesse and beauty of Gods workes bee not so plainly discovered. For every thing is <hi>beautifull in its time</hi>; what though the corne in the field hang downe the head, and the weeds seeme to flourish and overtop it; stay but till the harvest, and it will then appeare which was for the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and which for the fire. Goe into the Sanctuary of the Lord, and by faith looke unto the day of the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods righteous judgments, and it will appeare <hi>that the wayes of the Lord are right,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 14.9.</note> 
               <hi>though the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors stumble in them,</hi> or bee offended at them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from hence every man may learne how to bring beauty and order into himselfe, namely by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing those enemies of Christ, those lusts and evill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which dwell within him. Lawes wee know are the ligaments and sinewes of a state, the strings as it were which being touched and animated by skilfull governors doe yield that excellent harmonie which is to bee seen in well constituted common wealths; the more they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile so much the more unitie is preserved and faction
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16264:67"/>
abated, and community cherished in the mindes of men: Even so where the Scepter of Christ, the Law of the minde, the roiall Law of Liberty and grace doe more prevaile over the lusts of the heart, by so much the more excellent is the harmonie and complexion of such a soule.</p>
            <p>Now the last thing in this verse is,<note place="margin">Psal. 8.6.</note> 
               <hi>Scabellum pedibus tuis. A stoole under thy feete.</hi> Things are <hi>under Christs feete two manner of wayes:</hi> Either by way of subjection as <hi>Servants</hi> unto him, and so hee hath dominion over all the workes of Gods hands,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.21, 22.</note> and hath <hi>all things put under his feete.</hi> So the Apostle saith, that God hath set him at his owne right hand in heavenly places, farre above all principality, and power, and might, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and every name that is named, not onely in this world but also in that which is to come;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.22.</note> 
               <hi>And hath put all things under his feete,</hi> and gave him to bee the head over all things to the Church. Which <hi>S. Peter</hi> expresseth in a like manner: Hee is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God, <hi>Angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him:</hi> Or secondly, by <hi>way of victorie and insultation,</hi> and so all Christs <hi>enemies</hi> are put under his feete. Which is the most proper way. For the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ are indeed under the head. So wee finde that the sheepe of Christ are <hi>in his hands.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.28. Esai. 40.11. Esai. 63.1·3. Ioel 3.13, 14. Revel. 14.20.</note> 
               <hi>No man shall pluck them out of my hand.</hi> And the Lambes of Christ are in his <hi>armes, and bosome. Hee shall gather the Lambs with his arme, and carry them in his bosome.</hi> But the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Christ are <hi>under his feete</hi> to bee trampled upon, till their bloud bee squeezed out, and his garments stained with it. All the multiplied multitudes of the wicked in the world shall bee but as so many Clusters of ripe grapes to bee cast into the great winepresse of the wrath of God, and to bee troden by him who went forth on a white horse conquering and to conquer, till the bloud come out of the winepresse even unto the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16264:68"/>
horse bridles. And this is an usuall expression of a totall victory in holy Scripture, the laying of an adversary even with the ground, that hee may bee crushed and trampled upon. This was the curse of the Serpent that hee should crawle with his belly upon the dust of the earth,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.14. Luk. 10.19. Rom. 16.20. Psal. 68.23.</note> and that the seed of the woman should bruize his head. And it is the curse of Gods enemies, that they should lick the dust, and that the feete of the Church and the tongue of her dogs should bee dipped in the bloud of her enemies. Thus <hi>David</hi> put the people of <hi>Rabbah</hi> under harrowes; and <hi>Iehu</hi> trod <hi>Iezabel</hi> under his horses feete.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.31. 2 Kings 9.33. Lam. 1.15.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church chooseth that phrase to expresse the greatnesse of her calamity by. The Lord hath trodden under foote all my mighty men in the midst of mee; hee hath called an assembly against mee to crush my yong men. The Lord hath trodden the Virgin, the Daughter of Iuda as in a wine-presse.</p>
            <p>Now this putting of Christs enemies as a stoole un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, notes unto us in regard of Christ two things: First, his <hi>Rest</hi>; and secondly, his <hi>Triumph. To stand,</hi> in the Scripture Phrase (as I have before observed) denoteth <hi>Ministery,</hi> and to <hi>Sit, Rest</hi>; and there is no posture more easie than to sit with a stoole under ones feet. Till Christs enemies then be all under his feet, he is not fully in his Rest. It is true, in his owne person he is in Rest, he hath finished the worke which was given him to doe, and therefore is entred into his rest. Hee hath alreadie ascended up on high, and led captivity captive; yet in his members he still suffers, though not by way of <hi>paine</hi> or passion, yet by way of <hi>Sympathy</hi> or compassion, he is <hi>touched with a feeling of our infirmities, Heb.</hi> 4.15. As by the things which he suffered,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.8. Heb. 2.17, 18.</note> he <hi>learned obedience</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, so by the same sufferings hee learned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and thereupon mercy and fidelity towards his members; for no man can be more tenderly faithfull in the businesse of another, than he who by his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16264:68"/>
knoweth the consequence and necessity of it. And therefore he is said to be <hi>afflicted</hi> in all the <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of his people;<note place="margin">Esay. 63.9. Coloss. 1.24.</note> and the Apostle tels us that the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Saints fill up the remainders, or that which is behinde, of the sufferings of Christ; for as the Church is called the <hi>fulnesse of Christ,</hi> who yet of himselfe is so full, as that he filleth all in all (neither doth the Church serve to supply his defects, but to magnifie his mercy:) so the Churches sufferings are esteemed the fulnesse of the sufferings of Christ, although his were of themselves so full before, as that they had a <hi>consummatum est</hi> to seale up both their measure and their merit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our sufferings are called his, not by way of additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or improvement unto those, but by way of honour and dignitie unto us, they shew Christs compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and our union and conformitie to him, but no way either any defect of vertue in his, or any value of merit in ours, or any ecclesiasticall treasure, or redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie out of a mixture of both, very profitable they are for the edification of the Church, but very base and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for the expiation of sinne: very profitable for the comfort of men, but very unprofitable to the justice of God. So then, though Christ rest from suffering in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, yet not in his Saints; though the Serpent cannot come to the head, yet it is still bruizing of his heele. Here then the Apostles inference is good, there remaineth therefore rest unto the people of God, and that such a glorious rest as must arise out of the ruine of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when the wicked perish they shall see it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and shall wash their feet in the bloud of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. The revenge of God against his enemies is such, as shall bring an ease with it: <hi>Ah,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>I will ease me</hi> of mine adversaries,<note place="margin">Esay 65.13. Esay 66.5.</note> 
               <hi>I will avenge me</hi> of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Esay</hi> 1.24. This is the comfort which the Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his people, that they shall be full when their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies shall be hungry, and that he will appeare to their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16264:69"/>
joy, when their enemies shall be ashamed.</p>
            <p>This must teach wicked men to take heed of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the members of Christ, for they therein are profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed enemies to him whom yet they would seeme to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. This is certaine, that all the counsels and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are made against the subjects or lawes of Christs kingdome, are but <hi>vaine imaginations</hi> which shall never be executed; He will at last avenge the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell of his people, and in spight of all the power or malice of hell, make them to sit <hi>actually</hi> in heavenly places with him, whom he hath <hi>virtually</hi> and representatively car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thither alreadie. And it should comfort the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all their sufferings for Christs sake: Because here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are, first, <hi>Conformable</hi> unto him: Secondly, they are <hi>Associates</hi> with him: Thirdly, they are assured that they are in a way to rest: for, saith the Apostle, it is just with God to recompence tribulation to them that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1.6, 7.</note> and <hi>to you who are troubled rest, when the Lord Iesus shall be revealed from heaven.</hi> And inasmuch, saith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> as you are partakers of Christs sufferings, when his glory shall be revealed, <hi>ye shall be glad also with exceeding joy:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet 4.13.</note> And this joy shall be so much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because it shall grow out of the everlasting subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the enemie under Christs feet, and those whom here they persecuted and despised, shal there with Christ be their judges.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.2, 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, as it noteth the Rest, so likewise the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alex. ab Alex. Gen. dier. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Rosin. Antiq. Rom. l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 29.</note> when he shall set his feet on the necke of his enemies. The Apostle saith, that he <hi>triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in his Crosse, Coloss.</hi> 2.15. And there are two words which have an allusion unto the formes of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, <hi>Expoliation</hi> and <hi>Publication,</hi> or representation of the pompe unto the world of the faithfull. <hi>He spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led principalities and powers,</hi> that is, He tooke from them all their armour wherein they trusted, and <hi>divided the spoiles, Luke</hi> 11.22. The armour of Satan was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16264:69"/>
the hand-writing of the Law which was against us, or contrary unto us, so long as wee were under the full force and rigour of that, so long we were under the possession and tyranny of Satan; but when Christ nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that unto the Crosse, and tooke it out of the way, then all the other panoply of Satan was easily taken from him: he was then spoiled of all his weapons and provisions of lust, for the world, and therewithall the things which are in the world,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.14.</note> were unto us crucified in the Crosse of Christ; so that now by faith in him wee are able to overcome the world, to value it aright,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 5.4, 5.</note> to esteeme the promises thereof thinne and empty, and the threatnings thereof vaine and false;<note place="margin">Heb. 11.26.</note> the treasures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of baser than the very reproches of Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.18.</note> and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions thereof not worthy to bee compared with the glory which shall bee revealed in us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 17.</note> as being in their measure but light, and but momentary in their durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The power and wisdome of Satan was likewise in the Crosse of Christ most notably befooled and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; for when hee thought that hee had now swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up Christ, hee found a hooke under that bait, he found that which neither himselfe, nor any of his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could have suspected, that Christ crucified was indeed the wisdome of God, and the power of God, and that through death hee chose to destroy him who had the power of death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. Againe, he made a <hi>shew, or publike representation</hi> of this his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of these his spoiles openly unto the world. As the Crosse was his triumphall chariot, so was it likewise <hi>ferculum pompae,</hi> the pageant, as it were, and table of his spoiles, for though to a carnall eye there was nothing but ignominy and dishonour in it, yet to those that are called, there is an eye of faith given to see in the Crosse of Christ Hell disappointed, Satan confounded, his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome demolished, the earthly members of the old man crucified, affections and lusts abated, and captivity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16264:70"/>
led captive. And indeed what triumph of any the most glorious Conquerour was ever honoured with the opening of graves, the resurrection of the dead, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of enemies, the acclamation of mute and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate creatures, the darknesse of the Sunne, the trembling of the earth, the compassion of the rockes, the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, the admiration of the Angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but onely this triumph of Christ upon the Crosse? And if he did so triumph there, how much more at the right hand of the Majestie on high, where he is crowned with glory and honour; and at that great day, which is therefore called the Day of the Lord Iesus, because hee will therein consummate his triumph over all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when hee shall come with the attendance of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in a chariot of fire, with all the unbeleevers of the world bound before his Throne, and with the clamour, applause, and admiration of all the Saints.</p>
            <p>And this is a plentifull ground of comfort to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all their conflicts with Satan, sinne, temptations, or corruptions, they fight under his protection, and with his Spirit who hath himselfe already triumphed, who accounteth our temptations his, and his victories ours; who turned the sorest perplexities which the world shal ever see, into a doctrine of comfort unto his Disciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.25-28. When ever then we are assaulted with any heavie temptation to discomforts, feares, fainting, wearinesse, despaire, sinfull conformities or the like; let us not tosse over our owne store, nor depend upon any strength or principles of our owne, but looke onely by faith unto the victories of Christ, and to this great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which is here made unto him, as Head and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Church, by whom wee shall be able to doe all things, and though wee were surrounded with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to escape, as he did, thorow the midst of them all. Wee know the Cats <hi>unum magnum,</hi> in the fable, was more worth than the Foxes thousand shifts, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16264:70"/>
all the which he was caught at the last. Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies come against us in armies, with infinite methods and stratagems to circumvent us, this onely is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that we have <hi>unum magnum,</hi> one refuge which is above all the wisdome of the enemie, to climbe up unto the Crosse of Christ, and to commit the keeping of our soules unto him, out of whose hands no man can take them. When <hi>David</hi> went forth against <hi>Goliah,</hi> he did not grapple with him by his owne strength, but with his Sling and his stone at a distance overthrew him. It is not good to let Satan come too close unto the soule, to let in his temptations, or to enter into any private and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate combate with him (this was for our Captain one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doe, who we know entred into the field with him, as being certaine of his owne strength) but our onely way to prevaile against him, is to take faith as a sling, and Christ as a stone, he will undoubtedly finde out a place to enter in and to sinke the proudest enemie: we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set with enemies, yea, we are enemies unto our selves, the burden of the flesh, the assaults of the world, the firy darts of Satan, treason within, and warres without, swarmes of Midianites, troopes of Amalekites, the Sea before us, the Aegyptian behinde us, sinne before, Satan and the world behinde, either I must runne on and bee drowned in sinne, or I must stand still and be hewed in peeces with the persecutions of wicked men, or I must revolt and turne backe to Aegypt, and so be devoured in her plagues. In these extremities the Apostle hath given us our <hi>unum magnum, Looke unto Iesus,</hi> he that is the Author, will be the finisher of our faith:<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1, 2. Heb. 10.36, 37.</note> It is yet but a little while, he will come and will not tarry, he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the view of our faith, hee is within the crie of our prayers, hee <hi>sitteth at the right hand of power,</hi> nay, hee there <hi>standeth,</hi> and is risen up already in the quarrell of his Saints, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.56. The nearer the Aegyptian is to Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, the nearer he is to ruine, and the nearer Israel is to

There is no enemie so close, so dangerous, so unavoidable as our owne lusts. Now the Lord promiseth to deale with the sinnes of his people, as he did with the Aegyptians; wee know their tyranny he subdued with many plagues, their first-born, the strength and flower of the Land, he slew before, and those who afterwards joyned themselves against his people, he drowned in the bottome of the Sea; so saith the Prophet, <hi>He will subdue our iniquities,</hi> he will purge them away,<note place="margin">Mic. 7.19, 20.

            <p>Now lastly, this <hi>Foot-stoole</hi> under Christs feet, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his enemies, noteth unto us foure things: First, <hi>The extreme shame and confusion</hi> which they shall ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly suffer,<note place="margin">Esay. 2.11.</note> the utter abasing and bringing downe of all that exalteth it selfe against Christ.

               <hi>Valerian,</hi> that cruell persecutour of the Church, that he was trod under foot by <hi>Sapores</hi> the Persian King, and after stayed like a beast. It notes the extremest degree of revenge, which hath no mixture of mercy or compassion in it: So that by this we see the enemies of Christ and his kingdome shall be put to utter and everlasting shame: That as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in that great day of their redemption shall lift up their heads, and have boldnesse in the presence of the Lambe; so the wicked shall fall flat upon their faces, and cleave unto the dust; when the bookes shall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seal'd and the consciences of men opened, and the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses produced, and the secrets of uncleannesse reveal'd on the house-top, and the mouthes of the wicked, who here for a little while dispute against the waies of Christ, and cavill at his commands, shall be everlastingly stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, when men shall be like a deprehended theefe (as the Prophet speakes) then shall their faces be as a flame,<note place="margin">Ier. 2.26.

            <p>Secondly, hereby is noted the <hi>Burden</hi> which wicked men must beare: The foot-stoole beareth the weight of the body, so must the enemies of Christ beare the weight of his heavie and everlasting wrath upon their soules. Sin in the committing seemes very light, no bigger than the cloud which the Prophet shewed his servant, but at
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16264:72"/>
last it gathers into such a tempest, as, if the soule make not haste, it will be swept away, and overwhelmed by it: weighty bodies doe with much difference affect the sense according to the difference of places wherein they are. That vessell or peece of timber, which when it is on the water, may be easily drawne with the hand of man, on the land cannot be stirred with much greater strength: So is it with sin upon the conscience, in the time of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it, nothing more easie, but in the time of judging it, nothing more unsupportable. A wilde Asse in the time of her lusting traverseth her wayes with much pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulancie, and snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure, no man can turne her, but <hi>in her moneth,</hi> that is, when she is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with her foale,<note place="margin">Ier. 2.24.</note> shee then feeleth the event of her former lustfulnesse, and will easily be overtaken: so the wicked in sinne, however for the time they may beare it out with much mirth, and cheere up their hearts in the daies of their pleasure, yet when sin is come to the birth, and so fully finished, that it is now ready to bring forth death unto the soule, they shall then finde that it is but like the roll which the Prophet swallowed, sweet to the palat, but bitter in the belly, like a cup of deadly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, pleasant in the mouth, but torment in the bowels. On whomsoever the Sonne of man shall fall with the weight of his heavie displeasure hee will grinde him to powder.<note place="margin">Matth. 21.44.</note> That must needs bee a heavie burden which men would most joyfully exchange for the weight of rockes and mountaines to lye everlastingly upon their backes: And yet the wicked at that great day shall all in vaine begge of the mountaines and rockes to fall upon them,<note place="margin">Revel. 6.16.</note> and to hide them from the wrath of the Lambe, shall rather choose to live eternally under the weight of the heaviest creature in the world, than under the fury of him that sitteth upon the Throne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, herein likewise is noted the relation of a just and equall <hi>Recompence</hi> unto ungodly men. The Lord
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16264:72"/>
useth often to fit punishments to the quality and measure of the sinnes committed. Hee that on the earth denied a crumb of bread in hell was denied a drop of water.

Some principall of them we finde in this place; A <hi>throne,</hi> a <hi>scepter, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, armies</hi> for the right dispensing of his sacred power. We will first consider the words, and then raise such observations as shall offer themselves.</p>
            <p>First, what is meant by the <hi>Rod of Christs Strength,</hi> or his <hi>Strong Rod?</hi> It notes a thing which a man may leane upon, or lay the whole weight of his body on in his wearinesse.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Insigne majesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis regiae. Hieron.</hi>
               </note> But being spoken of Christs kingdome wee take it for a scepter or rod of majestie. I will not hold you with the variety of acceptions in Expositors. Some take it for the branch that groweth out of that roote of <hi>Iesse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> Some for the wood of the crosse. Some for the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16264:76"/>
body of Christ borne of a Virgin. Some, for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christs power,<note place="margin">Euthymius.</note> taking the signe for the thing signified. Some for the power of his mightie workes and preaching. That of the body, and of the crosse of Christ, except by them wee understand the vertue of Christ crucified, I conceive to be not so pertinent to the purpose of the Prophet. The rest agree in one. But for the more distinct understanding of the words wee may consider out of the holy Scriptures what things were <hi>sent out of Sion.</hi> And we finde there <hi>two things:</hi> First, <hi>the word of the Lord,</hi> or his holy Gospell. <hi>The Law shall proceed out of Sion, and the word of the Lord from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, Mic.</hi> 4.2. Secondly, <hi>the spirit of the Lord,</hi> which was first <hi>sent unto Sion:</hi> for at Hierusalem the Apostles were to wait for the promise of the Father, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4. and <hi>from thence was shed abroad into</hi> the world upon al flesh, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17. and <hi>both these are the power or strength of Christ.</hi> His word, a <hi>Gospell of power</hi> unto salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.10.4. and his spirit <hi>a spirit of power,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. which is therefore called the finger and the arme of the Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Esai.</hi> 53.1. so by the Rod is meant the Gospell and the Spirit of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what is meant by <hi>Gods sending this Rod of Christs strength?</hi> It notes, the <hi>manifestation</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, we knew it not before it was sent. The <hi>donation</hi> of the Gospell, we had it not before it was sent; the <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Gospell,</hi> we were without God in the world, and strangers from the Covenant of promise, before it was sent. The <hi>Commission</hi> of the Dispensers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, they have their patent from heaven, they are not to speake untill they be sent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what is meant by sending it <hi>out of Sion?</hi> It is put in <hi>Opposition to mount Sina,</hi> from whence the Law was sometimes sent with thunders and fire, and much terrour unto the people of Israel. <hi>Ye are not come,</hi> saith
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16264:77"/>
the Apostle, <hi>unto the mount that burned with fire, nor unto blacknesse and darknesse, and tempest, &amp;c. but yee are come unto mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly Ierusalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels, and to Iesus the Mediator of the new Covenant, &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 12.18.24. and the Apostle elsewhere sheweth us the meaning of this Allegoricall opposition betweene <hi>Sina</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> betweene <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> namely the two covenants of the Law and of Grace, or of bondage and liberty, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24, 25. <hi>Sion</hi> was the place whither the tribes resorted to worship the Lord, the place towards which that people praied, the place of Gods mercifull residence amongst them, the beauty of holines, the place upon which first the gift of the holy Ghost was powred forth, and in which the Gospell was first of all preached after Christs Ascension. We may take it by a <hi>Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche</hi> for the whole Church of the Jewes, unto whom the Lord first revealed his Covenant of Grace in Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule Thou</hi>] that is, <hi>Thou shalt rule,</hi> which is a usuall forme to put the Imperative for the future Indicative. It is not a command, which hath relation unto any service: but it is a promise, a commission, a dignity conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the midst of thine enemies.</hi>] Some understand it of changing the hearts of his enemies,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Qui alieni erant, tui esse incipient. Dignare esse Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus inimicoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tuorum. Hieron.</hi>
               </note> and converting them as captives unto his obedience. Other understand the wonderfull effect of the power of Christs kingdome, that he can by his Word and Spirit hold up his Church in despight of all the enemies thereof round about. The Church ever was and will be pester'd with divers kindes of adversaries, heretikes and hypocrites, and false bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with profanenesse, temptations, persecutions, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wickednesses; and in the midst of all these the Church of Christ groweth as a Lily amongst the thornes. Now this <hi>In medio,</hi> noteth two things; <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16264:77"/>
plenum,</hi> and <hi>dominium securum, A perfect and full governement,</hi> without mutilation, without impediment, the Church being amongst the wicked as a rocke in the midst of the sea, or as a garrison in an enemies towne. <hi>Media dominantur in urbe,</hi> is an expression of such a rule as can no way be hindered or removed. <hi>The Church of God is a burdensome stone,</hi> they who goe about to remove it out of that place where Christ will plant it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth should gather together against it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.3. <hi>A secure and confident governement,</hi> so in the Scripture phrase, <hi>In the midst</hi> notes <hi>confidence and security.</hi> When the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet asked the Shunamite, would'st thou be spoken for to the king, or to the Captaine of the host? she answered, <hi>I dwell amongst mine owne people,</hi> that is, I am safe and have enough already, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.13. When they of the Synagogue would have cast Christ downe head-long from the brow of a hill, it is said, that he <hi>passed through the midst of them and went his way,</hi> that is, with much confidence, safety, and assurance he withdrew himselfe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.29, 30. As the Prophet was full of security and quietnesse in the midst of the Syrian siege, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.14-16.</p>
            <p>The words being thus unfolded, wee may observe in them <hi>Three of Christs principall Regalities, Sceptrum, Solium,</hi> and <hi>Imperium.</hi> The Scepter, the Throne, and the Power or governement of his kingdome. His Scepter is the Word of his Gospell animated by the Power of his holy Spirit, and accompanied with the blessing and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God the Father, who sendeth it abroad into the world. His Throne, from whence this his Scepter is extended, Sion, the Church of the Jewes; His victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, plenarie, and secure governement, <hi>Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, the <hi>Scepter</hi> here is the <hi>Gospell</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ. Christ is a <hi>Shepheard</hi> towards his Flocke the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16264:78"/>
Church, <hi>Esai.</hi> 40.11. <hi>A great Shepheard, Heb.</hi> 13.20. that notes his <hi>Power and Majesty</hi> over them: and a <hi>good Shepheard, Ioh.</hi> 10.14. that notes his care and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towards his Sheepe. Kings in the Scripture are called <hi>Shepheards</hi> to lead and to feed, and to govern the people. So <hi>David</hi> is said to have beene taken from the sheepfolds, <hi>to feed Iacob and Israel, Psal.</hi> 78.71. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.2. and thus <hi>Christ is a Shepheard and a King. I will set up one Shepheard over them,</hi> and he shall feede them, <hi>Even my servant David</hi>— I the Lord will be their God, <hi>and my servant David a Prince among them, Ezek.</hi> 34.23, 24. Prophets &amp; Teachers are in the Scripture likewise called <hi>Shepherds, Ier.</hi> 23.1, 4. and so <hi>Christ is a Shepheard and a Bishop.</hi> Ye were as sheepe going astray, but now ye are returned <hi>unto the Shepheard and Bishop of your soules,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. And therefore wee finde in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that Christ hath <hi>two pastorall staves,</hi> to note his great care and double office in his Church. <hi>The Lord is my Shepheard, I shall not want - I will feare no evill, for thou art with me, thy Rod and thy Staffe they comfort me, Psal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>I tooke unto me two staves, the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands, and I fed the flocke, Zech.</hi> 11.7. So then the <hi>Rod of Christs strength</hi> or his strong staffe doth in these severall relations note unto us <hi>three things:</hi> As it is a <hi>staffe of strength,</hi> so it notes the <hi>power</hi> of Christ. As it is the <hi>Scepter of a King,</hi> so it notes the <hi>majestie</hi> of Christ. As it is <hi>the staffe of a Bishop</hi> or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, so it notes the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>superintendencie</hi> of Christ over his Church. So then this first particular of the Rod of Christs kingdome affoords unto us three observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: First, that Christ in his Gospell and Spirit is full of power and strength towards the Church. Secondly, that Christ in his Gospell and Spirit is full of Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty towards his Church. Thirdly, that Christ in his Gospell and Spirit is full of care and of tendernesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:16264:78"/>First, <hi>the words of the Gospell with the spirit is full of power and strength.</hi> No man will denie that Christ in his owne person is full of power. And as the power of a Prince is principally seene in his lawes, edicts, pardons, and gratious patents: so is the power of Christ won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully magnified towards the Church in his Gospell, which unto us is both a Covenant of mercy, and a Law of obedience. We may observe how Christ is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleased to honor his Gospell with his owne titles and attributes. And therefore the Apostle speakes of him and his word, as of one and the same thing.<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>The word of God is quicke and powerfull</hi>— a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, neither is there any Creature which is not manifest <hi>in his sight,</hi> but all things are naked and open <hi>unto the eyes of him with whom we have to doe.</hi> That which is the word in one verse is Christ himselfe in another, which hath given occasion to some learned men (without any constraining reason (as I conceive) to take the Word there for the essentiall Word of God, or the person of Christ himselfe, to whom I thinke that appellation is not given by any of the sacred Writers, but onely by his beloved Disciple Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> We know that Christ was crucified at Jerusalem, and yet the Apostle saith, that he was crucified amongst the <hi>Galatians.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, in that he died <hi>he died but once unto sin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.1.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> could not doe that himselfe, which he curseth others for doing, Crucifie againe the Lord of Glory. So then at Jerusalem he was crucified in his person, and at Galatia in the ministery of his Word. One and the same cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying was as lively set forth in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, as it was really acted upon Christs person: for Christ is as really present to his Church now in the spirituall dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of his ordinances, as hee was corporally present with the Jewes in the dayes of his flesh. And therefore I say it is that we finde the same attributes given to both. <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.24.</note>

               <hi>Gospell of Christ a Salvation</hi> too; wee know, saith Christ to the woman of Samaria, what we worship, <hi>for salvation is of the Iewes.</hi> The force of the reason leads us to understand by Salvation the Oracles of God which were committed unto that people, for out of them only it is that we know what and how to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and this is not unusuall in holy Scriptures. <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 2.2, 3. 2 Cor. 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>If the Word,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>spoken by Angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward: How shall we escape if we neglect so great Salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, &amp;c?</hi> Where we finde Salvation set in opposition to the Word spoken by Angels, which was the Law of God, or the ministerie of condemnation, and therefore it must needes signifie the Gospell of Christ. <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 18.28.</note> 
               <hi>Be it knowne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you,</hi> saith the Apostle to the unbeleeving Iewes, <hi>that the salvation of God,</hi> that is, the Gospell of God (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth plainely by the like paralell speech in <note n="p" place="margin">Act. 13.46.</note> another place) <hi>is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will heare it.</hi> So the Apostle saith that <note n="q" place="margin">Iam. 1.21.</note> 
               <hi>the engraffed Word is able to save the soules of men.</hi> All which and many other the like particulars note unto us, That as Christ is the Power and Image of his Father, so the Gospell is in some sort of Christ: For which reason the Apostle, as I conceive, calleth the <hi>Gospel</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note> 
               <hi>the Face of Iesus Christ: God who commanded the light to shine out of darkenesse, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of

Christ is not pleased any other wayes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to exercise his power, or to reveale his glory, but in these ordinances of his which wee dispense. Therefore hee walketh in his Church with a <note n="a" place="margin">Revel. 1.16.</note> 
               <hi>sword is his mouth,</hi> and with a <note n="b" place="margin">Esai. 11.4.</note> 
               <hi>Rod in his mouth,</hi> to note that hee giveth no greater testification of his strength than in the Ministery of his Gospell; which is therefore sometimes called a <note n="c" place="margin">Eph 6.17.</note>

            <p>To consider this point a little more distinctly. This Power of the Gospell of Christ appeares in both those regards, as it is a savor of life unto life, and as it is a savor of death unto death. Towards his Church who shall bee saved, and towards his enemies who shall perish. Many wayes is the Gospell of Christ and his Spirit a Rod of strength unto his Church.</p>

And therefore that which pulleth a man from under the paw of such a Lion, and forceth him away from his owne palace, must needs bee much stronger than hee.<note place="margin">Eph. 6.12.17.</note> And therefore the Apostle commendeth the power of the word by this argument that it is a sword fit to overcome principalities and powers and rulers of the darknesse of this world, and spirituall wickednesses in heavenly places. Againe, the old Man in our nature is a strong man too, a Raigning King, which setteth himselfe mightily against

Now in the dispensation of the word by the ministery of a weake man Christ stilleth the raging of this Sea, quels the lusts, correcteth the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely when this is done the soule cannot but stand amazed at its owne recovery, and admire that wonderfull and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible power which could so suddenly rebuke such raging affections and reduce them unto calmenesse and beauty againe. <hi>What ailed thee O thou Sea, that thou fleddest, and thou Iordan that thou wert driven back?</hi>

that yee skipped like Rams, and yee little hils like Lambes?</hi> It is an expression of Gods power towards his people in their triumphall entrance into the Land of Canaan. Wee may apply it to the conquest and possession which the word takes of the soules of men. What ailed a man that hee was driven back from his owne channell, and made suddenly to forget his wonted course? what ailed those strong and mountainous lusts, which were as immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly setled upon the soule as a hill upon his base, to fly away at the voice of a man like a frighted sheepe? what ailed those smaller corruptions and intemperancies, which haply had before lost their names, and were rather customes, and infirmities, than sinnes, to flie away like lambes from the word of Christ? A man went into the Church with a full tide and streame of lusts, every thicket in his heart, every reasoning and imagination of his soule did before shelter whole flocks of evill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: when hee came out the tide was driven back, the streame turned, the center of his heart altered, his forrest discovered, his lusts scattered and subdued. What ailes this man? Hee hath but heard an houres discourse, the same which others heare and their tide riseth the higher by it. Certainly these Devils were not cast out,<note place="margin">Act. 17.32, 34.</note> these streames were not turned back but by the finger of God himselfe. When the minister of Christ shall whisper in the ears of a dead man, whom no thunder could have awakened, and hee shall immediatly rise up and give glory to God, when Christ shall call men to denie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to get above themselves, to hate Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Wife and Children, and their owne life, to sell all that they have, to crucifie, and be cruell to their owne members, to pull out their right eyes, to cut off their right hands, to part from those sinnes which before they esteemed their choicest ornaments, and from those too which before they made their chiefest support and subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence; to stand at defiance with the allurements or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16264:81"/>
of the world, to bee set up for signes and wonders, for very proverbs of skorne, and objects of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to those of their owne house; to receive persecutions as rewards, and entertaine them not with patience onely but with thankfulnesse and rejoicing; to bee all their life long in the midst of enemies, put to tedious conflicts with the powers of the world and of darknesse; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve things which they have not seen, and to hope for things which they doe not know; and yet maugre all this to refuse to consult with flesh and bloud, to stand still more in awe of Gods word, than of any other thing: certainly that which with the voice of a weake man bringeth such great things to passe, must needs bee <hi>Virga virtutis, a Rod of strength.</hi> A Rod like the Rod of <hi>Moses</hi> which can lead us through such seas as these, to one whom wee have never seen nor knowen before, <hi>Esai.</hi> 55.5.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Gospell of Christ is a <hi>Rod of strength</hi> in the <hi>justification of men,</hi> as it is <hi>Sceptrum Iustitiae,</hi> a <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 1.8.</note> Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Righteousnesse, a <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> word of reconciliation, <note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 1.13.</note> a Gospell of salvation, <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 8.2, 3.</note> a Law of the Spirit of life, <note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 3.6.8.9.</note> a ministration of the Spirit, of life, and of Righteousnesse, an <note n="f" place="margin">Esai. 61.1.</note> opening of prisons and a proclaiming of liberty unto captives, in these respects likewise it is full of power. There was a mighty power in the Law of God typified in those thundrings and terrors with which it was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred upon mount <hi>Sina</hi>; the Apostle calleth it a <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 3.24.</note> 
               <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master</hi> to scourge and drive us unto Christ, and the Psalmist an <note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 2.9.</note> 
               <hi>iron Rod</hi> able to breake in pieces all the potsherds of the earth. And we know boies in a Schoole doe not apprehend so much terror in the King as in their Master. Yet in comparison of the Power of the Gospell, the Law it selfe was very <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8.3. Heb. 7.18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>weake and unprofitable,</hi> able to make nothing perfect. The Power of the Law was onely to destruction, the Power of the Gospell for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The Law could onely hold under him that was
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16264:81"/>
downe before, it could never raise him up againe. Now the power is farre greater to raise than to kill, to forgive sinnes, than to bind them. Herein is the mighty <note n="k" place="margin">Exod. 34.5, 6, 7. Mich. 7.18, 19. Matth. 9.6.</note> 
               <hi>strength of Gods mercy seen that it can passe by iniquities, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions and sinnes.</hi> To <note n="l" place="margin">Matth. 28.18, 19.</note> preach the Gospell of Christ in his name and authority is an evident argument of that plenary power which is given unto him both in heaven and earth. And the very dispensing of this word of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation which is committed unto the Ministers of the Gospell (how basely soever the ungratefull world may esteeme of them) hath honored them with a title of as great power as a man is capable of,<note place="margin">Obad. v. 21. Ioh 20.23. 1 Tim 4.16. Iam. 5.20.</note> to bee called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viors,</hi> to have the custodie of the keyes of heaven, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterially and instrumentally under Christ and his Spirit <hi>to save the soules,</hi> and <hi>to cover the sinnes of men.</hi> Now then that word which from the mouth of a weake man is able to reconcile a child of wrath unto God, and by the words of one houre to cover and wipe out the sinnes of many yeares, which were scattered as thick in the soules of men as the starres in the firmament, must needs bee <hi>virga virtutis, a Rod of strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Gospell of Christ is a <hi>Rod of strength in the sanctification of men,</hi> as it is <hi>Sceptrum cum unctione,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 17.17. Esai. 54.13. Gal 4.19. 2 Cor. 3.2.</note> a Scepter which hath ever an unction accompanying it. As it is a Sanctifying Truth, an heavenly teaching, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ in the soule, a making of the heart as it were his Epistle by writing the Law therein, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing the power and image of Christ in the conscience. If a man should touch a marble or adamant stone with a seale, and taking it off should see the print of it left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, hee could not but conceive some wonderfull and secret vertue to have wrought so strange an effect. Now our hearts are of themselves as hard as the nether mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone; when then a holy word, so meekly and gently laid on upon them, shall leave there an impression of its own puritie, when so small a thing as a graine of mustard-seed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16264:82"/>
shall transforme an earthy soule into its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when the eyes and hands, and mouth of Christ being in the ministerie of his word spread upon the eyes and hands and mouth of a Childe shall revive the same from death, when by looking into a glasse wee shall not onely have a view of our owne faces, but shall see them changed into the image of another face which from thence shineth upon us, how can wee but conclude that certainly that word by which such wonders as these are effected is indeed <hi>virga virtutis, a Rod of strength?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Gospell of Christ is <hi>a Rod of strength,</hi> in the <hi>Perservation and Perseverance of the Saints,</hi> as it is <hi>Virga germinans,</hi> a Rod like <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, which blosso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and the blossomes perished not, but remained in the Ark for a Testimony of Gods power. For as those buds, or the <hi>Manna</hi> in the <hi>Ark</hi> did not perish, so neither doth the word of the Gospell in the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The Apostle saith, that wee are <hi>kept by the power of God unto salvation.</hi> and <hi>S. Iude</hi> that <hi>Gods power keepeth the Saints from falling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.5. Iud. v.24.</note> 
               <hi>and presenteth them faultlesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the presence of his glory</hi>; and what is this power of God whereby hee doth it, but the Gospell of Christ, which <hi>S. Peter</hi> calleth <hi>semen incorruptibile,</hi> uncorruptible seed;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.24. 1 Ioh. 3.9.</note> and the Spirit of Christ, which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> calleth <hi>semen manens,</hi> an abiding seed? If I should see a tree with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall fruit, without any variation from the difference of seasons, a tree like that in <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Paradise which every moneth did bring forth fruite of twelve severall kindes, I should conclude that it had an extraordinary vitall power in it: so when I finde Christ in his word promising, and by the planting and watering of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers in the vineyard, making good that promise unto his Church; That every branch bringing forth fruit in him, shall not onely bee as <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, have his fruit preserved upon him, but <hi>shall bring forth more fruit</hi> and shall have <hi>life more abundantly</hi>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16264:82"/>
that that word which is the Instrument of so unperish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a condition, is indeed <hi>Virga virtutis</hi> a Rod of strength, a Rod cut out of the tree of life it selfe?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the Gospell of Christ is a <hi>Rod of strength in comforting and supporting of the faithfull,</hi> as it is <hi>Virga pulchritudinis &amp; colligationis,</hi> a Rod of Beauty and of Binding, as it is a word which doth binde that which was broken, and give unto them which mourne in <hi>Sion</hi> beauty for ashes,<note place="margin">Esai. 61.1.3.</note> and the garment of praise for the Spirit of heavinesse: as it quencheth all the firie darts, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth all the bloudy reasonings of Satan against the soule, as it is a staffe which giveth <hi>comfort, and subsistence in the very vallie of the shadow of death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 23.4.</note> The <hi>shadow of death</hi> is an usuall expressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Scripture for all feares, terrors, affrightments, or any dreadfull calamities either of soule or body. The whole misery of our naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is thereby signified, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.79. Many wayes doth the Prophet <hi>David</hi> set forth the extremities hee had been driven unto, my bones are vexed, and dried like a potsheard, and turned into the drought of summer; my couch swimmeth with teares, mine eye is consumed and waxen old with griefe. I am powred out like water, all my bones are out of joint, my heart is like melted wax in the mids of my bowels. Thine arrowes stick fast in mee, thine hand presseth me sore, there is no soundnesse in my flesh, my wounds stinke and are corrupt, I am feeble and fore broken, I have roared by reason of the disquietnesse of my heart. Innumerable evils compasse mee about, I am not able to looke up. Fearfulnesse and trembling are come upon me and horror hath overwhelmed mee. My soule is among lions, I lie amongst them that are set on fire. The waters are come in unto my soule. I sinke in deepe mire; the flouds overflow mee, &amp;c. These all, and the like are comprehended in that one word, <hi>The shadow of death.</hi> And in that, it was onely the word, and the Spirit of God which did support him;<note place="margin">Psal. 119.50.92.</note> 
               <hi>This is my comfort
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16264:83"/>
in my affliction,</hi> saith hee, <hi>for thy word hath quickned mee.</hi> When my afflictions had brought me to the very brinke and darknesse of the grave, thy word revived mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and made me flourish. <hi>Vnlesse thy Law had been my delights, I should have perished in mine affliction.</hi> Now then when I see a man upon whom so many heavie pressures doe meete, the weight of sinne, the weight of Gods heavie displeasure, the weight of a wounded Spirit, the weight of a decaied body, the weight of skorne and temptations from Satan and the world, in the mids of all this not to turne unto lying vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not to consult with flesh and bloud, nor to rely on the wisedome or helpe of man,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 32.8.</note> but <hi>to leane onely on this word,</hi> to trust in it at all times, and to cast all his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations upon it, to make it his onely Rod and staffe to comfort him in such sore extremities, how can I but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that this word is indeed <hi>Virga virtutis,</hi> a Rod of strength?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Math. 4.4. 1 Tim. 4.5.</note>Lastly, the Gospell of Christ is a <hi>Rod of strength</hi> in <hi>sanctifying</hi> and blessing of <hi>our Temporall things.</hi> As it is <hi>Baculus Panis,</hi> A staffe of bread; <hi>Man liveth not by bread alone, but by the word which proceedeth out of Gods mouth,</hi> not by the creature, but by the blessing which prepareth the creature for our use.

For all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God are by sinne mischievously converted into the instruments and provisions of lust.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.14. 1 Ioh. 2.16.</note> The Sunne, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16264:83"/>
all the glorious lights of nature but instruments to serve the pride, covetousnesse, adultery, vanity of a lustfull eye. All the delicacies which the earth, aire or Sea can affoord but materials to feed the luxurie and intemperance of a lustfull body. All the honors and promotions of the world but fuell to satisfie the haughtinesse and ambition of a lustfull heart. That word then which can fetch out this leprosie from the creatures, and put life, strength, and comfort into them againe must needs bee <hi>Virga vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis, a Rod of strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Gospell and Spirit of Christ is a rod of strength, in regard of his and his Churches enemies. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to repell, and to revenge all their injuries; to disappoint the ends and machinations of Satan, to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and get above the persecutions of men, to get a treasure which no malice nor fury of the enemy can take away, a noblenesse of minde which no insultation of the adversary can abate, a security of condition, and calmenesse of spirit, where no worldly tempests can any more extinguish than the darknesse of a cloud, or the boisterousnesse of a wind can blot out the lustre, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe the order of celestiall bodies; a heavenly wisdome able to prevaile against the gates of hell, and to stop the mouthes of every gain-sayer.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.6. Ier. 1.8, 9. Ier. 6.27. Ezek. 3.8, 9. Mat. 21.44.</note> The Word hath ever a <hi>Readinesse to revenge disobedience,</hi> as the Apostle speaks; it hardens the faces of men, and armes them, that they may breake all those who fall upon them.</p>
            <p>This power of the Word towards wicked men, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it selfe in many particulars: First, in a mighty worke <hi>of Conviction.</hi> The Spirit was therefore sent into the world to convince it by the ministery of the Gospell, which one word containeth the ground of the whole strength here spoken of; for all, which the word bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to passe, it doth it by the conviction of the Spirit. This <hi>Conviction is two-fold:</hi> A <hi>Conviction unto conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> whereby the hearts of men are wonderfully over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:16264:84"/>
ruled by that invincible evidence of the Spirit of truth, to feele &amp; acknowledge their wofull condition by reason of sinne, so long as they continue in unbeleefe, to take unto themselves the just shame and confusion of face which belongs unto them, to give unto God the glory of his righteous and just severity if hee should destroy them, and hereupon to be secondly by the terror of the Lord perswaded to count worthy of all acceptation any deliverance out of that estate which shall be tendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: To admire, adore, and greedily embrace any termes of peace and reconciliation which shall be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them. To submit unto the righteousnesse, and with all willing and meeke affection to bend the heart to the Scepter of Christ, and to whatsoever forme of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and spirituall government he shall please to erect therein. And this magnifies the strength of this Rod of Christs Kingdome, that it maketh men yeeld upon any termes: when we see the little stone grow into a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie mountaine, and eat into all the Kingdomes of the world; when wee see Emperours and Princes submit their necks and scepters to a doctrine at first every where spoken against, and that upon the words of a few despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16264:84"/>
able to stop the mouths, and to answer the objections of all gain sayers? Of this point I have spoken more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously upon another Scripture. Secondly, there is a <hi>Conviction unto condemnation</hi> of those who stand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this saving power of the Gospell and Spirit of grace, driving them from all their strong holds, and constraining them perforce to acknowledge the truth which they doe not love.<note place="margin">Matth. 22.46.</note> Thus wee finde our Saviour disputing with the Jewes, till no man was able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer him a word; and as he did so himselfe, so hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised that his messengers should doe so too, <hi>I will give you a mouth and wisdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 21.15.</note> 
               <hi>which all your adversaries shall not be able to gain-say, nor resist:</hi> And this promise wee finde made good;<note place="margin">Act 6.10.</note> the enemies of <hi>Steven</hi> were not able to resist the Spirit by which hee spake:<note place="margin">Act. 18.28.</note> And <hi>Apollos</hi> mightily convinced the Jews, shewing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ: And this the Apostle numbreth amongst the qualifications of a Bishop, that he should be able by sound doctrine <hi>to convince the gain-sayers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1.9, 11.</note> 
               <hi>and to stop the mouthes of those unruly deceivers,</hi> whose businesse it is to subvert men, for this is the excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Gods Word, that it <hi>concludeth or shutteth men in,</hi>

               <hi>commonnesse</hi> had taken away the <hi>illnesse,</hi> &amp; that which committed by one would have been a sin, being imitated after a multitude were but a fashion. To conclude this particular: The Apostle is peremptory, <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Esay 41.21.</note> 
               <hi>Neither forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, nor idolaters, nor effeminate, nor covetous, nor theeves, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdome of God:</hi> and the consciences of many men, who yet will never yeeld to the conclusion, cannot choose but subsume, as the Apostle goes on, <hi>such are some of we,</hi> nay, and such we will be too. But now if we should bespeake these men in the word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Produce your cause, saith the Lord, bring forth your strong reasons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 28.17.</note> 
               <hi>saith the King of Iacob,</hi> they should finde at the last their reasons to be like themselves, vanity and lighter than nothing, that the Word of the Lord will at last prevaile, and sweepe away all their refuge of lyes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the power of the Word towards wicked men is seene in <hi>Affrighting of them</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.16.</note> there is a spirit of bondage, and a savour of death, aswell as a spirit of life and libertie which goeth along with the Word. Guilt is an inseparable consequent of sinne, and feare of the manifestation of guilt: If the heart be once convinced of this, it will presently faint and tremble, even at the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a leafe, at the wagging of a mans owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; how much more at the voice of the Lord, which shaketh mountaines,<note place="margin">Levit. 26.36.</note> and maketh the strong foundations of the earth to tremble? If I should see a prisoner at the barre passe sentence upon his Judge; and the Judge thereupon surpriz'd with trembling, and forced to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe and acknowledge the doome, I could not but stand amaz'd at so inverted a proceeding; yet in the Scripture wee finde presidents for it, <hi>Micatah,</hi> a prisoner, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing death unto <hi>Ahab,</hi> a King: <hi>Ieremie,</hi> a prisoner, pronouncing captivitie unto <hi>Zedekiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 22.27, 28. Ier. 37.16, 17. Act. 24.25.</note> a King: <hi>Paul</hi> in his chain preaching of judgment unto <hi>Felix</hi> in his robes, and making his owne Judge to tremble. It is not for
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16264:86"/>
want of strength in the Word, or because there is stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the hearts of men to stand out against it, that all the wicked of the world do not tremble at it, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their ignorance of the power &amp; evidence thereof. The Devils are stronger and more stubborne creatures than any man can be, yet because of their full illumination, and that invincible conviction of their consciences from the power of the Word, they beleeve and tremble at it. Though men were as hard as rocks,<note place="margin">Iames 2.19. Ier. 23.29. Ier. 5.14. Ezek. 2.6. Deut. 33.2. Ier. 1.10. Psal. 91.13.</note> the Word is a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer which can breake them; though as sharp as thornes and briars, the Word is a fire which can devour and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, though as strong as kingdomes and nations, the Word is able to root them up, and to pull them downe, though as fierce as Dragons and Lions, the Word is able to trample upon them, and to chaine them up.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the power of the Word is seene towards wicked men, in that it doth <hi>judge them. Sonne of man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 22.2.</note> 
               <hi>wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloudy Citie, saith the Lord? yea, thou shalt shew them their abominations.</hi> To note that when wicked men are made to see their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the Word, they have therby the wrath of God, as it were seal'd upon them. <hi>He that rejecteth mee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 12.48.</note> 
               <hi>the Word which I have spoken the same shall judge him at the last day,</hi> saith our Saviour: And if all prophecie, saith the Apostle, and there come in one that beleeveth not, or one unlearned, <hi>he is convinced of all, hee is judged of all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.24.</note> and the secrets of his heart are made manifest. Nay, the Word doth in some sort execute death and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon wicked men. Therefore it is said that the Lord would <hi>smite the earth with the rod of his mouth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 11.8.</note> 
               <hi>and with the breath of his lips would slay the wicked:</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>I have hewed them by the Prophets, I have slaine them by the words of my mouth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 6.5.</note> And therefore the Word of the Lord is called fury by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Ier. 6.11.</note> to note that when wrath &amp; fury is powred out upon a land, they are the effects of Gods Word. If a pestilence devoure a city,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16264:87"/>
and a sword come and gleane after it, it is the Word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which flayes, they are but the instruments, which are as it were actuated and applied by the Word of God to their severall services. Therefore it is that the Prophet saith,<note place="margin">Mich. 6.9.</note> that wise men <hi>see the voice of God, and heare his rod.</hi> A rod is properly to be seene, and a voice to bee heard, but here is a transposition, and as it were, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of properties betweene the Word of God, and his punishments, to note that towards wicked men there is a judging, and tormenting vertue in the Word; <hi>For judgement,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>am I come into this world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 9.39.</note> 
               <hi>that they which see not might see, and that they which see might be made blinde.</hi> If it be here objected that Christ saith of himselfe, <hi>The Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 9.56</note> 
               <hi>but to save them, and that he came not to condemne the world, but that the world through him might bee saved</hi>; I answer, that there are two events of Christs comming, and by consequence of his Gospell. The one <hi>principall,</hi> and by him intended, the other <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall and occasionall,</hi> growing out of the ill disposition of the subject unto whom he was sent. The maine and essentiall businesse of the Gospell is to declare salvation, and to set open unto men a doore of escape from the wrath to come; but when men wilfully stand out, and neglect so great salvation, then secondarily doth Christ prove unto those men a stone of offence, and the Gospell a savour of death unto death, as that potion which was intended for a cure by the Physitian, may upon occasion of the indisposednesse of the body, and stubborne radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the disease, hasten a mans end sooner than the disease it selfe would have done: So that to the wicked the Word of God is a two-edged sword indeed, an edge in the Law, and an edge in the Gospell, they are on every side beset with condemnation, if they goe to the Law, that cannot save them, because they have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, if they goe to the Gospell, that will not save
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16264:87"/>
them, because they have contemned it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the power of the Word towards wicked men is seene in this, that it doth <hi>ripen their sins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 15.22.</note> and make them so much the more sinfull, and so much the sooner fill up their measure. <hi>If I had not come,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>and spoken unto them, they had had no sinne, but now they have no cloke for their sinne.</hi> A tree which is fastned unto a wall, in which the heat of the Sunne is more permanent and united, will bring forth ripe fruit before the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry season<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so a people upon whom the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell hath constantly shined,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.8.</note> and which doth often drinke in the raine which falleth upon it, must needs bring forth <hi>Summer-fruit,</hi> sinnes speedily ripe,<note place="margin">Amos 8.1. Luke 13 8, 9.</note> and therefore be so much the neerer unto cursing. There is but a yeare betweene such a tree and the fire: we shall never finde that the sinnes of Israel, and of Juda (for which they were at any time plagued with captivitie) were so long in ripening as the sinnes of the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, upon whom there did no light shine. The Land had rest sometimes fortie yeeres, and sometimes foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score yeeres, but we never finde that they were suffered to provoke the Lord to his face foure hundred yeeres together: We finde when to Ninive he sent a Prophet to reveale unto them the guilt and merit of their sinnes, he then set them a very short time, in which they should either forsake or ripen them, <hi>Yet fortie dayes and Ninive shall be destroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, the power of the Word towards wicked men is seene even in the <hi>rage and madnesse which it excites in them.</hi> It is a signe that a man hath to doe with a strong enemie when he buckleth on all his harnesse, and calleth together all his strength for opposition. When I see a river without any sensible noise or motion, I am ready to esteeme it a standing poole, but when I looke further and there observe what huge engines it carrieth about, and what weighty bodies it rouleth before it, I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16264:88"/>
a strength in it which I did not see: so when I see the Word of Christ rouze up the rage and lusts of men, and force them to set up against it strong holds, and high imaginations, even the wisedome and strength of the gates of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell to keepe it out, I must needs then conclude that it is indeed <hi>Virga virtutis, a Rod of strength.</hi> The most calme and devout hypocrites in the world have by the power of this word beene put out of their demure temper, and mightily transported with outrage and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse against the majesty thereof. One time filled with wrath; another time filled with madnesse; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time filled with envie and indignation, another time filled with contradiction and blasphemie;<note place="margin">Luk. 4.28. Luk. 6.11. Act. 5.17. Act. 13.45. Act. 7.54. Ioh. 8.59. Act. 6.10, 11. Act. 7 57, 58.</note> another time cut to the heart, and like reprobates in hell, gnashing with their teeth. Such a searching power, and such an extreme contrariety there is in the Gospell to the lusts of men, that if it doe not subdue, it will wonderfully swell them up, till it distemper even the grave, prudent men of the world with those brutish and uncomely affections of rage and fury, and drive disputers from their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto stonds. Sin cannot endure to be disquieted, much lesse to be shut in and encompassed with the curses of Gods word. Therefore as a hunted beast, in an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of distresse will turne backe, and put to its utmost strength to be revenged on the pursuers, and to save its life: so wicked men to save their lusts will let out all their rage, and open all their sluces of pride and malice to withstand that holy truth which doth so closely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them. Thus as beggarly masters deale with their servants, or bankrupts with their creditors, when they should pay them their monie (which they are unable to doe) they then picke quarrels, and create pretences to with-hold it; or as froward men in suits of law, when their cause failes, endeavour to piece it out with rage and passion; so doe wicked men deale with God in his word, when they should pay him that service which he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16264:88"/>
requireth of them, and which they have neither will nor power to doe, when he produceth his cause, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into controversie with them, convincing them in the court of their owne consciences, so that they are not able to stand out, they have then no other refuge left, but either to submit (which they will in no wise endure) or to flye into the face of the word, and withstand it with malice when they cannot with reason. Till men can be perswaded to lay apart all filthinesse and superfluity of naughtinesse, they will never receive the engraffed word with meeknesse. For till then it is a binding word,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.21. Mat. 18.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Mark. 16.16.</note> which sealeth their guilt and condemnation upon them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the mighty power of the word towards wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men is seene in <hi>altering them:</hi> in their semiperswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and semiconversions unto goodnesse, in restraining them from those lusts which they dearely love, and in forcing them to those externall conformities which have no inward principles to support them. The humiliation of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the observation of <hi>Herod,</hi>

Psal 78.34, 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Luk. 9.57.61.</note> the incomplete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> the forc'd obedience and flatteries of the dissembling Iewes, the essaies and offers of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites towards religion, the velleities and hankerings of unresolved wills after Christ, are notable evidences of the power and majesty which is in the Gospell. If I should see a millstone in the ayre not falling constantly and swiftly downe, but swag, and waver, and floate about in a kinde of unresolved motion, as if it were in a deliberation which way to goe, one while yeelding to its owne weight, another while lingering, and by fits attempting to ascend, how could I sufficiently wonder at that secret vertue, and those strange impressions which did retardate the naturall descent of so weightie a body? so when I see men, who still retaine the principles of their owne corrupt nature, which carry them with as strong an impulsion to sinne and hell, as a millstone is moved unto its Center, hanker notwithstanding after good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16264:89"/>
and when they yeeld unto their lusts, doe it not without much hesitancy and conflict of a naturall consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I must needes acknowledge a mighty strength in that word which setteth bounds to the raging of so proud a sea.</p>
            <p>From hence then the Messengers of Christ who are entrusted with the dispensation of this <hi>Rod of strength,</hi> may be instructed how to behave themselves in that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery. Few men wil lose any thing of that power which is given them, for every thing in its kinde doth affect power. Now Christ hath committed unto us the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his owne power, and therefore we ought to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it as <hi>a word of power,</hi> able alone by it selfe without the contemperations of humane fancies, or the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of humane opinions to worke mightily to the Salvation of those that beleeve, and to the conviction of gaine-sayers. Our Commission is to charge even the great men of the world. It is true the ministers of the Gospell are <hi>servants to the Church</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17. 2 Cor. 4.5.</note> In <hi>compassion</hi> to pitty the diseases, the infirmities, the temptations of Gods people: in <hi>ministerie,</hi> to assist them with all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full supplies of comfort, or instruction, or exhortation in righteousnesse; in <hi>humility,</hi> to waite upon men of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree, and to condescend unto men of weakest ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie. And thus the very Angels in heaven are servants to the Church of Christ. But yet we are servants onely for the Churches good, to serve their soules, not to serve their humors. And therefore we are such servants as may <hi>command too. These things command and teach, Let no man despise thy youth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.11, 12. Tit. 2.15.</note> And againe, <hi>These things speake, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority, Let no man despise thee.</hi> No ministers are more despicable than those who by ignorance, or flattery, or any base and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious affections betray the power &amp; majesticall simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Gospel of Christ. When we deliver Gods mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage <hi>we must not then be the servants of men;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23.</note>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16264:89"/>
men, I were not then the servant of Christ,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. To captivate the truth of God unto the humours of men, and to make the Spirit of Christ in his Gospell to bend, comply and complement with humane lusts, is with <hi>Ionah</hi> to play the runnagates from our office, and to prostrate the Scepter of Christ unto the insultation of men. There is a wonderfull majesty and authority in the word when it is set on with Christs Spirit. He taught men <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as one who had power and authority, or priviledge to speake,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.29. Matth. 22.16. 1 Cor. 2.4. 2 Cor. 13.17. 2 Cor. 3.10. 2 Cor. 4.2. Ier. 1.6, 7, 8. Ezek. 3.8, 9. Psal. 110.3. Eph. 6.20.</note> as one that cared not for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of men, and therefore where ever his spirit is, there will this power and liberty of Christ appeare, for he hath given it to his ministers, that they may commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the consciences of those that heare them, that they may harden their faces against the pride and scorne of men, that they may goe out in armies against the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his kingdome, that they may speake boldly as they ought to speake, that they may not suffer his word to be bound, or his Spirit to be straitened by the humors of men.</p>
            <p>Againe, we should all labour <hi>to receive the word in the power thereof,</hi> and to expose our tender parts unto it. A Cocke is in comparison but a weake Creature, and yet the crowing of a Cocke will cause the trembling of a Lion. What is a Bee to a Beare, or a Mouse to an Elephant? and yet if a Bee fasten his sting in the nose of a Beare, or a Mouse creepe up and gnaw the trunke of an Elephant, how easily doe so little Creatures upon such an advantage torment the greatest? Certainely, the proudest of men have some tender part into which a sting may enter. The conscience is as sensible of Gods displeasure, as obnoxious to his wrath, as subject to his word in a prince as in a beggar. If the word like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> stone finde that open and get into it, it is able to sinke the greatest <hi>Goliah.</hi> Therefore wee should open our consciences unto that word, and expect his spirit to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16264:90"/>
come along with it, and receive it as <hi>Iosiah</hi> did with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and trembling. Wee should learne to feare the Lord in his word, and when his voyce cryeth in the city, to see his name and his power therein. <hi>Will ye not feare me,</hi> faith the Lord, <hi>will ye not tremble at my presence, who make the sand abound to the sea.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 5 22.</note> No Creature so swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and of it selfe so strong and incroaching as the sea, nothing so small, weake, smoothe, and passable as the sand, and yet the sand (a creature so easily removed, and swept away) decreed to hold in so raging an Element. What in appearance weaker than words spoken by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised man? and what in the experience of all the world stronger than the raging of an army of lusts? and yet that hath the Lord appointed to tame and subdue these, that men might learne to feare his power.</p>
            <p>Againe, it should teach us to <hi>Rest upon God in all things,</hi> as being unto us all-sufficient, a sunne, a shield, an exceeding great reward in the truth and promises of his Gospell. The word of God is a <hi>sure thing,</hi> that which a man may cast his whole weight upon,<note place="margin">Psal. 19 7. 2 Pet. 1.19. Act. 13.34.</note> and leane confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently on in any extremity. All the Creatures in the world are full of vanity, uncertaineties and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then usually doe deceive a man most when he most of all relies upon them; and therefore the Apostle chargeth us <hi>not to trust in them.</hi> But the word of the Lord is an <hi>abiding word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17.</note> as being founded upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of Gods owne truth, he that maketh it his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, relieth on Gods omnipotency, and hath all the strength of the Almighty engaged to helpe him. <hi>Asa</hi> was safe while hee depended on the Lord in his promises against the hugest host of men that was ever read of,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 16.8, 9.</note> but when he turned aside to collaterall aides hee purchased to himselfe nothing but perpetuall warres. And this was that which established the throne of <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> and caused the feare of the Lord to fall upon the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the lands which were round about him,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 17.9, 10.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16264:90"/>
he honoured the Word of God, and caused it to be taught unto his people. Whensoever Israel and Judah did forget to leane upon Gods word, and betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to humane confederacies, to correspondence with Idolatrous people, to facility in superstitious complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the like fleshly counsels, they found them alwaies to be but very lies, like waxen and wooden feasts, made specious of purpose to delude ignorant commers; things of so thinne and unso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>id a consistence as were ever bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the weight of those who did leane upon them. Let us not therefore rest upon our owne wisedome, nor build our hopes or securities upon humane foundations, but let us in all conditions <hi>take hold of Gods Covenant,</hi> of this staffe of his strength,<note place="margin">Esai. 56.2, 4, 6.</note> which is able to stay us up in any extremities.</p>
            <p>Againe, since the Gospell is a word of such soveraigne power, as to strengthen us against all enemies and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to uphold us in all our wayes and callings, to make us strong in the Grace of Christ, (for ever a <hi>Christian mans knowledge of the Word is the measure of his strength and comfort</hi>) wee should therefore <hi>labour to acquit our selves with God in his Word,</hi> to hide it in our hearts, and grow rich in the knowledge of it. In hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven our blessednesse shall consist in the knowledge and communion with the Father and with his Sonne Iesus Christ. So that the Gospell and the Spirit, are to us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, the preludes and supplies of heaven, for by them onely is this knowledge and communion begun. And that man doth but delude himselfe and lye to the world who professeth his desire to goe to heaven, and doth not here desire to know so much of God as he is pleased to afford to men on the earth. The Gospell is the <hi>Patent and Charter of a Christian,</hi> all that hee hath to shew for his Salvation; the <hi>treasure</hi> of his wealth and priviledges, all that he hath to boast in either for this life or another; the <hi>armory</hi> of a Christian, all that he hath
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16264:91"/>
to hold up against the temptations and conflicts of his sorest enemies; the only <hi>toole</hi> and instrument of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, all that he hath to doe, any action of piety, charity, loyalty, or sobriety withall; the onely <hi>glasse</hi> of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian wherein he may see his owne face, and so learne to deny himselfe, and wherein he may see the face of God in Christ, and so learne to desire and to follow him. So that upon the matter for any man to be ignorant of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell is to unchristian himselfe againe, and to degenerate into a heathen. <hi>Powre out thine indignation upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that know thee not.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 10.25.</note> Ignorance makes a man a very heathen. <hi>This I say and testifie,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>that you henceforth walke not as other Gentiles walke in the vanity of their mind:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4.17, 20</note> 
               <hi>for you have not so learned Christ.</hi> It is not the title, nor the profession which maketh a man a reall Christian, and distinguisheth him from other heathen men, but the <hi>learning of Christ</hi> in his Spirit and Gospell. For as he who was onely outwardly and in the flesh a Jew,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.28, 29. Col. 2.11. Philip. 3.3.</note> might be uncircumcized in his heart: so he who is onely in title and name a Christian, may be a heathen in his heart; and that more fearefully than Sodome and Gomorrah, or Tyre and Sydon, because he hath put from himselfe the Salvation of the Lord, and judged himselfe unworthy of eternall life.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if there bee indeed such power in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, wee should <hi>labour to beare witnesse unto the testimony which God giveth of his Word in a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</hi> It is a reproach cast upon the ordinances of God when men doe in their lives denie that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which God testifieth to be in them. Wicked men are said to crucifie Christ againe, to put him to shame, to make God a liar; not that these things can so really bee, but because men in their evill lives carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as if indeed they were so. And in this sense the Gospell may bee said to bee weake too, because the pride of men holds out against the saving power
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16264:91"/>
thereof. But these men must know that the word retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not empty unto God, but accomplisheth some worke or other, either it ripeneth weeds or corne. There is thunder and lightning both in the word, if the one breake not a heart, the other will blast it, if it bee not humbled by the word, it will certainly bee withered, and made fruitlesse. Shall the clay boast it selfe against the fire, because, though it have power to melt wax, yet it hath not power to melt clay? Is it not one and the same power which hardneth the one and which softneth the other? Is not the word a sweete Savor unto God as well in those that perish as in those that are saved? Certainly there is as wonderfull a power in adding another death to him who was dead before (which upon the matter is to kill a dead man) as in multiplying and enlarging life. And the Gospell is to those that perish a <hi>Savor of death unto death,</hi> such a word as doth cumulate the damnation of wicked men, and treasure up wrath upon wrath. If it doe not convert it will certainly harden, if it doe not save it will undoubtedly judge and condemne. The Lord doth never cast away his Gospell, hee that gave charge to gather up the broken meate of loaves and fishes that nothing might bee lost, will not suffer any crumme of his spirituall manna to come to nothing. Yet wee finde the Lord giveth a charge to his Prophets to preach even there where hee foretold them that their words would not bee heard. <hi>Thou shalt speake all these wordes unto them, but they will not hearken to thee;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 7.27. Ezek. 2.3, 4.7.</note> 
               <hi>thou shalt also call unto them, but they will not answere thee.</hi> Sonne of Man I send thee to the Children of Israel, <hi>to a rebellions nation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 3.7.</note> 
               <hi>they are impudent Children and stiffe hearted. Yet thou shalt speake my words unto them,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will heare, or whether they will forbeare, for they are rebellion it selfe. <hi>They will not hearken unto thee, for they will not hearken unto mee:</hi> For all the house of Israel are impudent and hard hearted. Certainly when
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16264:92"/>
the Lord taketh paines by his Prophets to call those who will not heare, hee doth it not in vaine, they shall know at length that a Prophet hath been amongst them. Therefore as the Apostle saith that the Gospell is a sweet Savour even in those that perish. So wee finde those messages which have contained nothing but curses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an obstinate people have yet been as honie for sweetnesse in the mouth of those that preached them. I did eate the roule,<note place="margin">Ezek 3.3.2.10.</note> saith the Prophet, and <hi>it was in my mouth as honie for sweetnesse,</hi> and yet there was nothing in it written, but lamentations, and mourning, and woe. <hi>Ieremie</hi> did not desire the woefull day,<note place="margin">Ier. 17.16.28.6. Ier. 15.16.</note> but did heartily say Amen to the false Prophets in their predictions of safety; yet in regard of his ready service unto God, and of that glory which God would worke out unto himselfe in the punishment of that sinfull people, the word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie which was committed unto him was the joy and rejoicing of his heart; so that in all respects the Gospell of Christ is a word of power, and therein wee doe and must rejoice.</p>
            <p>Wee observed before that this Rod of strength is both <hi>Sceptrum Majestatis,</hi> and <hi>Pedum Pastorale.</hi> Both the Scepter of Christ as hee is a King, and his Pastorall staffe as hee is a Bishop. It denoteth the Administration of Christs Kingdome, which consisteth in the dispensing of his Gospell, as it is a word of Majesty, and of care. So then here are (as I before observed) two observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions yet remaining to bee noted out of these words, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga Virtutis,</hi> the Rod of thy strength.</p>
            <p>The first, that <hi>the Gospell of Christ accompanied with his Spirit is a word of great glory and Majesty.</hi> For wee must ever make these concomitants, <hi>wee preach the Gospell</hi> saith <hi>S. Peter with the Holy Ghost</hi> sent downe from heaven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. And indeed the Spirit is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Gospell, and not belonging to the Law at all, if wee consider it alone by it selfe, under the relation
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16264:92"/>
of a distinct covenant. For though as it proceedeth out of <hi>Sion,</hi> that is, as it is an appendix and additament unto the Gospell, it tend unto liberty,<note place="margin">Mic. 4.2. Rom. 8.3. Iam. 1.25. Gal 4.24. 2 Cor. 3.67.</note> and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit; yet by it selfe alone it gendreth nothing but bondage. And therefore when the Apostle sheweth the excellency of the Gospell above the Law, hee calleth one a ministration of death, and of the letter, the other a ministration of the Spirit and life. To shew that properly the Spirit belongeth unto the Gospell of grace. Now then this Spirituall Gospell of Christ is the Scepter of his Kingdome, and therefore as it is <hi>insigne regium,</hi> an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe of roialty it importeth Glory and Majestie. It is <hi>a Gospell full of glory.</hi> Wee may observe that the very <hi>Typicall prefigurations</hi> of that mercy, which is the sole businesse of the Gospell of Christ are in the Scriptures honored with the name of <hi>Glory.

And with this did the Lord fill the second Temple, which for this cause is said to have been <note n="o" place="margin">Hag. 2.7.9.</note> more glorious than the former, though in the magnificence of the structure farre inferior.

And therefore, as I before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in other things, so in this is it true likewise, that Christ and his Gospell have the same attribute of glory frequently given unto them. <note n="q" place="margin">Esai. 40.5.

A <note n="s" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note> glory which draweth the study and amazement of the most glorious creatures of God unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:16264:93"/>To consider this point more particularly: The glory and majesty of the Gospell of Christ appeareth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in foure things: in the <hi>Author</hi> of it: in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation</hi> and publishing of it: in the <hi>Matter</hi> which it containes: and in the <hi>Ends,</hi> purposes, or uses for which it serves.</p>
            <p>First, in the <hi>Author</hi> of it: Many things of small worth have yet growne famous by the authours of them, and like the unprofitable children of renowned progenitors, hold their estimation and nobility from the parents which begate them. And yet from men who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, there will ever descend some uncleannesse upon the workes which they doe. But the Gospell is therefore indeed a glorious Gospell, because it is the <hi>Gospell of the blessed God.</hi> There is glory in all the workes of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are his, for it is impossible that so great a workeman should ever put his hand to an ignoble work: And therefore the Prophet <hi>David</hi> useth his <hi>glory and his handy worke</hi> promiscuously for the same thing; <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy worke:</hi> to note that there is an evidence of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in any thing which hee puts his hand unto: And yet the Prophet there sheweth that there is more glory in the law of his mouth, than in the workes of his hands. The Lord is better known by Sion, and his name greater in Israel, than in al the world besides: the more God doth communicate himselfe unto any of his works, the more glorious it is. Now there is nothing wherein God hath so much put himselfe, wherin he may be so fully knowne, communicated with, depended upon, and praised, as in his Gospell. This is a glasse in which the blessed Angels doe see and admire that unsearchable riches of his mercy to the Church, which they had not by their owne ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation found out from the immediate view of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious presence. In the Creatures we have him a God of power and wisedome, working all things in number,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16264:94"/>
weight, and measure, by the secret vigour of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upholding that being which he gave them, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them to those glorious ends for which he gave it. In the law we have him a God of vengeance and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, in the publication thereof threatning, and in the execution thereof inflicting wrath upon those that transgresse it. But in the Gospell we have him a God of bounty and endlesse compassion, humbling himselfe that he might be mercifull to his enemies, that he might him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe beare the punishments of those injuries which had beene done unto himselfe, that he might not offer onely but beseech his owne prisoners to bee pardoned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled againe. In the Creature he is a God above us, in the Law he is a God against us; onely in the Gospel hee is <hi>Immanuel,</hi> a <hi>God with us,</hi> a God like us, a God for us.</p>
            <p>There is nothing doth declare God so much to bee God as his mercy in the Gospell. Hee is invisible in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, we cannot see him but in his Sonne. Hee is unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable in himselfe, wee cannot come unto him but by the Sonne. Therefore, when hee maketh himselfe knowne in his glory to <hi>Moses,</hi> hee sendeth him not to the Creation, nor to mount Sinai, but putteth him <hi>into a rocke</hi> (being a resemblance of Christ) and then maketh a proclamation of the Gospell unto him. <hi>Moses</hi> his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was,<note place="margin">Exod. 33.18, 19:</note> 
               <hi>I beseech thee shew me thy glory.</hi> How doth the Lord grant this Prayer? <hi>I will make all my goodnesse to passe before thee,</hi> and then revealeth himselfe unto him almost all by mercy.<note place="margin">Exod. 34.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, mercifull and gratious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodnesse and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sinne,</hi> to note unto us that the glory of God is in nothing so much revealed as in his goodnesse. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mich. 7.18.</note> 
               <hi>that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his people?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, though the Law be indeed from God, as from
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16264:94"/>
the Authour of it, so that in that respect there may seeme to be no difference of excellency betweene that and the Gospell, yet wee must observe that by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of Creation, though God should not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his Law againe unto <hi>Moses</hi> in the mount, much of the Law, and by consequence of God himselfe might have beene discover'd by humane industry, as wee see by notable examples of the philosophers and grave hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. But the Gospell is such a mystery as was for ever hidden from the reach and very suspicion of nature, and wholly of divine revelation. <hi>Eye hath not seene, nor eare heard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 16.25. 1 Cor. 2.7 9.</note> 
               <hi>neither have entred into the hearts of men the things which God hath prepared for them that love him</hi>; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh it of the mystery of the Gospell; noting that it is above the observation, or learning, or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of nature, so much as to suspect it; nay, the naturall inquirie of the Angels themselves could never have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it,<note place="margin">Ephes. 3.9, 10.</note> even unto them it is <hi>made knowne by the Church</hi>; that is, if it had not beene for the Churches sake that God would reveale so glorious a mystery, the Angels in heaven must have beene for ever ignorant of it. So extremely desperate was the fall of man, that it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the infinite and unsearchable wisedome of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to finde out a remedie against it. If the Lord should have proceeded thus farre in mercy towards man and no farther. Thou art a wretched Creature, and I am a righteous God; yea, so heavy is my wrath, and so wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thy condition, that I cannot choose but take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion upon thee; and therefore I will put the matter into thine owne hands; requisite it is that my pitty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee should not swallow up the respects to mine owne justice and honour, that my mercy should bee a righteous and a wise mercy. Consult therefore toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all ye children of men, and invent a way to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile my justice and mercy to one another, set mee in a course to shew you mercy, without parting from mine
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16264:95"/>
owne right, and denying the righteous demands of mine offended justice, and I will promise you to observe it; I say, if the mercy of the Lord should have confin'd it selfe within these bounds, and referr'd the method of our redemption unto humane discovery, we should for ever have continued in a desperate estate, everlastingly unable to conceive, or so much as in fancy to frame unto our selves a way of escape. As the Creatures before their being could have no thought or notion of their being educ'd out of that nothing which they were before. So man fallen could not have the smallest conjecture or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition of any feaseable way to deliver himselfe out of that misery into which he fell. If all the learning in the world were gather'd into one man, and that man should imploy all his time and studie to frame unto himselfe the notions of a sixth or seventh sense, which yet are as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely fashion'd amongst those infinite <hi>Idea</hi>'s of Gods power and omniscience, as these five which are already created, he would be as totally ignorant of the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he sought at last as hee was at first. For all humane knowledge of naturall things is wrought by a reflexion upon those Phantasmes or Idea's, which are impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions made from those senses wee already use, and are indeed nothing else but a kinde of notionall existence of things in the memory of man wrought by an externall and sensible perception of that reall existence which they have in themselves. And yet in this case a sixth or a seventh sense would agree <hi>in genere proximo,</hi> and so have some kinde of Cognation with those wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready enjoy. But a new Covenant, a new life, a new faith, a new salvation are things <hi>toto genere,</hi> beyond the straine and sphere of nature. That two should become one, and yet remaine two still, as God and man doe in one Christ, that hee who maketh should bee One with the thing which himselfe hath made; that hee who is above all should humble himselfe, that he who
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16264:95"/>
filleth all should emptie himselfe; that he who blesseth all should be himselfe a curse; that hee who ruleth all should be himselfe a servant, that he who was the prince of life, and by whom all things in the world doe consist, should himselfe be dissolved and dye, that mercy and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice should meet together, and kisse each other, that the debt should bee payed and yet pardoned, that the fault should bee punished and yet remitted, that death like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Lion should have life and sweetnesse in it, and be used as an instrument to destroy it selfe; these and the like Evangelicall truths are mysteries which surpasse the reach of all the princes of learning in the world. <note n="a" place="margin">

For the former wee may note that there was a resemblance of state and glory observ'd in the preaching of Christ. <hi>A Forerunner sent to prepare his way,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esai. 40.3, 4, 5.</note> and to beare his sword before him, as a Herald to proclaime his approach,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1, 4, 5.</note> and then at last is revealed the Glory of the Lord. And thus we may observe how we sent his Harbingers <hi>before his face into every Citie and place whither he himselfe would come:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 10.1.</note> that so men might prepare themselves, and lift up their everlasting gates against this Prince of Glory should enter in. When one poore ordinary man intendeth to visit another, there is no state nor distance, no ceremonies nor solemnities obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but when a prince will communicate himselfe unto any place, there is a publication, and officers sent abroad to give notice thereof, that meete entertainements may be provided. So doth Christ deale with men, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how unprepared wee are to give him a welcome, how foule our hearts, how barren our consciences, and therefore he sendeth his Officers before his face with his owne Provision, his Graces of Humiliation, Repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:16264:99"/>
Desire, Love, Hope, Joy, hungring and thirsting after his appearance; and then when hee is esteemed worthy of all acceptation, he commeth himselfe.</p>
            <p>Looke upon the more consummate publication of the Gospell (for Christ in his owne personall preaching is said but <hi>to have begun to teach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 1.1. Hebr. 2.3.</note>) and we shall see that as Princes in the time of their solemne Inauguration doe some speciall acts of magnificence and honour, open pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, proclaime pardons, create nobles, stampe coyne, fill conduits with wine, distribute donatives and congiaries to the people: So Christ to testifie the glory of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, did reserve the full publication thereof unto the day of his instalment and solemne readmission into his Fathers glory againe. <hi>When he ascended up on high he then led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity captive, and gave gifts unto men,</hi> namely, the Holy Ghost, who is called the <hi>Gift of God, Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Act.</hi> 8 20 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.10. and in the plurall number <hi>Gifts,</hi> as elsewhere he is called <hi>seven spirits, Revel.</hi> 1.4. to note the plenty and variety of graces which are by him shed abroad upon the Church. Wisedome, and faith, and knowledge, and healings, and prophesie, and discerning, and miracles, and tongues, <hi>All these worke one and the selfe-same spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.8, 11. Ephes. 4.12, 13.</note> And these gifts were all shed abroad for Evangelicall purposes, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the worke of the ministerie, and for the edifying of the body of Christ. And this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Saint <hi>Peter</hi> telleth us is <hi>a spirit of Glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.14.</note> and therefore that Gospell, for the more plentifull promulgation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was shed abroad, must needs be a Gospell of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie too.</p>
            <p>And this further appeares, because in this more solemne publication of the Gospell there was much more <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of glorious light and grace,</hi> shed abroad into the world. The Sunne of Righteousnesse in his estate of humiliation was much ecclipsed, with the similitude of sinfull flesh, the Communion of our common infirmities,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:16264:100"/>
the poverty of a low condition, the griefe and vexation of the sinnes of men, the overshadowing of his divine vertue, the forme and entertainement of a servant, the burden of the guilt of sinne, the burden of the Law of God, the ignominie of a base death, the agonie of a cursed death. But when hee ascended up on high, like the Sunne in his glory, hee then dispell'd all these mists, and now sendeth forth those glorious beames of his <hi>Gospell</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which are the <hi>two wings,</hi> by which he commeth unto the Churches, and <hi>under which the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and salvation of the world is treasured.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 4.2. Ezek. 47.8, 9. Esai. 35.5, 6, 7. Mat. 11.11, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was the last and greatest of all the Prophets who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of Christ, a greater had not beene borne of women, and yet he was lesse than the least in the kingdome of heaven, that is, than the least of those upon whom the Promise of the Spirit was shed abroad, for the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manifestation of the kingdome of his Gospell. All the Prophets and the Law prophesied untill <hi>Iohn</hi>; but at the comming of Christ they seem'd to bee taken away, not by way of abrogation and extinguishment, as the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but by way of excesse and excellency, <hi>ut stellae exiliores ad exortum solis,</hi> as the Orator speakes; so saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>Even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this respect, by reason of the Glory that excelleth.</hi> Therefore the full Revelation of the Gospell is called an <hi>effusion of the spirit,</hi> not in dew, but in showres of raine, which multiply into <hi>rivers of living water</hi> (for the raine of the spirit floweth from heaven as from a spring) and into <hi>wels of Salvation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 3.6. Heb. 6.7. Ioh. 7.38. Ioh. 4.14.

               <note place="margin">Esai. 44.3. Ezek 47.3, 4, 5.</note> it should be <hi>living water,</hi> multiplying and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up like the waters of the Sanctuary, till it came to a bottomelesse and unmeasurable sea of eternall life. And, to touch that which was before spoken of, very glorious
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16264:100"/>
are the vertues of the Spirit in the Gospell intimated in this similitude of <hi>living water.</hi> To quench the wrath of God, that otherwise consuming &amp; unextinguishable fury,<note place="margin">Esai. 33.14. Ioh. 4.10. Ezek. 47.12. Zech. 12.10.</note> which devoureth the adversaries with everlasting bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. To satisfie those desires of the thirsty soule which it selfe begetteth: for the Spirit is both for medicine and for meate; for medicine, to cure the dull and averse ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of the soule; and for meate, to satisfie them. The Spirit is both <hi>a Spirit of supplication and a Spirit of grace or satisfaction.</hi> A Spirit of supplication, directing us to pray; and a Spirit of Grace, supplying those requests and satisfying those desires which himselfe did dictate. <note n="a" place="margin">Ezek. 36.25.</note> To cleanse, to purifie, to mollifie, to take <note n="b" place="margin">Esai. 35.6, 7. Ezek. 11.19.</note> away the barrennesse of our naturall hearts. To <note n="c" place="margin">Mal. 3.16. Gal. 6.1, 2.</note> overflow and communicate it selfe to others. To <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 5.17. Phil. 1.27.</note> withstand and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due every obstacle that is set up against it. To continue and to multiply to the end.</p>
            <p>By this then wee learne the way <hi>how to abound in grace and glory,</hi> and how to bee transformed into the Image of Christ. The beame and light of the Sunne is the <hi>vehiculum</hi> of the heate and influence of the Sunne; so the light of the Gospell of Christ is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veieth the vertue and gracious workings of his Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soule. And therefore we are to seeke those varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of grace, which are for meate to satisfie the desires, and for medicine to cure the bruizes of the soule,<note place="margin">Ezek. 47.12.</note> onely upon the bankes of the waters of the Sanctuary, that is, in the knowledge of the word of truth, which is the Gospell of Salvation. The more of this glorious light a man hath, the more proportion of all other graces will he have too. And therefore the Apostle puts the growth of these two together, as contributing a mutuall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour unto one another, <hi>Grow in Grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.18.</note> 
               <hi>and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Your Grace will inlarge your desires of knowledge, and your knowledge will multiply your degrees of Grace. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16264:101"/>
the knowledge of the will of God in wisdome, and after a spirituall maner to be the ground of fruitfulnesse in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good worke,<note place="margin">Col. 1.9, 10.</note> and that again an inducement to increase in knowledge, as in the twisting together of two cords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one rope, they are by art so ordered that either shall bind and hold in the other. As in the heavens the inferior orbes have the measure and proportion of their generall motion from the supreme: so in the motions of grace in the soule, the proportion of all the rest a riseth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the measure of our spirituall and saving light. The more distinctly and throughly the spirit of a mans mind is convinc'd of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, beauty, and gloriousnesse of heavenly things, the more strong impressions therof wil be made upon all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate faculties; for we move towards nothing without preceding apprehensions of its goodnes, which apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as they more seriously penetrate into the true and intimate worth of that thing, so are the motions of the soule thereunto proportionably strengthen'd. As the hinder wheeles in a Coach ever move as fast as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer which leade them; so the subordinate powers of the soule are overrul'd in their maner &amp; measure of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards grace, by those spirituall representations of the truth and excellency thereof, which are made in the understanding by the light of the Gospel. Thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle telleth us that the <hi>excellency of the knowledge of Christ</hi> was that which made him so earnest to winne him;<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8, 14.</note> the knowledge of the power of his resurrection, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of his sufferings was that which made him reach forth and presse forward unto the marke and price of that high calling which was before him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Glory of the Gospell of Christ with his Spirit may be considered in regard of the <hi>matters</hi> which are therin contain'd, namely the Glory, the Excellencies, the Treasures of God himselfe:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> 
               <hi>We all,</hi> saith the Apostle, with open face <hi>behold as in a Glasse</hi> (that is, in the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ministration of the Gospell, having the veile of carnall
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16264:101"/>
stupidity taken away by the Spirit) <hi>The glory of the Lord.</hi> What glory doe we here behold, but that which a glasse is able to represent? Now <hi>in speculo nisi imago non cernitur,</hi> nothing can be seene in a glasse but the image of that thing which sheddeth forth its species thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore he immediately addeth, we are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>into the same image from glory to glory</hi>; and he else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where putteth these two together,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.7.</note> 
               <hi>Man is the image and the glory of God,</hi> for nothing can have any thing of God in it, any resemblance or forme of him, but so farre it must needs be glorious. But how doe we in the Gospell see the Image of God who is invisible? The Apostle expresseth that else-where, <hi>God who commanded the light to shine out of darknesse, hath shined in our hearts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> Christ is the Image and expresse Character of his Fathers glory, as the impression in the wax is of the forme and fashion of the seale, there is no excellencie in God which is not compleatly, adequately, and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Christ; so that in that glasse wherin we may see him, we may likewise see the glory of the Father. Now <hi>the Gospell is the face of Iesus Christ,</hi> that which as lively set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth his grace and Spirit to the soule, as if he were present in the flesh amongst us. Suppose we that a glasse could retaine a permanent and unvanishing <hi>species</hi> of a mans face within it, though hee himselfe were absent, might we not truly say this glasse is the face of that man, whose image it so constantly retaineth? So, in asmuch as Christ is most exactly represented in his Gospell (so that when we come into his personall and reall presence, to know even as we are knowne, we shall be able truely to say, this is indeed the very person who was so long since in his Gospell exhibited to my faith, <hi>sic ille manus, sic ora gerebat</hi>) it is therefore justly by the Apostle called <hi>the face of Iesus Christ</hi>; and therefore the <hi>Glasse wherein we see the Image and glory of God</hi>; as it is the same light
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:16264:102"/>
which shineth from the Sunne upon a glasse, and from a glasse upon a wall, so it is the same glory which shineth from the Father upon the Sonne, and from the Sonne upon the Gospell; so that in the Gospell we see the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable treasures of God, because his treasures are in his Sonne: Therefore that which is usually called <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 15.19. 1 Cor. 15.1.</note> 
               <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Gospell,</hi> is in other places called <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 20.25.</note>

            <p>It containeth the <hi>glory of Gods wisdome,</hi> and that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is <note n="d" place="margin">Ephes. 3.10.</note>

               </gap>, <hi>good-will towards men,</hi> which brought glory to God,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16264:102"/>
and to the earth peace: for the Gospell is as it were a Love-token or commendatory Epistle of the Lord unto his Church.<note place="margin">Act. 14.16, 17.</note> God left not himselfe without witnesses of his care, and evidences <hi>of some love</hi> even to those whom he suffered to walke in their owne wayes without any knowledge of his Gospell; he did them good, he gave them raine from heaven and fruitfull seasons; so even they had experience of <hi>some of his goodnesse,</hi> the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his providence,</hi> for hee is the <hi>Saviour of all men</hi>; but the Gospell containeth <hi>all Gods goodnesse,</hi> as a heape and miscellany of universall mercy: <hi>I will make all my goodnesse passe before thee, and I will proclaime the name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi> Gods speciall and gracious mercy, the mercy of his promises in Christ, doth convey unto the soule an interest in <hi>all his goodnesse,</hi> nay, it maketh <hi>all things good unto us,</hi> so that we may call them ours, as gifts and legacies from Christ.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.3, 4.</note> He hath given to us <hi>all things</hi> that pertaine to life and godlinesse, the world, and life, and death, and things present, and things to come; <hi>all are yours,</hi>

It containes the <hi>glory of Gods power and strength,</hi> for it is the <hi>Power of God unto salvation,</hi> as hath beene declared. It containeth the <hi>glory of Gods grace.</hi> The <hi>grace of his favour</hi> towards us, and the <hi>grace of his Spirit</hi> in us. <hi>The Law was given by Moses,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.17.</note> but grace came by Christ,</hi> that is, <hi>favour</hi> in stead of Gods fury, and <hi>strength</hi> in stead of mans infirmitie; for because man was unable to fulfill the Law, therefore the Law came with wrath and curses against man; but in the Gospell of Christ, there is abundance, even a whole <hi>kingdome of grace</hi> (the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.21.</note> that <hi>by Iesus Christ grace raigned</hi>) there is <hi>grace to remove the curse of the Law, by Gods favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:16264:103"/>
us:</hi> (so that on all sides the Law is weake, unable, by reason of mans sinne, to save; and unable, by reason of Gods favour, to condemne) and there is <hi>grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the weaknesse of man by Gods Spirit in us:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iames 4.5, 6.</note> for though our owne spirit lust unto envie, or set it selfe proudly against the Law of God; yet hee <hi>giveth more grace,</hi> that is, strength enough to overcome the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustings of the flesh against his will, and to enable us in sincerity, and evangelicall perfection to fulfill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law. Lastly, it containeth in some sort the <hi>glory of Gods heavenly kingdome,</hi> in that therein are let in the glimpses and first fruits, the seales and assurances thereof unto the soule by the promises, testimonies, and comforts of the Spirit. And therefore it is frequently called <hi>the Gospell of the kingdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 13.19. Marke 1.14. Luke 8 10.</note> and the <hi>mysteries of the kingdome of God,</hi> namely, that kingdome which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth here, but shall never end. As if a man borne in Ireland bee afterwards transplanted into England, though he change his countrey, he doth not change his King, or his Law, but is still under the same government: so when a Christian is translated from earth to heaven, he is still in the same kingdome, in heaven it is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory (mended much by the different excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the place and preferment of the person) in earth it is the same kingdome, though in a lesse amene and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable climate, the kingdome of the Gospell.

            <p>Here then wee see how and wherein we are to looke upon God, so as that wee may abide his glory, and bee comforted by it; wee must not looke upon him in his owne immediate brightnesse and essence, nor by our sawcie curiosities prie into the secrets of his unrevealed glory, for he is a consuming fire, an invisible and unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochable light;<note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.

But now to know the glory of God <hi>in the face of Iesus Christ,</hi> is both a fruitfull and a comfortable knowledge; wee know the patterne we must walke by, we know the life we must live by, we know the treasure wee must be supplied by, we know whom wee have beleeved, wee know whom wee may be bold with in all straits and distresses, wee know God in Christ full of love, full of compassion, full of eares to heare us, full of eyes to watch over us, full of hands to fight for us, full of tongues to commune with us, full of power to preserve us, full grace to transforme us, full of fidelity to keepe covenant with us, full of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to conduct us, full of redemption to save us, full of glory to reward us. Let us therefore put our selves into this Rocke, that Gods goodnesse may passe before us, that he may communicate the mysteries of his kingdom and of his glory unto us, that by him our persons may be accepted, our prayers admitted, our services regarded, our acquaintance and fellowship with the Lord increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by that blessed Spirit which is from them both shed abroad in his Gospell upon us.</p>
            <p>Now lastly, the Gospell of Christ is <hi>glorious</hi> in those <hi>ends, effects, or purposes for which it serveth:</hi> And in this respect principally doth the Apostle so often magnifie the glory of the Gospell above the Law. The Law was a glorious ministery,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.16-21.</note> as appeares by the thunderings and lightnings, the shining of <hi>Moses</hi> his face, and trembling at Gods presence, the service of the Angels, and sound of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16264:104"/>
the trumpet, the ascending of the smoke, and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the mountaine:<note place="margin">Hebr. 8.6.</note> but yet still the glory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell was farre more excellent, a better Covenant, a more excellent ministery. The Law had <hi>weaknesse and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablenesse</hi> in it,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.18, 19.</note> (both termes of diminution from the the glory thereof) and therefore it could make nothing perfect: But that which the Law could not doe, in as much as it was weake through the flesh,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2, 3.</note> the <hi>Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Iesus</hi> (which is a <hi>periphrasis</hi> of the Gospell, as appeareth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.) did doe for us, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, make us free from the law of sin and death. So then the Law was glorious, but the Gospell in many respects did <hi>excell in glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10.</p>
            <p>To take a more particular view of the spirituall glory of the Gospell of Christ in those excellent ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses for which it serveth: First, It is <hi>full of light,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, to comfort, to guide those who sate in darknesse and the shadow of death, into the way of peace. Light was the first of all the creatures which were made, and the Apostle magnifieth it for a glorious thing in those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther luminaries which were after created, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41. How much more glorious was the light of the Gospell? The Apostle calleth it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Of all other learning the knowledge of the Gospell doth infinitly excell in worth, both in regard of the object thereof, which is God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the flesh, and in regard of the end thereof, which is flesh reconciled, and brought unto God.<note place="margin">Ephes. 3.18.</note>

What Angell in heaven would trouble himselfe to busie his noble thoughts (which have the glorious presence of God, and

In all other learning a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in hell (the most cursed of all creatures,) doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully surpasse the greatest proficients amongst men; but in the learning of the Gospell, and in the spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations and evidences of the benefits of Christ to the soule from thence, there is a knowledge which surpasseth the comprehension of any angell of darknesse; for it is the Spirit of God onely which knoweth the things of God. It was the devillish flout of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate against Christian Religion,<note place="margin">

To which slander, though the most learned Father might have justly returned the lye, and given proofes both in the canonicall bookes of holy Scripture, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours of that religion, of as profound learning, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible argumentation, and as forcible eloquence as in any Heathen Author (for I dare challenge all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan learning in the world to parallel the writings of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Origen, Iustin, Tertullian, Cyprian, Minutius, Augustine, Theodoret, Nazianzen,</hi> and the other champions of Christian Religion against Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisme) yet he rather chooseth thus to answer, that that authoritie, which the faith he so much derided was built

                  <hi>Greg. Naz ibid.</hi>
               </note> Though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were to the Iewes an offence, as contrary to the honour of their Law, and to the Greekes foolishnesse, as contrary to the pride of their reason; yet to those that were perfect, it was an hidden and mysterious wisdome, able to convince the gain-sayers, to convert sinners, to comfort mourners, to give wisdome to the simple, and to guide a man in all his wayes with spirituall prudence; for, what ever the prejudice of the world may be, there is no man a wiser man, nor more able to bring about those ends which his heart is justly set upon, than hee who being acquainted with God in Christ by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, hath the Father of wisedome, the Treasurer of wisedome, the Spirit of wisedome, and the Law of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to furnish him therewithall. It is not for want of sufficiencie in the Gospell, but for want of more intimate acquaintance and knowledge thereof in us, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world are more wise in their generation, than the children of light.</p>
            <p>Secondly, another glorious end and effect of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell is to be <hi>a ministration of Righteousnesse,</hi> a publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a pardon to the world, and that so generall, that there is not one exception therein of any other sin than onely of the contempt of the pardon it selfe. And in this respect likewise the Gospell exceeds in glory. <hi>If the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of condemnation</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>bee glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousnesse exceed in glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. It is the glory of a man to passe by an offence, and the Lord proclaimeth his glory to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> in <hi>that he would forgive iniquitie, transgression and sinne,</hi> that is, multitudes of sinnes, and sinnes of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. And thus the Lord magnifies his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and thoughts towards sinners, above all the wayes and thoughts of men, even as the heavens are higher
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16264:106"/>
than the earth, <hi>because he can abundantly pardon,</hi> or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply forgivenesses upon those who forsake their wayes and turne to him, <hi>Esay</hi> 55.7, 8, 9. and therefore justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith whereby we rely upon the power of God to forgive and subdue our sinnes, is said <hi>to give glory to God. Abraham</hi> staggered not at the Promise through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, but being strong in faith hee gave <hi>glory to God,</hi> namely, the glory of his power and fidelity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20, 21.<note place="margin">Numb. 20.12.</note> 
               <hi>Ye shall not bring this congregation into the Land which I have given them,</hi> saith the Lord to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, because yee beleeved me not, to sanctifie mee in the eyes of the children of Israel,</hi> that is, to give me the glory of my power and truth (for to sanctifie the Lord of hoasts, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth to glorifie his power, by fearing him more than men, and by relying on him against the power and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies of men, <hi>Esay</hi> 8.12, 13. And therefore in the same argument touching the happinesse of the Saints, if they suffer for righteousnesse sake, or be reproched for the name of Christ:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.14, 15. 1 Pet. 4.14.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> useth in one place <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of the Lord in our hearts,</hi> and in another <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of him,</hi> as termes equivalent;) And therefore <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe is said to make God a lyar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5.10.</note> that is, to dishonour him,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.13.</note> and to rob him of the glory of his truth; And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire to rob God of his mercy, and to make the guilt of sinne greater than the power of God: And therefore murmurers, and unbeleevers are said <hi>to speake against God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal 78.18, 19.40.41.</note> 
               <hi>and to grieve him, to tempt, to limit him,</hi> that is, to call into question the glory of his power and truth. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then consisteth another glorious effect of the Gospell of Christ, that being a ministration of righteousnesse, it is a glasse of that power, truth, mercy, and fidelity of God, which by faith we rest upon, for the forgivenesse and subduing of sinne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, another glorious end of the Gospell is to be <hi>a ministration and a law of life. If the ministration of death</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>were glorious, how shall not the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:16264:106"/>
of the Spirit be rather glorious?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8. The Law alone by it selfe is towards sinners but a <hi>dead letter,</hi> onely the <hi>rule</hi> according unto which a man ought to walke, not any <hi>principle</hi> enabling him to walke. If <hi>Moses</hi> alone should speake unto men, he could onely tell them what they ought to doe,<note place="margin">

As the Sunne shining on a dung-hill exhaleth noysome vapours, and maketh it stinke the more. But now the Gospell by the Spirit doth not onely <hi>teach,</hi> but <hi>helpe</hi> too, sheweth us what wee should doe, and giveth us strength to doe it; we doe not onely therein <hi>see</hi> the glory of God, but are withall <hi>changed</hi> into the same Image, even <hi>from glory to glory,</hi> that is, (as I conceive from that allusion to a glasse) the glory of the Lord shining upon the Gospell, and from the Gospell shining upon our hearts, doth change them into the Image of the same glory; even as the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Sunne shining upon a glasse, and from that glasse reflecting on a wall, doth therein produce a more extraordinary image of its owne light: so that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <gap reason="foreign">

Matth. 12.20.</note> to censure, to condemne, to crucifie them, though before they were as deare as their owne members; to throw all their idols away as menstruous rags, and to judge and revenge themselves. <hi>Ephraim shall say, what have I to doe any more with idols?</hi>

I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himselfe: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, I smote upon my thigh.</hi> Thus the government of the Gospell in the heart, makes a man severe to sentence every sinne, to hang up his <hi>Haman,</hi> his favourite lusts, to give up himselfe to the obedience of Christ, and to have his conversation,<note place="margin">Phil. 3 20.</note> his trading, his treasure, his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, his freedome, his fellowship in heaven, as being now constituted under the gracious and peaceable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of an heavenly Prince.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it is a glorious Gospell, in that it was to be a <hi>continuing ministration, and an Immortall seed. If that which was done away,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. Now the Gospell is able to preserve a man blamelesse unto the comming of our Lord Jesus; it will not suffer a man to be shaken nor overturn'd by all the powers of darknesse; there is strength enough in it to repell, and wisdome to answer all the temptations and assaults of the enemies of our salvation: If the world set upon us with any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on the right hand, or on the left, with disgraces, persecutions, discomforts, exprobrations, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e this was the man who made God his helpe, and would needs be more excellent than his neighbours; the Gospel furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us with <hi>sure promises,</hi> and <hi>sure mercies</hi>; this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer sufficient against all the discouragements of the world, <hi>I know whom I have beleeved,</hi> I know that hee
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16264:107"/>
hath overcome the world, <hi>I know that he is able to keepe that which I have committed unto him, untill the last day,</hi> and in the meane time the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world, that is, we are at an equall point of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and defiance, the world contemnes me, and I am as carelesse of the world. If with pleasures, honours, and gilded baites to draw us away from God, <hi>Faith in the Gospell easily overcommeth the world,</hi> for it giveth both the Promises and first-fruits of such Treasures as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more pretious and massie than all the world can affoord; the very reproches of Christ (how much more his Promises, how infinitely more his Performances at the last?) are farre greater riches, than the treasures of Egypt. The daily sacrifice of a godly life, and the daily feast of a quiet conscience put more sweetnesse into the afflictions of Christ, than is in all the profits, pleasures or preferments of the world, being made bitter with the guilt of sinne. If Satan, or our owne reasonings stand up against the kingdome of Christ in us, the Gospell is a store-house which can furnish us with armorie of all sorts to repell them. Faith can quench firie darts, the weapons of the spirit can captivate the very thoughts of the heart unto the obedience of Christ, no weapon which is formed against it can prosper, and every tongue which riseth up against it in judgement, it shall condemn, it is a staffe which can carry a man over any Jordan, and can support &amp; comfort him in any shadow of death. This is the honour of the Word that it doth not onely <hi>sanctifie</hi> men, but <hi>preserve</hi> their holinesse in them. If it were not for the treasure of the word in the heart every little thing would easily turne a man out of his way, and make him revolt from Christ againe. How easily would <hi>afflictions</hi> make us mistrust Gods affection to us, and so change ours unto him (for this is certaine, <hi>His Love to us is the originall of our love to him)</hi> make us murmure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, struggle, fret under his hand, if in the Gospell wee
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16264:108"/>
did not looke upon them as the gentle corrections of a Father, who loves us, as the pruning and harrowing of our foules that they may bring forth more fruit? <hi>Except thy Law had beene my delight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.92.</note> 
               <hi>I should have perished in mine affliction.</hi> My affliction would have destroied me, and made mee perish from the right way, if it had not beene tempered and sanctified by thy Word. It wrought so with that wicked king of Israel, <hi>Behold this evill is of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 6.33. Mal. 3.14. Esai. 58.3.</note> 
               <hi>what should I waite upon the Lord any longer? what profit is there to walke humbly before him,</hi> or to afflict our selves before him, who will not see, nor take knowledge of it, but continue to be our enemie still? But the Gospell teacheth a mans heart to rest in God, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it that there is hope in Israel, and balme in Gilead, that they which beleeve should not make haste to limit, or to misconstrue God, but waite for his Salvation, which will ever come in that due time, wherein it shall be both most acceptable and most beautifull. Againe, how easily would <hi>Temptations</hi> over-turne the faith of men, if it were not daily supported by the Word? what is the reason that the sheepe of Christ will not follow stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, nor know their voice, that is, will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any force,<note place="margin">Iohn 10.4, 5.</note> nor subscribe in their hearts to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction or evidence of any temptation which would draw them from God, but onely because they heare and know the voice of Christ in his Gospell, and feele a spirit in their owne hearts setting to its seale and bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to that truth from whence those solicitations would seduce them? The Apostle foretold the Elders of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus at his solemne departure from them, that <hi>grievous wolves would enter in amongst them, &amp; that some of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves would arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20.29, 32.</note> And the maine remedie which the Apostle gives them against this danger was, <hi>I commend you to God, and to the Word of his grace which is able to build you up, &amp;c.</hi> Noting, that it is the Word of God
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16264:108"/>
which keepeth men from being drawne away with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse disputes. And the same intimation he gives them in his Epistle unto them, <hi>Hee gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers.—That we henceforth be no more children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.11-14.</note> 
               <hi>tossed to and fro, and carried about with every winde of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by the sleight of men, and cunning craftinesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they lye in waite to deceive.</hi> The more richly the word of God, in the love and evidence thereof,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5.21.</note> doth dwell in any man, and enable him to prove all things, the more stedfastly will he hold that which is good, and stand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable against the sleights and solicitations of men. Againe, how easily would our owne <hi>evill hearts</hi> gather a rust and unaptnesse for service over themselves, if they were not daily whet and brightned upon the Word of God. That onely it is which scrapeth away that lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and mossinesse which our soules are apt to contract out of themselves.<note place="margin">2 Ioh. 8.9.</note> 
               <hi>A man may lose all that hee hath wrought,</hi> all the benefit of what hee hath done already, and all the strength to doe any more,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.23.25.</note> 
               <hi>onely by not abiding in the Doctrine of Christ.</hi> Hee onely is no doer of the Word, who looketh in it as a man on a glasse, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently forgetteth the image and state of his conscience againe; it is onely hee that <hi>continueth therein,</hi> who is a doer of the worke, and blessed in his deed. He that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth up the Gospell in his heart, and laboureth to grow rich in the knowledge thereof, can never be turned quite out of his way, or become an Apostate from the grace of Christ.</p>

A holy man, who hath the spirit of his minde raised and ennobled by the Gospell, is an Agent in the same affaires, and doth in his thoughts, desires, prayers, emulations pursue the same high and heavenly ends, for the advancement of the glory of Christ, and demolishing the kingdome of Satan, with the blessed Angels of God. His desires looke no lower than a kingdome, a weight of massie, and most superlative exceeding glory. That which other men make the utmost point even of their impudent and immodest hopes, the secular favours and dignities of the world, these put lowest under their feet; but their wings, the higher and more aspiring affections of their soule, are directed onely unto heaven and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. They no sooner are placed in the body of Christ but they have publike services, some to preach, some to defend, all to pray, to practise, to adorne the profession they have under-taken. For indeede every Christian hath his talent given him, his service injoyn'd him. The Gospell is a <hi>Depositum,</hi> a publike Treasure, <hi>committed to the keeping of every Christian,</hi> each man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16264:109"/>
as it were, a severall key of the Church, a severall trust for the honour of this kingdome deliver'd unto him. As in the solemne Coronation of the Prince every Peere of the Realme hath his station about the Throne, and with the touch of his hand upon the roiall Crowne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the personall duty of that honour which hee is called unto, namely to hold on the Crowne on the head of his Soveraigne, to make it the maine end of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to study, and by all meanes endeavour the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of his Princes Throne: so every Christian as soone as he hath the honour to be called unto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and presence of Christ, hath immediately no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a <hi>depositum</hi> committed to his care than the very Throne and Crowne of his Saviour, than the publike honour, peace, victorie, and stability of his masters king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

The Gospell is the Law of Christs Throne, and the princes of the world are the lions about his Throne, set there to watch, and guard it against the malice of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

            <p>Lastly, the Gospell bringeth <hi>liberty and joy</hi> into the hearts of men with it. The liberty a <hi>Glorious liberty, Rom.</hi> 8.21. and the joy a <hi>glorious joy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gospell is called <hi>a Gospell of great joy, Luke</hi> 2.10. Liberty is so sacred a thing, that indeed it belongs in the whole compasse of it onely to the Prince: for though other men be free from servitude, yet they are not free from subjection. Now the Gospell giveth a plenary freedome to the consciences of men; they may be commanded by their owne consciences, but their consciences cannot be commanded by any but by Christ. The Sonne hath made them free from all others, that he onely might be the Lord over them. These are those noble effects of the majestie of the Gospell in the hearts of men, and all, so many severall evidences of that glorie which belongs unto it.</p>
            <p>Now then, to draw some inferences from this most usefull and excellent doctrine of the glory of the Gospell, we learne from thence first what liberty, and what sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity the Ministers of Christ ought to use in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of this his Kingdome in the Word. First, <hi>What Libertie.</hi> The Officers of a Prince who goe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16264:112"/>
before him to prepare his way, make bold to strike, and to scatter those unruly throngs of men, who presse too neere upon his sacred person. We are the Messengers of Christ sent before-hand with his royall proclamation of peace to make roome in the hearts of men for him, and to open their everlasting doores, that this King of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie may enter in. We may therefore boldly smite with the Rod of his mouth, wee must cry aloud, and not spare,<note place="margin">Ier. 1.17, 18. Ezek. 3.8, 9. 1 Tim. 4.11. 2 Cor. 4.1, 2.</note> pull downe mountainous lusts, subdue strong holds, take unto us iron pillars, and brasen wals, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of flint, to roote up, to pull downe, to batter and destroy, not to teach onely, but to command with all authority, and to commend our selves to every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in the sight of God. This use the Apostle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Glorie of the Gospell, <hi>seeing we have such Hope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.12.</note> that is, seeing in this glorious Gospell we have the dispensation of a blessed Hope unto men; or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Christ, who is unto us the Hope of Glorie, or the assured confidence of doing excellent workes by the vertue of this so glorious a word; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>We use great boldnesse or liberty of speech</hi>; for why should he, who bringeth unto men glad tidings of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, which offereth unto them the blessed Hope of Eternall life, bee affraid or ashamed of his Office? Though Rome were the seate, and that <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertull.

And therefore it is both the honour and duty of the dispencers of the Gospell <hi>to speake boldly as they ought to speake</hi>;<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.20.</note> and of the people to pray that that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spirit might ever accompanie so glorious a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. This was the prayer of the Primitive Saints for the Apostles of Christ, <hi>Grant unto thy servants, that with all Boldnesse they may speake thy Word.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 4.29.</note> And this duty lies
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:16264:112"/>
upon us with an heavie necessitie.</p>
            <p>For first, wee are dispensers of <hi>all Gods counsell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20.27. Iosh. 8.35. Deut. 29.29. Act. 5.20.</note> there must not be a Word which God hath commanded that we should refuse to make knowne unto the people, for the things revealed are for them and their children. Thus we finde when the Angell of the Lord brought forth the Apostles out of prison, he gave them this command, <hi>Goe stand and speake in the temple to the people all the words of this life:</hi> and certainely some of these words will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire boldnesse. When wee lay the axe to the roote of the tree, when wee how off mens very members, when we snatch them like brands out of the fire, when wee make them to see their owne faces in the Law of liberty, the face of a guilty, and therefore cursed conscience, there will be neede of much boldnesse. A Chirurgian who is to search an inveterate wound, and to cut off a putrified member, had not need to be faint-hearted, or bring a trembling hand to so great a worke.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the severest message we are sent withall, and which men are most unwilling to heare, is for them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. No newes could be so unwelcome to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles as to heare of Christs departure,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Because I have said these things sorrow hath filled your hart, neverthelesse I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I goe away.</hi> The first newes which we bring unto men is of Christs absence, of their false conceits and presumptions of their being in him, of the distance, and unacquaintance which is betweene them, of our feare of them and their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in all this we are not their enemies, because we tell them the truth. As it is our office to speake,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.16.</note> so it is the peoples duty and profit <hi>to heare all things which shall be told them of God,</hi> for <hi>all Scripture,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16, 17. Deut. 12.28. Psal. 119.128. Iam. 2.10, 11.</note> as well that which reproveth and correcteth, as that which teacheth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth in righteousnesse <hi>is profitable,</hi> and tends to the perfection of the Saints. <hi>All his precepts concerning all things are right.</hi> The contempt of one is virtually and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:16264:113"/>
interpretatively, in the constitution and preparation of heart, the violation of all, because they are all groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the same divine authority, and directed unto the same saving ends: and therefore wee ought not to picke, and choose either in the preaching or practising thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we are to answere for the bloud of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple if wee prevaricate, if wee let their sinnes alone they will have a double edge, to kill them and us both, like the mutuall embracements of two in a river, which is the meanes to drowne them both. <hi>Speake unto them all that I command thee;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 1.17.</note> 
               <hi>be not dismaied at their faces,</hi> saith the Lord to his Prophet, <hi>lest I confound thee before them. If thou warne not the wicked from his wicked way that hee may live,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 3.18.</note> 
               <hi>he shall dye in his wickednesse,</hi> (thy bashfulnesse shall doe him no good) <hi>but his bloud will I require at thy hands.</hi> Is it at all congruous that men should have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse enough to declare their sinnes, to speake them, to proclaime them, to weare them, to glorie in them, and that those officers, who are sent for no other businesse, but in the name and authority of Almighty God to fight against the corruptions of the world, should in the meane time hang downe the head and be tongue-tied? that men should have more boldnesse to destroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to doe Satans works, than we to save them, or to serve God?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we are to speake in the person of Christ, and in the vertue of his Spirit. We must speake as <hi>the</hi>

               <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the feare of that people fell upon them.</hi> We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this affection in the woman of Samaria, the first reason why shee gave some heed to Christ, speaking of his water of life unto her, was, because <hi>shee should thirst no more, nor come thither to draw.</hi> So long as <hi>Ephraim</hi> might have her worke and her wages together, shee was contented to doe God some service, <hi>like an Heifer which loveth to tread out the corne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 10.11.</note> that is, while shee hath no yoke on her necke, no muzzell on her mouth, while she is not put to plow, but to easie and pleasant service, shee is willing to yeeld unto it. To note, that it is but base and hypocriticall obedience, which is supported by no other than present rewards. <hi>They seeke me daily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 58.2, 3.</note> saith the Lord of the hypocrites among his people, <hi>and delight to know my wayes, as a nation that did righteousnesse.</hi> But the end was that they might have their owne wils, and as it were oblige God to reward them: and therefore as soone as God seemeth to neglect them and their servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they proudly expostulate with him, and even twit him with their workes, <hi>Wherefore have wee fasted, and thou seest not?</hi> &amp;c. This then is the proofe of our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love unto Christ, which is not raised upon mercina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie respects, when we can receive the Gospell with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. <note n="a" place="margin">Marke 10.30.</note> Persecution is amongst Christs legacies, a part of the Churches portion <note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 1.29.</note> and of Gods gifts unto

               <hi>as it was then, so is it now,</hi> saith the Apostle. The Saints of God ever have beene, and ever will be to the worlds end esteemed for <note n="e" place="margin">Zech. 3.8. Esay 8.18. 2 King. 9.11. Ier. 29.26. Wisd. 5.6.</note> wonders, and markes, and mad-men, and proverbs of reproch. And hereby the Lord doth provide to make his Gospell more glorious, because hee giveth men hearts to suffer scorne and reproch for it. <hi>To receive the word in affliction, and yet with joy,</hi> is an exemplary thing, which maketh the sound and glory of the Gospell to spread abroad. Now then, if persecution bee thus an appendant to the Gospell, every man must resolve to receive it in some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, when he must be put to discard his wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, to shake off his flattering and sharking lusts, to forsake his owne will and wayes, to runne a hazard of undeserved scorne, disreputation, and misconstructions in the world, and yet for all this to set an high price up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pretious truths of the Gospell still, is not this to receive the Word in much affliction? And surely till a man can resolve upon this conclusion, I am ready to be bound, and to die for the name of Iesus, I count not my life, much lesse my liberty, peace, credit, secular accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations deare, so I may finish my course with joy; Lord, my will is no more mine, but it shall be in all things subject unto thee; hee can never give such enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the Word as becommeth so glorious a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell. All his seeming profession and acceptation, is but like the Gadarens courtesie in meeting of Christ, which was onely to be rid of him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.34.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we should from hence learne a further Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an dutie, which is to adorne this glorious Gospell in an holy conversation.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.27. Tit. 2.10.</note> This use the Apostle every where makes of the Gospell of Christ; that wee should walke as becommeth the Gospell, that we should in all things

adorne the doctrine of God our Saviour, that we should walke worthy of him who hath called us unto his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and glory,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2.12.</note> that we shew forth the vertues of him who hath called us out of darknesse into his marvellous light, that we should not receive so great a grace,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.8.</note> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.1-3.</note> as the ministery of reconciliation in vaine, but that wee should walke sittingly to the holinesse and efficacie of so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a rule, as becommeth a royall nation,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.16.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note> a people of glory, a peculiar and selected inheritance, even zealous of good workes. It was once the expostulation of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> with his enemies,<note place="margin">Nehem. 6.11.</note> should such a man as I flie from such men as you?<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.3-6.</note> such should be our expostulation with Satan and our owne lusts, should such men as wee are, who have the Gospell of Christ for our rule, conforme our selves unto another Law? Is not this the end why the Gospell is preached, that we should live unto God? Doth it become the sonne of a King to goe in ragges, or to converse with meane and ignoble persons? Now by the Gospell we have that great honour and priviledge given us to be called <hi>the sons of God</hi>; and shall we then walke as servants of Satan? Would any Prince endure to see the heire of his crowne live in bondage to his own vassall and most hated enemie? Herein is the greatest glory of the Gospell above the Law, that it is a Law of life and libertie, a Word which transformeth men into the Image of Christ, and maketh them such as it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them to be. So that to walke still according to the course of the world as we did before, is, as much as in us lies, to make the Gospell as weake and unprofitable as the Law. <hi>How doe you say we are wise;</hi> saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>and the Law of the Lord is with us?</hi>

               <hi>Certainely in vaine made he it, the pen of the Scribe is in vaine:</hi> That is, the priviledge of having the oracles and ordinances of God committed unto us, will doe us no more good, if we walke unworthy of so great a grace, than if those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances had never beene written or revealed to men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:16264:119"/>Here then it is needfull to enquire in <hi>what manner</hi> we are to adorne and set forth the glory of the Gospell? To this I answer, that the first and greatest honour wee can doe unto the Gospell, is, to set it up in our hearts, as our <hi>onely rule,</hi> by which we are to walke, that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it above all our owne counsels, and venture not to mingle it with the wisdome and reasonings of the flesh; that wee raise up our conversation unto it, and never bend it unto the crookednesse of our owne ends or rules.<note place="margin">Col. 2.6.</note> 
               <hi>As yee have received Christ Iesus the Lord, so walke yee in him,</hi> saith the Apostle, that is, fashion your conversation to the doctrine of Christ, let that have the highest roome, and the over-ruling suffrage in your hearts. There is <hi>all wisdome</hi> in the Gospell, it is able to make men <hi>wise unto salvation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1.28.</note> that is, there is wisdome enough in it to compasse the uttermost and most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult end.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15, 16, 17.

This glory Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (though a man of great learning, of strong intellectuals, of a working and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring spirit, qualities very unapt to yeeld and be silent) did, at the very first revelation thereof, give unto the Gospell,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.16.</note> 
               <hi>Immediatly,</hi> saith he, <hi>I conferr'd not with flesh and bloud,</hi> I did not compare the Gospell of Christ with the principles of my carnall wisdome, I did not resolve to dispute against Gods grace, or to conforme unto this mystery no farther than the precepts of mine owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or the coexistence of mine owne secular ends and preferments would allow; but I captivated all my thoughts, and laid downe all the weapons of the flesh at Christs feet, resting onely on this Word, as a treasury of wisdome, and yeelding up my whole heart to be in all things ordered by this rule. It is an horrible boldnesse in many men to wrest, and torture, and distinguish the Gospell into all shapes for their owne lusts sake. As
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:16264:119"/>
we see what shifts men will use, to make the way of life broader than it is, by looking upon it thorow their owne multiplying glasses, what evasions and subterfuges sinne will finde out to escape by, when the letter of the Word presseth sore upon them. O how many sinnes might men escape, how wonderfully might they improve the Image of Christ in their hearts;<note place="margin">Psal. 119.24.</note> if they did with <hi>David</hi> make the Law their counsellor, and weigh every action which they goe about, those especially which they have any motions of reluctancie in the spirit of their minde unto, <hi>Non in statera dolosa consuetudinum,</hi>

               <hi>sed in recta statera scripturarum,</hi> not in the deceitfull balance of humane custome, but in the balance of the Sanctuary, the holy Scriptures: If they would seriously remember that they must alwayes <hi>walke in Christ, Coloss.</hi> 2.6. make him the rule, the way, the end, the Judge, the companion, the assistant in all their workes, that as the members of the body doe nothing at all but in the fellowship of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and as they are thereunto applied by the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon soule which animates them all: so Christian men should doe nothing but as parts of Christ, and as actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the same gracious Spirit which is in him. This is the meaning of our being Christians, and of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent which in our Baptisme we yeeld unto the Covenant of Christ, that we will not follow nor be led by Satan, the world, or the flesh, that is, by that wisdome which is earthly, sensuall, or devillish, but that we will be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by that Spirit of regeneration, the seale of whose Baptisme wee receive in our sacramentall washing. O then what is become of the Christianity of many men, who forget that they have beene purged? who live as if they had never beene baptized into Christ, who lived as if they had never learned Christ? What a prodigie and contradiction is it, that that tongue, which even now professed it selfe to be Christian, and said Amen to a most cleane and holy prayer, should, like those beasts
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16264:120"/>
which <hi>Seneca</hi> speaketh of, which by but turning aside their head to some other spectacle, doe immediately for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the meat which they seemed most greedily to eat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, breake forth presently into blasphemies, oathes, lies, revilings, clamours, obscenities, which are the very fumes and evidences of hell in the heart? That those hands which even now were reached forth to receive the sacred pledges and most dreadfull mysteries of salvation, which were even now imployed in distributing almes to the members of Christ, or in helping to heave and lift up a prayer unto heaven, which seemed like the hands of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> living creature to have wings of devotion over them, should suddenly have their wings melted off, and fall downe to covetous and cruell practices againe? that those feet which in the morning carried men into the Lords Sanctuary, and into the presence of Christ, should the same day turne the backes of the same men upon the Temple of the Lord, and carry them to stews and stages, the nurseries of uncleannesse? that those eyes which even now seemed to have beene nail'd unto heaven, and to have contended with the tongue and the hand which should more earnestly have presented the prayers of the soule to God, should almost in the space of their owne twinkling, be filled with sparkles of uncleannesse, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and glutting themselves upon vaine or adulterous objects? What is this but for men to renounce their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, to teare off their seale, and dash out their subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the covenant of grace, to deny the Lord that bought them, to repent of their bargaine which they had made for salvation, and <hi>really</hi> to dishonour that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell which they <hi>hypocritically</hi> professe? This then is the first honour which wee can doe unto the Gospell of Christ, when we set it up in our hearts as a most adequate rule of all wisedome, and the alone principle of every action.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee continue to honour the Gospell of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:16264:120"/>
Christ by walking in Obedience thereunto as our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule. First, in the <hi>Obedience of faith,</hi> receiving it, and leaning upon it, laying hold on the covenant which is therein revealed, as on the onely hope which is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: for this is a great acknowledgement of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and praise of God when we trust in him for salvation. Therefore the Apostle having shewed the Glorie of Christ above <hi>Moses,</hi> maketh this principall use of it,<note place="margin">Hebr. 3.3-12.</note> that therefore we should <hi>heare his voyce, and take heed of an evill and unbeleeving heart, in departing from him, Wee,</hi> saith he, <hi>are to the praise of Gods Glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>who trust in Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in <hi>Obedience of life and Holinesse.</hi> When for the honour of the Gospell we can denie our selves, and dishonour our lusts, and part from all that wee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as from dung and drosse, and expresse the image of Christ in our conversations. <note n="a" place="margin">Eph 4.20.22. 1 Ioh. 2.6. 1 Ioh. 4.17. Phil. 2.5. Esay 58.13. Ioh. 15.8.</note> This is indeed the true learning of Christ when we shew forth his life in ours, when we walke as he also walked, when as he was so we are in this world, when the same minde, judgement, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are in us which were in Christ. Thus the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are said to honour God, when they sanctifie his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and to glorie him when they bring forth much fruit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we honour the Gospell of Christ by <hi>constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and continuance</hi> in our faith and obedience thereunto; for standing fast, or persisting immoveably in our course without sorrow or repentance is an argument of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the Gospell. <note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 1.27.</note> 
               <hi>Walke,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>as becommeth the Gospell</hi> — that I may heare of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, <hi>that you stand fast in one spirit.</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Non stant uno loco vitia, sed mobilia &amp; inter se dissidentia tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuantur, pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt invicem, fugantur.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16264:121"/>
unnaturall desires: onely the Gospell, being spiritually apprehended, hath treasures enough for the soule to rest in, and to seeke no farther. And therefore falling away from the truth, power, or puritie of the Gospell is said to expose Christ to shame, and to crucifie him againe. For as in <note n="d" place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Orat.</hi> 40. <hi>de Baptismo.</hi> Rom. 2.23, 24.</note> Baptisme when wee renounce sinne, and betake our selves to Christ, we doe as it were, expose sinne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to publike infamie, and naile it on the Crosse of Christ: So when we revolt from Christ unto sinne againe, and in our hearts turne backe unto Egypt, and thrust him from us, we doe then put him to shame againe, as if hee were either in his power deficient, or unfaithfull in those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises which before we pretended to relie upon. If Israel, as they consulted, should likewise actually have rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against <hi>Moses,</hi> and returned in body as well as in heart unto Egypt againe, what a scorne would it have wrought in that proud nation, that their vassals should voluntarily resume their thraldome, after so many boasts and appearances of deliverance? If a man should relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish the service of some noble person, and apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto some sordid matter for subsistence, would not the mouths of men be quickly open, or their mindes jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to suspect that however such a man carry an high name, and there bee great expectations from attending on him, yet in truth he is but a dry matter, whom his own servants doe so publikely dishonour? So when any men turne Apostates from the power and Profession of the Gospell of Christ, presently wicked men are apt to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and to conceive desperate prejudices against our high and holy calling. If any man make a boast of the Law, and yet breake it, hee dishonoreth God the more, for (saith the Apostle) <hi>The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written,</hi> so then constancie in Christs service giveth him the glory of an honourable master, and his Law of a royall law, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.15, 16.</note>

waite to take advantages that they may blaspheme the name of God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.3. 1 Tim. 6 1.</note> and his doctrine.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Gospell of Christ is honoured by the <hi>unitie of the Spirit,</hi> and concurrent judgements and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of men toward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iud. v. 3.</note> and <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly contend for it</hi>; when all that ever have been or are acquainted therewith doe glorifie it with their suffrages and subscription, <hi>Nemo omnes, neminem omnes fefellere,</hi> it must needs be a glorious Gospell, if all that ever loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on it doe so conclude: Nothing was ever able to deceive all men, neither did so many ever combine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others. When the Philosophers severally strove for the precedence of their severall sects, and every man, after his owne order, gave the next place unto <hi>Plato,</hi> it was undoubtedly concluded that his was the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, because after their owne prejudice and personall respects, it was honoured by the equall suffrages of all the rest. How much more must the Gospell needes bee glorious which hath the joynt attestation of Angels and all holy men since the world began to honour it withall? Therefore when the Apostle proveth the greatnesse of this heavenly mystery, he useth a word which importeth the consent of men, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>without any doubt, or by an universall confession, Great is the mysterie of Godlinesse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> Doth it not much set forth the Glory of a Law, that there should be so much wisedome, power, equitie, majestie, beautie in the face of it, that every true subject in a Realme should concurre in a constant and uniforme love and obedience to it? Let us therfore expresse the glory of the Gospell, not only in our joynt confessions, but in our united obedience thereunto, and in our unanimous zeale and contention for it, in our brotherly affections and compassions to one another therby: for the schismes and disaffections of Christians bring much dishonour upon their holy profession, which in all their miscariages doth
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16264:122"/>
ever by occasion of the unreasonablenesse of wicked men suffer together with them. Therefore the Apostle from the unitie of Christ in himselfe concludeth that such he should be in his members too. <hi>Is Christ divided?</hi> hath he divers opinions, or hath he the truth of God in respect of persons? such as he is such should you bee likewise, lest by your contentions you seeme to make another Christ, or another Gospell, than that which you have received.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the Gospell of Christ is honoured in our <hi>studying of it,</hi> and digging after it in our serious and painefull enquiries into the mysteries of it. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> despised all other knowledge, and shooke off every weight that he might presse forward with the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied affections towards so excellent a treasure. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if men had the spirit of the Apostle, or of those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Angels which desire to pry into the Gospel of Christ, they would not misse-spend so much pretious time in frothy and fruitlesse studies, nor waste away that lampe of reason in their bosomes, in empty and unnourishing blazes; but would set more houres apart to looke into the patent of their salvation (which is the booke of God) and to acquaint themselves with Christ before-hand, that when they come into his presence they may have the entertainement of friends and not of strangers. Men that intend to travaile into forraigne kingdomes with any advantage to their parts, or improvement of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, doe before-hand season and prepare themselves with the language, with some topographicall observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Countrey, with some generall notions of the ingenie, manners, formes, civilities, entertainements of the natives there, doe delight to converse with those men who are best learned in these or the like particulars. Surely we al professe a journey to heaven, a pilgrimage in this present world, to have our conversation now where wee looke to have our everlasting abode with the Lord
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16264:122"/>
hereafter. Now in the Gospell of Christ we have as it were a map, a topographicall delineation of those glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mansions which are there prepared for the Church, we have a taste and description of the manners of that people, we have some rudiments of the heavenly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in one word, wee have abundantly enough, not onely to prepare us for it, but to enflame all the desires of our soule unto it, even as exiles or captives desire to returne to their native Countrey. Now then if wee no way regard to study it, or acquaint our selves with it, if wee seeme to desire the sight of Christ in heaven, and when we may every day have a most blessed view of his face in the Glasse of his Gospel, we turne away our eyes, and regard it not, we doe as good as proclaime to all the world, that either our hopes of heaven are very slender, or our care thereof little or none at all. And this I take for a most undoubted truth, that there is so much of the knowledge, grace, and spirit of Christ, and through him of the Father in the holy Scriptures (and those onely are the things which make heaven to bee the home and the hope of men) as that whosoever neglecteth the study of them, and suffereth the Scriptures to lye by him as a sealed booke, would bee every whit as unwilling if hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven gates were wide open unto him, to relinquish his portion in the earth, and to spend his time in the fruition or contemplation of that glorious Countrey.</p>
            <p>Lastly, wee honour the Gospell when in our greatest distresses we make it our <hi>Altar of refuge,</hi> our doore of escape, the ground of all our hope and comfort, the only anchor to stay our soules in any spiritual tempest, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly staffe to leane upon in our greatest darkenesse. What ever other carnall comforts men may for a time rejoyce in, they will all prove but as a fire of sparkes, or as a blaze of thornes, which can yeeld no solid or abiding light unto the soule. When sinners in Sion begin once to be affraid, and to be surprized with the fearefulnesse
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16264:123"/>
of a guilty soule, when the affrighted conscience shall put that dreadfull question in the Prophet to it selfe, How can I dwell <hi>with devouring fire?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esai. 33.14, 24.</note> how can I dwell <hi>with everlasting burnings?</hi> there will no other answere allay the scorching terrour thereof but that in the end of the same Chapter, <hi>The people that dwell therein shall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their iniquity.</hi> A man may as soone drinke up the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the sea with spunges, or remove mountaines with one of his fingers, as be able to draine out these close and incorporated sorrowes which together with sinne doe soake through the whole substance of the soule, with vaine companie, worldly imployments, or youthfull pleasure. All these doe but respite them for a time that they may returne the stronger. But if thou wilt indeed be comforted, sue out thy pardon, flye to the court of mercy which is erected in the Gospell; This was our Saviours argument to the man that was sicke of the Palsie,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.2.</note> 
               <hi>Sonne, be of good cheere, thy sinnes be forgiven thee.</hi> There is no worldly affliction goeth closer to the life of a man than sickenesse, and yet as in the midst of laughter the heart of a wicked man is sorrowfull, because it is still under the guilt of sinne, so in the midst of paine and sorrow the heart of a godly man may be cheerefull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his sinnes are forgiven.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, we may for our better encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in so necessary a dutie lay together these consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations: First, in point of <hi>honour</hi> we should learne to walke as becommeth the Gospell, for the Gospell is a Christians Glorie, and therefore ought to bee preserved in his heart, as his chiefest priviledge. The Spirit of God will not endure to have holy things profaned as if they were common or uncleane. <hi>Belshazzer</hi> converted the consecrated vessels of the Temple into instruments of luxurie and intemperance; but the Lord temper'd his wine with dregges, and made them prove unto him as cups of trembling and astonishment. <hi>Herod</hi> polluted

Antiq. lib.</hi> 16. <hi>ca.</hi> 11. 2 Mac. 3.5.</note> and God made fire rise out of the earth to devoure the over-busie searchers. <hi>Antiochus</hi> ransack'd the Temple of the Lord; <hi>Heliodorus</hi> emptied the treasures of their consecrated monies; <hi>Pompey</hi> defiled the Sabbath and the Sanctuarie; <hi>Crassus</hi> robb'd the house of God of ten thousand talents.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tacit. Hist lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Ioseph. Antiq. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</note> But inquire into the event of these insolencies, and we shall finde that true then, of which latter ages have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven many examples, and are still likely to give more, that stollen bread hath gravell in it to choake those that devoure it, that ruine is ever the childe of sacrilege, that mischiefe setteth a period to the lives and designes of prophane men. Now then if the Lord were thus jealous for the types of his Gospell, how, thinke wee, can he endure to see the Gospell it selfe dishonoured by an unsuteable profession, or the bloud of the Covenant trampled under foot, as if it were a common or uncleane thing? In the contempt of the Gospell there is more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour done unto every person of the blessed Trinity, than can be by any other sinne. An undervaluing of the <hi>Fathers wisdome,</hi> that great mysterie and counsell of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which was hidden from former ages: and what an indignity is it unto him, for a man to shut out the light of the sunne, that so hee may enjoy that pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full benefit of darkenesse, to gaze upon the false gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of rotten wood, or of earthly slime, the deceit wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would bee by the true light discovered? And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing of his <hi>wonderfull love,</hi> as if he had put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto a needlesse compassion, and might have kept it still in his owne bosome. A scorne unto the Sonne of God, when wee suffer him to stand at our doores with his locks wet with the dew of heaven, to put his finger into the hole of the locke, as if he desired to steale an entrance upon the soule; to emptie, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to denie himselfe, to suffer the wrongs of men, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:16264:124"/>
the wrath of God, and after all this to have that pretious bloud which was squeezed out with such woefull ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, counted no other than the bloud of a common ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, nor that sacred body which was thus broken, discerned from the bodies of the theeves which were crucified with him. An indignitie beyond all apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to <hi>the spirit of Grace,</hi> when wee suffer him to waite daily at our Bethesda, our houses of mercy, and all in vaine, to spend his sacred breath in the ministerie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, in doubling and redoubling his requests un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our soules, that we would be contented to bee saved, and we shall harden our hearts, and stop our eares, and set up the pride and stoutnesse of our owne reasonings, till wee doe even wearie him and chide him away from us. Now this is a certaine rule, God will not lose any honour by mens sinnes; if they refuse to give him the glory of his mercy, he will shew the glory of his Power and justice, in treading downe the proud enemies of Christ under his feet. As they that honour him shall be honoured; so they who cast any disgrace upon his truth and covenant, shall be sure to meet with shame and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour at the last.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to avoid <hi>Scandall.</hi> The Gospell is the <hi>light</hi> of a nation: And sinnes in the light as they are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with more impudence, so likewise with more offence. An offence or scandall tending unto sinne in misguiding the weake, in heartening and confirming the obdurate, in opening the mouthes of adversaries to revile our holy profession; and a scandall tending unto sorrow in woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hearts of the godly, and vexing their righteous spirits with a filthy conversation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, wee should learne to walke as becommeth the Gospell, even in respect to the <hi>state,</hi> for the Gospell is the foundation of true peace and tranquility in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, and those who shew forth the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are, as it were, Lions about the Throne of their King.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16264:124"/>
               <hi>By righteousnesse the Throne is established, but sinne is a reproch unto any people.</hi>

If Christians live as if they had no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, or as if they had another Gospell, what can wee expect but that God should either plague us, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake us, either send his judgements, or curse his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings?</p>
            <p>Lastly, the Gospell makes sinne more filthy, if it doe not purge it; as a taper in the hand of a Ghost makes him seeme more gastly than he was before. Sweet oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment causeth ranke and strong bodies to smell worse than they did before.<note place="margin">

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:16264:125"/>
those sinnes which are committed against it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all these considerations we should labor to walke worthy of so glorious a Gospell, and of so great a salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thus have we at large spoken of the <hi>Rod of Christs strength,</hi> as it is <hi>Insigne regium,</hi> or <hi>Sceptrum majestatis,</hi> an Ensigne and Rod of Majestie: we are now to speake a little of it as it is <hi>Pedum pastorale,</hi> an episcopall Rod, which denoteth much heedfulnesse and tender care. This is the Precept which the Apostle giveth unto the Pastors of the Church that they should <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>The Care of all the Churches.</hi> And this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration affordeth us another note out of the words,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.28.</note> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>Christ in the ministerie of his Gospell and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of his spirit, is full of care and tendernesse towards his Church.</hi> This Christ maketh one maine point of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position betweene himselfe and hirelings, that these <hi>Care not for the flock,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.12, 13.

The Lord committed the Church unto Christ as their Head, gave them into his hands, not as an ordinary gift, wherein he did relinquish his owne interest in them or care of them (for hee careth for them still) but as a blessed <hi>depositum</hi> entrusted them with him,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.7.</note> as the choicest of his Iewels, as the most pretious casket amongst all the treasures of the Creation,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.17.</note> that he should polish, preserve, present them faultlesse, and without spot before the presence of his glory at the last day.<note place="margin">Iud. v. 24.</note> And for this purpose hee gave <note place="margin">Eph. 5.26, 27.</note>him <hi>a Commandement</hi> of the greatest care and tendernesse
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16264:125"/>

Heb. 2.17.3.2.</note> and should lose nothing of all that was given him, but should raise it up at the last day. So that now want of care or compassion of Christ towards his Church, would be an argument of unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse; If he had not been a mercifull high priest, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he have beene faithfull to him that appointed him, for he was appointed to bee mercifull, and was by the Spirit of God filled with most tender affections, and qualified with an heart fuller of compassion than the sea is of waters, that he might commiserate the distresses of his people, and take care of their salvations.</p>
            <p>Notably doth this Care of Christ shew it selfe: First, in the apportioning and measuring forth to every o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

very tender, weake, and fearefull; and these he gathers with his arme, and carries in his bosome, shewes them that his care doth not onely reach unto the least of his kingdome, but that his compassions are most enlarged to those that are too weake to helpe themselves,<note place="margin">Esai. 66.11.</note> that hee hath brests of consolation to satisfie and delight with abundance the smallest infant of his kingdome. Some are broken-hearted, and those he bindeth; some are captives,<note place="margin">Esai. 61.1, 2, 3.</note> to those hee proclaimeth liberty; some are mourners in Sion, and for them he hath beautie, and oile of joy, and garments of praise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some are bruized reedes, whom every curse or commination is able to crush, and some are smoaking flax, whom every temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is able to discourage, and yet even these doth hee so carefully tend, and furnish with such proportionable supplies of his Spirit of grace, as makes that seede and sparkle of holinesse, which hee began in them, get up above all their owne feares, or their enemies machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Esai. 42.3.

In one word, some are strong and others are weake; the strong hee feedeth, the weake he cureth, the strong hee confirmeth, the weake hee restoreth, hee hath trials for the strong to exercise their graces, and hee hath cordials for the weake to strengthen theirs. According unto the severall estates, and unto the secret demands of each members condition; so doth the Care of Christ se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally shew it selfe towards the same in his Word: there is provision for any want, medicine for any disease, comforts for any distresse, promises for any faith, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres to any doubt, directions in any difficulty, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons against any temptation, preservatives against any sinne, restoratives against lapse; garments to cover my nakednesse, meate to satisfie my hunger, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke to cure my diseases, armour to protect my person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a

treasure to provide for my posteritie. If I am rich, I have there the wisedome of God to instruct me; and if I am poore, I have there the obligations of God to enrich mee. If I am honourable, I have there the sight of my sins to make me vile; and rules of moderation to make me hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: If I am of low degree, I have there the Communion and consanguinitie of Christ, the participation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, the adoption of God the Father to make me noble. If I am learned, I have there a law of charitie to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it unto edification, and if I am unlearned, I have there a Spirit which searcheth the deepe things of God, which can give wisedome unto the simple, which can reveale se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets unto babes, which can command light to shine out of darknes, which can give the light of the knowledge of the glory, fulnesse, and love of God in the face of Iesus Christ, which can make me, though ignorant of all other things, to learne Christ, in whom there is more wisdome, more various and admirable curiositie, more filling and plentifull satisfaction, more proportion to the boundlesse desires of a soule once rectified, more fruit and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which should bee the end of every Christian mans learning) than in all other knowledge which either past or present ages can afford. In one word, every where and in all things I am there taught how to want, and how to abound, and how to do all things through Christ that strengthens me. A Christian can be set in no estate, wherein the abundant Care of Christ over him is not in the Gospell wonderfully magnified. And commonly in the greatest straits he sheweth the greatest care, as waters runne strongest in the narrowest passages: when we walk in darknesse and have no light, when we seeke water and there is none, and our tongue faileth for thirst, then is his fittest time to helpe us, and then is our fittest time to stay upon him.

            <p>But then a little compassion is enough for those that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16264:127"/>
had deserved none, for those that had provoked scorne and displeasure against themselves: but herein is the care and tendernesse of Christ abundantly magnified, that it hath in it all the ingredients of a most soveraigne mercy, that nothing more could have beene done,<note place="margin">Esay 5.4.</note> than he hath done for us. First,<note place="margin">Hos. 11.8. Ier. 31.20. Ephes. 3.19. Esay. 55.9.

            <p>Secondly, there is a <hi>studie and inquisitivenesse</hi> how to doe good, a debating within himselfe, a consulting and projecting how to shew mercy, an arguing, as it were, of his grace with mans sinne, and his owne severitie; <hi>How shall I give thee up Ephraim?</hi>

Hebr. 13.8.</note> they have many seales by which they are confirmed, the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the immutabilitie, and the oath of God: If there were not continuance in his mercies, if he were not the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever in his truth and fidelitie to his Church; if hee should change and turne from us, as oft as we forsake him, if he should leave us in the hand of our owne counsell, and not afford us such daily supplies of his Spirit, as might support us against the ruinous disposition of our owne nature, wee should be children of wrath every day anew. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth the abundant care of Christ in the Gospell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it selfe unto us, that though we are <hi>wormes</hi> in our selves,<note place="margin">Esay 41.10-14.</note> full of weaknesse, and of earthly affections, yet God hath <hi>a right-hand of righteousnesse,</hi> which can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us; that though we are bent to back-sliding, yet <hi>he is God and not man,</hi> unchangeable in his Covenant with the Persons, almighty in his power and mercy towards the sinnes of men, both to cover them with his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and to cure them by his Spirit, both to forgive for the time past,<note place="margin">Hos. 11.7-11.</note> and to heale and prevent back-slidings for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that he might be fit for so meane and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16264:128"/>
a service, there was <hi>a lessening and emptying of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe</hi>; he was contented to be subject to his owne Law,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.7, 8.</note> to be the childe of his owne creature, to take upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe not the similitude onely,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.5.</note> but the infirmities of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flesh, to descend from his throne, and to put on rags,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> in one word, <hi>to become poore for us, that we through his povertie might be made rich.</hi> Amongst men,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.9.</note> many will be willing to shew so much mercy as will consist with their state and greatnesse, and may tend to beget a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther distance, and to magnifie their heighth and honour in the mindes of men; but when it comes to this exigent, that a man must debase himselfe to doe good unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his compassion will be to a miserable man no benefit, except he suffer ignominie, and undergoe a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile condition for him, and doe, as it were, change habits with the man whom he pities; what region of the earth will afford a man who will freely make his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be the price of his brothers redemption? yet this is the manner of Christs Care for us, who though hee were the Lord of Glory, the brightnesse of his Fathers Majestie, and the expresse Image of his Person, did yet humble himselfe to endure shame, and the contradiction of sinners, that he might be the Author and finisher of our faith.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There was not onely an humbling or meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall emptying of himselfe, in that he made himselfe of no reputation; but there was likewise <hi>a reall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per emptying of himselfe,</hi> he therein testified his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Care of the businesses of man, that for them he put himselfe to the greatest expence, and to the exhausting of a richer treasure, than any either heaven or earth could afford besides: yee were not redeemed, saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, with corruptible things, as silver and gold from your vaine conversation, <hi>but with the precious bloud of Christ, as of a Lambe without blemish, and without spot:</hi> That which no man will bestow upon himselfe, and that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16264:129"/>
which was in nature, and might justly in love have beene neerest to Christ himselfe, even the soule in his body, and the bloud in his veines, he was contented to make a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for them, who powred it out as the bloud of a malefactour.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, besides this great price which he paid to his Father for us, hee hath opened another treasure of his <hi>Grace and Spirit,</hi> out of which he affordeth us daily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and putteth into our hands, as it were, an heavenly stocke, for the better negotiating and improvement of our salvation. Hee setteth up his Spirit in our hearts, thereby conversing and communing with us, teaching us the trade of the citizens of heaven, and of laying up treasures there, where our finall abode must be, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our conversation and commerce with innumerable companies of Angels, and with the spirits of just men made perfect, and withall that generall assembly or Church of the first-borne, which is inrolled in heaven.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to all this he addeth <hi>Preparations and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> for the future for us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9. Phil. 4.19.</note> he doth not onely <hi>give,</hi> but he <hi>prepareth things for those that love him,</hi> and what ever is wanting now, he will <hi>make it up unto us in the riches of his glory.</hi> It was for our expediencie that hee left the Church on earth (in regard of his carnall presence) and went unto his Father againe: Hee was not beholden to change o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dient, to seale and secure our full and finall redemption unto us; for as the Leviticall Priest entred not into the holiest of all without bloud, so neither did
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16264:129"/>
Christ into heaven without making satisfaction, hee first obtained eternall redemption for us,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.12.</note> and then he entred into the holy place, and expedient to prepare a place for us, that the glory which is given to him, hee may give unto us, that being raised up together,<note place="margin">Iohn 14 2, 3.</note> we may likewise <hi>sit together</hi> with him in heavenly places; for when the head is crowned,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.22.</note> the whole body is invested with roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all honour: Hee by the vertue of his Ascension opened the kingdome of heaven for all beleevers;<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.6.</note> even the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before Christ entred not in without respect unto that consummate redemption which hee was in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of time to accomplish for his Church. As a man may be admitted into an actuall possession of land, onely in the vertue of covenants, and under the intuition of a payment to be afterwards performed. Thus we see in how many things the abundant Care of Christ doth shew it selfe towards the Church.</p>
            <p>And as there are therein all the particulars of a tender care, so by the Gospell likewise, doe all the fruits and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits thereof redound unto the faithfull. First, in the Gospell he <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 23 5. Mica 7.13.15. Ezek. 34.14, 23. Matth. 15.26. Phil. 4.12. Heb 6.12. Ioh. 15.4.</note> 
               <hi>feedeth</hi> and strengthneth them, even in the presence of their enemies he prepareth them a table, and feedeth them with his rod, and according to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of Aegypt he sheweth unto them marvellous things. And therefore our Saviour calleth his Gospell, <hi>The childrens bread.</hi> It is that which quickneth, which strengthneth them, which maketh them fruitfull in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall workes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He <hi>upholdeth</hi> them from fainting; if their strength at any time faile, hee <hi>leadeth them gently</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>teacheth them to goe.</hi>

not to their beasts, and <hi>with bands of love.</hi> As an Eagle sluttereth over her young, and spreadeth abroad her wings, and taketh them and beareth them on her wings: so doth the Lord in his Gospel sweetly lead on and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the faithfull unto strength and salvation: he dealeth with them as a compassionate nurse with a tender infant, condescendeth to their strength and capacitie; when we stumble, he keepeth us; when we fall he raiseth us; when we faint, hee beareth us in his armes; when wee grow weary of well-doing, the Gospell is full of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to hearten us, full of spirit to revive us, full of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to establish us, full of beautie to entice us; when we seeme to be in a wildernesse, a maze, where there is no issue,<note place="margin">Hos. 2.14, 15.</note> nor view of deliverance, even there he openeth a doore of hope, and allureth, and speaketh comfortably unto us.</p>

Sanctuary, not for <hi>meat</hi> onely, but for <hi>medicine</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, as hee healeth our diseases, and giveth us strength, so in the mids of enemies and dangers he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth our feares, and giveth us <hi>comfort</hi> and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note n="h" place="margin">Ezek. 34 25.</note> 
               <hi>I will make with them,</hi> saith he, <hi>a Covenant of peace, and I will cause evill beasts to cease out of the Land, and they shall dwell safely in the wildernesse, and sleepe in the woods.</hi>

            <p>Lastly, hee keepeth a <hi>continuall watch</hi> over us by his spirituall presence and protection: As <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 31.40.</note> 
               <hi>Iacob</hi> testified his great care for the good of <hi>Laban,</hi> that the <hi>drought consumed him by day, and the frost by night, and that sleepe departed from his eyes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 121.4.</note> so doth the Lord commend his care towards the Church, in that he is the keeper or the watch-man of Israel,<note place="margin">Exod. 33.14.</note> which doth neither slumber nor sleepe. His presence is with his people to guide them in their pilgrimage, and unto which they have daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course for comfort and establishment. In that great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest when Christ was asleepe in the ship, his Disciples awaked him and expostulated with him, <hi>Master,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Marke 4.38.40.</note> 
               <hi>carest thou not that we perish?</hi> But when hee had rebuked the wind and the sea, hee then rebuked them likewise, hee
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:16264:131"/>
had another storme of feare and unbeleefe to calme in their hearts, who could not see him in his providence watching over them, when his body slept.</p>
            <p>The grounds of this great Care, which Christ in his Gospell testifieth towards his Church, are these: First, <hi>He is our kinsman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 25 5. Ruth 3.9.4 5. Levit. 25.25.</note> there is affinitie in bloud, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a naturall care and tendernesse in affection: wee know amongst the Jewes when a woman had buried an husband without fruit of his body, the next of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred was to take care of her, and to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance: And if any man had waxen poore, and sold any of his possession, the neerest kinsman was to have the first option in the recovery and redemption of it: And from hence the Apostle argueth to prove the mercifulnesse and fidelitie of Christ, in san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying or bringing many sonnes unto glory (for I take those phrases to be in that place equivalent) because he was <hi>not ashamed to call us brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2.11.17.</note> 
               <hi>but was made in all things like unto us.</hi> And wee may observe that in the Scripture he hath almost all the relations of consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to note that his care is universall and of all sorts. He is a <hi>Father, Behold, I and the children which thou hast given me:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 8 18.</note> and the care of a father is to governe, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, to instruct, to lay up for his children. He is as <hi>a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 49.15. Esay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ephes. 5.25.32.</note> he carrieth his young ones in his bosome, he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them as a hen her chickens, hee milketh unto them out of the brests of consolation. And thus he hath a care of indulgence and compassion. Hee is a <hi>Brother, Goe to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and unto my God, and your God.</hi> And the care of a brother is to counsell, advise, and comfort. A brother is borne for adversity. Lastly, hee is a <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>; yee are married to him who is raised from the dead, and that word compriseth all care, to love, to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, to instruct, to maintaine, to protect, to compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to adorne, to communicate both his secrets and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16264:131"/>
himselfe. A father may maintaine his childe, but hee cannot suckle it; a mother may give it a brest, but shee cannot ordinarily provide it a portion; a brother can give counsell, but he cannot give himselfe unto his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: A husband may comfort his wife, but it becomes him not to correct her. There is no degree of neerenesse that hath power enough to answer al the offices of love, but in one point or other it will be defective: Therefore Christ is set forth unto us <hi>under all relations of bloud and unitie</hi>; to note that there can no case or condition of the Church be supposed, wherein the care of Christ shall be impotent or deficient towards it, wherein he is not able to correct, to nourish, to instruct, to counsell, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to provide for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is our <hi>Companion</hi> in sufferings, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe suffered and was tempted, and this the Apostle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a maine ground of his care towards us,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15.</note> and of our confidence in him: wee have not an high Priest which cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.17.</note> but was in <hi>all points tempted as we are,</hi> onely without sinne;<note place="margin">Hebr. 5.2.</note> and therefore he is able to succour those that are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to take compassion on those that are out of the way, because he was compassed with such infirmities, as were much lesse grievous than the weight of sinne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He is <hi>our Head,</hi> and so is One with us in a neerer relation than that of affinitie, in a relation of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for he and his members make but <hi>one Christ.</hi> And being head, hee is the seat of Care, and the fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>taine of influences into the rest of the body; all the wisedome, spirits, senses, which are in the head, are there placed as in a Watch-tower, or Councell-chamber, to consult and provide for the good of the whole; the eye seeth, the eare heareth, the tongue speaketh, the fancie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, the memory retaineth for the welfare of the other members,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.25.</note> and they have <hi>all the same care one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:16264:132"/>Fourthly, He is <hi>our Advocate,</hi> and Mediatour, he is the onely practicer in the court of heaven,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2.2.</note> and therefore he must needs be full of the businesses of his Church: It is his office to dispatch the affaires of those that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and crave his favour and intercession to debate their causes, and he is both faithfull and mercifull in his place,<note place="margin">Hebr. 3.2.</note> and besides, furnished with such an unmeasurable unction of Spirit, and vast abilities to transact all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses of his Church, that whosoever commeth unto him for his counsell and intercession,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.37.</note> 
               <hi>hee will in no wise cast them out,</hi> or refuse their cause: And this is one great assurance we may take comfort in, that be our matters never so foule and unexcusable in themselves, yet the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry entertaining him of our counsell, and the leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wisdome, power, fidelity, and mercy to expedite our businesses, to compassionate our estate, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue us from our owne demerits, doth, as it were, alter the propertie of the cause, and produce a cleane contrary issue to that which the evidence of the thing in triall would of it selfe have created. And as we may observe that men of extraordinary abilities in the Law, delight to wrestle with some difficult businesse, and to shew their learning in clearing matters of greatest intricacie, and perplexitie before; so doth Christ esteeme himselfe most honoured, and the vertue and wisedome of his Crosse magnified, when in cases of sorest extremitie, of most hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous guilt, of most blacke and uncomfortable darknesse of soule, which pose not onely the presumptions, but the hope, faith, conjectures, thoughts, contrivances which the hearts of men can even in wishes make to themselves for mercy, they doe yet trust him <hi>whose thoughts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above their thoughts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 55.8. Esay 50.10.</note> 
               <hi>and whose wayes above their wayes; who is there among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darknesse and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God:</hi> When the soule can goe unto

            <p>And indeed <hi>a right judgement of God will helpe us to imploy our faith in any condition.</hi> In wealth men are apt to trust in their abundance, to stand upon their moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and to say, I shall never be moved. But now in this estate, if a man conceive aright of God, that it is he who giveth strength to be rich, &amp; who giveth riches strength to doe us good, that hee can blast the greatest estate with an imperceptible consumption, and in the midst of a mans sufficiencie make him bee in straits, that hee can embitter all with his sore displeasure, and not suffer the floore nor the winepresse to feed him: In great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and deepe counsels, if a man consider that the counsell of the Lord shall stand, and that hee can turne the wisdome of oracles into foolishnesse, and catch the wise in their owne craftinesse: In great provisions of worldly strength, and humane combinations, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that God can take off the wheeles, and amaze the phantasies, and dissipate the affections, and melt the spirits, and way-lay the enterprises of the hugest hosts of men, that he can arme flies, and lice, and dust, and wind, and starres, and every small unexpected contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie against the strongest opposition; it must need make him set his rest, and hang his confidences and assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon an higher principle.

in the time of famine, that when the young Lions famish for hunger, (they which live not by the fruits on the earth, but by their prey, they which can feed of the dead bodies of those other creatures whom a famine had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured) yet even then hee can provide abundantly for his; that when things are marvellous unto us,<note place="margin">Zech. 8.6.</note> then they are easie unto him; that when they are impossible unto us, then they are possible with him;<note place="margin">Marke 10.27.</note> that he can lead in a wildernesse,<note place="margin">Psal. 136.16.</note> and feed with an unknowne and an unsus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected bread; that when the light of the Sun and the Moone shall faile,<note place="margin">Ier. 2.6.</note> he can be an everlasting light and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his people; that <hi>as a Father,</hi> so he pitieth;<note place="margin">Amos 2.10.</note> and <hi>as an heavenly Father,</hi> so he knoweth, and can supply all our needs;<note place="margin">Deut. 8.15, 16.</note> that when we are without any wisdome to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint, or strength to withstand the confederacies of men, when they come with chariots of iron,<note place="margin">Esay 60.19.</note> and walls of brasse,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.32.</note> even then the eyes of the Lord runne to and fro to shew himselfe valiant in the behalfe of those that walke uprightly, that he can then order some accident,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 16.9.</note> produce some engine, discover some way to extricate and to cleere all;<note place="margin">Phil. 4.6.</note> then will a man learne to be carefull or distracted in nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication, with thankesgiving, make his request knowne unto him who is at hand, and who careth for him.</p>
            <p>The like may be said of mens spirituall condition; when men despaire, as <hi>Cain,</hi> that their sinne is greater than can be forgiven? the onely ground is, because they judge not aright of God in Christ, they looke not on him in his Gospell as a God that careth for them, they doe not leane upon the staffe of his strength. Despaire is an affection growing out of the sense of sin and wrath, as it is, <hi>malum arduum, instans, &amp; ineluctabile,</hi> an evill too heavie to be borne, and yet impossible to be removed. All victory ariseth either out of an inward power of our owne, or by the assistance of forren power, which is
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16264:135"/>
more than our owne. Now then when we despaire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of sinne, this commeth first from the consideration of our owne everlasting disability to breake thorow sin by our owne strength; and this is a good despaire, which helpeth to drive men unto Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it commeth from a misconceiving either of the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Care</hi> of those which might assist us, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>from the mis-judging of Gods power,</hi> for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of sinnes is an act of omnipotencie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Lord proclaimeth himselfe a forgiver of iniquitie, transgression, and sinne, he introduceth it with his titles of power, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, Gracious and mercifull,</hi>

Let a mans sinnes be never so crimson, and his continuance therein never so obdurate (I speake this for the prevention of despaire, not for the encouragement of security or hardnesse) yet as soone as he is willing to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16264:135"/>
turne, God is willing to save, as soone as he hath an heart to attend, God hath a tongue to speake salvation unto him. Wee see then the way to trust in Christ is to looke upon him as the Bishop of our soules, as the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of our peace, as one that careth and provideth for us, as one that hath promised to save to the uttermost, to give supplies of his Spirit, and Grace in time of need,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.25. Heb. 4.16. Ioh. 10.10. Heb. 13.9.</note> to give us daily bread, and life in abundance, to bee with us alwayes to the end of the world, never to faile us nor forsake us.</p>

            <p>Now the ground of all this power, majestie, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Gospell is here set forth unto us in two words. First, it is the strength of Christ; Secondly, it is sent by God himselfe. The Lord shall <hi>send</hi> the Rod of <hi>Thy strength</hi> out of Sion.</p>
            <p>Here then we may first note, That <hi>the Gospel is Christs owne Power and strength,</hi> and the Power of God his Father, by whom it is sent abroad; So the Apostle cals it, The <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1.16. 1 Cor. 2.4, 5.</note> Power of God unto Salvation, and the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Spirit, and of Power; that our faith should not stand in the wisedome of men, but in the Power of God. Therefore in one place we are said to be <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 6.45.</note> 
               <hi>taught of God,</hi> and in another to be <note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 4.20, 21.</note>

               <hi>Gospell of the blessed God,</hi> and in another the <note n="e" place="margin">Rom 15.19.</note> 
               <hi>Gospell of Christ,</hi> to note that <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 5.19.</note> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things the Father doth in his Church, the same
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16264:136"/>
the Sonne doth also, and that the Father doth not make knowne his will of mercie, but by his Sonne;<note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> that as in the Sonne he did reconcile the world unto himselfe; so in the Son hee did <note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 1.18.

Christ is both the Matter and the Authour of the Gospell. As in the worke of our Redemption he was both the sacrifice, and the Priest to offer, and the Altar to sanctifie it: So in the dispensation of the Gospell, Christ is both the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the Preacher, and the Power, which giveth blessing unto all. He is the Sermon, <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.23. 2 Cor. 4.5. Col. 1.28.</note> 
               <hi>Wee preach Christ crucified,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>wee preach not our selves, but Christ Iesus the Lord.</hi> And he is the Preacher, <note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 12.25. Eph. 2.17. 1 Pet. 3.19.</note>

               <hi>The dead shall heare the voice of the Sonne of man, and they that heare shall live; for as the Father hath life in himselfe, so hath he given to the Sonne to have life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.

So then the Word is his, but the service ours.</p>
            <p>From whence both the Ministers of the Word, and they which heare it may learne their severall duties. First, we should learne to <note n="s" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.11. 1 Cor. 4.1. 2 Cor. 5.19, 20.</note> speake as the Oracles of God, as the Servants and Stewards of a higher Master, whose Word it is which wee preach, and whose Church it is which we serve. We should therefore doe his worke, as
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16264:136"/>
men that are set in his stead, preach him, and not our selves. There can bee no greater sacrilege in the world, than to put our owne image upon the Ordinances of Christ, than to make another Gospell than we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.

For hereby men doe even justle Christ out of his owne throne, and, as it were, snatch the Scepter of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome out of his owne hand, boldly intruding upon that sacred and uncommunicable dignitie which the Father hath given to his Sonne onely, which is to bee the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of his Gospell, and the totall and adequate Object of all Evangelicall Preaching. This sacrilege of selfe-preaching is committed three manner of wayes: First, when men make themselves the Authors of their owne preaching, when they preach their owne inventions, and make their owne braines the seminaries and forges of a new faith; when they so glosse the pure Word of God, as that withall they poison and pervert it.

Ier. 23.2, 29.</note> so horrid are the consequences of taking away the Gospell of Christ from him, and making it the Rod not of his strength, but of our owne pride or passion. Wee must therefore alwayes remember that the Gospell is Christs owne, and that will encourage us to speake it as we ought to speake.</p>
            <p>First, with authoritie and boldnesse, without silence or connivence at the sinnes of men. Though in our private and personall relations we are to shew all modestie, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and lowlinesse of carriage towards all men, yet in our masters businesses, wee must not respect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, nor bee daunted at the faces of men; <hi>Paul</hi> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner was not affraid to preach of righteousnesse and temperance, and judgement to come before a corrupt and lascivious Prince, though it made him tremble.</p>
            <p>Secondly, with wisedome; as a Scribe instructed to the kingdome of heaven. This was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> care to worke as a wise master-builder:<note place="margin">Mat. 13 52. 1 Cor. 3 10.</note> When Christs enemies watched him to picke something out of his mouth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might accuse him, wee finde so much depth of wisedome in the answeres and behaviours of Christ, as utterly disappointed them of their expectations,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.22, 46.</note> and strooke them with such amazement that they never durst aske him questions more: So should wee endeavour to behave our selves in such manner as that our ministerie may not be blamed,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.3.</note> nor the truth of God exposed to censure or disadvantages: for sacred truthes may bee sometimes either so unseasonably, or so indigestedly, and uncoherently delivered, as may rather open than stop the mouthes of gain-sayers, and sooner discredit the truth than convert the adversary. The Apostle saith that we are to <hi>make a difference to save some with compassion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iud. v. 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>others with feare.</hi> This is to speake <hi>a word in due season,</hi> and as our Saviour did, <hi>to speake as men are able to heare</hi>;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16264:138"/>
to presse the Word upon the conscience with such seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and sutable enforcements as may bee most likely to convince those judgements, and to allure those affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we have to doe withall. It is not knowledge in the generall, but the right use thereof,<note place="margin">Prov. 11.30. Prov. 15.2. 2 Cor. 12.16. Act. 17.23, 28.</note> and wise appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto particulars which winneth soules. <hi>The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright.</hi> This is that heavenly Craft wherewith the Apostle caught the Corinthians as it were <hi>by guile:</hi> such Art he useth towards the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers of Athens, not exasperating men who were heady and confident of their owne rules, but seeming rather to make up the defects which themselves in the inscription of their Altar confessed, and to reveale that very God unto them, whom they worshipped, but did not know. Therefore wee finde him there honouring their owne learning, and out of that disputing for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and against idolatry, to shew that Christian Religion was no way against that learning or rectified reason which they seemed to professe. The like art hee used towards king <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 26.2, 3, 27, 29.</note> first presuming of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and credit which he gave to the Prophets, and then meeting and setting on his inclinable disposition to embrace the Gospell; like the wisedome of the servants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> unto <hi>Ahab, They did diligently observe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing would come from him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 20.33.</note> 
               <hi>and did hastily catch it; and they said, Thy Brother Benhadad.</hi> And the like wisedome he used every where, hee denied himselfe his owne libertie, and made himselfe a servant unto all;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.19-23.</note> to the Jew as a Jew, to the Greeke as a Greeke, to the weake as weake, and all things to all, that by all meanes he might save some, and so further the Gospell. One while he used Circumcision that he might thereby gaine the weake Jewes, another while hee forbade Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that he might not misguide the converted Gentiles, nor give place by subjection unto false brethren. <hi>Who is weake,</hi> saith he, <hi>and I am not weake? who is offended,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11 29.</note> 
               <hi>and I
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:16264:139"/>
burne not?</hi> His care of mens soules made him take upon him every mans affection, and accommodate himselfe unto every mans temper; that hee might not offend the weake, nor exasperate the mightie, nor dis-hearten the beginner, nor affright those which were without from comming in,<note place="margin">

But all this it doth <hi>non mentiendo, sed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiendo,</hi> not by belying the truth, but by pitying the sinner. It is not the wisedome of the flesh, nor to bee learned of men. The Scripture alone is able to make the man of God <hi>wise unto the worke of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, with meeknesse, for that is the childe of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <hi>Who is a wise man,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iames, let him shew out of a good conversation his workes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with meeknesse of wisedome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 3.13, 17.</note> and againe, the <hi>wisedome which is from above is pure, peaceable, gentle, easie to be intreated, full of mercie.</hi> The Gospell is Christs Gospell, and it must be preached with Christs spirit, which was very meeke and lowly;<note place="margin">Matth. 11.29.21.5.</note> When the Disciples would have called for fire from heaven upon the Samaritanes for their indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie done unto Christ, hee rebuked them in a milde and compassionate manner,<note place="margin">Luk. 9.55.</note> 
               <hi>Ye know not what spirit ye are of.</hi> A right Evangelicall Spirit is ever a meeke and a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Spirit. <hi>If a man</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spirituall restore such an one in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekenesse:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6.1. 2 Tim. 2.25.</note> and againe, <hi>In meekenesse,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>instruct those that oppose themselves,</hi> if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure will give them repentance to the acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the truth.</p>
            <p>Lastly, with faithfulnesse, in as much as the Gospell is
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:16264:139"/>
none of ours, but Christs whose servants and stewards we are. Christ was faithfull,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.2. 1 Cor. 4.2. 2 Tim. 2.2.</note> though hee were a Son over his owne house, and therefore might in reason have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd the more liberty to doe his owne will: much more doth it become us who are but his Officers, to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full too, not to dissemble any thing which the estate and exigence of those soules committed to our charge shall require us to speake, not to adde, diminish,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.2. Gal. 1.6. Act. 20.27. Heb. 13.17.</note> or deviate from our commission, preaching one Gospell in one place, and another in another; but to deliver onely the Counsell of God, and to watch over the soules of men, as they that must give an account.</p>
            <p>Againe, since the Gospell is Christs <hi>owne Power,</hi> wee must all learne from thence two duties: first, to receive it as from him with the affections of subjects which have been bought by him, that is, first in hearing of the word to expect principally <hi>his voyce,</hi> and to seeke him spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from heaven. This is the nature of Christs sheep,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.4, 5, 27.</note> to turne away their eares from the voyce of strangers, and <hi>to heare him.</hi> Two things principally there are which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the voice of Christ in the ministerie of the word: First, it is a spirituall and <hi>heavenly doctrine,</hi> full of purity, righteousnesse, and peace, touching the soule,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.12. Iam. 3.17.</note> with a kind of secret and magneticall vertue, whereby the thoughts, affections, conscience, and conversation are turned from their earthly center, and drawne up unto him as Eagles to a carcasse. Secondly, it is a powerfull, an edged, a <hi>piercing doctrine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> If the word thou hearest speak unto thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if it search thy hart, if it discover thy lusts, if it make thy spirit burne within thee, if it cast thee upon thy face, and convince and judge thee for thy transgressions, if it bind up thy sores, and clense away thy corruptions, then it is certainly Christs word, and then it must bee received with such affections as becommeth the word of Christ.</p>
            <p>First, with Faith: if we conferre with flesh and bloud, we shall be apt ever to cavill against the truth; For hee
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:16264:140"/>
that rejecteth Christ, doth never receive his word. A fleshly heart cannot submit unto a heavenly Doctrine. Christ and his Apostles did every where endure the contradiction of sinners.<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Matth 5.22.</note> noting that hee onely was unto the Church the Author and fountaine of all heavenly Doctrine, that unto him onely belongeth that authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative and infallible Spirit which can command the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription and assent of the conscience, that hee onely can say with boldnesse to the soule, as hee did to the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan woman, <hi>Beleeve mee.</hi> And that therefore no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority either of men,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.21.</note> or Churches, either Episcopall, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, or Synodicall can without open sacrilege usurpe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to over-rule the faith of men, or impose any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and Doctrinall necessity upon the conscience in any points which are not ultimately and distinctly resolv'd into the evident authority of Christ in his word.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.24. 1 Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is onely Christs word which the hearts of men must stoope and attend unto, and which they must mingle with faith that it may bee profitable unto them;<note place="margin">Heb. 4.2. 1 Thess. 2.13.</note> that is, they must let it into their hearts with this assurance, that it is not the breath of a man, but the message of Christ, who is true in all his threatnings, and faithfull in all his promises, and pure in all his precepts, that hee sendeth this ministerie abroad for the perfection of the Saints, &amp; the edification of his Church,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.12.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:16264:140"/>
as much as in them lieth make void the holy ordinance of God, which yet must never returne in vaine. The word of God doth <hi>effectually worke</hi> onely in those that beleeve. It worketh in hypocrites, and wicked hearers, (according to the measure of that imperfect faith which they have) but it worketh not effectually, that is, it doth not consummate nor accomplish any perfect worke but onely in those that beleeve; in the rest it proves but an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortion, and withers in the blade.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <note n="a" place="margin">2 Thes. 2.10. Act. 2.41. Act. 17.11. Act. 21.17. 1 Sam. 3.18. 1 Sam. 25.32. Gal. 4.14.

For herein is our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to Christ the more apparent, when we suffer a little childe to lead us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note n="b" place="margin">Iam. 1.21. Levit. 26.2. Act. 10.33. 1 Thes. 2.13, 14. Eph 4.20-22.</note> with meeknesse and submission of heart, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verencing and yeelding unto it in all things. Wresting, shifting, evading, perverting the word is as great an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity unto Christ, as altering, interlining, or rasing a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent which the King hath drawen with his owne royall hand, is an offence against him. Patience and effectuall obedience even in affliction, is an argument that a man esteemes the word to bee indeed Gods owne word, and so receives it. Hee onely who putteth off the old man, the corrupt deceitfull lusts of his former conversation, and is renewed in the Spirit of his minde, is the man that hath heard, and been taught by Christ, that hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Truth in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, in as much as the Gospell is the Rod of <hi>Christs owne strength,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esai. 53.1.</note> or the instrument of his arme (who hath beleeved our report and to whom is the <hi>arme of the Lord revealed</hi>) and the instrument is no further operative or
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:16264:141"/>
effectuall than according to the measure of that impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vertue which it receiveth from the superior cause: therefore wee should learne alwayes to repaire unto Christ for the successe of his word. For he onely is the teacher of mens hearts, and the author of their faith. To him onely it belongeth to call men out of their graves, and to quicken whom hee will. Wee have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ministerie, he keepeth the power in his own hands, that men might learne to waite upon him, and to have to doe with him, who onely can send a blessing with his word, and teach his people to profit thereby.</p>
            <p>Another ground of the power of the word is, that it is <hi>sent from God.</hi> The <hi>Lord shall send forth the Rod of thy strength.</hi> From which particular likewise wee may note some usefull observations, as,</p>
            <p>First, that Gods appointment and ordination is that which gives being, life, majesty, and successe to his owne word, authority, boldnesse, and protection to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. When hee sendeth his word hee will make it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper. When <hi>Moses</hi> disputed against his going down into Egypt to deliver his brethren,<note place="margin">Esai. 55.11. Exod. 3.4.</note> sometimes alleaging his owne unfitnesse and infirmity, sometimes the unbeliefe of the people, this was still the warrant with which God encouraged him, <hi>I will bee with thee, I have sent thee, doe not I make mans mouth? I will bee with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say.</hi> I was no Prophet, neither was I a Prophets Sonne (saith <hi>Amos</hi>) but I was an heards<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man &amp; a gatherer of sycamore fruit:<note place="margin">Amos 7.14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>And the Lord tooke me as I followed the flock, and said unto mee, Goe, prophecie unto my people Israel.</hi> And this made him peremptory in his office to prophecie against the idolatry of the Kings Court, and against the flattery of the Priest of Bethel. And this made the Apostles bold,<note place="margin">Act. 4.13. 5.29.35, 36.</note> though otherwise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and ignorant men, to stand against the learned councill of Priests and Doctors of the Law, <hi>Wee ought to obey God rather than men.</hi> Vpon which, Grave was the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:16264:141"/>
advice of <hi>Gamaliel</hi>; If this counsell or worke bee of men, it will come to nought; <hi>But if it bee of God, yee cannot overthrow it,</hi> lest haply yee bee found even to fight against God. For to withstand the power or progresse of the Gospell, is to set a mans face against God himselfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in as much as the Gospell is sent forth by God, that is, revealed and published out of Sion, wee may observe, That Evangelicall learning came not into the world by humane discovery or observation, but it is utterly above the compasse of all reason or naturall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, neither men nor Angels ever knew it but by divine revelation. And therfore the Apostle every where calleth it a <hi>Mystery,</hi> a <hi>great and a hidden Mystery,</hi> which was kept secret since the world began.<note place="margin">Rom. 16.25. 1 Cor. 2.7·9. Rom. 1.20.2.14.15.</note> There is a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Theologie,</hi> without the world, gathered out of the workes of God, out of the resolution of causes and effects into their first originals, and out of the Law of nature written in the heart. But there is <hi>no naturall Christianity.</hi> Nature is so farre from finding it out by her owne inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that shee cannot yeeld unto it when it is revealed without a Spirit of faith to assist it. The Iewes stumbled at it as dishonorable to their Law, and the Gentiles deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, as absurd in their Philosophy; It was a <hi>Hidden and secret wisedome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 14.16. 1 Pet. 1.20. 1 Cor. 2.7.10. Eph. 1.9.10. Eph. 3.9.11.</note> the execution and publication whereof was committed onely to Christ. In God it was an <hi>Eternall Gospell,</hi> for Christ was a lambe slaine from before the foundations of the world, namely in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate counsell &amp; decree of his father; but revealed it was not till the dispensation of the <hi>fulnesse of time,</hi> wherein he gathered together in one all things in Christ. The purpose and ordination of it was eternall, but the preaching and manifestation of it reserved untill the time of Christs solemne inauguration into his Kingdome, and of the obstinacy of the Iewes, upon whose defection the Gentiles were called in.<note place="margin">Act. 14.16.17.30.</note>

            <p>Which might teach us to adore the unsearchablenesse
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16264:142"/>
of Gods judgements unto former ages of the world, whom hee suffered to walke in their owne wayes, and to live in times of utter ignorance, destitute of any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Gospell, or of any naturall parts, or abilities to finde it out. For if these things bee true: First, that without the knowledge of Christ there is no salvation.<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.3. Esai. 53.11.</note> 
               <hi>This is eternall life to know thee and him whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ. By his knowledge shall my righteous ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant justifye many.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> Secondly, that Christ cannot bee knowen by naturall, but Evangelicall and revealed light. <hi>The naturall man cannot know the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> because they are spiritually discerend. The light shined in darknesse,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.5.</note> and the darknesse was so thick and fixed that it did not let in the light nor apprehend it. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.22.</note> that this light was at the first sent onely unto the Iewes, as to the first borne-people, (excepting onely some particular extraordinary dispensations and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to some few first fruits and preludes of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.<note place="margin">Psal. 147.20. <hi>Vide Cameron. de Eccl. pag.</hi> 81.</note>) <hi>He sheweth his word unto Iacob, his statutes and his judgements unto Israel. Hee hath not dealt so with any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Hee hath not afforded the meanes of salvation or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily unto any other people; the world by wisedome knew him not. Fourthly, that this severall dispensation toward one and other, the giving of saving knowledge to one people, and with-holding it from others, was not grounded upon any preceding differences and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions thereunto in the people, but onely in the <hi>Love of God.</hi>

               <hi>The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to bee a speciall people unto himselfe, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.</hi> The Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because yee were more in number than any people (for ye were the fewest of all people) <hi>but because the Lord loved you,</hi>

There was no difference betweene them and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles from whom I gathered them. Fiftly, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell was hidden from others <hi>in God,</hi>

Hee forbad men to goe into the cities of the Gentiles, neither were they to goe unto them without a speciall gift, and commission. The same <hi>Beneplacitum</hi> was the reason of revealing it to some, and of hiding it from others; <hi>Even so ô father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.</hi> If all these particulars bee true, needs must we both admire the inscrutablenesse of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards the Gentiles of old, (for no humane presumptions are a fit measure of the wayes and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of God towards sinners.) And also everlastingly adore his Compassions towards us, whom hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for these times of light, and, out of the alone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable riches of his grace, hath together with princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and powers in heavenly places, made us to see what is the fellowship of that great mysterie which from the beginning of the world was hidden in himselfe.</p>

Luk. 14.23.</note> in that the Lord doth send forth the Gospell of Christ out of <hi>Sion</hi> into the world, wee may further observe that the Gospell is a Message, and an invitation from heaven unto men. For, for that end was it sent that thereby men might bee invited and perswaded to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Lord sendeth his Sonne up and down, carrieth him from place to place; he is set forth before mens eyes, he comes, and stands, and calls, &amp; knocks at their doores, and beseecheth them to bee reconciled. Hee setteth his word before us, at our doores, and in our mouths and eares. He hath not erected any standing sanctuary or city of refuge for men to fly for their salvations unto, but hath appointed Ambassadors, to carry this treasure unto mens houses where hee inviteth them, and intreateth them, and requireth them, and commandeth them, and compelleth them to come into his feast of mercy. And this must needs bee <gap reason="foreign">

riches of grace, for mercy, pardon, preferment, life, salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to goe a begging, and sue for acceptance; and very unsearchable likewise must needs bee the love of sinne, and madnesse of folly in wicked men, to trample upon such pearles, and to neglect so great salvation when it is tendered unto them. O what a heavy charge will it bee for men at the last day, to have the mercy of God, the humility of Christ, the entreaties of his Spirit, the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of pardon, the approches of salvation, the dayes, the years, the ages of peace, the ministers of the word, the booke of God, the great Mysterie of Godlinesse, to rise up in judgement, and to testifie against their soules?</p>
            <p>Lastly, in that the Gospell is sent from God, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spencers thereof must looke unto their mission,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.4.</note> and not intrude upon so sacred a businesse before they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>called by God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 1.12.</note> Now this <hi>call</hi> is twofold: <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> by immediate instinct, and revelation from God, which is ever accompanied with immediate and infused gifts (of this wee doe not now speake:) And <hi>Ordinary,</hi> by imposition of hands, and Ecclesiasticall designation. Whereunto there are to concurre three things. First, an Act of <hi>Gods providence</hi> casting a man upon such a course of studies, and fashioning his minde unto such affections towards learning, and disposing of him in such Schooles and Colleges of the Prophets, as are congruons prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and were appointed for nurseries and seminaries of Gods Church. It is true many things fall under Gods <hi>providence,</hi> which are not within his <hi>allowance,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no sufficient argument to conclude Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or commission in this office, because his wisedome hath cast mee upon a collegiate education. But when therewithall, hee in whose hands the hearts of all men are as clay or wax, to bee moulded into such shapes as the counsell of his will shall order, hath bended the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of my heart to serve him in his Church, and hath set the strongest delight of my minde upon those kindes of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:16264:143"/>
learning which are unto that service most proper and conducent; when measuring either the good will of my heart, or the appliablenesse of my parts, by this, and other professions of learning, I can cleerly conclude that that measure and proportion which the Lord hath given mee is more suteable unto this, than other learned cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, I suppose, other qualifications herewith concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, a man may safely from thence conclude, that God, who will have every man live in some profitable calling, doth not onely by his <hi>providence</hi> permit, but by his <hi>secret direction</hi> lead him unto that service, whereunto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of gifts which he hath conferred upon him are most suteable and proper. And therefore secondly, there is to bee respected in this <hi>Ordinary mission,</hi> the meet qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the person who shall bee ordained unto this ministerie: For if no Prince will send a mechanick from his loome, or his sheers, in an honorable Embassage to some other forraigne Prince, shall wee thinke that the Lord will send forth stupid and unprepared instruments about so great a worke as the perfecting of the Saints, and Edification of the Church? It is registred for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall dishonor of that wicked King <hi>Ieroboam</hi> (who made no other use of any Religion but as a secondary bye thing,<note place="margin">1 Kings. 12.31.</note> to bee the supplement of policie) <hi>that he made of the Lowest of the People,</hi> those who were really such as the Apostles were falsly esteemed to be, the scumme and offscouring of men, to bee Priests unto the Lord.

               </note> yet they did beare witnesse unto those Scriptures, out of which the Christians did prove their faith. And there is no greater evidence in a cause than the affirmative testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of that man who is an enemie to the cause. If the Church of Rome had such evidences as these out of the booke of God, to prove their usurped primacie by, how proud and intolerable would they be in boasting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and obtruding it unto others, who are now so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon farre slenderer grounds?</p>
            <p>And from hence we may learne to take heed of the sinnes of that people, which were principally the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the corner stone, and the putting off the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell of Christ away from them, as every obstinate and unbeleeving sinner doth from himselfe. This is that which hath made them of all nations the most hated, and the most forsaken, and hath brought <hi>wrath to the uttermost</hi> upon them, because when Christ came unto his owne they received him not. <hi>Because of unbeliefe they were broken off,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>and thou standest by faith; be not high-minded, but feare, for if God spared not the naturall branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</hi> And we should likewise learne to pray for the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Gentiles,</hi> and for the restoring of this people unto their honour and originall priviledges againe; for <hi>we are their debtors</hi>; we entred upon the promises which were made to them; and therefore good reason we have to doe for them now, as they did for us before: <hi>We have a little sister,</hi> or rather an elder sister, <hi>and shee hath no brests,</hi> the oracles and ordinances of God are taken from her; <hi>What shall wee doe for our sister in the day when shee shall be spoken for? Cant.</hi> 8.8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this notes unto us the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles into the fellowship of the same mystery which was first preached unto the Iewes,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.61. Zech 8.23. Esay 2.2, 3.</note> that they might be the <hi>daughters</hi> of this mother Church, that they may <hi>take hold of the skirt of the Iew,</hi> and say, We will go with you,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16264:147"/>
for we have heard that God is with you. The Church of Ierusalem was set up as a beacon, or an ensigne, or a publike sanctuary to which the nations should flie, as doves to their windowes. Of this merciful purpose some evidences and declarations the Lord gave before in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, Iob,</hi> Ninive, the Wise-men, and others, who were the preludes and first fruits of the Gentiles unto God: and did after fully manifest the same in his unlimited commission to his Apostles, <hi>Goe preach the Gospell unto every creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now alas, what were we that God should bring us hitherto? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith that we were <hi>filled with all unrighteousnesse</hi>; that we did neither understand God, nor seeke after him. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l our faculties were full of sinne, and the fulnesse of all sinne was in us; we were ruled by no lawes but the course of the world, the Prince of the aire, and the lusts of the flesh, without God in this world, and without any hope for the world to come. Here ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of lust and poyson, and fitted to be hereafter vessels of destruction and misery. We were no nation, a foolish people, a people that sought not, nor inquired after God; and yet his owne people hath he set by and called us to the knowledge of his love and mercie in Christ. And that, not as many other Gentiles are called, who heare of him indeed, and worship him, but have his doctrine corrupted and overturned with heresie, and his worship defiled with superstition and idolatry; but hee hath for us purged his floore, and given unto us the wheat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the chaffe, he hath let the light of his glory to shine purely upon us onely in the face of Iesus Christ, without any humane supplements, or contributions. How should we praise him for it, and as wee have received Christ purely, so labour to walk worthily in him? How should we runne to him that called us when we knew him not? How should we set forward, and call upon one another, that we may flie like doves in companies unto the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:16264:147"/>
of the Church? How earnestly should wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for this truth, the custodie whereof he hath honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us withall? How should we renue our repentance, and remember our first workes, lest so excellent a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be removed from us. There is no wrath that is <hi>wrath to the uttermost,</hi> but that which depriveth a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Gospell, and taketh away their Candlesticke from them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it notes unto us the difference of the two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, the <hi>one out of Sinai, and the other out of Sion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 12.18-22. Gal. 4.25, 26</note> At first the Law proceeded out of Sinai, wherein though the end were merciful, yet the manner was terrible, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the effect nothing but bondage; but after it was sent out of Sion with the Spirit of grace, and adoption, observed with cheerefulnesse and libertie, as by those that know God will spare them, as a man spareth his childe that serveth him, for in my bond-slave I looke to the perfection of the worke, but in my son to the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and disposition of the heart.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it notes unto us, that the seat of saving truth, the custodie of the promises, and Gospell of salvation, doth still belong unto Sion, to the Church of God. Out <note n="a" place="margin">

               <hi>Hard to be understood,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speakes, either by reason of their allegoricall and figurative expressions, as the visions of <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechary,</hi> &amp;c. or by reason of the obscure and strange connexion of one part with another, or of the dependance thereof upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren learning, or the like; but then we must note that the knowledge of such things as these, are not of absolute necessitie unto salvation, for though the perverting of hard places be damnable (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> telleth us) yet that ignorance of them which groweth out of their owne obscurity, and not out of our neglect, is not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Secondly, some things have evidence enough in the termes that expresse them, but yet are <hi>Hard to be beleeved,</hi> by reason of the supernaturall quality of them. As when we say that Christ was the Sonne of a Virgin, or that he died and rose againe, there is no difficultie in the sense of these things, it is easily understood what he that affirmeth them doth meane by them. All the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie is to bring the minde to give assent unto them. Thirdly, some things though easie in their sense to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, and it may be easie likewise in their nature to be beleeved, are yet <hi>Hard to be obeyed and practised,</hi> as repentance, and forsaking of sinne, &amp;c. Now according unto these differences wee may conceive of the office and power which the Church hath in matters of holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>for hard places in regard of the sense and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of the place, it is the dutie of the Church to open

allow the same honor to no society of men but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves? But in this case the office of the Church is, both to labour by al good means to evidence the credibility of the things which are to be beleeved, to discover unto men those es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall and intimate beauties of the Gospel, which to spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall mindes and hearts raised to such a proportionable pitch of capacitie as are suteable to the excellency of their natures, are apt to evidence and notifie themselves, and also to labour to take men off from dependance on their owne reason or corrupted judgement, to worke in their heart an experience of the Spirit of grace, and an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to those holy truths which they already assent unto;<note place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Field</hi> of the Church, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> with which preparations and perswasions, the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing possessed, will in due time come to observe more cleerely, by that spirituall eye, the evidence of those things which were at first so difficult; so then the <hi>Act of the Church is in matters of faith an act of introduction and guidance,</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, for those places which are difficult, rather to be obeyed than to be understood: The worke of the Church is to enforce upon the conscience the necessitie of them, to perswade, rebuke, exhort, encourage with all authority.</p>
            <p>Which should teach us all <hi>to love the Church of Christ,</hi> and to pray for the peace and prosperity of the walls of Sion, for the purity, spiritualnesse, power and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Word therein, which is able to hold up its owne honour in the minds of men, if it be but faithfully
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:16264:150"/>
published; we should therefore studie to maintaine, to credit, to promote the Gospell, to encourage truth, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance errour, to stand in the gap against all the stratagems and advantages of the enemies thereof, and to hold the candlestick fast amongst us, to buy the truth, and sell it not, betray it not, forsake it not, temper it not, misguize it not. This is to be a pillar, &amp; to put the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der under the Gospell of Christ. And surely though the Papists boast of the word and name of the Church (as none more apt to justifie and brag of their sobrietie than those whom the wine hath overtaken) yet the plaine truth is, they have farre lesse of the nature thereof, than any other Churches, because farre lesse of the pure ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and ministration thereof, for in stead of holding forth the Word of life, they pull it downe, denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people of Christ the use of his Gospell, dimidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the use of his Sacrament, breeding them up in an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant worship, to begge they know not what, in all points disgracing the Word of truth, and robbing it of its certaintie, sufficiencie, perspicuitie, authoritie, purity, energie in the minds of men. And this is certain, the more any set themselves against the light and generall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Word of truth, the lesse of the nature of the Church they have in them, what-ever ostentations they may make of the name thereof.</p>
            <p>The last thing observed in this second verse amongst the regalities of Christ, was <hi>Imperium, his rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> in his Church by his holy Word, maugre all the attempts and machinations of the enemies thereof against it: <hi>Rule thou in the middest of thine enemies,</hi> that is, <hi>Thou shalt rule safely, securely, undisturbedly,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, feare, or hazard, from the enemies round about; their counsels shall be infatuated, their purposes shall vanish, their decrees shall not stand, their <note n="c" place="margin">Ne quicquam proficit exquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior quae<expan>

            <p>The kingdome of Christ is two-fold; His <hi>kingdome of glory,</hi> of which there shall be no end, when hee shall <hi>rule over his enemies,</hi> and tread them under his feet: and his <hi>kingdome of grace,</hi> whereby hee <hi>ruleth amongst his enemies,</hi> by the scepter of his Word. And this is the kingdome here spoken of; noting unto us, that Christ will have a Church and people gathered unto him by the preaching of his Gospell on the earth, maugre all the malice, power, or policie of all his enemies. Never was Satan so loose, never heresie and darknesse so thicke, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver persecution so prevalent, never the taile of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon so long, as to sweepe away all the Starres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or to devoure the remnant of the womans seed. The gates of hell, all the policie, power and machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the kingdome of darknesse, shall never root out the Vine which the Father hath planted, nor prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the body of Christ. His Gospell must be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched till the worlds end, and till then he will be with it to give it successe. Though the Kings of the earth stand up, and the Rulers gather together against the Lord and his Christ, yet they imagine but a vaine thing, and hee that sitteth in heaven shall laugh them to scorne.</p>
            <p>The grounds of the certainetie and perpetuitie of Christs Evangelicall Kingdome is not the nature of the Church in it selfe consider'd, either in the whole or parts; for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> were a Church at first, a people that were under the law of obedience, and worship of God, and yet they fell away from that excellent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the Prophet tels us,<note place="margin">Esay 1.9.</note> that except the Lord had left a very small remnant, the Church had beene all as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and like to Gomorrah. But the grounds hereof are; First, <hi>The Decree,</hi> ordination, and appointment of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.2. and wee know what
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:16264:151"/>
ever men project, the counsell of the Lord must stand. Secondly, Gods <hi>Gift unto Christ, Aske of mee, and I wil give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, &amp;c. Ps.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gavest them me, Ioh.</hi> 17.6. <hi>My Father which gave them me is greater than all, and none is able to plucke them out of my Fathers hand, Ioh.</hi> 10.29. Thirdly, <hi>Gods Oath,</hi> which is the Seale of his irreversible decree, and Covenant with Christ. <hi>Once have I sworne by my holinesse, that I will not lye unto David; His seede shall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sunne before me, Psal.</hi> 89.35, 36. Fourthly, Christs owne <hi>Purchase</hi> and price which he paied for it. The Apostle saith, Christ died not in vaine, and the vertue of his bloud lasteth to the end of the world; for as his bloud was shed from the beginning of the world in regard of Gods Decree, so doth it continue to the end, in regard of its owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and efficacie; so long as hee sitteth at the right hand of God, which must be till the time of the restitution of all things,<note place="margin">Act. 3.21.</note> the merit of his bloud shall worke amongst men. Fifthly, Christs owne <hi>Power,</hi> to keepe inviolable the proprietie he hath gotten, <hi>My sheepe heare my voyce, and I give unto them eternall life, and they shall never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, neither shall any man plucke them out of my hand, Ioh.</hi> 10.27, 28. Sixthly, the Fathers <hi>Command</hi> unto his Son, <hi>This is the Fathers will, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, &amp;c. Ioh.</hi> 6.39. Seventhly, <hi>Christs Love and Care.</hi> The Church is his Spouse, under his Coverture and protection, and therefore as hee hath power and office, so hee hath delight to preserve it still. His Love is better able to helpe, than the malice of the enemy is to hurt. Eighthly, <hi>Christs Intercession,</hi> which is not for the world, but for those whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him out of the world, and those he demandeth of his Father (who heareth him alwayes) in the verture of that Covenant which betweene them was ratified, on Gods part by a Promise and Oath, and on Christs part by a
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:16264:151"/>
Merit and Purchase. Now Christs Intercession shall last till his returning to judge the world, and therefore still he must have a Church, for whom to intercede. Lastly, Christs owne <hi>Promise,</hi> to be with the preaching of his Gospell; that is, to give it assistance and successe, for the gathering together and perfecting of the Saints unto the End of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20.</p>
            <p>Here then may bee answered two great Questions: First, whether the <hi>Church</hi> may <hi>deficere,</hi> faile upon the earth or no? To which I answere, That the <hi>Church</hi> may bee taken either <hi>mystically, spiritually,</hi> and <hi>universally.</hi> And in that sense it can never faile, but there must bee upon the earth a true Church of Christ, not onely <hi>certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine eventus,</hi> by the certainety of the event, which is on all sides agreed; but <hi>certitudine causa</hi> too, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie growing out of those irresistible causes upon which the being of the mysticall body of Christ on the earth dependeth. Or it may be considered <hi>particularly</hi> in the severall parts and places of the world where the Gospell is planted; and <hi>hierarchically and politically,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting a company of men, professing the faith of Christ, and reduc'd into a quiet, peaceable, composed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous governement; and so wee affirme that there is no Church in the world so safe, but that it may <hi>deficere,</hi> faile, and be extinguished out of its place. The Church of the Jewes did, and after them any may. Else the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles argument even to the Roman Church it selfe (which was then a famous Church throughout the world,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.8.</note> and of that passage in the Apostle,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 58 §. 47, 48, 49, 50.</note> 
               <hi>Baronius</hi> makes a long boast) were very weake, when <hi>à majori ad minus</hi> hee thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth, <hi>Be not high-minded but feare, for if God spared not the naturall branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11.21, 22.</note> Thus we finde the ten tribes in their apostacie, till they became <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> to be no more a people;<note place="margin">Hos. 1.9.</note> and their brethren after fall in their condition, <hi>Wrath,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is come to the uttermost upon them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 2.16.</note> And hee
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:16264:152"/>
telleth us that the man of sinne, the Sonne of perdition, should be revealed by <hi>Apostacie,</hi>

            <p>A second question which may be made is this, that since the Church doth not totally faile from off the earth, whether that which remaineth thereof be <hi>alwayes visible?</hi> To which wee answere, That if wee take the Church for the <hi>spirituall and mysticall body of Christ:</hi>

Seene indeed they may be by an eye of <hi>Charitie,</hi> in their fruits, but not by an eye of <hi>certainety,</hi> in their owne infallible being. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if wee take the Church for a company of men <hi>professing the true Doctrine of Christ,</hi> wee answere, that <hi>take the men in themselves</hi> so truly professing, and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it is but their faith should shew it selfe in the fruits thereof, for the kingdome of Christ is in the heart like leaven which will manifest it selfe in the whole lumpe, and so we can in all even the worst ages of the Church, shew some who have witnessed the truth against that deluge of ignorance, errour, and idolatry, which had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the world, like gray haires here and there min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled on a blacke head; as if you single out fire from the ashes, it will be seene by its owne evidence, though it may be so raked up that it is not observed. But then if we speake of these men <hi>in aggregato,</hi> as concurring to make up a distinct external body, or Church, so we say that the professors of the truth may be so few, and they persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, traduced, suppressed, cried downe, driven into the wildernesse, without any apparant, separated conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and governement of its owne (as in the time of <hi>Constantius</hi> the emperour the publike professors of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16264:152"/>
Divinitie of Christs person, against the damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the Arrians were used) as that in this sense we may justly denie the Church to have beene <hi>alwayes visible,</hi> that is, The few true professors of Christ in power and puritie to have had a free, open, uncontroled, distinct ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall body of their owne, notoriously and <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectu hominum</hi> different from that tyrannicall and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous hierarchie under which they suffered: for though Christ rule, yet it is <hi>in the midst of his enemies,</hi> and the enemies may be so many, and Christs subjects in whom he rules so few, that the corne may be invisible for the abundance of weeds amongst which it growes, though in it selfe very apt to be seene.</p>
            <p>And this giveth a full answer to that Question, where <hi>Our Church was</hi> before the late Reformation began by <hi>Luther:</hi> for that Reformation did not <hi>new-make</hi> the Church, but <hi>purge it.</hi> And that it stood in need of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, the Papists themselves were faine to confesse, and declare to the world in their Councell of Trent. Onely herein is the difference, The Councell pretended a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation <hi>in points of Discipline and manners,</hi> and wee made a Reformation <hi>in points of Doctrine</hi> too. When Christ purged the Temple of buyers and sellers, it was the same Temple after, which before. When a man se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth the wheate from the chaffe, it is the same corne which before. In these corrupter ages then the pure Professour of Christ, who denied not his faith did dwell where Satan had his seate.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vt sub Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christi sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus Christi po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus non exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret. Hilar.</hi>
               </note> The members of Christ were amongst the Rulers of Antichrist. Wee are not another Church newly started up, but the same which before from the Apostles times held the common and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie grounds of Faith and Salvation, which grounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in latter ages perverted and over-turned by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianisme, have beene by valiant Champions for the faith of Christ therefrom vindicated, who have onely pruned the Lords Vine, and picked out the stones, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:16264:153"/>
driven out the bores out of his Vineyard, but have not made either one or other new.</p>
            <p>Now this point that Christ ruleth in the midst of his enemies is ground of great confidence in his Church, in as much as shee subsisteth not upon any corruptible strength of her owne, but upon the Promise, decree, oath, power and love of God, things invincible by all the Powers of darkenesse. Let the enemies rage never so much, they cannot dis-throne Christ, nor extinguish his Gospell, for it is an <hi>everlasting Gospell.</hi> It is but as the <hi>comming forth of a Shepheard against a Lion,</hi> as the Prophet compareth it.<note place="margin">Revel. 14.16.

            </p>
            <p>Now besides this generall observation, the words afford some particular notes which I will but briefly touch. As first, That Christs kingdome in this world is <hi>Regnum Crucis,</hi> a Kingdome beset with enemies, of all other the most hated and opposed. They that submit unto it must resolve to be herein conformable to their head; a Crosse was his Throne, and Thornes were his Crowne, and every one which will live godly must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer persecution, and through many afflictions enter into his Masters Kingdome. <hi>Quod erat Christus, erimus
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:16264:153"/>
Christiani.</hi> No marvell if the world hate the Church of Christ, for it hated him first. In his word he is resisted, disobeyed, belied, and, if it were possible, silenced and corrupted; in his officers mocked and misused, in his subjects persecuted and reviled, in his Spirit thrust away and grieved; in his worship neglected and polluted; in all his wayes slandered and blasphemed.</p>
            <p>The Reasons of which strange entertainement of the Kingdome of Christ are, first, because it is a <hi>New King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> which enters into the world by way of chalenge and dispossession of former lords, and therefore no wonder if it finde opposition. Secondly, it is an <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi> unconspicuous, unattended, desolate, and in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ignoble kingdome. It began in the forme of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, in the ignominie of a Crosse,<note place="margin">Ioh. 7.48.</note> none of the Princes of this world,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22.</note> none of the learned of this world to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or helpe set it up, but amongst them all, esteemed as an offensive and foolish thing. Thirdly, it is an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall kingdome, Nec parem patitur nec superiorem,</hi> Christ will admit of no Consorts or Corrivals in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Body, and Soule, and Spirit,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.20. 1 Thes. 5.23. <hi>Laurent. de La Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others is given for the reason, why when <hi>Tiberius</hi> proposed Christ unto the Romane Senate with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of his owne suffrage, to be worshipped, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him, because hee would be a God alone. If hee would exempt some of the earthly members from his subjection, let lust have the eye, or folly the eare, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the hand, or covetousnesse the heart, or any other evill affection share with him, he would be the easier to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated; but when he will be absolute, and nothing must remaine in our hearts but as his vassall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be spoiled, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, condemned, and crucified by him, if the whole state of sinne must bee ruined, and the body destroied, no wonder if the world cannot away with him. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is the Summe of all, It is a <hi>heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:16264:154"/>
a spirituall Kingdome, My Kingdome is not of this world,</hi> and therefore no marvell if the divels of hell, and the lusts of the flesh doe set themselves against him.</p>

Therefore <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 17.1.4.</note> Antichrist is called <hi>a Whore,</hi> because hee should seduce the Christian world with much expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love, and creepe peaceably and by flatteries into the kingdome of Christ: of these severall enemies of Christ, under the profession of his name and worship, some are Christians but not in purity, as heretikes; some

And all this is to make him but a mock-king as the Jewes did, when indeed we crucifie him.</p>
            <p>Note thirdly, Christs Word and Spirit are stronger than all adverse opposition. This is his Glory that his kingdome commeth in unto him <hi>by way of Conquest,</hi> as Canaan unto Israel. Therefore at the very first erecting of his kingdome, when, in all presumption, it might most easily have beene crushed, he suffer'd his enemies to vent their utmost malice, and to glut themselves with the bloud of his people, that so it might appeare, that though they did fight against him, they <note n="l" place="margin">Esai. 8.7-10. Dan. 2.44. Dan. 7.25, 26. Zech 12.3, 4. Esai. 31.8.</note> could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile against him, but that his counsell should still stand and flourish, and should consume, and breake in pieces
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:16264:155"/>
all the kingdomes which set themselves against it: that they all should be affraid of the Ensigne of the Gospell, and should fly from it.</p>
            <p>This jealousie of God for his Church may be seene, in frustrating the attempts, and pulling off the wheeles on which the projects which are cast against his Church doe move, as hee dealt with <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Hee can dissolve the confederacies, shatter the counsels, cast a spirit of treachery, unfaithfulnesse, and mutinous affections into the hearts of his enemies, as hee did into the Midianites, and into the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudg 17.22. 2 Chr. 20.22, 23. Esai. 19.9.29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. Mic. 4.11, 12. Esai. 37.33, 34. Psal. 33.10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> when they gathered together against his people. He can infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate their counsels, and make them the contrivers and artificers of their owne ruine, as we see in the consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> with his young men, and of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> in his idolatrous policy, and of <hi>Haman</hi> in his gallowes. He can defeat their expectations, and disannull their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and make his owne Counsell alone to stand.</p>
            <p>But when all this is done, this is onely to rule in spight of his enemies. But besides this, his Kingdome fetcheth his enemies under, and in some sort ruleth <hi>over their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi> and striketh them to the ground; maketh the divels in hell, the stoutest of all sinners to tremble, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the rockes asunder, affrighteth, judgeth, sealeth, hardeneth,<note place="margin">Ier. 23 29. 2 Cor. 10.6.</note> thresheth, revengeth the pride of men, and maketh them before-hand to taste the bitternesse of that damnation, which waketh over them, and commeth swiftly against them.</p>
            <p>Let us take heed then of being Christs enemies, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the power and progresse of his word, the evidence and purity of his Spirit in the lives of men. It is but to make a combination to pull the Sunne out of heaven; or for a wave to contend with a rocke; for as the ruines of a house are broken on the things upon which they fall: so are the enemies of Christ, which gather together against his Church,<note place="margin">Luk 20.18.</note> and fall upon the rocke, at length ruined by
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:16264:155"/>
their owne malice. <hi>Sampsons</hi> foxes were themselves burnt amongst the corne which they fired. The land brought forth corne the next yeere againe (and it may be more plentifully by reason of that fire) but the foxes never came up any more. Even so can the Lord deale with those enemies which waste and depopulate his Church, make them the authors of their owne utter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and bring forth his Church with shouting, and with doubled graces.</p>
            <p>Who then is the man that desireth tranquillitie of life, and securitie against all evill? Let him become a subject in this conquering kingdome, and cast himselfe under the banner and protection of Christ, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miscarrie. <hi>He that walketh uprightly, walketh surely. The Name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto it and is safe. The Lord is a Sunne and a shield,</hi> a <hi>Fountaine of all good.</hi> Grace and Glorie will hee give, and no good thing will hee with-hold from them that walke uprightly: and a protection against all evill; <hi>I will not be affraid of ten thousand of men,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>David, that compasse me about.</hi> When there is no light, nor issue, nor in nature possibility of escape, he can open a doore of deliverance, to relieve his Church. As a man in the kings high-way is under the kings protection: so in Christs way we are under his protection. Let us then never repine at the miscarriages of the world, nor mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure against the wise proceedings of God in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dispensation towa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds his Church on earth: when he punisheth, he doth it in measure, lesse than our sinnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; and when we search and try our wayes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto him, hee knoweth how to worke his owne glory in our deliverance. Those stones which are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a glorious building are first under the saw, and the hammer, to be hewed and squared; and those Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in whom the Lord will take most delight, he usually thereunto fitteth by trials and extremities. Hee that is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:16264:156"/>
brought to tremble in himselfe, may with most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence expect to rejoyce in God.<note place="margin">Hab. 3.16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Note fourthly, this is the honour of Christs kingdome to be a peaceable, quiet, and secure kingdome, not onely after the victory, but in the midst of enemies. <hi>This man,</hi> saith the Prophet of Christ,<note place="margin">Mic. 5.5.</note> 
               <hi>shall be the peace, when the Assyrian,</hi> the enemie, <hi>is in the land.</hi> Wee have peace in him, when wee have tribulation in the world. Christ saith of himselfe, <hi>I came not to send peace but a sword</hi>; and yet the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.33.</note> 
               <hi>That hee came, and preached peace to those which were afarre off,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10.34. Eph. 2.17.</note> 
               <hi>and to them which were neere.</hi> How shall these things be reconcil'd? Surely as a man may say of a Rocke, Nothing more quiet, because it is never stirr'd, and yet nothing more unquiet, because it is ever assaulted: so wee may say of the Church, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more peaceable, because it is established upon a Rocke, and yet nothing more unpeaceable, because that rocke is in the midst of seas, windes, enemies, persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But yet still the Prophets Conclusion is certaine, <hi>The worke of righteousnesse is peace, and the effect of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esai. 32.17.</note>

Or lastly, thus; as the Priests who offered sacrifices to the Lord were cloathed with <hi>Holy and Beautifull garments; Exod.</hi> 28.2.40. or as those who in admiration of some noble Prince voluntarily follow the service of his warres, doe set themselves forth in the most complete furniture and richest attire as is fit to give notice of the noblenesse of their mindes: (for <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>From the wombe of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.</hi>] There is a middle point after those words, [<hi>The Wombe of the Morning,</hi>] which may seeme to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joine the clauses, &amp; make those words referre wholly to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:16264:158"/>
the preceding. In which relation, there might bee a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sense conceived in them. Either thus, <hi>In the Beauties of Holinesse,</hi> or in Holinesse very beautifull more than the <hi>Aurora</hi> or <hi>wombe of the morning,</hi> when shee is ready to bring forth the Sunne. And then it is a notable meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor to expresse the glorious beautie of Gods wayes. Or thus, thy people shall bee a willing people from the very <hi>wombe of the morning</hi>; that is, from the very first forming of Christ in them, and shining forth upon them, they shall rise out of their former nakednesse and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and shall adorne themselves with the beautifull graces of Christs Spirit, as with cloathing of wrought gold, and rayment of needle-worke, and shall with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and rejoycing, with much devotion and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart bee brought unto the King, and present themselves before him as Voluntaries in his service.<note place="margin">Psal. 45.13, 14, 15.</note> But because the learned conceive that the middle point is onely a distinction for convenient reading, not a disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the sense, I shall therefore rest in a more recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved exposition. Thy Children shall bee borne in great abundance unto thee, by the seed of thy word, in the wombe of the Church, as soone as the morning, or sunne of righteousnesse shall shine forth upon it. As the dew is borne out of the coole morning aire as out of a wombe, distilling down in innumerable drops upon the earth; so thine elect shall bee borne unto thee, by the preaching of thy word and first approach of thy heavenly light, in innumerable armies. And this explication is very suteable to the harmonie of Holy Scripture, which useth the same metaphors to the same purpose in other places.<note place="margin">Mic. 5.7. Revel. 22.16. Luk. 2.78. Mal. 4.2. Rom. 13.12. 1 Iohn 2.8.</note> The <hi>Remnant of Iacob,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>shall bee in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of many people as a dew from the Lord.</hi> And Christ is called the <hi>Bright-morning-starre,</hi> and the <hi>Day-spring,</hi> and the <hi>Sunne of Righteousnesse,</hi> and time of the Gospell is called the <hi>time of Day,</hi> or the approach of Day. So that, <hi>from the wombe of the morning,</hi> is from the heavenly
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:16264:158"/>
light of the Gospell, which is the wing or beame wherby the Sunne of Righteousnesse revealeth himselfe, and breaketh out upon the world, as the rising Sunne, which rejoyceth like a Giant to runne his race, shall the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion increase, and armies of the Church of God bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually supplied.</p>
            <p>The words thus unfolded doe containe in them a lively <hi>Character of the subjects in Christs spirituall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Described first by their Relation to him, and his propriety to them, <hi>Thy People.</hi> Secondly, by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition, intimated in the word, <hi>Willing,</hi> or <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi> and (if wee take [<hi>Thy People</hi>] and [<hi>Armies</hi>] for Synonymous termes.

For when he conquereth by his word, his conquest is wrought upon the wills and affections of men. <hi>Victor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que volentes Per populos dat jura. Thy people shall bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> The ground of which willingnesse is further added, (for so chiefly I understand those words) <hi>The Day of thy Power.</hi> So that the willingnesse of Christs subjects is effected by the power of his grace and Spirit in the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Gospell. Fourthly, By their honorable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and military robes, in which they appeare before him, and attend upon him, <hi>In Beauties of Holinesse,</hi> or in the various and manifold graces of Christ as in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diverse colours. Fiftly and lastly, by their age, multitudes, and manner of their birth; They are the <hi>Dew of the morning,</hi> as many as the small drops of dew, and they are borne to him out of the <hi>wombe of the morning,</hi> as dew is generated, not on the earth, but in the aire, by a <hi>Heavenly calling,</hi> and by the shining of the morning-starre, and day-spring upon their consciences.

            <p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:16264:159"/>I said before, that I approve not the mincing and crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of Holy Scriptures. Yet in these parts of them, which are written for models and summaries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine, I suppose there may bee weight in every word, as in a rich Iewell there is worth in every sparkle. Here then first wee may take notice of Christs Propriety to his people. [<hi>Thy people</hi>] All the Elect and Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers doe <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 1.21. Ioh. 10.3. Cant. 2.16.7.10.</note> belong unto Christ. They are <hi>His People.</hi> They are his <hi>Owne sheepe.</hi> There is a mutuall and reciprocall propriety between him and them. <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine.</hi> His desire is towards mee. <hi>His,</hi> I say, not as hee is God onely, by a right of inseparable domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as wee are his creatures. For all things were <note n="b" place="margin">Col. 1.16, 17. Rom. 9.5.</note> 
               <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by him and <hi>for him.</hi> And hee is <hi>over all,</hi> God blessed for ever. Nor his onely as hee is the <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 1.2, 3.2.7, 8.</note> first-borne and the heire of all things. In which respect hee is Lord of the Angels, and God hath set him <hi>over all the workes of his hands.</hi> But as he is the mediator and head in his Church. In which respect the faithfull are his by a more peculiar propriety. <note n="d" place="margin">Esai. 63.19.</note> 
               <hi>Wee are thine, thou never barest rule over them, they were not called by thy name.</hi> The Devils are his <hi>Vassals.</hi> The wicked of the world his <hi>prisoners.</hi> The faithfull onely are his <hi>subjects and followers.</hi> His Iewels, his Friends, his Brethren, his Sonnes, his Members, his Spouse. His, by all the relations of intimatenesse that can bee named.</p>
            <p>Now this Propriety Christ hath unto us upon severall grounds. First, by Constitution and Donation from his Father.<note place="margin">Act. 2.36. Eph. 1.22. Psal. 2.8. Esai. 8.18. Ioh. 17.6.</note> God hath <hi>made him Lord and Christ.</hi> Hee hath <hi>put all things</hi> under his feete, and hath <hi>given him to bee Head</hi> over all things to the Church. Aske of mee and I <hi>will give thee</hi> the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Behold, I and the Children whom <hi>thou hast given mee.</hi> Thine they were, and <hi>thou gavest them to mee.</hi> For as in regard of Gods Iustice we were <hi>bought by Christ in our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:16264:159"/>
so in regard of his love wee were <hi>given unto Christ in our election,</hi> that hee might redeeme us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by a right of purchase, treaty, and covenant betweene Christ and his Father. For wee, having sold away our selves, and being now in the enemies posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, could not bee restored unto our primitive estate without some intervening price to redeeme us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith the Apostle, hee was made under the Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.5. 1 Cor. 6.20. Tit. 2.14. Heb. 7 22. Rom. 3.25.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that hee might <hi>Buy out</hi> those that were under the Law. And againe, yee are <hi>Bought with a price.</hi> Hee was our surety, and stood in our stead, and was <hi>set forth to declare the righteousnesse of God.</hi> God dealt in grace with us, but in justice with him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by a right of conquest and deliverance. Hee hath plucked us out of our enemies hands, hee hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed and spoiled those that ruled over us before, he hath delivered us from the power of Satan, and transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us into his owne Kingdome; wee are <hi>his free men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 11.22. Esai. 26.13, 14, 15. <hi>Ingratus Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus qui Patrono non praestat obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium.</hi> Iosh. 9.26, 27.</note> hee onely hath made us free from the Law of sinne and death, and hath rescued us as spoiles out of the hands of our enemies, and <hi>therefore</hi> wee are become <hi>his servants,</hi> and owe obedience unto him as our <hi>Patron</hi> and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer. As the Gibeonites when they were delivered from the sword of the children of Israel, were thereupon made hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the congregation: So wee being rescued out of the hands of those tyrannous Lords which ruled over us, doe now owe service and subjection unto him that hath so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully delivered us.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.18.7.6.</note> 
               <hi>Being made free from sinne</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>ye become the Servants of Righteousnesse.</hi> And, <hi>wee are delivered from the Law,</hi> that being dead wherin we were held, <hi>that wee should serve in newnesse of Spirit.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.15.</note> 
               <hi>Hee died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, by covenant and stipulation. <hi>I entred into
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:16264:160"/>
covenant with thee, and thou becamest mine.</hi> Therefore in our Baptisme we are said to bee <hi>Baptized into Christ,</hi> and to <hi>put on Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.8. Rom. 6.3, 5. Gal. 3.27. Act. 19.5.</note> and to bee <hi>Baptized into his name,</hi> that is, wholy to consecrate and devote our selves to him as the servants of his family. Therefore they which were Baptized in the ancient <note n="a" place="margin">

And therefore it is that wee still retaine the ancient forme of <hi>vow, promise, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in Baptisme,</hi> which <note n="b" place="margin">

For which purpose <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> calleth Baptisme <note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, according to the rules and courses and sinfull maximes of worldly men, in such indifferency, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliancie and connivence as may flatter others and delude himselfe; he that is freely and customarily over-rul'd by the temptations of Satan, that yeeldeth to loosnesse of heart, to vanity of thoughts, lusts of eye, pride of life, luxury, intemperance, impurity of minde or body, or any other earthly and inordinate affection, is little better in the sight of God than a perjured, &amp; a runnagate person, flinging off from that service unto which hee had bound himselfe by a solemne vow, and robbing Christ of that interest in him which by a mutuall stipulation was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon.</p>
            <p>Lastly, by the vertue of our communion with him, and participation of his grace and fulnesse. All that wee are in regard of Spirit and life is from him, <note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 12.11.</note> 
               <hi>Wee are nothing
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:16264:160"/>
of our selves.</hi> And wee <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 15.5.</note> 
               <hi>can doe nothing of our selves.</hi> All that wee are is from the grace of Christ. <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.10.</note> 
               <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am.</hi> And all that wee doe is from the grace of Christ,<note n="h" place="margin">Phil. 4.13.</note> 
               <hi>I am able to doe all things through Christ that strengthneth mee.</hi> As when we doe evill, <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 7 20.</note> it is not wee our selves, but sinne that dwelleth in us: So when wee doe good, it is <note n="k" place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> not wee, but Christ that liveth in us. So that in all respects wee are not our owne, but his that died for us.</p>
            <p>Now this being a point of so great consequence, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is that wee labor therein to try &amp; secure our selves that wee belong unto Christ.<note place="margin">Esai 29.13.</note> For which purpose wee must note that a man may belong unto Christ two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes: First, by a meere <hi>Externall profession.</hi> So all in the visible Church that call themselves Christians, are his, and his word and oracles theirs. In which respect they have many priviledges, (as the Apostle sheweth of the Iewes.) Yet notwithstanding such men continuing unreformed in their inner man, are neerer unto cursing than others, and subject unto a sorer condemnation, for despising Christ in his word, and Spirit, with whom in their Baptisme they made so solemne a covenant. For God will not suffer his Gospell to be cast away,<note place="margin">Esai. 55.10, 11.</note> but will cause it to prosper unto some end or other, either to save those that beleeve; or to cumulate the damnation of those that disobey it. Hee will be more carefull to cleanse his garner, and to purge his floore,<note place="margin">Luk. 3.17.</note> than of other empty and barren places. A weed in the garden is in more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of rooting out than in the open field. Such belong unto Christ, no otherwise than Ivy to the tree unto which it externally adheres. Secondly, a man may belong unto Christ by <hi>Implantation into his Body:</hi> Which is done by <hi>faith.</hi> But here wee are to note that as some branches in a tree have a more faint and unprofitable fellowship with the roote than others; as having no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strength than to furnish themselves with leaves, but
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:16264:161"/>
not with fruit: so, according unto the severall vertues or kindes of faith, may the degrees of mens in grafture into Christ bee judged of.<note place="margin">Iam. 2 26.</note> There is a dead, unoperative faith, which like <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall hath the nakednesse thereof covered onely with leaves, with meere formall &amp; hypocriticall conformities. And there is an unfained, lively,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.5.</note> and effectuall faith; which is availeable to those purposes for which faith was appointed, namely to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the person, to purifie the heart, to quench tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to carry a man with wisedome and an unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conversation through this present world, to worke by love, to grow and make a man abound in the service of the Lord. And this distinction our Savior giveth us, <hi>That there are some branches in him which beare not fruit,</hi> and those he taketh away:<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.2.</note> 
               <hi>And others which beare fruit,</hi> and those hee purgeth that they may bring forth more. Those onely are the branches, which hee desires to owne.</p>
            <p>And thus to belong unto Christ is that onely which maketh us <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>A purchased, a peculiar people unto him.</hi> And there are severall wayes of evidencing it. I will onely name two or three, and most in the Text. First, wee must know that Christ is a <hi>Morning-starre,</hi> a <hi>Sunne of Righteousnesse,</hi> and so ever comes to the soule <hi>with selfe-evidencing properties.</hi> Vnto him belongeth that royall prerogative, to write <hi>Teste Meipso</hi> in the hearts of men, to bee himselfe the witnesse to his owne Acts, purchases, and covenants. Therefore his Spirit came in tongues of fire, and in a mighty winde, all which have severall wayes of manifesting themselves, and stand not in need of any borrowed or forraigne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations. If Christ then bee in the heart hee will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himselfe. His Spirit is the Originall of Grace and strength, as concupiscence is of sinne. It is a seed in the heart which will spring up and shew it selfe. And therefore as lust doth take the first advantage of the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:16264:161"/>
faint and imperfect stirrings of the reasonable soule in little infants, to evidence it selfe in pride, folly, stubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and other childish sinnes: So the Spirit of grace in the heart cannot lie dead, but will worke, and move, and as a Spirit of burning by the light, heate, purging, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, inflaming, combating vertue which is in it, make the soule which was barren, and settled on the lees, and unacquainted with any such motions before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> stand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at its owne alteration, and say with <hi>Rebekah, If it bee so, why am I thus?</hi> Externals may bee imitated by art; but no man can paint the soule or the life, or the sense and motion of creature. Now Christ and his Spirit are the internall formes, and active principles in a Christian man, <hi>Christ liveth in us,</hi> when Christ who is <hi>our Life</hi> shall appeare, &amp;c. Therefore impossible it is that any hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite should counterfeite, and by consequence obscure those intimate and vitall workings of his grace in the soule, whereby hee evidenceth himselfe thereunto. It is true, a man that feareth the Lord may walke in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and be in such discomforts as he shall see no light; and yet even in that condition Christ doth not want properties to evidence himselfe, in tendernesse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, feare of sinne, striving of Spirit with God, close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart and constant recourse to him in his word, and the like; onely the soule is shut up and overclowded that it cannot discerne him.<note place="margin">Eph. 1.14. 1 Ioh. 4.3.</note> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ is a <hi>Seale,</hi> a <hi>witnesse,</hi> an earnest, an hansell, a <hi>first fruit</hi> of that fulnesse which is promised hereafter. It is Christs owne Spirit, and therefore fashioneth the hearts of those in whom it is unto his heavenly image, to long for more comprehension of him, for more conformity unto him, for more intimacie and communion with him, for more grace, wisedome, and strength from him; it turneth the bent and course of the soule from that earthly and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall end unto which it wrought before, as a good branch having been ingrafted into a wild stock con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:16264:162"/>
the sappe of a Crab into pleasant fruit.</p>
            <p>Againe, if a man be one of Christs people, then there hath a <hi>day of power</hi> passed over him, the sword of the Spirit hath entred into him, hee hath beene conquered by the rod of Christs strength, he hath felt <hi>Iohns</hi> axe laid to the root of his conscience, and hath beene perswaded by the terrour of the Lord; for the comming of Christ is with shaking: the conscience hath felt a mightie ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Word, though to other men it hath passed over like emptie breath; for the Word <hi>worketh effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in those that beleeve,</hi> and bringeth about the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for which it was sent.

            <p>Againe, where Christ comes, he comes with <hi>beautie and holinesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.9.14.</note> those who lay in their bloud and pollutions before bare &amp; naked, are made exceeding beautifull, and renowned for their beauty, <hi>perfect through the comelines which he puts upon them.</hi>

            <p>Lastly, where Christ commeth, he commeth with a <hi>wombe of the morning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 7.38.15.2.</note> with much light to acquaint the soule with his truth and promises; and with much fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, making the heart, which was barren before, to flow with rivers of living water,<note place="margin">Cant. 4.2.</note> to bring forth fruit more and more, and to abound in the workes of the Lord.<note place="margin">Esay 32.15.</note> These are the particular evidences of our belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ in the Text, and by these we must examine our selves.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.4.</note> Doe I finde in my soule the new name of the Lord Iesus written, that I am not onely in title, but in truth a Christian? Doe I finde the secret nature and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Christ fashioned in mee, swaying mine heart to the love and obedience of his holy wayes? Doe I heare the voice, and feele the hand and judicature of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit within me, leading me in a new course, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:16264:162"/>
mine inner man, sentencing and crucifying mine earthly members? Am I a serious and earnest enemie to my originall lusts, and closest corruptions? Doe I feele the workings and kindlings of them in mine heart with much paine and mourning, with much humiliation for them, and deprecation against them? Is Christ my cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Doe I finde in mine heart a willingnesse to be with him, as well here in his word, wayes, promises, directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, comforts, yea, in his reproches and persecutions, as hereafter in his glory? Is it the greatest businesse of my life to make my selfe more like him, to walke as he also walked, to be as he was in this world, to purifie my selfe even as he is pure? Hath the terrour of his wrath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded me, and shaken my conscience out of its carnall securitie, and made me looke about for a refuge from the wrath to come, and esteeme more beautifull than the morning brightnesse the feet of those who bring glad tidings of deliverance and peace? Hath his Gospell an effectual seminall vertue within me to new forme my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and life daily unto his heavenly Image? Is it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted word which mingleth with my conscience, and hideth it selfe in my heart, actuating, determining, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating, and over-ruling it to its owne way? Am I cleansed from my filthinesse, carefull to keepe my selfe chaste, comely, beautifull, a fit spouse for the fairest of ten thousand? Doe I rejoyce in his light, walking as a childe of light, living as an heire of light, going on like the Sunne unto the perfect day labouring to abound al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the work of the Lord? Then I may have good assurance that I belong unto Christ. And if so, that will be a seminary of much comfort to my soule.</p>
            <p>For first, if we are Christs, then he <hi>careth for us,</hi> for propriety is the ground of care. <hi>Hee that is an hireling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh 10.12, 13, 14.</note> saith our Saviour, <hi>and not the shepherd, whose owne the sheepe are not, seeth the wolfe comming, and leaveth the sheepe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Because hee is an hireling he careth not for the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:16264:163"/>
sheepe. But I am the good Shepherd, and know my sheepe, and am knowne of mine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 34.11-15.</note> 
               <hi>because they are mine, therefore I am carefull of them.</hi> He watcheth over us, he searcheth and seeketh us out in our stragglings, and feedeth us. This is the principall argument we have to beleeve, that God will looke upon us for good, notwithstanding our manifold provocations, because he is pleased to owne us, and to take us as his owne peculiar people. Though the Church be full of ruines,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.5, 6.</note> yet because it is his own house, he will repaire it;<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.8, 9.</note> though it be blacke aswell as comely, yet because it is his owne Spouse, he will pitie and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish it;<note place="margin">Ezek. 15.5.</note> though it bring forth wilde grapes, and bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed meet for no worke, yet because it is his owne vine, planted by his owne right hand,<note place="margin">Psal. 80.15.</note> and made strong for himselfe, he will therefore be carefull to fence and prune it. This is the onely argument we have to prevaile with God in prayer, that in Christ we call him <hi>Father,</hi> wee present our selves before him,<note place="margin">Esay 63.8-19.</note> as his <hi>owne,</hi> we make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of no other Lord or name over us, and therefore he cannot deny us the things which are good for us.<note place="margin">Esay 26.13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, if wee are Christs, then hee will certainely <hi>purge us,</hi> and make the members suteable to the head. I sware unto thee, and entred into covenant with thee, saith the Lord,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.8, 9.</note> and <hi>thou becamest mine,</hi> and immediately it followes, <hi>then washed I thee with water,</hi> yea, I through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly washed away thy bloud from thee.<note place="margin">Iohn 15.2.</note> Every branch <hi>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e</hi> that beareth fruit, <hi>he purgeth it,</hi> that it may bring forth more fruit.<note place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note> He <hi>purifieth to himselfe a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> If wee be his <hi>peculiar people,</hi> and set apart for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe (as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> speakes) he will undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>purifie us</hi>;<note place="margin">Psal. 4 3.</note> that we may be honourable vessels, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and meet for the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sters use, and prepared unto every good worke. He will furnish us with all such sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of the spirit of grace,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.21.</note> as the condition of that place in his body requires, in the which he hath set us. Grace and glory will he give, and no good thing will he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:16264:163"/>
from those who walke uprightly, our proprietie to Christ giveth us right unto all good things: <hi>All is yours, and you are Christs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, if we are Christs, then he will <hi>spare us.</hi> This was the argument which the Priest was to use betweene the Porch and the Altar, <hi>Spare thy people, O Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioel 2.17, 18.</note> and give not thine heritage to reproch. Then will the Lord be jealous for his Land, and <hi>pitie his people.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod 32.12. Numb. 14.13. Esay 64.9. Malac. 3.17.</note> They <hi>shall be mine,</hi> saith the Lord, in the day that I make up my jewels; and I will <hi>spare them,</hi> as a man <hi>spareth his owne sonne</hi> that serveth him. Of my servant, to whom I give wages for the merit of his worke, not out of love or grace, I expect a service proportionable to the pay hee receives: But in my childe I reward not the dignity of the worke, but onely the willingnesse, the loving and obedient disposition of the heart; and therefore I passe over those failings and weaknesses which discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for want of skill or strength, and not of love, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the endevours, and pardoning the miscarriages. Thus doth the Lord deale with his children.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if we be Christs he will <hi>pray for us,</hi> I pray not for the world, but <hi>for them which thou hast given me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 17.9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>for they are thine; and all mine are thine, and thine are mine,</hi> &amp;c. so that wee shall be sure to have helpe in all times of need,<note place="margin">Iohn 11.42.</note> because we know that tho Father heareth his Sonne alwayes; and those things which in much feare, weaknesse, and ignorance we aske for our selves, if it bee according to Gods will, and by the dictate and mouth of the Spirit in our heart, Christ himselfe in his intercession demandeth for us the same things. <hi>And this is the ground of that confidence which we have in him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5.14.</note> 
               <hi>that if wee aske any thing according to his will hee heareth us, and we have the petitions that we desire of him:</hi> For as the world hateth us, because it hateth him first; so the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loveth and heareth us, because he loveth and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him first.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:16264:164"/>Fifthly, if wee be Christs, then hee <hi>will teach us,</hi> and commune with us, and reveale himselfe unto us, and lead us with his voice. He <hi>calleth his owne sheepe by name, and leadeth them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 10.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>and putteth them forth, and goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</hi> Because Israel was his owne people, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he shewed them his words.<note place="margin">Psal. 147.19. Iohn 8.17.</note> 
               <hi>The Law was theirs, and the Oracles theirs,</hi> when hee entreth into covenant with a people, that they become his, then he writeth his Law in their hearts, and teacheth them. This is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Davids</hi> argument,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.125.</note> 
               <hi>I am thy servant, give me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>: Because I am thine in a speciall relation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acquaint me with thee in an especiall manner. <hi>The earth is full of thy mercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 64.</note> there is much of thy goodnesse revealed to all the nations of the world, even to those that are not called by thy name: but as for mee whom thou hast made thine owne by a neerer relation, let mee have experience of a greater mercy, <hi>Teach mee thy Statutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 30.10, 11.</note>Sixthly, if we be his, he will <hi>chastise us in mercy,</hi> and not in fury, though he leave us not altogether unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, yet he will punish us lesse than our iniquities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; he will not deale with us as with others: <hi>Though I make a full end of all nations whither I have driven thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 9.13.</note> 
               <hi>yet I will not make a full end of thee,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>but I will correct thee in measure.</hi> I will correct thee to cure, but not to ruine thee.</p>
            <p>The second thing considered in the words, was the <hi>Present condition of the people of Christ,</hi> which was to be <hi>military men,</hi> to joyne with the armies of Christ against all his enemies. As he was, so must we be in this world; no sooner was Christ consecrated by his solemne Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme unto the worke of a Mediatour, but presently hee was assaulted by the Tempter: And no sooner doth any man give up his name to Christ, and breake loose from that hellish power under which hee was held, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoasts, Satan and his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:16264:164"/>
pursue him with deadly fury, and powre out flouds of malice and rage against him. Hell and death are <hi>at truce with wicked men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 28.15.</note> there is a <hi>covenant</hi> and agreement betwixt them, Satan <hi>holdeth his possession in peace:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 11.21.</note> but when a stronger than he commeth upon, and overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him, there is from that time implacable venom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and hostility against such a soule; the malice, power, policie, stratagems, and machianations of Satan; the lusts and vanities, the pleasures, honours, profits, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, frownes, flatteries, snares of the wicked world: the affections, desires, inclinations, deceits of our owne fleshly hearts, will ever plie the soule of a Christian, and force it to perpetuall combates.</p>
            <p>There is in Satan an everlasting enmitie against the glory, mercy, and truth of God, against the power and mystery of the Gospel of Christ. This malice of his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth it selfe against all those that have given themselves to Christ, whose Kingdome he mightily laboureth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molish: by his <hi>power</hi> persecuting it, by his <hi>craftinesse</hi> and wily insinuations undermining it; by his vast know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and <hi>experience</hi> in palliating, altering, mixing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning, and measuring his temptations and spirituall wickednesse in such manner, as that he may subvert the Church of Christ, either in the <hi>purity</hi> thereof, by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Christ with <hi>heresie,</hi> and his <hi>worship</hi> with <hi>idolatrie</hi> and <hi>superstition</hi>; or in the <hi>unity</hi> thereof, by pestering it with <hi>schisme</hi> and distraction; or in the <hi>liberty</hi> thereof, by <hi>bondage</hi> of conscience, or in the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse</hi> and inlargement thereof, endevouring to blast and make fruitlesse the ministery of the Gospell. And this malice of Satan is wonderfully set on and encouraged both by the <hi>corruption of our nature,</hi> those armies of lusts and affections which swarme within us, entertaining, joyning force, and co-operating with all his suggestions; disheartning, reclaiming, and pulling backe the soule when it offers to make any opposition; and also by the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:16264:165"/>
               <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>materials</hi> of this evill <hi>world.</hi> By the examples, the threats, the interests, the power, the intimacie, the wit, the tongues, the hands, the exprobrations, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, the insinuations and seductions of wicked men. By the profits, the pleasures, the preferments, the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, credit and applause of the world.</p>
            <p>By all which meanes Satan most importunately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth one of these <hi>two ends,</hi> either to <hi>subvert</hi> the godly by drawing them away from Christ to apostacie, formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hypocrisie, spirituall pride, and the like, or else to <hi>Discomfort</hi> them with diffidence, doubts, sight of sinne, opposition of the times, vexation of spirit, and the like afflictions. And these oppositions of Satan meet with a Christian in every respect or consideration, under which he may be conceiv'd: consider him in his <hi>spirituall estate,</hi> in his <hi>severall parts,</hi> in his <hi>temporall relations,</hi> in his <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or imployments</hi>; and in all these Satan is busie to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the Kingdome of Christ in him. In his <hi>spirituall estate,</hi> if he be a <hi>weake Christian,</hi> he assaulteth him with perpetuall doubts and feares touching his election, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, adoption, perseverance, christian liberty, strength against corruptions, companies, temptations, persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. if he be a <hi>strong Christian,</hi> he laboureth to draw him unto selfe-confidence, spirituall pride, contempt of the weake, neglect of further proficiencie, and the like. There is no <hi>naturall part</hi> or facultie which is not aimed at likewise by the malice of Satan, for Christ when hee comes, takes possession of the whole man, and therefore Satan sets himselfe against the whole man. Corporeall and <hi>sensitive faculties</hi> tempted either to <hi>sinfull represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> letting in and transmitting the provisions of lust unto the heart, by gazing and glutting themselves on the objects of the world: or to <hi>sinfull executions,</hi> finishing and letting out those lusts which have beene conceived in the heart. The <hi>phantasie</hi> tempted by Satanicall inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and immutations to be the forge of loose, vaine,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:16264:165"/>
unprofitable, and uncleane thoughts. The <hi>understanding</hi> to earthly wisdome, vanity, infidelity, prejudices, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perswasions, fleshly reasonings, vaine speculations and curiosities, &amp;c. The <hi>will</hi> to stiffenesse, resistance, dislike of holy things, and pursuite of the world. The <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to deadnesse, immobilitie, and a stupid benummed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to slavish terrours and evidences of hell, to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious bondage, to carnall securitie, to desperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions. The <hi>affections</hi> to independence, distraction, excesse, precipitancie, &amp;c. In <hi>temporall conditions,</hi> there is no estate of health, wealth, peace, honor, estimation, or the contraries unto these: no relation of husband, father, magistrate, subject, &amp;c. unto which Satan hath not such suteable suggestions, as by the advantage of fleshly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions may take from them occasion to draw a man from God. Lastly, in regard of our <hi>actions and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> whether they be <hi>Divine,</hi> such as respect <hi>God,</hi> as acts of pietie, in reading, hearing, meditating, and study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Word, in calling upon his name, and the like, or such as respect <hi>our selves,</hi> as acts of temperance and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, personall examinations, and more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with our owne hearts: or such as respect <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> as acts of righteousnesse, charity, and edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Or whether they be actions <hi>naturall,</hi> such as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to the preservation of our being, as sleepe and diet: or actions <hi>civill,</hi> in our <hi>callings</hi> or <hi>recreations,</hi> in all these Satan laboureth either to <hi>pervert</hi> us in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them, or to <hi>divert</hi> us from it. There is then no condition, facultie, relation, or action of a Christian man, the which is not alwayes under the eye and envy of a most raging, wise, and industrious enemie. And therefore, great reason there is, that Christians should be <hi>Military men,</hi> well instructed in the whole armour of God, that they may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devill, and to quench all his firy darts. It is our calling to wrestle against principalities and powers, and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:16264:166"/>
spirituall wickednesses in high places, to resist the devill, to strive against sinne, to mortifie earthly members, to destroy the body of sinne, to denie our selves, to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the reasonings of the flesh, to checke and controule the stirrings of concupiscence, to resist and subdue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of our evill hearts, to withstand and answere the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of Satan, to out-face the scornes, and despise the flatteries of the present world, in all things to endure hardnesse as the souldiers of Iesus Christ. Our cause is righteous, our captaine is wise and puissant, our service honourable, our victory certaine, our reward massie and eternall, so that in all respects great encouragements we have to be voluntaries in such warre, the issue whereof is our enemies perdition, our Masters honour, and our owne Salvation.</p>
            <p>The third thing observed was the through and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Resignation</hi> and devotednesse of Christs people unto him. Thy people shall be <hi>willing,</hi> or a people <hi>of great devotion</hi> in the day of thy Power. From whence I shall gather two observations: First, They that belong unto Christ as his people are most throughly and <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly subject unto his government,</hi> doe consecrate, resigne, and yeeld up their whole soules and bodies to serve in his warres against all his enemies. For the distinct un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of which point we are to observe first, that <hi>by nature</hi> wee are <hi>utterly unwilling</hi> to be subject unto Christ.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.7, 8, 10.</note> The carnall minde is enmitie against God, it is <hi>not subject</hi> to the Law of God, <hi>neither indeed can bee.</hi> For if Christ be over us, the body of sinne must dye; it once crucified him, and he will be reveng'd upon it. By nature wee are willingly subject unto no Law, but the Law of our members,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.17. 1 Sam. 15.23.</note> nor to no will, but the will of the flesh; full of contumacie, rebellion, and stoutnesse of spirit against the truth and beauty of the word or wayes of God. The Love of corrupted nature is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. 8.11. Prov. 14.14.</note> set upon our owne wayes, as an <note n="b" place="margin">Ier. 2.24.8.6. Hos. 4.16.</note> untamed heifer,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:16264:166"/>
or a wilde asse; men <note n="c" place="margin">Ier. 2.20.</note> wander, and <note n="d" place="margin">Ier. 31.22.</note> goe about, and <note n="e" place="margin">Esai. 57.10.</note> wearie themselves in their full compasse and swinge of lust, and will not be turned. And therefore it is that they bid God <note n="f" place="margin">Iob 21.14.</note> depart from them, and desire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his wayes, that they leave the paths of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that having <note n="g" place="margin">Deut. 32.5.</note> crooked hearts of their owne, they labour likewise to pervert and <note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 1.7. 2 Pet. 3.16.</note> make crooked the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell of Christ, that they may from thence steale coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to their sinnes, contrary to that holy affection of <note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 5.8.</note> 
               <hi>David, Make my way strait before me,</hi> that they <note n="k" place="margin">Mal. 1.13.</note> snuffe and rage, and <note n="l" place="margin">Nehem. 9.29.</note> pull away the shoulder, and <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 7.51.</note> fall back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 7.39.</note> thrust away God from them. And hence it is that men are so apt to cavill, and foolishly to charge the wayes of God; first, as <hi>grievous wayes</hi>; too full of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, narrownesse and restraint. <note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 25.24</note> 
               <hi>I knew that thou wert an austere man</hi>; and this is an <note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 6.60.</note>

The young man whom for his ingenuity and forwardnesse Christ loved came in a sad and serious manner to learne of Christ the way to heaven: and yet wee finde there were secret reservations which he had not discerned in himselfe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on discoverie whereof by Christ he was discouraged and made repent of his resolution, <hi>Mark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Saint <hi>Iames</hi> tels us that a <hi>double-minded man is unstable in all his wayes, Iam.</hi> 1.8. never uniforme nor constant to any rules.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:16264:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as the workings and representations of the one or other are at the time more fresh and predominant, in like maner is sinne for that time either cherished or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. Many men at a good Sermon, when the matter is fresh and newly presented, while they are looking on their face in the glasse; or in any extremitie of sicknesse, when the provisions of lust doe not relish for the present, when they have none but thoughts of salvation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon, are very resolute to make promises, vowes, and professions of better living; but when the pleasures of sin grow strong to present themselves again, they returne like a man recover'd of an ague with more stomacke and greedinesse to their lusts againe. As water which hath been stop'd for a while rusheth with the more violence, when its passages are opened. A double heart is like the boles of a Scale, according as more weight is put into one or other, so are they indifferently over-rul'd unto either motion, up or downe. When I see a vapour ascend out of the earth into the aire, why should I not thinke that it will never leave rising till it get up to heaven? and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the motion is not naturall, but caused either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion from a heat within, or by attraction from a heat without, when the cause of that ascent is abated, and the matter gathers together into a thicker consistence, it growes heavie and fals downe againe. Even such is the affection of those faint &amp; unresolved desires of men who like <hi>Agrippa</hi> are but <hi>halfe-perswaded</hi> to believe in Christ.</p>
            <p>But now lastly wee must observe, that in the day of Christs power, when he by his word and Spirit worketh effectually in the hearts of men, they are then made <hi>free-will offerings, Totally willing to</hi> obey and serve him in all conditions.

            <p>This <hi>willingnesse</hi> of Christs people sheweth it selfe in two things: First, in begetting most cordiall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Enmitie</hi> against all the enemies of Christ, never holding any league or intelligence with them, but being alwayes ready to answere the Lord as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Saul, Thy servant will goe and fight with this Philistime.</hi> Hee that is a voluntary in Christs armies is not disheartned with the potencie, policie, malice, subtlety, or prevailing faction of any of his adversaries. Hee is contented to deny himselfe, to renounce the friendship of the world, to bid defiance to the allurements of Satan, to smile upon the face of danger, to hate father, and mother, and land, and life, to be cruel to himselfe, and regardlesse of others for his masters service. Through honor and dishonor, through evill report and good report, through a Sea and a wildernesse, through the hottest services, and strongest oppositions will hee follow the Lambe whither soever he goeth: though he receive the word <hi>in much affliction,</hi> yet hee will receive it <hi>with joy</hi> too. Secondly, in begetting most loving, constant, and <hi>deare affections to the</hi> mercy, grace, glory, and wayes of God, an universall conformity
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:16264:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unto Christ our head, who was contented to take upon him the forme of a servant, to have his eare bored, and his will subjected unto the will of his Father. <hi>I delight to doe thy will ô my God, yea, thy Law is within my heart, Psal.</hi> 40.8. And as hee was, so are all his in this world, of the same minde, judgement, Spirit, conversation, and therefore of the same will too.</p>
            <p>Now this deare and melting affection of the heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Christ and his wayes, whereby the soule longeth after him, and hasteth unto him, is wrought by severall principles: First, by the <hi>Conviction of our naturall Estate,</hi> and a through humiliation for the same. <hi>Pride is ever the principle of disobedience.</hi> They were the <hi>proud</hi> men who said unto <hi>Ieremie, thou speakest falsly, the Lord hath not sent thee, Ier.</hi> 43.2. And they were the proud men who hardned their necks, and withdrew the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and <hi>would not heare,</hi> and refused to obey, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.16, 17, 29. A man must bee first brought to denie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before hee will bee willing to follow Christ, and to lug a crosse after him. A man must first <hi>humble himselfe before he will walke with God, Mic.</hi> 6.8. The poore onely receive the Gospell. The hungrie onely finde sweetnesse in bitter things. Extremities will make any man not onely willing but thankfull to take any course wherin hee may recover himselfe and subsist againe; when the soule findes it selfe in darknesse, and hath no light, and begins to consider whither darknesse leads it; that it is even now in the mouth of Hell, under the paw of the roaring lion, under the guilt of sinne, the curse of the Law, and the hatred and wrath of God, it cannot chuse but most willingly pursue any probability, and with most inlarged affections meete any tender of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: Suppose wee that a Prince should cause some bloudy malefactor to bee brought forth, should set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes all the racks and tortures which the wit of man can invent to punish prodigions offenders withall,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:16264:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and should cause him to tast some of those extremities: and then in the middest of his howling and anguish, should not onely reach out a hand of mercy to deliver him, but should further promise him upon his submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to advance him like <hi>Ioseph</hi> from the iron which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into his soule, unto publike honor and service in the state, would not the heart of such a man bee melted into thankfulnesse, and with all submission resigne it selfe unto the mercy and service of so gracious a Prince? Now the Lord doth not onely deale thus with sinners; doth not onely cause them by the report of his word, and by the experience of their own guilty hearts, to feel the weight, fruitlesnesse, and shame of sinne, and the first fruits of that eternall vengeance which is thereunto due: not onely set forth Christ before them as a rock of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reaching out a hand to save, and offering great and pretious promises of an exceeding, eternall, abundant weight of glory: but besides all this doth inwardly touch the heart by the finger of his Spirit, framing it to a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and divine conformity unto Christ. How can the soule of such a man in these present extremities of horror, which yet are but the pledges of infinite more which must ensue; and in the evidence of so wonderfull and sweete promises, the seales of the eternall favor and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of God, choose but with much importunity of affection to lay hold on so great a hope which is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and with all readinesse and ambition of so high a service, yeild up it selfe into the hands of so gracious a Lord, to bee by him ordered and over-ruled unto any obedience?</p>
            <p>Secondly, this <hi>willingnesse</hi> of Christs People is wrought by a <hi>spirituall illumination of minde.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Conversion</hi> of sinners is called a <hi>Conviction,</hi> because it is ever wrought in us <hi>Secundum modum judicii</hi> as wee are reasonable and intelligent creatures. I take it (under favor and submission to better judgements) for a
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:16264:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firme truth; that if the minde of a man were once throughly and in a spirituall manner (as it becommeth such objects as are altogether spirituall) possessed of the adequate goodnesse and truth which is in grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the heart could not utterly reject them; for humane liberty is not a brutish, but a reasonable thing, it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth not in contumacie or headstrongnesse, but in such a manner of working, as is apt to bee regulated, varied, or suspended by the dictates of right reason. The onely cause why men are not willing to submit unto Christ is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not throughly and in a manner suteable to the spirituall excellency of the things, illightned in their minde. The Apostle often maketh mention of <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 4.17. Act. 14 26. 2 Tim. 4.5. Rom. 15.19.</note> 
               <hi>fulfilling</hi> and <hi>making full proofe of our ministery,</hi> and of <hi>preaching the Gospell fully,</hi> namely <hi>with the evidence of the Spirit and of power,</hi> and with such a <hi>manifestation of the truth as doth commend it selfe unto the conscience of a man. The</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>Word of God,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is not yea and nay,</hi> that is, a thing which may bee admitted or denied at pleasure, but such a word as hath no inevidence in it selfe, nor leaveth any uncertainty or hesitancie in a minde sitted to receive it. And as wee may thus distinguish of <hi>preaching,</hi> that there is an imperfect and a full preaching: so may wee distinguish of understanding the things preached, in some it is <hi>full,</hi> and in others but <hi>superficiall</hi>; for there is a <hi>Twofold illumination</hi> of the minde, the one <hi>Theoreticall</hi> and meerly <hi>Notionall</hi> consisting in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; the other <hi>Practicall, Experimentall, and spirituall</hi>; consisting in the irradiation of the soule by the light of Gods countenance, in such an apprehension of the truth as maketh the <hi>heart to burne</hi> therby,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.32. 1 Cor. 8.2.</note> 
               <hi>when we know things as wee ought to know them,</hi> that is, when the manner and life of our knowledge is answerable to the nature and excellencie of the things knowne, when the eye is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually opened to beleeve, and seriously conclude that the things spoken are of most pretious and everlasting conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:16264:171"/>
to the soule, as things that concerne our peace with God. This is the <hi>Learning of Christ,</hi> the <hi>teaching of the Father,</hi> the <hi>knowing of things which passe knowledge,</hi> the <hi>setting to the seale of our owne hearts that God is true,</hi> the evidence of spirituall things not to the braine but to the conscience. In one word this is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle calleth, <hi>a spirituall Demonstration.</hi> And surely in this case the heart is never over-ruled contrary to the full, spirituall, and infallible evidence of divine truths unto a practicall judgement. Therefore the Apostle saith that <hi>Eve being Deceived</hi> was in the transgression,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.14.</note> and there is frequent mention made of the <hi>deceitfulnesse of sinne,</hi> to note that sinne got into the world, by <hi>error <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, <hi>a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Appetite,</hi> and therefore (as <hi>I</hi> conceive) doth not stirre from such a good as is fully and spiritually repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented thereunto, as the most universall, adequate, and unquestionable object of the desires and capacities of a humane soule; for the freedome, and willing consent of the heart is not lawlesse, or without rules to moderate it, but it is therefore said to bee free because whether out of a true judgement it move one way, or out of a false, another, yet in both it moveth <hi>naturally, secundum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum sibi competentem,</hi> in a manner suteable to its owne condition.</p>
            <p>If it bee objected that the heart being unregenerate is utterly averse unto any good, and therefore is not likely to bee made willing by the illumination of the minde.

But withall, that God doth never so fully and spiritually convince the judgement, in that manner, of which I have spoken, without a speciall worke of grace thereupon, opening the eye, and removing all naturall ignorance, prejudice, hesitancie, inadvertency, misperswasion, or any other distemper of the minde
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:16264:172"/>
which might hinder the evidence of spirituall truth. By which meanes hee also frameth and fashioneth the will to accept, embrace, and love those good things, of which the minde is thus prepossessed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this <hi>willingnesse</hi> of Christs people is wrought by the <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>adspiration of the spirit of Grace,</hi> which is a <hi>free spirit, a spirit of love,</hi> and <hi>a spirit of liberty,</hi> a spirit which is in every faculty of man as the soule and principle of its Christianity or heavenly being and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.<note place="margin">Psal. 51.12. 2 Tim. 1.7. 2 Cor. 3.17.</note> And therefore it makes every faculty <hi>secundum modum sibi proprium</hi> to worke unto spirituall ends and objects. As the soule in the eye causeth that to see, and in the eare to heare, and in the tongue to speake: so the spirit of Grace in the minde causeth it rightly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and in the will causeth it freely to desire heavenly things; and in every facultie causeth it to move towards Christ in such a way and maner of working as is sute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its nature.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this <hi>willingnesse of Christs</hi> people ariseth from the <hi>apprehension of Gods deare love, bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and riches of most unsearchable grace, revealed in the face of Iesus Christ to every broken and penitent spirit. Love is naturally, when it is once apprehended, an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive of love. And therefore it is that the Apostle saith, <hi>Faith worketh by love,</hi> that is, By faith first the heart is perswaded and affected with Gods Love unto us in Christ. <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himselfe for me, Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17, 18. Being thus perswaded of his love to us, the <hi>heart is framed to love him againe:</hi> for who can be perswaded of so great a benefit as the remission of sinnes, and not be most deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflamed with the love of him by whom they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. and lastly, by this reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall love of the heart to Christ, <hi>faith becommeth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall</hi> to worke obedience and conformitie to his will. <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> he that loves God would
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:16264:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with all joyfulnesse fulfill every jot of Gods Law if it were possible; <hi>This is the love of God,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>that we keepe his Commandements, and his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not grievous.</hi> True love overcomes all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is not apt to pretend occasions for neglecting any service of God, nor to conceive any prejudices against it, but puts an edge and alacritie upon the spirit of a man, he can no more be said to love Christ, who doth not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly undergoe his yoke, than that woman to love her husband who is ever griev'd at his presence, and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth more in the societie of strangers.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, this <hi>willingnesse</hi> of Christs people ariseth from the <hi>beauty and pretiousnesse of those ample Promises,</hi> which by the love of Christ are made unto us. It is said of <hi>Moses</hi> that he did <hi>chuse</hi> (and that is the greatest act of willingnesse) rather to suffer affliction with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sinne for a season: and the ground of this willingnesse was, <hi>he had a respect unto the recompence of the reward, Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26. so Christ endured the Crosse, and despised the shame, that is, the shame (which would much have stagger'd and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened an unresolved man) was no prejudice or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement unto him, to abate any of his most willing obedience, and the motive was, <hi>for the joy that was set before him, Heb.</hi> 12.2. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> professeth of himselfe that he <hi>pressed forward,</hi> hee was not onely willing, but importunate and contentious to put forth all his spirits, and like riders in a race to rouse up himselfe in a holy fervour and emulation, and all this was <hi>for the Price of the high calling of God in Christ Iesus,</hi> which was, as it were, before his face in the Promises thereof. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. so the Apostle assureth us, That a Christians Hope to be like unto Christ hereafter, will cause him to purifie himselfe even as hee is pure, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3. when a man shall sit downe and recount with <hi>David,</hi> what God hath done for him already.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:16264:173"/>
               <hi>Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</hi> And what God hath further promised to doe for him more. <hi>Thou hast also spoken of thy servants house for a great while to come.</hi> Of a childe of wrath thou hast called mee to an inheritance of the Saints in light, and into the fellowship of more glory than can be shadowed forth by all the lights of heaven, though every Star were turned into a Sunne; I say, when the soule shall thus recount the goodnesse of God, how can it but bee wonderfully enlarged with thoughts of thankfulnesse, and grieved at the slow and narrow abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the other parts to answer the urgent and wide desires of a willing soule?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, this <hi>willingnesse</hi> of Christs people ariseth from <hi>the experience of that peace, comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> life, liberty, triumph and securitie</hi> which accompanieth the Spirit and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Christ. Nothing makes a man more fearefull of warres than the dangers and hazards which are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thereunto. But if a man can serve under such a Prince, whose imployments are not onely honourable, but safe; if he, who is able and faithfull to make good his words, promise us that none either of the stratagems or forces of the enemie shall doe us hurt, but that they shall flie before us, while wee resist them: who would not be a <hi>Voluntary</hi> in such services as are not liable to the casualties and vicissitudes which usually attend other warres, wherein he might fight with safetie, and come off with honour? <hi>David</hi> had experience of Gods power in delivering him from the Lion and the Beare, and was well assured that that God who was carefull of sheepe, would be more pitiful to his people Israel, and that made him with much willingnesse ready to encounter <hi>Goliah,</hi> whose assurance was onely in himselfe and not in God. When a man shall consider what God might have done with him, he might have sent him from the wombe to hell, depriv'd him of the meanes of grace, left him to the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:16264:173"/>
rebellion and hardnesse of his evill heart, and to the rage of Satan, burnt his bones, and dried up his bowels with the view of that wrath which is due to sinne, and what he hath done with him; he hath called him to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his will, refreshed him with the light of his countenance, heard his prayers, given an issue to his temptations, and a reviving out of bondage, fastned him as a naile in his holy place, given him his favour which is better than light, and spoken of his servant for a long time to come; O how readily will the spirit of such a man conclude, Lord, according to thine owne heart hast thou done all this unto me, and I have found so much sweetnesse in thy service above all mine owne thoughts or expectations, that now, O Lord, my heart is prepared, my heart is prepared, I will sing and rejoyce in thy service.</p>
            <p>Lastly, this <hi>willingnesse</hi> of Christs people ariseth from that excellent <hi>beauty and attractive vertue</hi> which is in holinesse. <hi>Thy Law is pure, therefore thy servant loveth it.</hi> And therefore we finde Christ and his Church doe kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the coales of love, and stirre up those flames of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall dearenesse towards one another, doe cherish those longing, languishing, and ravished affections, and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirings of hearts, by the frequenting contemplations of each others beautie. <hi>Behold, thou art faire my love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou art faire, thou hast doves eyes. Behold, thou art faire my beloved, yea pleasant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.15, 16. These are the principles of that great devotion and willingnesse which is in the people of Christ unto his service.</p>
            <p>And hereby we may make triall of the truth of that profession, subjection, and obedience which we all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto the Gospell of Christ.<note place="margin">Act. 11.23.</note> It is then onely sound when it proceeds from a willing and devoted heart, from purpose, fervour and earnestnesse of Spirit;<note place="margin">Rom. 12.11.</note> for as God in mercy accounts <hi>the will for the deed</hi>;<note place="margin">Gal. 4.18.</note> because where there is a willing minde there will certainly be all answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

               </note> will: <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> did both sacrifice, it was the heart which made the difference betweene them: let the outward conversation be what it will, yet <hi>if a man regard iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in his heart,</hi> God will not heare him. <hi>Gravius est di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligere peccatum quam facere:</hi> It is a worse token (saith <hi>Gregory</hi>) of an evill man to love sinne, than to commit it, for it may be committed out of temptation and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and so may be either in part the sin of another that tempteth us, or at least not the sinne of our <hi>whole selves,</hi> but of those remainders of corruption which dwel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us. But <hi>our love is all our owne,</hi> Satan can but offer a temptation, the heart it selfe must love it: and love is strong as death, it worketh by the strength of the whole man, and therefore ever <hi>such as the will is</hi> (which is the seat of love) <hi>such is the service</hi> too. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is: First, because the <hi>will is the first mover,</hi> and the master-wheele in spirituall workes, that which regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all the rest, and keepeth them right and constant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which holdeth together all the faculties of the soule and bodie in the execution of Gods will. In which sense, amongst others I understand that of the Apostle, <hi>That love is the bond of perfection,</hi> because when love resideth in the heart, it will put together every facultie to doe that worke of God perfectly which it goes about. And therefore by a like expression it is called <hi>The fulfilling of the Law,</hi> because love aimes still at the highest, and at the best in that thing which it loves, it is ever an enemie to defects. He that loves learning will never stop, and say I have enough, in this likewise love is as death. And he that loves grace, will be still <hi>Ambitious to abound</hi> in the worke of the Lord, and to presse forward unto perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to make up that which is wanting to his faith, to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:16264:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be sanctified throughout, to bring forth more fruit, to walke <hi>in all pleasing,</hi> to be holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable, without spot or wrinkle. It is an absurd thing in religion to dote upon mediocrities of grace; <hi>in eo non potest esse nimium, quod esse maximum debet</hi>; Hee that with all the exactnesse and rigour of his heart, can never gather together <hi>all grace,</hi> can surely never have too much. In false religions no man so much magnified as he that is strictest: that Papist which is most cruel to his flesh, most assiduous at his beads, most canonicall in his houres, most macerated with superstitious penance, most frequently prostrated before his idols, is of all other most admired for the greatest Saint. O why should not an holy strictnesse be as much honoured as a superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? why should not exactnesse, purity, and a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto perfection, be as much pursued in a true as in a false religion? Why should not every man strive to be filled with grace, since he can never have enough till hee have it all, till he is brimme-full? Hee that truely loves wealth, would be the richest; and he that loves honour, would be the highest of any other: certainly grace is in it selfe more lovely than any of these things. Why then should not every man strive to be most unlike the evill world, and to be more excellent than his neighbour, to be holy as God is holy, to be as Christ himselfe was in this world, to grow up in unity of faith, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, unto a perfect man? Certainely, if a man once set his will and his heart upon grace, he will never rest in mediocrities; he will labour to abound more and more, he will never think himselfe to have apprehended, but forgetting the things which are behinde, hee will reach forth to those things which are before him, for all the desires of the heart are strong, and will over-rule any other naturall desire. The griefe of <hi>Davids</hi> heart made him forget to eat his bread. The desire of Christs heart to convert the Samaritan woman, made him carelesse of

               <note place="margin">Iudg. 5.2, 9.</note>Secondly, because <hi>God is more honoured in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the will</hi> than of the outward man. Humane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints may rule this, but nothing but Grace can rule the other; for herein we acknowledge God to bee the searcher of hearts, the discerner of secret thoughts, the Iudge and Lord over our consciences. <hi>Whatsoever ye doe</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>doe it heartily as to the Lord, and not to men.</hi> Noting unto us that a man doth never respect the Lord in any service which commeth not willingly, and from the inner man. Now he worketh in vaine, and loseth all that he hath wrought, who doth not worke for him who is master of the businesse he goes about, and who onely doth reward it. Therefore saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Doe it heartily as to the Lord, knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the Reward of the inheritance, for you serve the Lord Christ.</hi> He onely is the pay-master of such kinde of worke, and therefore doe it onely as to him, so that he may approve and reward it.</p>
            <p>Before I leave this point touching the willingnesse of Christs people, here is a great case, and of frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence to be resolved, Whether those who are truely of Christs people may not have feares, torments, uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortablenesse, wearinesse, unwillingnesse in the wayes of God? Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in generall states the case, <hi>There is no feare in love, but perfect love casteth out feare: Because feare hath torment,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.18. so that it seemes where
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:16264:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is torment, and wearinesse, there is no love: for the cleering of this case, I shall set downe some few posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>First, in generall, where there is true obedience there is ever a <hi>willing and a free spirit,</hi> in this degree at the least, a most deepe desire of the heart, and serious endevour of the spirit of a man to walke in all well-pleasing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God: a longing for such fulnesse of Grace, and enlargement of soule as may make a man fit to runne the way of Gods Commandements.</p>
            <p>Secondly, where there is this <hi>will,</hi> yet there may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other reasons be such a <hi>feare</hi> as hath paine and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it, and that in two respects: First, there may be a <hi>feare of Gods wrath,</hi> the soule of a righteous man may be surpriz'd with some glimpses and apprehensions of his most heavie displeasure, he may conceive himselfe set up as <hi>Gods mark to shoot at, Iob</hi> 7.20. that the <hi>poisoned ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and terrors of the wrath of God doe sticke fast upon him, Iob</hi> 6.4. that <hi>his transgressions are sealed up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd against him, Iob</hi> 14.17. The hot displeasure of the Lord may even <hi>vexe his bones,</hi> and make his soule sore within him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. Hee may conceive himselfe <hi>forgotten and cast out by God,</hi> surprized with feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, trembling, and the horrour of death, <hi>Psal.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 55.4, 5. Christ may withdraw himselfe and bee gone, in regard of any comfortable and sensible fruition of his fellowship, and in that case the soule may faile and seeke him but not finde him, and call upon him but receive no answere, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. A man may feare the Lord, and yet be in darkenesse, and have no light, <hi>Esai.</hi> 50.10. Secondly, there may bee a great <hi>feare even of performing spirituall duties.</hi> A broken and dejected man may tremble in Gods service, and upon a deepe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of his owne unworthinesse, and erroneous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of that sad expostulation of God with wicked men, <hi>What hast thou to doe to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

mouth? Psalm.</hi> 50.16. And, <hi>what hath my beloved to doe in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdnesse with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? Ier.</hi> 11.15. he may be startled, and not dare adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon such holy and sacred things without much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancie, and shame of spirit. <hi>O my God,</hi> saith <hi>Ezra, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my God: for our iniquities are increased over our heads, Ezra</hi> 9.6. Thus it is said of the poore woman who upon the touch of Christs garment had beene healed of her bloudy is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, That <hi>shee came fearing and trembling, and fell downe</hi> before Christ, and told him the truth, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.33. But yet great difference there is betweene this feare of the Saints, and of the wicked. The feare of the wicked ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out of the evidences of the guilt of sinne, but the feare of the Saints from a tender <hi>apprehension of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie of God,</hi> and his most pure eyes which cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to behold uncleannesse (which made <hi>Moses</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to tremble, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.32.) and out of a deepe <hi>sense of their owne unworthinesse</hi> to meddle with holy things. And such a feare as this may bring much <hi>uncomfortablenesse</hi> and distraction of spirit; but, <hi>never</hi> at all <hi>any dislike</hi> or hatred of God, or any stomacke-full disobedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: for as the feare of the soule deterres, so the necessity of the precept drives him to an endeavour of obedience and well-pleasing; slavish feare forceth a man to doe the dutie some way or other, without any eye or respect unto the manner of doing it. But this other which is indeed a filiall, but yet withall an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable feare, rather disswades from the dutie it selfe, the heart being so vile; and unfit to performe so pretious a duty in so holy a manner as becomes it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as the Saints may have <hi>feare</hi> and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse (which are contrary to a free spirit) so they may have a <hi>wearinesse</hi> and some kinde of <hi>unwillingnesse</hi> in Gods service. Their spirits like the hands of <hi>Moses</hi> in the mount may faint and hang downe, may bee damp'd
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:16264:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with carnall affections, or tired with the difficulty of the worke, or pluck'd back by the importunitie of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, so that though they beginne in the spirit, yet they may be bewitched and transported from a through-obedience to the truth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1, 3. A deadnesse, heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, insensibilitie, unactivenesse, confusednesse of heart, unpreparednesse of affections, insinuation of worldly lusts and earthly cares may distract the hearts, and abate the cheerefulnesse of the best of us. And hence come those frequent exhortations to stirre up our selves, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our hearts to seeke the Lord, to whet the Law upon our children, to exhort one another lest the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinne harden us, to bee strong in the Grace of Christ, not to faint or be weary of well-doing, and the like. All which, and sundry like, intimate a sluggishnesse of disposition, and naturall bearing backe of the will from Gods service.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Proportion</hi> of this discomfort and <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse</hi> ariseth from these grounds: First, from the <hi>strength of these corruptions</hi> which remaine within us: for ever so much fleshlinesse as the heart retaines, so much bias a man hath to turne him from God and his wayes, so much clog and encumbrance in holy duties. And this remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of flesh is in the will as wel as in any other facultie to indispose it unto spirituall actions, as it is in our <hi>members</hi> that we <hi>cannot doe</hi> the things which wee would, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. so in proportion it is in <hi>our wills,</hi> that wee cannot with all our strength <hi>desire</hi> the things which wee should, and therefore <hi>David</hi> praiseth God for this especiall Grace, Who am I, and what is my people that we should be able <hi>to offer so willingly after this sort?</hi> for all things come of thee, and of thine owne have we given thee, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the dulnesse or sleepinesse of Grace in the heart, which without daily reviving, husbanding, and handling will bee apt to contract a rust, and to bee
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:16264:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
over-growne with that bitter roote of corruption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. As a bowle will not move without many rubs and stops in a place overgrowne with grasse, so the will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move with readinesse towards God, when the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which should actuate it are growne dull and heavie. A rustie key will not easily open the locke unto which it was first fitted; nor a neglected Grace easily open or enlarge the heart.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the violent importunity and <hi>immodesty of some strong temptation,</hi> and unexpellible suggestions, which frequently presenting themselves to the spirit doe there beget jealousies to disquiet the peace of the heart: for Satans first end is to <hi>rob us of grace,</hi> for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he hearteneth our lusts against us: but his second is <hi>to rob us of Comfort,</hi> and to tosse us up and downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene our owne feares and suspicions: for unwearied and violent contradictions are apt to beget wearinesse in the best. Consider him that endured such contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinners against himselfe, saith the Apostle, <hi>lest ye be wearied and faint in your mindes, Heb.</hi> 12.3.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, from the <hi>present weight of some heavie fresh sinne,</hi> which will utterly indispose the heart unto any good. As we see how long securitie did surprize <hi>David</hi> after his murther and adulterie. Thus as <hi>Ionah</hi> after his flight from God, fell asleepe in the ship: so stupiditie and unaptnesse to worke is ever the child of any notable and revolting sinne: When the conscience lieth bleeding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any fresh sinne it hath first a hard taske to goe through in a more bitter renewing the teares of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And hard works have for the most part some feares and reluctancies in the performing of them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it hath not such boldnesse and assurance to bee welcome to God. It comes with shame, horror, blushing and want of peace, and so cannot but finde the greater conflict in it selfe. Thirdly, sinne diswonts a man from God, carries him to thickets and bushes. The soule loves
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:16264:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not to be deprehended by God in the company of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan or any sinfull lust. That childe cannot but feele some strugglings of shame and unwillingnesse to come unto his father, who is sure when he comes to be upbraided with the companions which he more delights in.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, from the <hi>proportions of the desertions of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> for the Spirit of God bloweth where and how he listeth; and it is hee that worketh our wils unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If he be grieved and made retire, (for he is of a delicate and jealous disposition) if hee turne his wind from our sailes, alas, how slow and sluggish will our motion be? How poore our progresse? Vpon these and severall other the like grounds, may the best of us bee possessed with feares, discomforts, and unwillingnesse in Gods service. But yet</p>
            <p>Fifthly, none of all this takes off the <hi>will a Toto,</hi> though it doe a <hi>Tanto,</hi> but that the faithfull in their greatest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinesse and unfitnesse of spirit, have yet a stronger by as towards God than any wicked man when he is at best, for it is true of them in their lowest condition, that they <hi>Desire</hi> to feare Gods name, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.11. That the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> of their soule is towards the remembrance of him, <hi>Esay</hi> 26.8. that they are seriously displeased with the distempers and uncomfortablenesse of their spirit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42.5. that they long to be enlarged, that they may run the way of Gods Commandements, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.32. That they <hi>set their affection</hi> unto God and his service, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.3. That they <hi>prepare their heart</hi> to seeke the Lord God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.19. That they <hi>strive, grone, wrestle,</hi> and are unquiet in their dumpes and dulnesse, earnestly contending for joy and freedome of Spirit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.8.11.12. In one word, that they dare not omit those duties, which yet they have no readinesse and disposednesse of heart to performe; but when they cannot doe them in <hi>alacrity,</hi> yet they doe them in <hi>obedience,</hi> and serve the Lord when he hideth his face from them. <hi>I said, I am
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:16264:178"/>
cast out of thy sight, yet I will looke againe towards thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Temple, Ionah</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that feareth the Lord will obey his voice, though he walke in darknesse,</hi> and have no light, <hi>Esay</hi> 50.10. So then the faithfull have still thus much ground of comfort, that God hath their wils alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted and resign'd unto him, though thus much likewise they have to humble them too, the daily experience of a back-sliding and tired spirit in his service; and should therefore be exhorted to stirre up the spirit of grace in themselves, to keepe fresh and frequent their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ. The more acquaintance and experience the heart hath of him, the more abundantly it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him, and make haste unto him, that it may with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> apprehend him in fruition, by whom it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready apprehended, and carried up unto heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in assurance and representation. As long as wee are here there will be something lacking to our faith, some mixture of unbeleefe and distrust with it, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Marke</hi> 9.24. corruptions, temptations, afflictions, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, will be apt to beget some feares, discomforts, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and indisposednesse towards Gods service. The sense whereof should make us long after our home, with the Apostle grone, and wait for the adoption, even the redemption of our bodies, for the manifestation of the sons of God, (for though we are now sonnes, yet it doth not appeare what we shall be, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2.) should make us pray for the accomplishment of his promises, for the hastening of his Kingdome, where we shall be changed into an universall spiritualnesse, or purity of nature, where those relickes of corruption, those strugglings of the law of the members against the law of the minde shall be ended, those languishings, decayes, ebbes and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes of grace shall be removed, where all deficiencies of grace shall be made up, and that measure and first fruits of the Spirit which we here receive, shall be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with fulnesse, and everlasting perfection. Here we
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:16264:178"/>
are like the stones and other materials of <hi>Salomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but in the act of fitting and preparation, no marvell if we be here crooked, knottie, uneven, and therefore subject to the hammer, under blowes and buffets. But when we shall be carried to the heavenly building which is above, and there laid in, there shall be nothing but smoothnesse and glory upon us, no noise of hammers, or axes, no dispensation of Word or Sacraments, no appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of censures and severity; but every man shall bee filled with the fulnesse of God, Faith turned into sight, Hope turned into fruition, and Love everlastingly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished with the presence of God, with the face of Iesus Christ, with the fulnesse of the holy Spirit, and with the communion and societie of all the Saints. And so much for the first observation out of the third particular, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>willingnesse of Christs people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was further therein observed the <hi>Principle</hi> of this <hi>Willingnesse, [In the day of thy power, or, of thine armies]</hi> that is, when thou shalt send abroad Apostles, and Prophets, and Evangelists, and Doctours and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for evidencing the Word and Spirit unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men. Whence we may secondly observe, that the [<hi>Heart of Christs people is made willing to obey him by an act of Power,</hi>] or by the strength of the Word and Spirit. It is not barely <hi>enticed,</hi> but it is <hi>conquered</hi> by the Gospell of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. And yet this is <hi>not a compulsory conquest</hi> (which is utterly contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a reasonable will, which would cease to be it selfe, if it could be compell'd) but it is an <hi>effectuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</hi> The will (as all other faculties) is dead naturally in trespasses and sins: And a dead man is not raised to life againe by any enticements, nor yet compell'd unto a condition of such exact complacencie and suteablenesse to nature by any act of violence. So then a man is made <hi>willingly subject</hi> unto Christ, neither by <hi>meere morall perswasions,</hi> nor by any <hi>violent impulsions</hi>; but by a
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:16264:179"/>
               <hi>power,</hi> in it selfe <hi>supernaturall, spirituall, or Divine,</hi> and in its manner of working <hi>sweetly tempered to the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the will,</hi> which is never by grace destroyed, but perfected. Therefore the Apostle saith, that it is <hi>God who worketh in us to will and to doe, Phil.</hi> 2.13. first, he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth our will according to his owne (as <hi>David</hi> was said to be a man <hi>after Gods owne heart,</hi>) and secondly, by that will, and the imperate acts thereof, thus sanctified and still assisted by the Spirit of grace, he setteth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther powers of nature on worke in further obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his will. And therefore the Prophet <hi>David</hi> praised God that had enabled him and his people <hi>to offer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi> unto the service of Gods house, and prayeth him that he would ever keepe that willing disposition in the imaginations and thoughts of the hearts of his people, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14.18. Therefore, the Apostle saith, that <hi>Our faith standeth not in the wisdome of men, but in the power of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. Therefore likewise it is called, <hi>The faith of the operation of God who raised Christ from the dead, Col.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p>For the more distinct opening and evidencing this point, how Christs people are made <hi>Willing by his power,</hi> I will onely lay together some briefe positions which I conceive to be thereunto pertinent, and proceed to that which is more plaine and profitable. First, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>nature of the will,</hi> which is, to be a <hi>Free agent or mover,</hi> to have <hi>ex se,</hi> and within it selfe an <hi>indifferencie</hi> and <hi>undeterminatnesse</hi> unto severall things; so that when it moves or not moves, when it moves one way or other, in none of these it suffers violence, but workes according to the condition of its owne nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we may note that this indifferencie is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either habituall, belonging to the constitution of the will, which is nothing else, but an originall aptitude, or intrinsecall non-repugnancie in the will, to move unto contrary extremes, to worke, or to suspend its owne
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:16264:179"/>
working; or else actuall, which is in the exercise of the former, as objects present themselves, and this is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either a freedome to good, or evill, or a freedome to will, or not to will.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, notwithstanding the will be in this manner free, yet it may have its freedome in both regards so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, as that in such or such a condition, it cannot doe what it should, or forbeare what it should, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe what it should not, nor forbeare what it should not. Man fallen, without the grace of God, is free only unto evill, and Christ in the time of his obedience was free wholly unto good. Man free to evill, but yet so, as that he onely doth it voluntarily, he cannot voluntarily leave it undone. Christ free onely to good, yet so, as that he doth it most freely, but could not freely omit the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the will worketh not in this condition of things unto morall objects without some other concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent principles which sway and determine it severall wayes; so that the will is <hi>principium quod,</hi> the facultie which moves, and the other <hi>principium quo,</hi> the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or vertue by which it moves. And these qualities are in naturall men the <hi>flesh</hi> or the originall concupiscence of our nature, which maketh the motions of the will to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the will of the flesh; and in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the <hi>Grace and Spirit of Christ,</hi> so farre forth as they are regenerate.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, as the will is ever carried either by the flesh or the spirit to its objects, so neither to the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without the preceding conduct and direction of the practicall judgement, whether by grace illightned to judge aright, or by corrupt affections bribed and blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to misguide the will; for the will being a rationall appetite, never moveth bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>per modum judicii,</hi> upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of some goodnesse and convenience in the thing whereunto it moves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:16264:180"/>Sixthly, the judgement is never throughly illightned to understand spiritual things in that immediate and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beautie and goodnesse which is in them, but only by the Spirit of Christ, which maketh a man to have the selfe-same minde, judgement, opinion, and apprehension of heavenly things which he had; so that Christ and a Christian doe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>thinke the same thing,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speakes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. By the which Spirit of grace, working first upon the judgement to rectifie that, and to convince it of the evidence and necessitie of that most universall and adequate good which it presenteth, the whole nature is proportionably renewed, and Christ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med aswell in the will and affections, as in the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: as the body in the wombe is not shaped by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale, one part after another, but all together by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable degrees and progresses of perfection: So that at the same time when the Spirit of grace by an act of heavenly illumination is present with the judgement of reason to evidence, not the truth onely, but the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the knowledge of Christ thereunto, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise present by an act of heavenly perswasion, and most intimate allurement unto the will and affections, sweetly accommodating its working unto the exigence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the faculties, that they likewise may with such libertie and complacencie as becomes both their owne nature, and the qualitie of the obedience required, apply themselves to the desire and prosecution of those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things which are with so spirituall an evidence set forth unto them in the ministery of the Word. As by the same soule the eye seeth, and the eare heareth, and the hand worketh: so when Christ by his Spirit is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in us, (for the Spirit of Christ is the <hi>Actus primus,</hi> or soule of a Christian man, that which animateth him unto an heavenly being and working, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.) every power of the soule and body is in some proportionable measure enabled to worke <hi>suo
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:16264:180"/>
modo,</hi> in such manner as is convenient and proper to the quality of its nature, to the right apprehension and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary prosecution of spirituall things. The same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which by the word of grace doth fully convince the judgement, and let the light of the knowledge of the glory of God shine upon the minde; doth by the same word of grace proportionably excite, and assist the will to affect it, that as the understanding is elevated to the spirituall perception, so the will likewise is enabled to the spirituall love of heavenly things.</p>
            <p>By all which wee may observe that this working of the Spirit of grace, whereby we become voluntaries in Christs service, and whereby he worketh in us both to will and to doe those things which of ourselves we were not obedient unto, neither indeed could be, is both a sweet and powerfull worke, as in the raising of a man from the dead (to which in the Scriptures the renewing of a sinner is frequently compared) there is a worke of great power, which yet, being admirably sutable to the integrity of the creature, must needs bring an exact com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencie and delight with it: we may frequently in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures observe, that of the same effect severall things may be affirmed by reason of its connexion unto severall causes, and of the severall causalities or manners of concurrence with which those severall causes have contributed any influence unto it. As the obedience of Christ was of all other the most free and voluntary ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Father, if we consider it with respect unto his most holy, and therefore most undistracted, and unhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered will: (for if it were not voluntary, it were no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) and yet notwithstanding it was most certaine and infallible, if we consider it with respect to the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie of his nature, to the unmeasurablenesse of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to the plenitude of his unseducible and unerring Spirit, to the mystery of his hypostaticall union, and the communication of properties between his natures, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:16264:181"/>
what-ever action was done by him, might justly be called the action of God, in which regard it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for him to sinne. In like manner, the passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ was most free and voluntary, as it respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his owne will, for he troubled himselfe, hee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and emptied himselfe, he laid downe his owne life, he became obedient unto death, even the death of the Crosse; and yet, thus it was written, and thus it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or was necessary for Christ to suffer, if we respect the predeterminate counsell and purpose of God, who had so ordained, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.28. God would not suffer a bone of Christs to be broken, and yet he did not disable the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from doing it, for they had still as much strength and libertie to have broken his, as the others who were crucified with him, but that which in regard of the truth and prediction of holy Scriptures was most certainly to be fulfilled, in regard of the second causes by whom it was fulfilled, was most free and voluntary. Wee finde what a chaine of meere casualties and contingencies (if we looke onely upon second causes) did concurre, in the offence of <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In like maner, when the hearts of men do voluntarily dedicate
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:16264:181"/>
and submit themselves to the kingdome of Christ, if we look upon it with relation unto the Spirit of grace, which is the <hi>principium quo,</hi> the formall vertue whereby it is wrought; so it is an effect of power, and as it were, an act of conquest; and yet looke upon it with relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart it selfe, which is <hi>Principium quod,</hi> the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall efficient cause thereof, and so it is a most free, sweet, connaturall action, exactly temper'd to the exigencie of the second cause, and proceeding there-from with most exact delight, answerably to the measure of the grace of illumination, or spirituall evidence in the minde, whereby our naturall blindnesse, prejudices, and misperswasions may be remov'd: and to the measure of the grace of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, assistance, and co-operation in the heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the naturall frowardnesse and reluctancy thereof may be subdued.</p>
            <p>In one word, there are but three things requisite to make up a free and voluntary action. First, it must be <hi>cum judicio rationis,</hi> with a preceding judgment. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it must be <hi>cum indifferentia,</hi> there must be an internall indeterminatenesse and equall disposition of it selfe unto severall extremes. Thirdly, it must be <hi>cum dominio actus,</hi> the will must have the power of her owne worke. And all these three doe sweetly consist with the point of the Text, That the heart is made willing to obey Christ by an act of power.</p>
            <p>For first, this power we speake of is onely the power of the Word and Spirit, both which doe alwayes worke in the ordinary course of Gods proceeding by them with men, <hi>secundum judicium,</hi> by a way of judgement and conviction, by a way of teaching and demonstration, which is suteable to a rationall facultie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, which way soever the will is by the Spirit of grace directed and perswaded to move, it still retaines an habituall or internall habitude unto the extremes, so that if it should have moved towards them, that motion
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:16264:182"/>
would have beene as naturall and suteable to its condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as this which it followeth; for the determination of the act is no extinguishment of the libertie thereunto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when the Spirit by the power of the word of grace doth work the will in us, yet still the will hath the dominion of its owne act, that is, it is not servilely, or compulsorily thereunto overswayed, but worket<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, <hi>ex motu proprio,</hi> by a selfe-motion, unto which it is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and actuated by the sweetnesse of divine grace, as the seed of that action, according to that excellent knowne speech of Saint <hi>Augustine, Certum est nos vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le cum volumus, sed Deus facit ut velimus.</hi> Thus we see how the subjection of Christs people unto his kingdome is a voluntary act in regard of mans will, and an act of power in regard of Gods Spirit, inwardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ground of this point why there is an act of power required to conquer the wils of sinners unto Christ, is that notable enmitie, stoutnesse, reluctancie, rebellion, wearinesse, aversenesse; in one word, fleshlinesse which possesseth the wils of men by nature: such forwardnesse unto evill, so much frowardnesse against good, such a spring and byas from private ends, and worldly objects, such feares without, such fightings within, such allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the right hand, such frownes and affrightments on the left; such depths of Satan, such hellish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable plots of principalities and powers, to keepe fast and faithfull to themselves this chiefe mistris of the soule of man; such slie and soaking, such furious and firy temptations, to flatter or to fright it away from Christ; such strong prejudices, such deepe reasonings, such high im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

deceitfulnesse of heart, such misperswasions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptious of our present peace, or at least of the easinesse of our future reformation, such strong surmises of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hopes which will be prevented, or worldly dangers incurred, or private ends disappointed; such lusts to be denied, such members to be hewed off, such friends to be forsaken, such passions to be subdued, such certaine persecutions from the world, such endlesse solicitations of Satan, such irreconcilable contentions with the flesh; in the midst of all these pull-backes, how can we thinke the will should escape and breake thorow, if God did not send his Spirit, as once the Angell unto <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19.16. to lay hands upon it while it lingers and hankers after its wonted course, to use a mercifull conquest over it, and, as the Scriptures expresse it, <note n="*" place="margin">Rom, 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.

Certainly, there is so much extreme perversenesse, so much hellishnesse, and devillish antipathy to God and his service in the heart by nature, that if it were left to its owne stubbornenesse to kicke, and rebell, and fall backe and harden it selfe, and were not set upon by the grace of Christ, no man living would turne unto him, or make use of his bloud; by the same reason that any one man perisheth, every man would too, because in all there is as fundamentall and originall enmity to the wayes of grace, as there is in any.</p>
            <p>The consideration whereof may justly humble us in our reflexion upon our selves, whom neither the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of heaven can allure, nor the bloud and passions of Christ perswade, nor the flames of hell affright from our sinnes, till the Lord by the sweet and gracious power of his holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

relate unto the conscience the woefull and everlasting horrors of hell, if a mans naturall capacity were made as wide to apprehend the wrath, fury, and vengeance of a provoked God, the foulenesse, guilt, and venome of a soule fuller of sins than the heavens of stars, as the most intelligent divels of hell doe conceive them. If an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angell or <hi>Seraphim</hi> should be sent from heaven to reveale unto the soule of a naturall man the infinite glory of Gods presence, the full pleasures of his right hand, the admirable beauty of his wayes, the intimate conformity and resemblance between his divine nature in himselfe, &amp; the Image of his holinesse in the creature, the unsearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and bottomlesse love of Christ in his Incarnation and sufferings, the endlesse incomprehensible vertue &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse of his bloud and prayers; yet so desperately evill is the heart of man, that if after all this God should not afford the blessed operation and concurrence of his owne gratious Spirit, the revelation of his own arme and power upon the soule, to set on those instrumentall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, it would be invincible by any evidence, which all the cries and flames of hell, which all the armies and hosts of heaven were able to beget.

To him therefore we should willingly acknowledge all our conversion and salvation; So extremely impotent are we, O Lord, unto any good, so utterly unprofitable, and unmeet for our Masters use, and yet so strongly hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the impulsion of our owne lust towards hell, that no <hi>precipice,</hi> nor danger, no hope nor reward, no man or Angell is able to stop us, without thine owne immediate power, and therefore <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name</hi> onely be attributed the glory of our conversion.</p>
            <p>Againe, by this consideration we should be provoked to stirre up and call together all our strength in the Lords service, to recover our mispent time, to use the more contention and violence for the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when wee consider how abundant wee have beene in the workes of sinne, in the pursuing of vast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires which had neither end nor hope in them. O how
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:16264:184"/>
happie a thing would it be, if men could serve God with the same proportion of vigour and willingnesse of mind, as they served Satan and themselves before? I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tired in that way, I went on indefatigably towards hell, like a swift Dromedary, or an untamed heifer, I pursued those evill desires which had vanity for their object, and misery for their end, no fruit but shame, and no wages but death. But in the service of Christ I have a price before mee, an abiding Citie, an enduring sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, an immarcescible crowne to fix the highest of my thoughts upon: I have the promises of Christ to strengthen me, his Angels to guard, his Spirit to lead, his Word to illighten me. In one word, I have a soule to save, and a God to honour. And why should not I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my power, to serve him, who did reach forth his owne power to convert me? A long way I have to goe, and I must doe it in a spanne of time; so many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to overcome, so many corruptions to shake off, so many promises to beleeve, so many precepts to obey, so many mysteries to study, so many workes to finish, and so little time for all: my weaknesses on one side, my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses on another, mine enemies and my sinnes round about me take away so much, that I have scarce any left to give to God. And yet, alas, if I could serve God on earth, as he is served in heaven, if I had the strength of Angels, and glorified Saints, to doe his will, it would come infinitely short of that good will of God in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, or of his power in my conversion. If God should have said to all the Angels in heaven, there is such a poore wretch posting with full strength towards hell, goe stand in his way and drive him back againe, all those glorious armies would have beene too few to blocke up the passage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If then the Lord did put to his owne power to save me, great reason there is that I should set my weake and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent faculties to honour him, especially since hee hath beene pleased both to mingle with his service great joy, liberty, and tranquillity here, and also to set before it a full, a sure, and a great reward, for my further animati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and encouragement thereunto.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing observed in this Verse was the attire wherein Christs people should attend upon his service, <hi>In the Beauties of Holinesse</hi>] These words referre to those before, and that either to the word [<hi>People</hi>] or to the word [<hi>willing.</hi>] If to [<hi>People</hi>] then they are a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of Christs Subjects or Souldiers, they shall be all like servants in Princes Courts, beautifully arraied, like the Priests of the Law that had garments of beauty and glory, and so <hi>Schindler</hi> expounds it, <hi>In societate sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotum.</hi> If to the word [<hi>willing</hi>] then it notes the ground and inducement of their great devotion and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto Christs kingdome, that as the people came up in troopes to the Lords house, which was the Beauty of his Holinesse, or as men doe flocke together to the sight of some honorable and stately solemnity: so Christs people should by the beauty of his banners be allured to gather unto him, and flye in multitudes as Doves unto their windowes.

               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5.23. Heb. 13.20, 21.</note> saith the Apostle, and <hi>the God of peace make you perfect in every good worke to doe his will.</hi> Therefore the spirit is called a spirit of Holinesse,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> by the power whereof Christ ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the dead was declared to bee the Sonne of God, to note the answerablenesse betweene raising from the dead or giving life where there was none before, and the sanctification of a sinner. Therefore the Apostle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it the renewing of the Holy Ghost, and the forming of Christ in us, the quickning, and creating us to good workes.<note place="margin">Tit. 3.5. Gal. 4.19. Ephes. 2.5, 10.</note> By all which we may note that what Beautie the Creation brought upon that emptie and unshaped Chaos when it was distributed into this orderly frame which we now admire; or what beautie the reunion of a living soule unto a dead and gastly body doth restore unto it; the same beautie doth Holinesse bring unto the soule of a man which was filthy before. But yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we must note that God did not make man as other ordinarie Creatures, for some low and inferior use, (and yet <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, that they were made <hi>all beautifull</hi> in their time) but there was a pause, a consultation, a more than common wisedome, power, and mercie revealed in the workemanship of man: for God made man for
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:16264:186"/>
his owne more peculiar delight, company and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, one whom hee would enter into a more intimate league and covenant withall.<note place="margin">Psal. 4.3. Esai. 43.21.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord hath set apart the man that is godly for himselfe. This people have I formed for my selfe, they shall shew forth my praise,</hi> I will magnifie the beautie of my glorious vertues in those whom I have sanctified for my selfe. Thus wee finde what perfect comelinesse the Lord bestowed upon his people, when he entred into Covenant with them, and made them his <hi>owne,</hi> one which was alwayes to leane on his bosome, and to stand in his owne presence, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8, 14. The Church is the Lords <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15.</note> 
               <hi>owne House,</hi> a <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 6.16.</note> 
               <hi>Temple</hi> in the which hee will dwell and walke; it is his <note n="c" place="margin">Ier. 3.17.</note> 
               <hi>Throne,</hi> in which he sitteth as our Prince and Law-giver. And in this regard it must needs bee extraordinarie beautifull; for <hi>the</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Esai. 60.13.</note> 
               <hi>Lord will beautifie the place of his Sanctuary,</hi> and will make the place of his feet glorious. Now then, if by Holinesse we are made <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>Gods building,</hi> and that not as the rest of the world is for his Creatures to inhabite, but as a Temple for himselfe to dwell in, as a <note n="f" place="margin">Cant. 7.5.</note> 
               <hi>gallerie</hi> for himselfe to walke and refresh himselfe in, certainely Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse which is the Ornament and ingraving of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must needs be a glorious thing, for there is much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and wisedome in all Gods workes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if we consider the <hi>Nature</hi> of Holinesse, it must needs be very <hi>Beautifull.</hi> In generall, it consists in a <hi>Relation of conformitie,</hi> as all Goodnesse, save that of God doth: for no Creature is so absolute as to have its being from it selfe, and therefore its Goodnesse cannot consist in any thing which hath its originall in it selfe. It is the Rule and End which denominateth the Goodnesse of any created thing, that therefore which ought not to worke for its owne end, ought not to worke by its owne Rule, for he who is Lord of an end, must needs be Lord of the meanes and directions which lead unto that end. And this is indeed the ground of all sinne, when men
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:16264:186"/>
make themselves their owne will, wit, reason, or resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to bee the spring and fountaine of all their actions. Therefore sinne is called our <hi>owne wayes,</hi> and the lusts of our owne hearts and our owne counsels, because it is absolutely from our selves, and hath no constituted rule to moderate or direct it. Impossible it is for any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it comes out of Gods hands, to bee without a Law, or to be an originall law unto it selfe: for as hee who hath none over him cannot possibly be subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Law, in as much as a Law is but the declaration of a Superiours will what he requires to bee done, and what he threatneth on default thereof to inflict: so hee that is under the wisedome and ends of another, must needs likewise bee subject to the Lawes which his will prescribes for advancing and compassing his owne ends, who if he bee in his owne nature and ends most holy, must needs be holy in the Lawes which he enacts. By all which we may observe that Holinesse consisteth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, so that according to the excellencie of the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne whereunto it referres, so is the measure of its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be conjectured. And the patterne of our Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is God himselfe, <hi>Be you holy, as your father which is in heaven is Holy</hi>; Other Creatures have some prints and paths of God in them, and so are all beautifull in their time: but man had the image of God created in him, his will was set up in our heart as a Law of nature, most pure, right, holy, good, wise and perfect, and that Law did beare the same relation to mans life, as his soule doth unto his members, to animate, forme, and organize every motion of the heart, every word of the mouth, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action of the soule and bodie according unto the will of God. When after this man threw away this Image, and God was pleased in mercy again to renue Holinesse in him, he did it againe by another patterne, or rather the same exhibited in another maner. He made him then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Image of his Son, the heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.29. 1 Cor. 15 49.</note>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:16264:187"/>
who is himselfe the Image of the invisible God, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Character of his Fathers brightnesse, a Sunne of righteousnesse, a morning starre, the light of the world, the fairest of ten thousand: so that compare Holinesse with the first originall draught thereof in Paradise, the nature of <hi>Adam</hi> as it came new out of Gods fashioning, or that with the Law of God written in his heart, or that with the Holinesse of God, of which it was a ray shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the soule, or that Image of God with it selfe in Christ the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and every way Holinesse in its nature consists in a Conformity and Commensuration to the most beautifull things.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if we consider some of the chiefe <hi>Properties</hi> of Holinesse, wee shall finde it in that regard likewise very Beautifull. First, <hi>Rectitude</hi> and <hi>Vprightnesse,</hi> since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and simplicitie of heart, <hi>God made man upright, but they have found out</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. 7.29. Ier. 31.22. Esai. 57.10.</note> 
               <hi>many inventions,</hi> that is, have sought up and downe through many turnings and by-wayes to satisfie crooked affections. It was <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 5.8.</note> 
               <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer, <hi>Make thy way strait before my face,</hi> and it is the Apostles instruction, <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 12.13.</note> 
               <hi>Make strait paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way.</hi> True Holinesse is a plaine, and an even thing, without falsehood, guile, perversenesse of Spirit, deceitfulnesse of heart, or star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aside. It hath one end, one rule, one way, one heart, whereas hypocrites are in the Scripture called <note n="d" place="margin">Iam. 1.8.</note> 
               <hi>Double minded men,</hi> because they pretend to God, and follow the world. And <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 32.5.</note> 
               <hi>crooked men,</hi> like the <note n="f" place="margin">Esai. 30.12, 13.</note> swelling of a wall, whose parts are not perpendicular, nor levell to their foundation. Now rectitude, sincerity, and single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart is ever both in the eyes of God and man a beautifull thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Harmonie</hi> and <hi>Vniformity</hi> within it selfe. The Philosopher saith of a <hi>Iust man</hi> that he is like a <hi>Dye,</hi> which is every way even and like it selfe, turne it how you will, it fals upon an equall bottome. And so Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:16264:187"/>
keepes the heart like its selfe in all conditions; as a watch though all together it may bee tossed up and downe with the agitation of him that carrieth it about him; yet that motion doth no way perturbe the frame, or disorder the workings of the spring and wheeles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: so though the man may bee many wayes tempted, and disquieted, yet the frame of his heart, the order of his affections, the governement of the spirit within him is not thereby stopped, but holdeth on in the same te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. We know in the body if any part doe exceed the due proportion, it destroies the beautie and acceptable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the rest. Symmetrie and fitnesse of the parts unto one another is that which commends a body. Now Holinesse consisteth in this proportion, there is in it an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> an <hi>exactnesse</hi> of obedience, an equall respect unto all Gods Commandements, an hatred of every false way, an universall worke upon the whole spirit, soule, and body, a supply made unto every joynt, a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure dispenced unto every part, not a grace due unto Christian integritie which is not in some proportion fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned in a man. Christ hath no <hi>Monsters</hi> begotten by his spirituall seed: for Monsters are ever caused either by an excesse, or by a defect of seed; in the one case nature being overcharged is forc'd to labour that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, and will not be laid aside, into some superfluous members; and in the other for want of materials to leave her worke unfinished, and destitute of some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary parts. But now first wee are to note that a man can have no superfluitie of Grace, we can never have too much of that, the fulnesse whereof we should labour to get, and for the other danger, wee know Christ hath a Residue of spirit to supply any defect, and to make up whatsoever is away for the fashioning of Christ in us: so then Holinesse fashioneth the whole man. Hee that leaves any one faculty of his soule neglected, or any one part of the Service or Law of God disobeyed (I
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:16264:188"/>
speake of a totall, and constant neglect) is undoubtedly an Hypocrite and disobeyes all, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.10, 11. As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> with a little stone slew <hi>Goliah</hi> because his forehead was open; so can our enemie easily deale with us if he observe any faculty naked and neglected. The actuall and totall breach of any one Commandement, (<hi>Totall,</hi> I meane, when the whole heart doth it, though haply it execute not all the obliquitie which the compasse of the sinne admits) is an implicite, habituall, interpretative, and conditionall breach of all; His soule stands alike dis-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the holinesse of every Commandement, and hee would undoubtedly adventure on the breach of this, if such exigences and conditions as misguided him in the other should thereunto as strongly induce him. He that hath done <hi>any one</hi> of these abominations, hath done <hi>all these abominations</hi> in Gods account. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.10, 13. There being then in a Christian man a suteable life and vigour of holinesse in every part, and a mutuall conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them all in the same wayes and ends, there must needs likewise be therein an excellent beauty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>growth</hi> and further <hi>Progresse in these Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> for it is not onely uprightnesse and Symmetrie of parts, which causeth perfect beauty and comelinesse, but stature likewise. Now Holinesse is a thriving and growing thing. The Spirit is seede, and the Word is raine, and the Father is an Husbandman, and therefore the life of Christ is an <hi>abounding life, Ioh.</hi> 10.10. The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Spirit of Grace spring up unto Eternity, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.36. As Christ hath no Monsters, so neither hath hee any <hi>Dwarfes</hi> in his mysticall body; but all his grow up unto the pitch of perfection which it becommeth them to have in him, even <hi>unto the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ, Ephes.</hi> 4.12, 13. The meaning of the Apostle is that Christ is not alwayes an infant in us as when he is first formed, but that he doth <hi>Grandescere in Sanctis,</hi> as <hi>Musculus</hi> well expresseth it, that he groweth
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:16264:188"/>
up still unto the stature of a man: for wheresoever there is faith and holinesse there is ever ingenerated an appetite for augmentation; Faith is of a growing and Charitie of an <hi>abounding Nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.3. By the Word of truth, as by incorruptible seed wee were begotten,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.18, 21. 1 Pet. 1.23. 2.2. Luk. 17 5. Psal. 68.28.</note> and by the same Word as by the sap and milke are we nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, and grow up thereby. This affection holinesse ever workes, as it did in the Disciples, <hi>Lord, increase our faith,</hi> and in <hi>David, Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, besides the Rectitude, Harmonie, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie which is in Holinesse, there is another propertie, which maketh the Beautie thereof surpasse all other Beautie, and that is <hi>Indeficiencie.</hi> The measure of Christ must be the Rule of our growth, but Christ never was overtaken by old age or times of declining, He never saw corruption: so wee must proceede from strength to strength, like the Sunne to the perfect day, but there is no sinking or setting of Holinesse in the heart. They that are planted in Gods House doe still bring forth fruit in their <hi>Old age,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 92.14.</note> and are even then fat and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing. As our outward man decaieth, so our inward man groweth day by day. Our Holinesse is a branch of the life of Christ in us, which doth never of it selfe runne into death, and therefore is not <hi>apta nata</hi> of it selfe to decay: for that is nothing but an earnest, inchoation, and assurance of death. <hi>That which waxeth old,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is ready to vanish away, Heb.</hi> 8.13.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly, if we consider the <hi>Operations</hi> of Holinesse, that likewise will evidence the Beautie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for it hath none but gratious and honourable effects. It filleth the Soule with Joy, Comfort, and Peace. All Joy, unspeakeable, and glorious joy, peace, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, assurance, songs, and everlasting joy.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.13. 1 Pet. 1.8. Esai. 32.17. Esai. 35.5, 10.</note> It maketh the blinde see, the deafe heare, the lame leape, the dumbe sing, the wildernesse and parched ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:16264:189"/>
springs of water. It entertaineth the soule with feasts of fatted things,<note place="margin">Esay 25.6. Cant. 2.4, 5. Psal. 45.15. Cant. 1.4. Cant. 7 5. Iohn 14.21-23. Hebr. 12.14. Psal. 45.11. Cant 4.9.</note> and of refined wines, and carrieth it into the banquetting-house unto apples and flagons. It giveth the soule a deare communion with God in Christ, a sight of him, an accesse unto him, a boldnesse in his presence, an admission into most holy delights, and intimate conferences with him in his bed-chamber, and in his galleries of love. In one word, it gathers the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of men, it secures the protection of Angels, and which is argument of more beautie than all the creatures in the world have besides, it attracteth the eye and heart, the longings and ravishments, the tender compassions and everlasting delights of the Lord Iesus.</p>
            <p>I have insisted on those properties of holinesse, which denote <hi>inward beautie,</hi> because all the graces of the Spirit doe beautifie inherently. But the word proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifying <hi>Decus</hi> or <hi>Ornatum,</hi> outward adorning by a metaphor of rich apparell, expressing the internall excellencie of the soule, notes unto us two things more.</p>
            <p>First, that the people of Christ are not only sanctified within, but have interest in that unspotted holinesse of Christ, wherewith they are clothed as with an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So the Priests <note n="a" place="margin">Psal 132 9.</note> of God are said to be <hi>clothed with righteousnesse,</hi> and we are said to <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 3.27.</note> 
               <hi>put on Christ:</hi> And the righteousnesse of Christ is frequently compared to <note n="c" place="margin">Revel. 3.18.4.4.6.11.7.9.</note> 
               <hi>long white robes,</hi> fit to <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 32.1.</note> cover our sins, to hide our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and to protect our persons from the wrath of God: so that to the eye of his justice we appeare, as it were parts of Christ; as when <hi>Iacob</hi> wore <hi>Esau's</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was as <hi>Esau</hi> to his father, and in that relation obtained the blessing. God carrieth himselfe towards us in Christ, as if we our selves had fulfilled <hi>all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> as if there were no ground of contestation with us, or exception against us. And this is indeed the <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of holinesse:</hi> The modell, prototype, and originall of <hi>all beautie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:16264:189"/>Secondly, from the metaphoricall allusion (as it is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally understood) it notes unto us likewise, that all the people of Christ are <hi>Priests unto God,</hi> to <note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.5. Esay 56.7. Revel 1.6.</note> offer up sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices acceptable unto him by Iesus Christ. They have all the priviledges, and the duties of Priests. To approach unto God, <note n="f" place="margin">Hebr. 10.19.</note> wee have libertie <hi>to enter into the holiest</hi> by the bloud of Iesus; to consult and have communion with him, to be his <hi>Remembrancer</hi>; for as his Spirit is his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer unto us, <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 14.26.</note> hee shall bring <hi>all things to your remembrance,</hi> whatsoever I have said unto you; so is he <note n="h" place="margin">Esay 43.25. Esay 62.6, 7.</note> our Remembrancer unto God, to put him in minde of his mercy and promises, to make mention of him, and to give him no rest. To know, and propagate his truth; this <note n="i" place="margin">Mal. 2.7.</note> was the office of the Priest, to be the keeper of the knowledge, and to teach it unto others: and this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Gospell doth <note n="k" place="margin">Esay 11.9.</note> overflow the earth, and make every <note n="l" place="margin">Col 3.16. Hebr. 3.13. Iude vers. 20.</note> man, in a spirituall sense, a Priest, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer, and edifier of his brother. To offer to him such sacrifices as hee now delighteth in: the <note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 107 22.</note> sacrifices of thanksgiving, the <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 51 17.</note> sacrifices of a broken and contrite spirit, the <note n="o" place="margin">Heb 13.15, 16. Phil. 4.18.</note> sacrifices of praise, confession, good works, and mutuall communicating unto one another: in one word, the <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 12.1. Rom. 15.16. Esay 66.20. Iames 1.18.</note> sacrificing of a mans whole selfe, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated as a kinde of first fruit unto God, being sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Holy Ghost. There is no man actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto the Kingdome of Christ, who hath not all these holy affections wrought in him, and maketh conscience of them, as of his calling, and the duties of his life.</p>
            <p>Wee see then that <hi>Holinesse</hi> is the badge of Christs subjects; they are called <note n="q" place="margin">Esay 63.18.</note> 
               <hi>The people of his Holinesse:</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ier. 2.3. Iames 1.18.</note> Israel was <hi>holinesse unto the Lord,</hi> and the <hi>first fruits</hi> of his increase consecrated unto him and his service as a kinde of first fruits. The livery of Christs servants is a parcell of the same holy Spirit with which his owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature was clothed. <note n="s" place="margin">Exod. 40.9.</note> All the vessels and ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:16264:190"/>
instruments of the Tabernacle were anointed with the holy oyle; and the <note n="t" place="margin">Psal. 93.5.</note> house of the Lord was an house of holinesse, to signifie that every Christian should bee by the Spirit of God sanctified, because he is <note n="u" place="margin">2 Cor. 6.16.</note> a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and every member, because it is <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 6.13.</note> a vessell and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument for the Masters use. <hi>The Spirit of holinesse</hi> is that which <hi>distinguisheth,</hi> and as it were, <hi>marketh</hi> the sheepe of Christ from the wicked of the world: yee are <note n="y" place="margin">Ephes. 1.13.</note> 
               <hi>sealed</hi> with the <hi>Holy Spirit of promise:</hi>

               <hi>setteth us apart</hi> for Gods <hi>service,</hi> for his <note n="b" place="margin">Hebr. 12.14.</note> 
               <hi>presence</hi> and fruition; <note n="c" place="margin">Ezek. 9.4.</note> protecteth and priviledgeth us from the <hi>wrath</hi> to come, in the day when he shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate betweene the pretious and the vile, and make up his jewels: without this no man can either serve, or see, or escape God, either doe his will, enjoy his favour, or decline his fury.

               <hi>Dung,</hi> and who would thanke that man for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who with wonderfull officiousnesse should bring nothing but heapes of dung into his house? If a man could powre out of his veines rivers of bloud, and offer up every day as many prayers as thoughts unto God, if his eyes were melted into teares, and his knees hardned into horne with devotion; yet all this, if it be not the fruit of holinesse, but of will-worship, or superstition, or opinion of merit and righteousnesse, it is but as dung in Gods sight. <hi>Wherefore lyest thou upon thy face, there is an accursed thing in the campe?</hi> What-ever sinne thy conscience tels thee lyeth next thy heart, and warmes it, so that thou art unwilling to part from it, take heed of bringing it into Gods presence, or provoking him with thy services, for he will throw them backe like dung into thy face. <hi>What hath my beloved to doe in mine house, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shee hath wrought lewdnesse with many?<note place="margin">Ier. 11.15.

Till a man put away the evill of his doings, and cleanse himselfe, all his worship of God is but mocking of him, and prophaning his ordinances. In vaine did the Marriners pray while <hi>Ionah</hi> was in the ship; in vaine did <hi>Ioshua</hi> intercede while the accursed thing was in the campe. A man shall lose all which he hath wrought in Gods worship, and have neither thankes nor reward for it, so long as he harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth any uncleane affection in his heart, and will not yeeld to part from it. Any sinne which wasteth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science (as every great and presumptuous sinne doth in whomsoever it is) unqualifieth that person for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven. Grace maketh a beleever <hi>sure</hi> of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but it doth <hi>not</hi> make him wretchlesse or secure in living; though there be not an extinguishment, yet there is a suspension of his right upon any black and notorious fall, that man must not dare to lay claime to heaven, that hath dared in a presumptuous manner to provoke the Lord. Our holinesse is not the <hi>cause</hi> of our salvation, but yet it is the <hi>way</hi> thereunto; he which by any wasting and presumptuous sin putteth himselfe out of that way, must by repentance turne into it againe, before hee can hope to finde out heaven; for <hi>without holinesse no man shall see the Lord.</hi> He that is an hundred miles from his owne house, notwithstanding his proprietie thereunto, shall yet never actually enter therein, till he have travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over the right way which leads unto it. There is an <hi>Order, à primo ad ultimum</hi> in the salvation of men, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intermediate passages betweene their vocation and their glory: Justification, repentance, sanctification, as a scale or ladder betwixt earth and heaven, he that fals from his holinesse and purity of conscience, though hee be not quite downe the ladder, and hath the whole worke to begin againe, as much as ever, yet doubtlesse he shall never get to the top till he recover the step from which he fell.</p>

               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:16264:191"/>And if in this case it be true that the righteous shall scarcely be saved; O then where shall that man appeare whom God at the last shall finde without this garment and seale upon him. When there was a tempest, he who slept, and least thought of it, was throwne into the sea; and when the day of wrath shall come, those that have neglected their estate most, shall doubtlesse be in the greatest danger. And therefore we should labour to goe to Gods throne with our garments and our marke upon us; for all other endowments, our learning, our honours, our parts, our preferments, our earthly hopes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies will none follow us, but wee shall live to see either them or the comforts of them depart. <hi>Achitophel</hi> had wisdome like an oracle of God, but he liv'd to see it bid him quite farewell, for hee died like a very foole or childe, who when he may not have his owne will, will be reveng'd upon himselfe. <hi>Haman</hi> had more honour than the ambition of a subject usually aspires unto, and yet he liv'd to see it bid him farewell, and died the basest death which himselfe could devise for his most hated and despised enemie. <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> a King, liv'd to see his Crowne take its leave, and was buried with the buriall of an Asse, and drag'd like carrion out of the gates of the Citie. There will be nothing at last left for any man to cast his trust upon but God, or Angels, or our fellowes; and if then God be against us, though all which remains were on our side, alas what is an handfull of stubble to a world full of fire? but yet there will not be that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but the combate must be single betweene God and a sinner. The good Angels rejoyce to doe Gods will, and the wicked will rejoyce to doe man any mischiefe; these will be only readie to accuse, and those to gather the wicked together unto the wrath of him that sitteth on the Throne. O what would a man give then for that holinesse which hee now despiseth? what covenants would such a man be content to subscribe unto, if God
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:16264:191"/>
would then shew him mercy when the court of mercy is shut up? wouldst thou returne to the earth, and live there a thousand yeares under contempt and persecution for my service? O yes, not under thy service onely, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rockes and mountaines of the earth, so I may be hid from the face of the Lambe. Wilt thou be content to goe to hell and serve me there a thousand yeeres in the midst of hellish torments, and the reviling of damned creatures? O yes, even in hell infinitely better would it be to be thy servant than thine enemie. Wilt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge every oath with an yeare of prayers, every bribe or corruption with a treasury of almes, every vanity with an age of precisenesse? Yes Lord, the severest of thy commands to escape but the smallest of thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. O let us be wise for our selves, there shall be no such easie conditions then proposed when it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to observe them, and there are now farre easier proposed, when we are invited to observe them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, from hence we learne that none will be <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> to come unto Christ till they see <hi>Beauty</hi> in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which with a carnall eye they cannot doe, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the heart is possessed with much prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, that the way of religion in that exactnesse which the Word requires, is but the phantasme of more subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated speculations, a meere notionall and airy thing, which hath no being at all, but in the wishes of a few men, who fancie unto themselves the shape of a Church, as <hi>Zenophon</hi> did of a Prince, or <hi>Plato</hi> of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And therefore though with their tongues they doe not, yet in their hearts men are apt to lay aside that rigour and exactnesse which the Scripture requires, namely, to pull out our right eyes, to cut off our right hands, to hate father and mother, and wife, and lands, and our owne life; to deny our selves, to crosse our own desires, to mortifie our earthly members, to follow the Lambe through evill report and good report, through

afflictions and persecutions, and manifold temptations whither soever hee goeth, to warre with principalities and powers, and spirituall wickednesses, to acquaint our selves with the whole counsell of God, and the like: and in stead thereof to resolve upon certaine more tolerable maximes of their owne to goe to heaven by, certaine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrities betweene piety and prophanenesse, wherein men hope to hold God fast enough, and yet not to lose either the world, or their sinfull lusts. This is a certaine and confessed truth, that the spirit which is in us by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is contrary to the spirit of purity and power which is in the world: and therefore the universall and willing submission of the heart unto this, must needs finde both many antipathies within, and many discouragements and contempts without.<note place="margin">Esay 8.14.18.</note> Christ was set up for <hi>a signe of contradiction</hi> to be spoken against, and that <hi>in the houses of Israel and of Iuda,</hi> and as it was then, so is it now, even <hi>in Abrahams family,</hi> in the houshold and visible Church of Christ,<note place="margin">Zech. 3.8.</note>

            <p>From whence we may note; First, that Christ in the day of his power, in the morning of his Church, had <hi>multitudes of children</hi> borne unto him.

            <p>Now this was <hi>in die copiarum,</hi> in the time when Christ first sent abroad his armies and the rod of his strength into the world.<note place="margin">Act. 14.16.</note> Before this God suffered men to walke in their owne wayes, yea, in his owne life-time hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade his Disciples to enter into the Cities of the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,<note place="margin">Act. 17.30.</note> or the Gentiles.

Wee never reade of so many converted by Christs personall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching (which was indeed but the beginning of his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, for it is the Lord which speaketh from heaven still) as by the ministery of his Apostles; he thereby provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to magnifie the excellencie of his spirituall presence, against all the carnall superstitions of those men who seeke for an invisible corporall presence of Christ on the earth, charmed downe out of heaven under the lying shapes of separated accidents.

            <p>The Reason hereof is to magnifie the exaltation &amp; spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall presence and power of Christ in the Church; while he was upon the earth he confin'd his ordinary residence and personall preaching unto one people, because his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily presence was narrow, and could not bee communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the whole world.

But his Spirit and power is over the whole Church, by them hee walketh in the middest of the Candlesticks. Christs bodily presence and preaching the Iewes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and crucified the Lord of glory. But now to shew the greatnesse of his power by the Gospell, hee goes himselfe away, and leaves but a few poore and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men behinde him, assisted with the vertue of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by them wrought workes which all the world could not withstand. Hee could have published the Gospell as hee did the Law by the ministery of Angels; hee could have anointed his Apostles with regall oyle, and made them not Preachers only but Princes, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of his faith in the world. But hee rather chose to have them to the end of the world poore and despised men, whom the world (without any shew of just reason which can bee by them alleaged) should overlooke, and account of as low and meane conditioned men, that his Spirit might in their ministerie bee the more glorified. <hi>God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise,</hi>

Now <hi>universality</hi> is common to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian, idolatrous, &amp; malignant Churches. The <hi>Arrian</hi> heresie invaded the world, and by the Imperiall counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance spread it selfe into all Churches.

               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:16264:195"/>
but yet consider it <hi>comparatively</hi> with the other more prevailing &amp; malignant part of the world, &amp; so it is but a <hi>little flock,</hi> as many graines and measures of corne may lie hid under a greater heape of chaffe. Secondly, the Church now is <hi>many, comparatively</hi> with the old church of the Iewes, <hi>more are the Children of the desolate than of the married wife, Esai.</hi> 54.1.

Thirdly, though Christ alwayes have a <hi>numerous offspring,</hi> yet in severall ages there is observable a different purity and conspicuousnesse according to the different administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and breathings of the Spirit upon his garden. In some ages the Doctrine more uncorrupt, the profession and acceptation more universall than in others. In the Apostles times there were <hi>many borne</hi> unto Christ, by reason of the more abundant measure of Spirit which was shed abroad upon them,<note place="margin">

In the times of the Primitive persecutions there were many likewise born, because God would glorifie the foundations of his Church, and the power of his Spirit above the pride of men. In the first countenancing of it by Imperiall Laws and favors, it was very generall and conspicuous, because professed by the obedience, and introduced by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of those great emperors whom the world followed. But after that long peace and great dignities had corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the mindes of the chiefe in the Church, and made them looke more after the pompe than the purity thereof, the mystery of iniquity, like a weed, grew apace, and overspread the Corne, first abusing, and after that subjecting the power of princes, and bewitching the Kings of the earth with its fornications.</p>
            <p>Hence likewise wee may learne to acknowledge
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:16264:195"/>
Gods mercy in the worst times; in those ages wherin the Church was most oppressed, yet many have yeelded themselves unto Christ. <hi>The woman was with Childe, and was delivered even when the Dragon did persecute her, Revel.</hi> 12.1.4.<note place="margin">

               </note> and even then God found out in the wildernesse a place of refuge, defence, and feeding for his Church. As in those cruell times of <hi>Arrianisme</hi> when heresie had invaded the world, and in those blinde and miserable ages wherin Satan was loosed, God still stirred up some notable instruments by whom hee did defend his truth, and amongst whom hee did preserve his Church, though they were driven into solitary places, and forced to avoid the assemblies of Hereticall and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Teachers.</p>
            <p>Wee learne likewise not to censure persons, places or times; God had seven thousand in Israel, when <hi>Elias</hi> thought none but himselfe had been left, all are not alike venturous or confident of their strength. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> came to Christ <hi>by night,</hi> and yet even then Christ did not reject him. Therefore we must not presently censure our neighbours as cold or dead, if they discover not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly the same measure of courage and publike stoutnesse in the profession of Christ with our selves; some men are by nature more retir'd, silent, unsociable, unactive men: some by the engagement of their places, persons, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings wherein they are of more publike and necessary use in the Church, are put upon more abundant caution and circumspection in the moderate carriage of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves than other men. <hi>Paul</hi> was of himselfe very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and earnest in that great confusion, when <hi>Gaius</hi> and <hi>Aristarchus</hi> were haled into the theater, to have gone in unto the people in that their outrage and distemper: but the wisedome of the Disciples, and some of his chiefe friends is herin commended, that they sent unto him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring him that hee would not adventure into the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that they suffered him not, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.30, 31. It is a
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:16264:196"/>
grave observation which <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> makes of that great champian, and universall agent for composing the differences,<note place="margin">

Basil,</hi> that <hi>pro temporis ratione &amp; Haereticorum principatu,</hi> by reason of the prevalencie of adversaries and condition of the times, hee did in the controversies concerning the Deitie of the Holy Ghost abstaine from some words which others of an inferior ranke did with liberty and boldnesse use; and that this hee did in much wisedome, and upon necessary reasons; because it was not fit for so eminent a person, and one who had such generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence by the quality of his place and greatnesse of his parts in the welfare of the Church, by the envie of words or phrases to exasperate a countenanced enemie, and to draw upon himselfe, and in him upon the Church of God, any inevitable and unnecessary danger. And surely if the wisedome and moderation of that holy man were with the same pious affection generally observed, that men, when they doe earnestly contend for the truth once delivered, (which is the duty of every Christian) did not in heate of argument load the truth they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, with such hard and severe, though it may bee true expressions, as beget more obstinacie in the adversarie, and it may bee suspition in the weake or unresolved loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker on, differences amongst men might bee more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly composed, and the truth with more assurance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained.</p>
            <p>Againe, wee have from hence an encouragement to goe on in the wayes of Christ, because wee goe in great and in good Company: many wee have to suffer with us, many wee have to comfort and to encourage us. As the people of Israel when they went solemnely up to meete the Lord in <hi>Sion</hi> went on <hi>from troope to troope,</hi> the further they went,<note place="margin">Psal. 84.7.</note> the more companie they were mixed withall, going to the same purpose: so when the Saints goe towards heaven to meete the Lord there, they doe
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:16264:196"/>
not onely goe unto an <hi>innumerable Company of Angells, and just men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.21, 23. 1 Kings. 19.14.</note> but they meete with <hi>troopes in their way</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to encourage one another. All the discouragement that <hi>Elias</hi> had was, that hee was alone; but we have no such plea for our unwillingnesse to professe the truth and power of Religion now. Wee are not like a lambe in a wide place, without comfort or company; but wee are sure to have an excellent guard and convoy unto Christs Kingdome. And this use the Apostle makes of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of beleevers, that wee should by so great a <hi>Cloud of witnesses,</hi> bee the more encouraged in our patient running of that race which is set before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It should teach us <hi>to love the multitudes,</hi> the assemblies and the <hi>Communion of the Saints,</hi> to speak of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to one another, to encourage &amp; strengthen one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not to forsake the assembling of our selves together as the manner of some is; to concurre in mutuall desires, to conspire in the same holy thoughts and affections; to bee of one heart, of one soule, of one judgement, to walke by one &amp; the same rule, to besiege heaven with armies of united Prayers; to be mutually serviceable to the City of God, and to one another as fellow members. Therefore hath the Lord given unto men <hi>severall gifts,</hi> and to no one man all, that thereby wee might bee enabled to and induced to worke <hi>together</hi> unto one end, and by <hi>Love</hi> to unite our severall graces for the edification of the body of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11, 13.</p>
            <p>Now for the manner of producing or procuring these multitudes, it is set forth unto us in two Metaphors. <hi>A wombe, and Dew of the morning.</hi> Now the birth of Dew is first <hi>generatio caelestis.</hi> That which is exhal'd is an earthly vapor, but the heavenly operation changeth it into <hi>Dew</hi>; no art of man is able to doe it.

            <p>It is not good therefore to have the faith of God in respect of persons; the seed of this spirituall generation cannot otherwise bee given us than in earthen vessels, by men of like passions and infirmities with others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when pure and good seed is here and there sowed, to attribute any thing to persons, is to derogate from God; where gifts are fewer, parts meaner, probabilities lesse, God may and often doth give an increase above hope, as to <hi>Daniels</hi> Pulse, that the excellency of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer may bee of him, and not of man. Though it bee a lame or a leprous hand which soweth the seed, yet the successe is no way altered: good seed depends not in its growth on the hand that sowes it, but on the earth that covers, and on the heavens that cherish it: So the word borroweth not its efficacy from any humane vertue, but from the heart which ponders, and the Spirit which san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:16264:199"/>When then thou comest unto the word, come with affections suteable unto it. All earth will not beare all seed; some wheate, and some but pulse; there is first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a <hi>fitnesse,</hi> before there will bee a <hi>fruitfulnesse.</hi> Christ had many things to teach which his Disciples at the time could not carry away,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.12, 13. Heb. 5.14.</note> because the Comforter was not then sent, who was to lead them into all truth; they who by use have their senses exercised, are fit for strong meate. The truth of the Gospell is an heavenly truth, and therefore it requires a heavenly disposition of heart to prosper it. It is <hi>wisedome to those that are perfect,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.6.</note> though to others foolishnesse and offence. The onely reason why the word of truth doth not thrive is, because the heart is not fitted nor prepared unto it. The seed of it selfe is equall unto all grounds, but it prospers onely in the honest and good heart; the raine in it selfe alike unto all, but of no vertue to the rocks, as to other ground, by reason of their inward hardnesse, and incapacity. The Pharises had covetous hearts, and they mocked Christ; the Philosophers had proud hearts, and they scorned <hi>Paul.</hi> The Iewes had carnall hearts, and they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the Gospell; the people in the wildernesse had unbeleeving hearts, and the word preached did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them. But now a heavenly heart comes with the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a Scholer to bee taught by God; with the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a servant, to bee commanded by God, with the affections of a Sonne, to bee educated by God; with the affections of a sinner, to bee cur'd by God. It consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that it is the <hi>Lord from heaven, who speakes</hi> in the Ministery of the word to him who is but dust and ashes; and therefore hee puts his hand on his mouth, dares not reply against God, nor wrestle with the evidence of his holy Spirit, but falleth upon his face, and giveth glory unto God; beleeves when God promiseth, trembles when God threatneth, obeyes when God commandeth, learnes when God teacheth, bringeth alwayes meeknesse
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:16264:200"/>
and humility of Spirit, ready to open unto the word that it may incorporate.</p>
            <p>Lastly, from hence we must learne to looke unto God in all his ordinances, to expect his arme and Spirit to bee there in revealed, to call on, and depend on him for the blessing of it. If a man could when hee enters into Gods house but powre out his heart in these two things; A <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> and a <hi>Prayer.</hi> Lord, I am now entring into thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.2.

My heart is prepared ô Lord, my heart is prepared, to learne and to love any of thy words. Thy Law is my Counsellor, I will bee ruled by it; it is my Physitian, I will bee patient under it; it is my Schoolemaster, I will bee obedient unto it. But who am I that I should promise any service unto thee? and who is thy Minister that hee should doe any good unto me without thy grace and heavenly call? bee thou therefore pleased to reveale thine owne Spirit unto mee, and to worke in mee that which thou requirest of mee; I say, if a man could come with such sweete preparations of heart unto the word, and could thus open his soule when this spirituall <hi>Manna</hi> fals down from heaven, he should finde the truth of that which the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Ye are not straitned in us,</hi> or in our ministerie, wee come unto you with abundance of grace, but yee are straitned onely in your owne bowels, in the hardnesse, unbeliefe, incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and negligence of your owne hearts, which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that in drops, which falleth downe in showres.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The Lord hath sworne</hi>] Here two things are to bee enquired: First, how God is said to sweare? Secondly, why hee swears in this particular case of Christs Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? The former of these the Apostle resolves in one word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. Hee interposed in or by an oath, namely himselfe, for that is to bee supplied out of the thirteenth verse, where it is said that <hi>bee sware by himselfe.</hi> So elsewhere it is said that <hi>he sware by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Iacob,</hi> that is, by himselfe, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.7.6.8. <hi>By my selfe have I sworne,</hi> saith the Lord, that in blessing I will blesse thee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16. The meaning is, that God should denie himselfe, (which hee cannot doe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13.) and should cease to bee God, if the word which hee hath sworne should not come to passe. So that usuall forme, <hi>as I live,</hi> is to be understood, let me not be esteemed a living
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:16264:202"/>
God, if my word come not to passe; so elsewhere the Lord interposeth his holinesse, <hi>I have sworne by my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse that I will not lie unto David, Psal.</hi> 89.35. As im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him to breake his word as to bee unholy.</p>
            <p>For the second question,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Basil. Mag. in Psal.</hi> 14. <hi>To.</hi> 1.</note> why God swears in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular? I answer: First, and principally, to shew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The immutable and irreversible certainty of what hee speakes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. <hi>I have sworne by my selfe,</hi> the word is gone out of my mouth, <hi>and it shall not returne, &amp;c. Esai.</hi> 45.23. Thus wee finde God confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the unmoveablenesse of his covenant by <hi>an Oath, Esai.</hi> 54.9, 10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.34, 35. When the Lord doth <hi>onely say</hi> a thing (though his word bee as certaine in it selfe as his oath, for it is as impossible for him to lie as to forsweare himselfe) yet there is an implicite kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation for the altering, revoking, or reversing that word by some subsequent declaration. As in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Priesthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> though God made it for a perpetuall ordinance, yet there was after a change of it, for the weaknesse and unprofitablenesse thereof. So when the Lord sent <hi>Ionah</hi> to preach destruction unto <hi>Ninive</hi> within fortie dayes, though the Denuntiation came not to passe, yet was it not any false message, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was made reversible upon an <hi>implicite condition,</hi> which condition the Lord is pleased sometimes in mercy to conceale, that men may bee the sooner frighted out of their security, upon the apprehension of so approching a danger. <hi>At what time, saith the Lord, I shall speake concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdome, to pluck up, and to pull downe, and to destroy: If that Nation against whom I have pronounced turne from their evill, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the evill that I thought to doe unto them, Ier.</hi> 18.7, 8. But when the Lord <hi>sweares</hi> any absolute Act, or promise of his owne (for the Revocation whereof there can no other ground <hi>de novo</hi> arise, than was extant at the time of making it, and yet was no barre nor hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:16264:203"/>
unto it, namely the sinne of man) he then by that oath seales and assures the immutability thereof, to those that rely upon it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is to <hi>commend the excellencie</hi> and pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minencie of that above other things, which hath this great seale of Heaven, the Oath of God to confirme and establish it. <hi>Inasmuch,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>as not without an oath hee was made Priest, by so much was hee made a surety of a better Testament; Heb.</hi> 6.20, 22. and this is a consequent of the former; for by how much the more abiding, by so much the more glorious is the Ministery of the Gospell. <hi>If that which is done away were glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. The more solemne and sacred the institution was, the more excellent is the Priesthood. Now this Oath was that Seale of God, by which hee designed and set apart his Sonne for that great Office, in a more solemne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ordination than was to others usuall. <hi>Him hath God the Father sealed; Iohn</hi> 6.27. It was but <hi>Hee hath said,</hi> unto others, ye are Gods, but it is, <hi>He hath sanctified,</hi> to his Sonne.<note place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly, It is to <hi>commend Gods great compassion and good will,</hi> for the establishing of the hearts of men in comfort and assurance. He therefore confirmed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise by an oath, <hi>That by two immutable things wherein it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope which is set before us. Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. an oath even amongst men is <hi>the end of all controversie,</hi> the determination and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of all differences; how much more when hee sets his Seale upon his mercy and covenant should the hearts of men bee secure, and lay fast hold thereon without doubt or scruple? Therefore wee finde the Saints in the Scripture make mention of the Oath of God, for establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing their hearts against feares or dangers. <hi>Thou wilt performe the truth to Iaakob, and the mercy to Abraham,

And this is the ground of all the Churches comfort and stabilitie: for alas, wee every day deserve to have God abrogate his Covenant of mercy with us, but hee is mindefull of the Oath which hee hath sworne. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8.9.5. There was wickednesse enough in the world to have drawne downe another flood after that of <hi>Noah,</hi> the same reason that caused it, did remaine after it was removed. <hi>Genes.</hi> 6.12, 13.8.21. But <hi>Gods Oath</hi> bound him to his mercy, <hi>Esay,</hi> 54.9. The meaning then of this first Clause is this. The Lord to shew the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of his Counsell, the unchangeablenesse of Christs Priesthood, the excellencie of it above the Priesthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the strong consolation which the Saints may there hence receive, hath sealed it by an Oath: so that he is a Priest by a decree which cannot be revoked.</p>
            <p>It notes unto us the <hi>Solemne call of Christ</hi> unto the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Priesthood, as before of <hi>King.</hi> verse 1. He did not usurpe this honour to himselfe as <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> did, when of their owne heads they offered strange fire unto the Lord, nor incroach upon us as <hi>Vzziah</hi>; but hee was <hi>ordained and begotten, and called of God</hi> thereunto, after the order of <hi>Melchisedech, Heb.</hi> 5.5.10. <hi>Hee was sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and sent, and had a commandement, and a worke set him to doe. Iohn</hi> 10.18.36.37. In which respect hee was called <hi>a Servant,</hi> or a chosen officer <hi>formed</hi> for a speciall imployment. <hi>Esay</hi> 42.1.49.5.53.11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. here then is the <hi>consent of the whole Trinitie</hi> unto Christs Priesthood. First, the <hi>Fathers consent</hi> in his Act of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination:
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:16264:204"/>
for him hath <hi>God the Father sealed, Iohn</hi> 6.27. <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee, Heb.</hi> 5.5, 6. Secondly, <hi>The Sonnes by voluntary susception</hi> and vadimonie for mankinde: for he was the <hi>Suretie of the Covenant, Heb.</hi> 8.22. The Apostle joyneth these two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9, 10. <hi>Loe, I come to doe thy Will O God</hi>; there was Gods Will and Christs submission thereunto, in which regard he is said <hi>to sanctifie himselfe, Iohn</hi> 17.19.

            <p>If then God call Christ unto his Priesthood by a <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Oath,</hi> and make him surety of a better covenant, we ought to take the more especiall notice thereof: for when God sweares he must be heard.

               <hi>onely Gods Oath,</hi> by which Christ is made a Priest, <hi>Able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and his company were in a great tempest, <hi>all hope</hi> that they should be saved was taken away, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.20. yet he exhorts them to bee of good cheere, because there should not bee the losse of any mans life amongst them; and the ground hereof was <hi>Gods promise,</hi> which he beleeved, verse 24, 25. The case is the same with us, we are compassed about with infirmities; with enemies too hard, and with sinnes too heavie for us; with feares and doubting, that we shall lose all againe; how can wee in such tempests of Spirit be cheered, but onely by casting anchor upon Gods covenant which is established by an oath? by learning to hope above hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. to be strong in him when we are weake in our selves? to bee faithfull in him when wee are fearefull in our selves? to be stedfast in him when we stagger in our selves? in the midst of Satans buffets and our owne corruptions to finde a <hi>sufficiencie in his Grace,</hi> able to answer and to ward off all? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. To catch hold of his covenant and to flie to the hope that is set before us, as to the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuge and sanctuary of a pursued soule, when wee are not able to stand by our selves? <hi>Esay</hi> 56.6. Heb. 6.18. It is hard very thing when a man hath a distinct view of his filthinesse and guilt, by reason of time, not to give over himselfe and his salvation as desparate things. It is nothing but ignorance and insensibilitie which makes men <hi>presume</hi> of the pardon of sinne. In this case then we must consider <hi>Gods Oath</hi> and Covenant with his people. First, <hi>not to reject them</hi> for their sinnes. <hi>Israel hath not beene forsaken, nor Iudah of his God, though their land was filled with sinne against the holy One of Israel, Ier.</hi> 51.5. <hi>My People are bent unto backsliding, &amp;c. and yet I will not execute the fiercenesse of mine anger,</hi> I will not return to destroy <hi>Ephraim, For I am God, and not Man, &amp;c.

            <p>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:16264:205"/>Secondly, <hi>not alwayes to suffer them</hi> to lie under sin, but in due time <hi>to heale their backeslidings,</hi> Hos. 14.4. he will not onely remove our transgressions from himselfe, but he will <hi>remove them from us too,</hi> and that so farre, as that it shall be as possible for the East and West to meet together, as for a man and his sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.12.

            <p>Many things there are in this call of Christ unto his Office to confirme this consolation, and upon which the troubled soule may cast Anker</p>
            <p>First, from the Father he hath received a <hi>command</hi> and call unto thy service, and so as a <hi>Servant</hi> he hath <hi>fidelity</hi>; for God choseth none but faithfull servants. Hee was <hi>an Apostle and high Priest</hi> sent to preach the Will, and to pacifie the wrath of God, and he was <hi>faithfull to him
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:16264:205"/>
that appointed him, as Moses was, Heb.</hi> 3.11.2. And if he be faithfull we may trust him, for he will doe the worke which is given him to doe. <hi>Faithfull is he that calleth you who also will doe it,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.24.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from himselfe there is a <hi>voluntarie submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> whereby he gives himselfe for his Church, and layes downe his owne life, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.11. for being of himselfe equall with the Father, he could not be by him commanded, ordained, or overruled to any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, without a voluntary concurring to the same decree; emptying himselfe, and taking on him the forme of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, making himselfe lesse than his Father, and in some sort for a while lower than the Angels,<note place="margin">Iohn 14.28. <hi>August de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.</note> that so he might be commanded. So that besides his fidelitie to rest on as a servant, here is his especiall mercy as a concurring agent in the decree, whereby he was ordained unto this office: He is not onely a <hi>Faithfull,</hi> but a <hi>mercifull high Priest,</hi> to make reconciliation for the sinnes of men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. But a man may both by his <hi>Fidelitie</hi> as a servant, and by his <hi>Mercy,</hi> as having the same tender compassion with him that sent him, be willing to helpe another out of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and yet may not be able to effect his owne desires for want of <hi>Power.</hi> And therefore,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by the Vnction of the holy Spirit, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Father and himselfe; hee is said to bee <hi>sanctified by the Father, Iohn</hi> 10.36. and to <hi>sanctifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, Iohn</hi> 17.19. To have received <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> from his Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.27. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.2. and to have power likewise within himselfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.18. That spirit, which for the discharge of this office hee brought with him in fulnesse, and unto all purposes of that service into the world, is a <hi>Spirit of Power,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. whereby he is enabled <hi>perfectly to save</hi> all commers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. so that unto his <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> here is added <hi>Abilitie</hi> likewise.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, as he received an office and a service, so hee
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:16264:206"/>
received a <hi>Promise</hi> from his father likewise which did much encourage him in this service. And this promise is <hi>twofold.</hi> First, the <hi>promise of a great seed</hi> which by the execution of his office hee should gather unto himselfe, and of a great conquest over all his enemies. God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred this ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our upon him to be the King of a mighty People, whom he should save and sanctifie to himselfe: <hi>They were given unto him, Psal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.6. so that unto his <hi>Fidelitie, Mercie</hi> and <hi>Power</hi>; here is further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a <hi>Propriety</hi> to the thing which hee saves: and who would not use all fidelitie in his owne businesse, all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards his owne seed, all the power he hath to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his <hi>owne House</hi> from the fire? and Christ was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>as a Sonne over his owne house, whose house are wee: Heb.</hi> 3.6. Secondly, there was the <hi>promise of a great Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Crowne</hi> which the nature he had assumed should in his Person receive after the fulfilling of his Service. After he had beene a little while lower than the Angels, hee was to bee <hi>crowned with Glory and Honour, Heb.</hi> 2.7. and therefore we may bee sure that hee hath fulfilled all righteousnesse, and done for his Church all which hee was to doe upon the Earth; <hi>because hee is gone, and wee see him no more:</hi> for his sufferings were to goe before, and his glory to follow: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. This is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles argument why we are not in our sinnes, but delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them, because Christ is risen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. <hi>Who is he that condemneth, it is Christ that died, yea rather that is risen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us? Rom.</hi> 8.34. And it is his argument againe, why wee ought to hold fast our profession, and to come boldly to the Throne of Grace for help in time of neede, because wee have a great high Priest that is passed into the Heavens, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, as hee had a <hi>Promise</hi> from the Father to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him, so he had a <hi>Nature from us</hi> to incline him
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:16264:206"/>
unto the execution of his Office. He was made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made like unto us in all things, sinne onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>tempted</hi> and <hi>afflicted</hi> as we are: and so there are two things which the heart of a beleever may rest upon in him in any discomforts. First, <hi>his Sympathie,</hi> for besides his <hi>Essentiall mercy</hi> as he is God, there was in him a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie which he learned</hi> by being like unto us. <hi>In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that hee might be a mercifull and a faithfull high Priest, Heb.</hi> 2.17. Such was his compassion towards the hunger of the multitude, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.32. because hee himselfe knew what hunger was, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.2. and such was his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards the sorrowes of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha, Iohn</hi> 11.33, 35. because he himselfe was acquainted with griefe, <hi>Esay,</hi> 53.3. and such was his compassion towards <hi>Peter</hi> in that state of desertion wherein he lay, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.61. because he himselfe knew what it was to be forsaken, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. And this is the Apostles assurance that we shall obtaine mercy and grace to helpe in time of neede; <hi>because hee had a feeling of our infirmities, and was tempted, as wee are, Heb.</hi> 4.15, 16. Secondly, <hi>His consanguinitie,</hi> He is not ashamed to call us brethren: He is our <hi>Goel,</hi> our <hi>Kinsman,</hi> and therefore our <hi>Redeemer: Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Ruth.</hi> 3.9.4.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And will not repent.</hi>] Many things God hath <hi>said,</hi> which hee hath revoked, as the destruction of <hi>Ninive</hi>; the death of <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> and the like; which implying a tacite condition, fit in the particular cases to be conceal'd upon the varieties of that, God might bee said either to persevere, or to repent; <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.7, 8.26.13, 19. God is ever most unchangeable in all his wayes, counsels and purposes, they stand for ever. Nothing can fall out to make God more wise, more mercifull, more provident, more powerfull than hee was before, and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make him truely to change his will, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his former actions or resolutions. There is with
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:16264:207"/>
him <hi>no variablenesse nor shadow of changing: He is not a man that hee should repent. I the Lord change not: Iam.</hi> 1.17. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. Only in mercy unto <note n="a" place="margin">

He spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth according to our capacitie, but he worketh accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne counsell, so that God is <hi>then said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> when that which he once willed to be, hee after by the counsell of the same will, causeth not to be; therein <hi>not changing his owne counsell,</hi> but <hi>onely willing the change of the things,</hi>

            <p>Now then, when not onely the counsell of God is immutable in it selfe, but also hee hath ordained some Law, Covenant or Office, which hee will have for ever to endure, without either naturall expiration, or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall abolishment, then is God said <hi>not to repent.</hi> To ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to the present businesse; the Apostle speaking of a new covenant which is established upon this new Priesthood of Christ (for the Priesthoods and the Lawes goe both together, the one being changed, there is made of necessitie a change of the other; <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12.) maketh the introducing of this new Covenant, which is founded upon the Oath of God, to make the preceding covenant old and transitory: <hi>In that hee saith, A new Covenant, he hath made the first old: Now that which decayeth and waxeth old, is ready to vanish away, Heb.</hi> 8.13. And hee saith peremptorily that it was therefore disannul'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:16264:207"/>
of the <hi>weakenesse and unprofitablenesse</hi> thereof: <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18. and this he affirmeth even of the morall Law; that law, the righteousnesse whereof was to be fulfilled in us by the Spirit of Christ, (namely in sincerity and in love, which is the bond of perfection, and the fulfilling of the Law) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. For the full understanding then and applying the words to the <hi>priesthood of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> or the second covenant thereupon grounded, it will be needfull to resolve these two questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. First, whether God hath repented him of the Law, which was the rule and measure of the Covenant of workes? Secondly, upon what reasons or grounds the immutabilitie of the second Covenant or Law of grace standeth?</p>
            <p>For the first of these, the Psalmist telleth us, that the <hi>Commandements of God are sure, and that they stand fast for ever and ever, Psal.</hi> 111.7, 8. and wee may note that the same forme of speech which the Lord useth to shew the stability of the new covenant; <hi>The Mountaines shall depart, and the Hils bee removed, but my kindnesse shall not depart from thee, neither shall the Covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee, Esay,</hi> 54.10. the same kinde of forme doth our Saviour use to expresse the stability of the Law; <hi>It is easier for Heaven and Earth to passe, than for one tittle of the Law to faile; Luk.</hi> 16.17. Now the Law hath a twofold Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; the one <hi>principall</hi> which is to <hi>Obedience,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is annexed a promise of righteousnesse or justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the other <hi>secondary</hi> and <hi>conditionall,</hi> which is unto <hi>malediction,</hi> upon supposall of disobedience. For, <hi>cursed is every one which continueth not in all things which are written in the Booke of the Law to doe them, Gal.</hi> 3.10. Now if no tittle of the Law must faile, then neither of these two must faile, but bee both fulfilled, and then it should seeme that the first Covenant is not removed not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the weaknesse thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:16264:208"/>For resolving hereof, wee must note that in point of validity or invalidity,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Gretii de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens fidei Cathol. de satisfactione Christi, cap.</hi> 3.</note> there can but five things be said of the <hi>Law</hi>: for first, either it must be <hi>obeyed,</hi> and that it is not, for <hi>all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God, Rom.</hi> 3.23. Or secondly, it must be <hi>executed</hi> upon men, and the curse or penaltie thereof inflicted; and that it is not neither, <hi>for there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ, Rom.</hi> 8.1. Or thirdly, it must be <hi>abrogated,</hi> or extinguished; and that it is not neither, for Heaven and Earth must sooner passe away. If there were no Law, there would be no sinne, for sinne is the transgression of the Law; and if there were no Law, there would be no judgement; for the world must be judged by the Law. Or fourthly, it must be <hi>moderated</hi> and favourably inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by rules of equity, to abate the rigor and severity thereof; and that cannot bee neither, for it is inflexible, no jot nor tittle of it must be abated. Or lastly, the Law it selfe remaining, the Obligation thereof notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, must towards such or such persons be so farre forth <hi>dispensed</hi> withall, as that a <hi>surety</hi> shall be admitted (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a concurrence of all their wills who are therein inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested; God willing to allow, Christ willing to performe, and Man willing to enjoy:) both to doe all the duties, and to suffer all the curses of the Law, in the behalfe of that Person, who in rigour should himselfe have done and suffered all. So then neither the Law nor any jot or tittle thereof is abrogated, in regard of the <hi>Obligations</hi> therein contained, but they are all reconciled in Christ with the second covenant. Yet notwithstanding, <hi>to the purpose of a covenant</hi> or rule of righteousnesse betweene us and God, so he hath repented of it, and removed that office or relation from it, that righteousnes should come to us thereby, by reason of the weaknesse and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablenesse which is in it to that purpose by the sinne of Man: yet thus much the Law hath to doe with justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that the fulfilling of the whole law is thereunto
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:16264:208"/>
ever some way or other presupposed. Onely in the first covenant, we were to doe in our <hi>owne persons</hi>; in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Christ is appointed and allowed to doe it for us. Hee fulfilled all the Obligations of the Law; the <hi>duties</hi> thereof by <hi>active obedience</hi> in his life, and the <hi>curses</hi> thereof by <hi>passive obedience</hi> in his death. Now then we by faith becomming one with Christ, the grace of God doth number us up in the same masse and summe with him, and so imputeth and accounteth that ours which was done by him. There is no righteousnesse but doth originally referre and beare proportion to the Law of God, and yet wee are not justified by the Law, but by Grace; because it is the favour of God, contrary to the rigour and exaction of the Law, which alloweth the righteousnesse of the Law <hi>by one fulfilled,</hi> to be unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>accounted.</hi> A man is denominated righteous, as a wall may bee esteemed red or greene. Now that comes to passe two manner of wayes, either by the colour inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and belonging unto the wall it selfe, or by the same colour in some diaphanous transparent body; as glasse, which by the beame of the Sunne shining on the wall, doth externally affect the same as if it were its owne, and covers that true inherent colour which it hath of it selfe. In like manner by the strict covenant of the Law wee ought to be righteous from a righteousnesse inherent in, and performed by our selves; but in the new covenant of grace we are righteous by the righteousnes of Christ, which shineth upon us, and presenteth us in his colour unto the sight of his Father. Here in both covenants the righteousnesse from whence the denomination groweth is the same (namely the satisfying of the demands of the whole Law) but the manner of our right and propriety thereunto is much varied. In the one we have right unto it <hi>by Law,</hi> because wee have done it our selves: In the other we have right unto it onely by <hi>Grace and favour</hi>; because another mans doing of it is bestowed upon us,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:16264:209"/>
and accounted ours. And this is that gratious covenant of which the Lord here saith, <hi>I have sworne and will not repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For resolving of the second question, upon what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons the immutability of the covenant of Grace standeth, we must note that as things are of severall sorts, so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they may bee mutable or immutable severall waies. Some things are <hi>absolutely immutable</hi> out of the nature of the thing it selfe; and that is, when the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, or alteration of the thing would unavoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably inferre some prodigious consequences and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pravity with it, as certaine dishonour to God, and confusion upon other things. As if we should conceive a man free from worshipping, reverencing, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, loving or trusting in God; herein the creature would be unsubordinated to the Creator, which would inferre desperate pravitie and disorder, and God should bee robb'd of his essentiall honor which he can no more part from, than cease to bee God. But now it is repugnant to the nature of an entire <hi>covenant,</hi> to bee in this manner immutable. For in a covenant there is a mutuall stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and consent betweene God and Man; and after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Mans duty, God maketh promise of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing a reward. Now there can bee no binding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity in God to conferre, nor absolute power in Man to challenge any good from God, who doth freely and by no necessity, good unto his Creatures. Secondly, some things are meerely <hi>juris positivi,</hi> not of any intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall necessity, resulting out of the condition of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, such as are free either to bee or not to bee of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or when they are free to continue or to cease; not in themselves determined unto any condition of being unvariably belonging unto their nature. And such are <hi>all covenants</hi>; for God might have dealt with Men, as with lapsed Angels, never have entred a-new into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them: hee might have reserved unto himselfe
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:16264:209"/>
a power of reconciliation and calling in his patent, and shutting up his office of mercy againe. How then comes it that this covenant is <hi>immutable,</hi> and Christs Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of everlasting and unchangeable vigor to all ages and generations of men? That there shall never be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Church any other forme of Gods worship, or any other instruments of Mans salvation, than those which we now enjoy? The Apostle groundeth it upon <hi>two reasons, Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. The <hi>Promise</hi> and the <hi>Oath</hi> of God. First, The <hi>Promise</hi> putteth a right in the creature which he had not before, and that Promise determineth the Will of God to the being; and leave not that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to the being or not being of the Covenant. For it is the foundation of a just claime which wee by faith may make upon the Fidelity, Iustice and Power of God, to make it Good. <hi>He is faithfull and just to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our sinnes</hi>; 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. <hi>The righteous God shall give unto mee a Crowne of righteousnesse:</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. righteousnesse and justice as well as mercy is the ground of forgivenesse of sinnes and salvation, not in relation or respect to merit in us, but to promise in God. Onely mercy it was which moved him to promise, and having promised onely truth and fidelity and righteousnesse bindeth him to performe. As impossible it is for God to breake any promise, and to lie unto <hi>David,</hi> as it is to bee an unholy God, or to deny himselfe; <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.35. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.24. Secondly, the <hi>Oath</hi> of God, for that pawnes his owne Being, Life, Power, Truth, Holinesse, to make good that which he hath so ratified; and upon these two doth the immutability of the second Covenant, and of Christs Priesthood depend.</p>
            <p>Here then wee see upon what ground all our comfort and assurance subsisteth; not upon any strength, power, libertie, or inherent grace already received, which wee of our selves are every day apt to waste and be cheated of by Satan and the world, but upon Gods unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:16264:210"/>
mercy and covenant. This was all <hi>Davids</hi> salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and desire, all that his heart rested upon, that though his house were not so with God, that is, did faile much of that beautie and puritie which therein God required, and therefore did deserve to be cast off, yet God had made with him an <hi>everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. When the conscience is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the sense of sinne, with the feare of its owne slipperinesse and unstedfastnesse in Gods covenant, this is all it hath to support it, <hi>That God is one, Galath.</hi> 3.19. That Christ is <hi>the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13.8. that he is where he ever was, <hi>ready to meet those that returne, Esay</hi> 64.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. If I should doe to men, as I have done to God, they would despise, forsake, revenge themselves on me, I should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive grace nor favour againe.

                  </gap> Iacob, nor perversenesse in Israel, Numb.</hi> 23.19, 20, 21. If the Sunne should be alwayes immoveably fixed in one place, as it was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while in <hi>Ioshua's</hi> time at the destruction of the Kings, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10.12, 13. though I might shut out the light of the Sunne from me, yet as soone as I remove the curten, the Sunne is still where it was, readie to be found, and to shine upon me. The case were lamentable with us, if so often as man provokes Gods justice, he should presently revoke his mercy; if the issue of our salvation should
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:16264:210"/>
depend upon the frailty and mutability of our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and our life should be in our owne keeping. If the pure Angels of heaven fell from their created condition, to be most blacke and hideous adversaries of the God that made them; if <hi>Adam</hi> stood not firme with all that stocke of strength and integrity of will which he had in Paradise: how can I who have so many lusts within, so many enemies without, such armies of feares and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations round about mee, bee able to resist, and stand? Grace inherent is as mutable in me, as it was in <hi>Adam,</hi> Satan as malitious and impetuous against me, as against <hi>Adam:</hi> Propensions to sinne and falling away, strong in me, which were none in <hi>Adam</hi>; snares as many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses more; enemies as many temptations more: from the grace which is deposited in mine own keeping, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but depart daily, if the Lord should leave me in the hand of mine owne counsell: even as water, though it could be made as hot as fire, yet being left unto it selfe, will quickly reduce and work it selfe to its own originall coldnesse againe. We have grace abiding in our hearts, as we have light in our houses, alwayes by emanation, effusion and supportance from the Sunne of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which shines upon us. Therefore this is all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which a man hath remaining, that though I am wanting to my selfe, and doe often turne from God, yet he is not wanting to mee, nor returnes from me, <hi>for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance, Rom.</hi> 11.29. The heart of the best man is like the wheeles in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> vision, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.16. As mutable, and moveable se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall wayes as wheeles, as perplexed, hindered, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted in it selfe, as crosse wheeles in one another, grace swaying one way, and flesh another, who can expect stabilitie in such a thing? Surely of it selfe it hath none, but the constancie and uniformitie of motion in the wheeles was this, that they were joyned to the living creatures, who in their motion returned not when they
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:16264:211"/>
went, <hi>vers.</hi> 17-21. such is the stability of the faithfull in the covenant, they have it not from themselves, for they are all like wheeles, but from him unto whom by the same Spirit of life they are united, who cannot repent, nor returne from the covenant of mercy which he hath made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech</hi>] We now come to speake of the Priesthood of Christ it selfe, which is thus sealed and made immutable by the oath of God. <hi>Every high Priest,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sinnes, Heb.</hi> 5.1. These sacrifices are of two sorts, some <hi>Eucharisticall,</hi> as testifications of homage, subjection, duty and service, as the dedication of the first fruits, the offerings of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> the meat and drinke offerings, &amp;c. some <hi>Ila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall</hi> or <hi>expiatory,</hi> for the washing away of sinnes, for making compensation to the justice of God, which had beene in sinne violated, and to propitiate him againe. So that in this regard a Priest was to be a <hi>middle person,</hi> by Gods appointment to stand, and to minister betweene him and men in their behalfe, to be impartiall and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full towards the justice and truth of God, and not to be over-ruled by his love to men to injure him, and to be compassionate and merciful towards the errours of men, and not to be over-ruled by his zeale to Gods justice, to give over the care or service of them. And such an High Priest was Christ, zealous of his Fathers righteousnesse and glory, for hee was <hi>set forth to declare the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, Rom.</hi> 3.25. and he did glorifie him on earth by finishing the things which he had given him to doe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.4. Compassionate towards the errours and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of his Church, for hee was appointed to expiate, and to remove them out of the way, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <p>Touching this Priest-hood, wee will thus proceed: First, to enquire into the <hi>Necessitie</hi> we have of such a
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:16264:211"/>
Priest. Secondly, what kinde of <hi>Qualifications</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in him, who must be unto us such a Priest. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wherein the <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>Offices</hi> of such a Priest-hood doe principally consist. Fourthly, what is the <hi>Vertue,</hi> fruits, ends, events of such a Priest-hood. Fifthly, what are the <hi>Duties</hi> which the execution of that office doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force upon us, or what uses wee should make of it. In these five particulars, I conceive, will the substance of most things which pertain unto the Priesthood of Christ be absolved.</p>
            <p>For the first of these wee must premise this generall rule, there can be no necessitie of a Priest (in that sense which is most proper and here intended) but betweene a <hi>guiltie creature,</hi> and a <hi>righteous God,</hi> for if man were innocent in his relations towards God, hee would stand in no need of an <hi>Expiation,</hi> and if God were unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the passages of mans sin, there would not be due unto him any just debt of <hi>satisfaction.</hi> This being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised I shall through many steps and gradations bring you to this necessitie of Christs Priest-hood which wee inquire into.</p>
            <p>First, every creature is unavoidably subject to the Creator, for he made all things for himselfe, and all is to returne that glory to him for which he made them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. And this subjection of the creature to the Creator, doth suppose a debt of service to the will of the Creator. Impossible it is, and utterly repugnant to the quality of a creature not to be subject to some Law, and indebted in some obedience or other to him that made it. <hi>Omne esse</hi> is <hi>propter operari,</hi> it is a certaine rule in creatures, that God giveth every creature a Being to this end, that it might put forth that being in some such operations as hee hath fitted it for, and prescribed it to observe. The most excellent of all creatures, that excell in strength, are <hi>Ministers to doe his pleasure and to heare his voice, Psal.</hi> 103.20, 21. and all the rest have their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:16264:212"/>
lawes, and rules of working by his wisdome set them, in the which they wait upon him, and according unto which they move like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wheeles, by the conduct of an invisible Spirit, and by the command of a voyce that is above them, as if they understood the Law of their Creator, and knew the precepts which they doe obey, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.25, 26. <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.19. No creature is for its selfe onely, or its owne end, for that which hath not its being of its selfe, cannot be an end unto it selfe, in as much as the end of every thing which is made is antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the being of it in the minde and intention of him that made it. The end of things is, as a marke, fixed and unmoveable in the purpose of the supreme cause, the creatures as the arrow, ordered by a most wife, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious providence, some through naturall and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, others voluntary and contingent motions unto one and the same generall end, the glory and service of the Creator.</p>
            <p>Secondly, no creature is in its being, or in any those operations and services which to God it owes, intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and of it selfe immutable. It is Gods owne pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar honour to bee without variablenesse or shadow of changing, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. There was a time when the Sunne stood still, and moved backward, and was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with darknesse, as with an internall cloud; when the Lions have forgotten to devoure, and the fire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, and the Whales to concoct, God can as he will alter the courses of nature, let goe the reines, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with the rules which himselfe had secretly impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon the creatures to observe, which shewes that they are not in themselves immutable. That constancie which in their motions they observe, is from the regular government of that most wise providence which carries them to their end <hi>without any turning, Ezek.</hi> 1.17. but when his glory requires, and his will commands it, the mountaines tremble, the sea cleaves asunder, the rivers
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:16264:212"/>
runne backe, the earth opens, the Lawes of nature stand still for a while without any execution, as if they were suspended or repeal'd by him that made them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that place things are said to <hi>move by a voice</hi> which is above them, namely, by the command of the supreme cause, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.24, 25.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, man being in his nature, and formall consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution a <hi>reasonable creature,</hi> was appointed by God to serve him after a <hi>reasonable manner,</hi> out of judgement, discretion, and election to make choice of his way above all others, as being most excellent, and beautifull in it selfe, and most convenient and advantageous unto man; therefore our service is called a <hi>reasonable service, Rom.</hi> 12.1. and <hi>David</hi> is said to have <hi>chosen the way of truth,</hi> and the precepts of the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.30. and <hi>Moses</hi> to have <hi>chosen the afflictions</hi> of Gods people, and the reproches of Christ, before the pleasures of sinne, or the treasures of Aegypt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26. And hence it is that Holinesse in the phrase of Scripture is called <hi>Iudgement,</hi> he shall <hi>convince the world of judgement, Ioh.</hi> 16.11. and <hi>he shall bring forth judgement unto victory, Matth.</hi> 12.20. Noting that the Spirit of holinesse ruleth and worketh in the children of obedience by a way of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> therefore hee is called <hi>a Spirit of Iudgement, Esay</hi> 4.4. And for this cause God did not set any over-ruling law, or determinating vertue over the operations of man, as of other creatures, that so he might truely worke out of the conduct of judgement, and election of will.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there is no deviation from a reasonable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or true active obedience, (properly so called) for the obedience of brutes and inanimate creatures (is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther passive than active) which hath not some intrinsecall pravity in it, and by consequence some fundamentall demerit, or obligation unto punishment; for Guilt is the proper passion of sinne, resultant out of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inseparable from it. It cannot be that a creature
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:16264:213"/>
should of it selfe, and out of the corruption of its owne reason and judgement, choose to relinquish the service of him to whom it is naturally and unavoidably subject, and by that meanes become altogether unprofitable, abominable, and unfit for the Masters use, and for those holy ends to which it was originally ordered, but it must withall incurre the displeasure, and thereupon provoke the revenge of that righteous Creator, who out of great reasons had put it under such a service.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, By all this which hath hitherto beene spoken it appeares, that God is not unjust, but most holy and righteous: First, in making a Law for man to observe, when hee forbade the eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evill, to shew that man had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by personall, immediate, and underived right, but all by donation, and indulgence. Any Law God might justly make, the obedience whereof hee gave the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture an originall power to performe, by reason of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and necessary subjection of the creature unto him. Secondly, in annexing a curse and penalty to the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Law, which for the declaration of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious justice hee might most righteously doe, because of the inevitable demerit, or liablenesse unto censure from the disobedience of that Law resulting. Thirdly, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king man in such a mutable condition, as in the which he might stand or fall by his owne election, because hee would be obeyed by judgement and free choice, <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Sixthly, here then comes in the <hi>fall of man,</hi> being a wilfull or chosen transgression of a Law, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts whereof he was most justly created, and unto the malediction wherof he was as necessarily &amp; righteously subject if hee transgressed: for as by being Gods <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> he was subject to his will, so by being his <hi>prisoner,</hi> he was as justly subject unto his wrath, and that so much the more, by how much the precept was more just, the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:16264:213"/>
obedience more easie, the transgression more unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and the punishment more certaine.</p>
            <p>Now by this fall of man there came great mischiefe into the world, and intolerable injury was done by the Creature to him that made him: First, his dominion and authoritie in his holy command was violated. Secondly, his justice, truth, and power in his most righteous threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings were despised. Thirdly, his most pure and perfect Image, wherein man was created in righteousnesse and true holinesse, was utterly defaced. Fourthly, his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which by an active service the creature should have brought unto him, was lost and despoiled. So that now things will not returne to their primitive order and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection againe, till these two things be first effected: First, a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Gods justice: And secondly, a <hi>Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of mans nature: which two must needs be effected by such a middle and common person, as hath both zeale towards God, that he may be satisfied, and compassion toward man, that he may be repaired; such a person, as having mans guilt and punishment on him translated, may satisfie the justice of God, and, as having a fulnesse of Gods Spirit and holinesse in him, may sanctifie and repaire the nature of man. And this person is the Priest here spoken of by <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the learned frame a kinde of conflict in Gods holy Attributes, and by a libertie which the Holy Ghost from the language of holy Scripture alloweth them, they speake of God after the manner of men, as if he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced unto some straits and difficulties by the crosse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his severall attributes: Justice called upon him for the condemnation of a sinfull, and therefore worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accursed creature, which demand was seconded by his truth, to make good that threatning, <hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the death.</hi> Mercy on the other side pleaded for favour and compassion towards man, wofully seduced and overthrowne by Satan; and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:16264:214"/>
peace for reconcilement and pacification betweene an offended Judge, and an undone creature. Hereupon the infinite wisdome and counsell of the blessed Trinitie found out a way, which the Angels of heaven gaze on with admiration and astonishment, how to reconcile these different pleas of his attributes together. A Priest then is resolv'd upon, one of the same blessed Trinitie, who by his Fathers ordination, his owne voluntary sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and the holy Spirits sanctification, should be fitted for the businesse. He was to be both a <hi>Surety,</hi> and a <hi>Head</hi> over sinfull men, <hi>to suffer</hi> their punishments, and to <hi>sanctifie</hi> their natures, in the relation of a surety to pay mans debt unto God; and in the relation of an Head to restore Gods Image unto man: and thus in him <hi>mercie and truth have met together, righteousnesse and peace have kissed each other, Psal.</hi> 85.10.</p>
            <p>So then the necessitie which man fallen hath of this Priest here spoken of, is grounded upon the sweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and mutuall kisses of Gods Mercy, Truth, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and Peace; which will more distinctly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by considering three things: First, God did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose not utterly to destroy his creature, and that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for these two reasons, as we may observe out of the Scriptures: First, his owne <hi>free and everlasting love,</hi> and that infinite delight which he hath in mercy, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth him abundantly to pardon, and to exercise loving kindnesse in the earth, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 103.8. <hi>Esay</hi> 55.7. <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.24. Secondly, his delight to be actively glorified by his creatures voluntary service and subjection: <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that you beare much fruit, Iohn</hi> 15.8. <hi>I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that hee turne from his way and live, Ezek.</hi> 33.11. He delighteth most in unbloudy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, when by his patience, goodnesse, and forbearance he subdueth the hearts, affections, and consciences of men unto himselfe, so leading them unto repentance,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:16264:214"/>
and bringing downe their thoughts unto the obedience of Christ: he loveth to see things in their primitive recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and beautie, and therefore esteemeth himselfe more glorified in the <hi>services,</hi> than in the <hi>sufferings</hi> of men. Hee loveth to have a Church and generation of men, which shall serve him in the middest of all his enemies. <hi>The Lord loveth the gates of Sion, more than all the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Iacob, Psalm.</hi> 87.2. namely, because hee was there more solemnely worshipped and served. And therefore he resolved not to destroy all men, lest there should be no <hi>Religion</hi> upon the earth. When the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels fell, they fell not all, many were still left to glorifie him actively in their service of him, but when <hi>Adam</hi> fell, all mankinde fell in him, so that there was no tree of this Paradise left to bring forth any fruit unto God (and this is most certaine, God had rather have his trees for fruit, than for fuell,) and for this reason he was pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store mankinde againe. These are the causes why the Lord would not utterly destroy man, but these alone shew not the necessitie of a Priest to come betweene God and man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God did purpose not to suffer sinne to passe utterly unrevenged, and that for these reasons: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his great <hi>Hatred</hi> thereunto. He is of <hi>purer eyes than to behold evill, he cannot looke on iniquitie, Hab.</hi> 1.13. it provoketh a nauseousnesse and abhorrencie in him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.21, 22. <hi>Esay</hi> 1.13, 14. Secondly, because of his <hi>Truth,</hi> and the Law which he had established against sinne,<note place="margin">

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:16264:215"/>
Thirdly, because of his <hi>terrour</hi> and fearefull Majestie, for God will have men alwayes to tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and by his terrour to bee perswaded from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10, 11. God will for this cause have men alwaies to feare before him, because he reserveth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe entire the punishment of sinne; <hi>Feare him who is able to destroy both bodie and soule in hell, I say unto you feare him,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Matth</hi> 10.28. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4. for it is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, and therefore we ought to serve him <hi>with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and godly feare, because he is a consuming fire, Hebr.</hi> 10.30.12.28, 29.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, adde unto all this the everlasting <hi>Impotency</hi> which is in man either to satisfie God, or to repaire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Gods justice is <hi>Infinit</hi> which is wronged, &amp; his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry infinite, of which man had attempted to spoile &amp; rob him, and man is both <hi>finite</hi> in himselfe and very <hi>impotent</hi> by reason of sin (for to be a sinner, and without strength are termes equivalent in the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6.8.) Now then betweene <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>infinite</hi> there can be no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore from the one to the other there can be no satisfaction: man is utterly unable to doe any of Gods will, because he is altogether carnall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. and he is utterly unable either to suffer or to breake thorow the wrath of God, because he hath not strength enough to endure it, nor obedience to submit unto it. Now then joyne all these things together, and wee shall see the absolute necessity we had of a Priest. God <hi>will not execute the severity of his Law,</hi> for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the creature should everlastingly lose the fruition of him, and he should likewise lose the service and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary subjection of his creature. And yet <hi>he will not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish his Law</hi> neither, lest thereby his justice should be the more securely abused, his hatred against sinne the lesse declared, his truth in all his threatnings questioned, and his dreadfull Majesty by men neglected, as the woodden
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:16264:215"/>
king by the frogs in the fable, hee will not punish those persons whom he loves, because he is pitifull to them: he will not passe over the sinnes which he hates, because he is jealous towards himselfe. Man and sin are as inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably joyned together since the fall, as fire and heat; yet God wil have mercy on the man, &amp; he wil take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the sin. Some course then or other must there be found out, to translate this mans sins on anothers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who may be able to beare them, and to interest this mans person in anothers righteousnesse, which may bee able to cover him. Some way must be found out, that things may bee all one in regard of man, as if the Law had beene utterly abrogated, and that they may be all one in regard of God too, as if the creature had beene utterly condemned. And all this is done in our High Priest. On him was executed the curse of the Law, by him was fulfilled the righteousnesse of the Law, for him was remitted the sin of man, and through him were all things made new againe. The world was in Christ as in its suretie, making satisfaction to the justice of God; and God was in Christ as in his Ambassadour, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world unto himselfe againe. By all which wee see the necessitie which man lapsed had of a Priest to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him.</p>
            <p>Hence then we may learne, first, how much we ought to hate sinne, which armes the Law, Justice, and power of God against us. As hatefull as it is unto God, so hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is in it selfe, for hee judgeth uprightly, hee seeth things just as they are, without passion, prejudice, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie: and as hatefull as it is in it selfe, so hatefull should it be unto us, as the onely ground of our misery, of the creatures vanitie, and of Gods dishonour. Wee see it is so hatefull unto God, that he will most certainly be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of it. If he spare me, yet he will not spare my sin, though his owne beloved Son must be punished for it. O then why should that be light to mee, which was as
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:16264:216"/>
heavie as a milstone to the soule of Christ? Why should that bee my pleasure, which was his passion? Why should that be in a throne with me, which was upon a crosse with him? Why should I allow that to be really in me, which the Lord so severely punished, when the guilt thereof was but imputed to his Sonne? Many sinnes there are which others in their practice, aswell as Papists in their doctrine and profession esteeme for light and veniall sinnes. And veniall indeed they are, <hi>per exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorem Patris Christum,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> states the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by Christ who is a prevailing Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But however let not us dare esteeme that a light thing for which Christ died. And woe had it beene for men, if Christ had not in his body on the tree carried as well the guilt of our idle words, our vaine thoughts, our loose and impertinent actions, as of our oaths, execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and blasphemies. If great sinnes were as the speare and nailes, certainely small sinnes were the thornes which pierced his head. And therefore we should learne with <hi>David</hi> to hate every evill way, because God hates it, and suffers it not to passe unpunished, to revenge the quarrell of Christ against those lusts of ours which nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to his crosse, and to crucifie them for him againe, for, for that end was Christ crucified, that our old man might be crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that hence-forth we should not serve sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6.</p>
            <p>Againe, wee see by this necessitie of a Priest, how deepely we stand engaged to our mercifull God, who hath vouchsafed to helpe us in our greatest necessitie. How we ought to love him, who hath first of all loved us. How wee ought in our bodies and in our spirits to glorifie him, who hath so dearely bought us. How we should like Voluntaries fight for him who overcame for us. How thankfull we should be to him, who was so compassionate unto us. How wee should admire and
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:16264:216"/>
adore the unsearchable riches of his wisdome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, who when wee were desperately and incurably gone, had found out a way of escape and deliverance for us. God stood not in need of us or any service of ours, he could have glorified himselfe in our just destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Who then can enough expresse either the mercy of God, or the dutie of man, when hee considers that God should call together all the depths of his owne wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and counsell, to save a company of desperate fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives, who had joyned in combinations with his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test enemies to resist and dishonour him? It would have posed all the wisdome of the world, (though misery be commonly very witty to shape and fashion to it selfe images of deliverance) to have found out a way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven betweene the wrath of God, and the sinne of man. It would have posed all the heavenly intelligences, and the united consultations of the blessed Angels, to have reconciled Gods mercy in the salvation of man, and his justice in the condemnation of sinne, to have powred out hell upon the sinne, and yet to have bestowed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the sinner. If God should have instructed us thus farre, you are miserable creatures, but I am a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God; the demands of my justice I must not deny, neither will I deny the entreaties of my mercy: finde me out a sacrifice answerable to my justice, and it shall be accepted for you all: O where could man have found out a creature of capacitie enough to hold, or of strength enough to beare the sinnes of the world, or the wrath of God? Where could he have found out in heaven or earth, amongst men or Angels a Priest that durst accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany such a sacrifice into the presence of so consuming a fire? Or where could he have found out an Altar where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to offer, and whereby to sanctifie so great a sacrifice? No, no, the misery of man was too deepe, and inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable for all the created counsell in the world to invent a deliverance. Now then if God himselfe did studie <hi>to save</hi>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:16264:217"/>
me, how great reason is there that I should studie <hi>to serve</hi> him? How ought all my wisdome, and counsell, and thoughts, and desires be directed to this one resolution, to live acceptably and thankfully unto him, who when hee might have produced glory to himselfe out of my confusion, chose rather to humble, and as it were for a while to unglorifie himselfe for my salvation? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that man did never rightly understand the horrour of sinne, the infinite hatred of God against it, the heavinesse of his wrath, the malediction of the Law, the mystery and vast dimensions of Gods love in Christ, the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of his sacrifice, the end, purpose, or merit of his death, any of those unsearchable riches of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in the flesh, who will not crucifie a vanitie, a lust, a pleasure, an earthly member unto him againe; who findes more content and satisfaction in his owne wayes of sinne and death, more wisdome in the temptations and deceits of Satan and his owne fleshly minde, than in those deepe mysteries of grace, and contrivances of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which the Angels desire to prie into.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the last place wee should labour to feele this necessitie we have of such a Priest. This is the only reason why so few make use of so pretious a fountaine, because they trust in their owne muddie and broken cisternes at home, and are never sensibly and throughly touched with the sense of their owne wants; for it is not the saying and confessing, <hi>ore tenus,</hi> that I have nothing, nor the knowing in speculation only that I have nothing, but the feeling and sm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rting by reason of my want, which will drive me to seeke for reliefe abroad. If a man did seriously consider and lay together such thoughts as these; I am very busie for the affaires and passages of this present life, which will quickely vanish and passe away like a Weavers shuttle, or a tale that is told. I have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and an abiding life to live after this is over. All that I toile for here is but for the backe, the belly, the bagge,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:16264:217"/>
and the posterity. And am I not neerer to my selfe, than I am to my money? Am I not neerer to my soule, than I am to my carkasse, or to my seed? Must I not have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that, when neither I nor my posterity have either backe to be clothed, or belly to bee fed, or name to be supported? O why am I not as sadly imployed, why spend I not some at least as serious and inquisitive thoughts about this, as about the other? Doe I not know that I must one day stand before him who is a consuming fire, that I must one day be weighed in the ballance, and woe be unto me if I am found too light? Appeare before him I dare not of my selfe alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Priest</hi> to mediate for me, to cover and protect me from his fury, and to reconcile me unto him againe. My <hi>person</hi> wants a <hi>Priest,</hi> it is clogg'd with infinite <hi>Guilt,</hi> which without him cannot bee covered. My <hi>nature</hi> wants a <hi>Priest,</hi> it is overspred with a deepe and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall <hi>corruption,</hi> which without him cannot be cured. My <hi>sinnes</hi> want a <hi>Priest,</hi> they are in number and in quality above measure sinfull, which without him cannot bee pardoned. My <hi>services</hi> want <hi>a Priest,</hi> they are blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and poisoned with many failings and corruptions, without him they cannot be accepted: I say, if men did seriously lay together such thoughts as these, it could not be that rationall and sad men, men of deepe thoughts in other matters, who love to boult out things to the bran, and to be very solicitous for evidence and certainty in them, should suffer such a businesse as this, their interest in that <hi>Priest</hi> who must alone clothe their persons with his righteousnesse, and cleanse their nature with his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and wash away their sinnes with his bloud, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie their prayers, and almes, and all religious devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with his incense, and intercession, or else all of them must passe thorow the triall of such a fire as will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them all, to be slubber'd over with loose and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoughts, and to bee rested in, and resolv'd upon
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:16264:218"/>
rather by the lying presumptions of a deceitfull heart, than by the evidences and testimony of Gods holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Consider what I say, and the Lord give you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in all things.</p>
            <p>The second thing proposed to bee considered in the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ, was the <hi>qualification</hi> of that person who was to be a fit High-Priest for us. <hi>Legall sacrifices</hi> would not serve the turne to purge away sin, because of their basenesse. They were not expiations of sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9.12. but were onely <hi>remembrances</hi> and commemorations of sinne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.3. necessary it was that heavenly things themselves should be purified with better sacrifices, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.23. for they of themselves, without that <hi>typicall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which they had unto Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. and that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall vertue</hi> which in that relation they had from him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13. were utterly <hi>weake and unprofitable, Heb.</hi> 7.18. as the shadow hath neither being in it selfe, nor can give refreshment unto another, but dependently on the body to which it belongeth. And this appeareth, first, by their <hi>reiteration,</hi> where the conscience is once purged, and there is remission of sin, there is no more offring, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.2-18. for the repeating of the sacrifice shews that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for whose sake it is repeated, is <hi>in statu quo prius,</hi> in the same condition now as hee was in at the time of the former oblation. Secondly, by their <hi>Variety,</hi> there were both <hi>Gifts and sacrifices</hi> for sins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1.8.3. buls, and goats, and calves, and lambes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9.12.13. and that shewes that no one thing was fit to typifie the full expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought by Christ, whereas he offered but <hi>One Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and by that perfected for ever them that are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12.14. And if <hi>legall sacrifices</hi> would not serve the turne, then neither would <hi>legall Priests</hi> be fit for so great a worke; for all the good which the Priest doth is in the vertue of the sacrifice which he brings: and this likewise the Apostle proves by many arguments: First, because of their <hi>sinfulnes,</hi> for they themselves wanted an
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:16264:218"/>
expiation, and therefore could not be mediatours for the sinnes of others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.3.7.27. Secondly, because of the <hi>carnalnesse of their institution.</hi> They were made after the Law of a <hi>carnall commandement,</hi> that is, of a temporary, perishable, and meerely externall ordinance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16. which prescribed onely the examples and shadowes of heavenly things. Thirdly, because of their <hi>mortality,</hi> they were not suffered to continue by reason of death, wheras our Priest must <hi>live</hi> to make intercession. Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their <hi>ministery</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the revolution of their servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which never came to a period or perfection in which the Priest might give over, and <hi>Sit downe.</hi> They <hi>Stood daily ministring,</hi> and oftentimes offering (their service did daily returne upon them againe) whereas Christ, after he had offered <hi>One sacrifice</hi> for sinne for ever, <hi>sate downe</hi> on the right hand of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.11, 12.</p>
            <p>To shew you then the qualifications of this Priest. A Priest in general is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, to offer sacrifice for the obtaining of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and remission of sinnes.</p>
            <p>First then, Christ being a Priest, must of necessity be a <hi>Mediator</hi> and a <hi>Surety</hi> betweene parties, that he might have one unto whom, and others for whom &amp; in whose behalfe to offer a sacrifice. Every Priest must be a <hi>media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> to stand betweene God and the people, and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and beare the iniquity even of their holy things.<note place="margin">Exod. 28.38.</note> And unto this mediation there must concur the consent of the parties between whom it is negotiated; for a mediator is not a mediator of one. Now God giveth his consent by laying on him our iniquities, and making his soule an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for sin, and thereby declaring himselfe to be <hi>One with us.</hi> And man gives his consent,<note place="margin">Esay 53.6—10. Gal. 3.20.</note> when by faith hee receiveth Christ, and so becommeth not only the friend, but the Sonne of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, but every Mediator is not presently a Priest, for there is a <hi>mediation</hi> onely by way of <hi>intreaty,</hi> prayer,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:16264:219"/>
and request, wherein men doe obtaine but not deserve or purchase remission for others; such mediators were <hi>Ioab,</hi> and the Widdow of <hi>Tekoah</hi> in the behalfe of <hi>Absalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. and there are <hi>mediators</hi> by way of <hi>satisfaction,</hi> as <hi>Sureties</hi> are between the creditor and the debtor; and such a mediator was Christ, not onely a <hi>Mediator,</hi> but also a <hi>surety</hi> of a better covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. he was not to procure remission of our sinnes by way of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and request; but hee was set forth <hi>to declare the Righteousnesse of God, Rom.</hi> 3.25. and such a mediator betweene God and us must needs bee a Priest too; for the debt which we owed unto God was <hi>bloud.</hi> Without shedding of bloud there is no remission, <hi>Heb.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.22.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, being such a Priest he must have a <hi>Sacrifice an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable</hi> to the debt which was owed to his Father. The debt wee owed was the forfeiture and subjection of our <hi>Soules and Bodies</hi> to the wrath of God, and the curse of the Law. God is able to destroy both <hi>Soule and Body in Hell, Matth.</hi> 10.28. It is not to bee understood onely of his <hi>Absolute power</hi> but of that power which as our <hi>Iudge</hi> hee hath over us <hi>per modum Iustitiae,</hi> as we are his Prisoners, and so obnoxious to the Curses of his Law. Therefore our Priest also was to have a <hi>Soule and a Body,</hi> to pay as a surety for our Soules and Bodies. Thou shalt make his <hi>Soule an offering for sinne, Esai.</hi> 53.10. <hi>My soule is exceeding sorrowfull even unto Death, Matth.</hi> 26.38. And againe, <hi>A Body hast thou prepared mee</hi>; we are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified through the <hi>Offering of the Body of Iesus Christ</hi> once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5.10. His owne selfe <hi>bare our sinnes in his owne Body on the tree,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. So hee was to bee <hi>Man</hi> that he might have a <hi>fit</hi> and answerable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to offer, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Thou hast <hi>fitted</hi> or <hi>prepared</hi> a Body for mee, that my Sacrifice might bee proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to that in the place whereof it stood. And thereby as hee is <hi>fit for passion,</hi> so also for <hi>Compassion,</hi> hee was to bee <hi>our Kinsman,</hi> and of our bloud, that hee might bee a
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:16264:219"/>
mercifull and faithfull high Priest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11.14.17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>And fit for derivation of his Righteousnesse,</hi> and transfusion of his Spirit upon us; for <hi>hee that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth and they that are Sanctified are both of one.</hi> And as it must bee thus <hi>fitted</hi> to the sinner that it may bee a proper and suteable Sacrifice for his sinne: So must it bee <hi>perfect</hi> likewise. First, <hi>Without blemish or sinne.</hi> Such an High Priest became us who is <hi>Holy, Harmelesse, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, separate from sinners, Heb.</hi> 7.26. That so hee might <hi>offer himselfe without spot unto God,</hi> and have no need of a Sacrifice for himselfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, without any manner of <hi>Defect,</hi> which should stand in need of supplement and contribution from some thing else, that of it selfe alone it might bee sufficient, and available to bring perfection and salvation unto men, and to leave no more conscience of sinne behinde it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19.10.14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, as there was to bee such a Sacrifice, <hi>perfect</hi> in it selfe, and <hi>fit</hi> for the use and occasion for which it was appointed, so there must bee an <hi>Altar</hi> upon which to offer it unto the Father; for it is <hi>the Altar which San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth the offering</hi>; that is, which in regard of <hi>God</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it <hi>acceptance,</hi> and which in regard of <hi>Man</hi> giveth it <hi>vertue, merit and value</hi> answerable to his occasions. This Sacrifice was to be sufficient for the satisfaction of God, and for the justification and reparation of Man, and both these by meanes of the <hi>Altar</hi> on which it was offered, which was the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> Through the <hi>Eternall Spirit hee offered himselfe without spot unto God, and so</hi> by his bloud purgeth our consciences from dead workes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>For Christ as God sanctified himselfe as man,</hi> that so we through the vertue and merit of his Sacrifice might bee sanctified likewise, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.19. Hee was to be God as well as man, <hi>Medium participationis</hi>; before hee could bee <hi>Medium reconciliationis</hi>; that so he might bee himselfe supported to undergoe and breake through the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:16264:220"/>
weight of sinne and the Law, and having so done might have compasse enough in his Sacrifice to satisfie the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God, and to swallow up the sinnes of the world.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, in as much as the <hi>Vertue of the Deitie</hi> was to bee attributed truly to the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> (else it could have no value nor vertue in it) and that Sacrifice was to be his <hi>Owne Life,</hi> Soule and Body, who is the Priest to offer it, because hee was not barely a <hi>Priest</hi> but a <hi>Suretie,</hi> and so his person stood in stead of ours, to pay our debt, which was a debt of bloud, and therefore hee was to offer himselfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. And in as much as his person must needs bee equivalent in dignity and representation to the persons of all those for whom hee mediated, and who were for his sake onely delivered from suffering: for these causes necessary it was that God and man should make but <hi>one Christ,</hi> in the unity of the same <hi>infinite person,</hi> whose natures they both were, that which suffered, and that which sanctified. The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature was not to bee left to subsist in and for it selfe, but was to have dependence, and supportance in the person of the Sonne, and a kinde of <hi>Inexistence</hi> in him, as the graft of an apple may have in the stock of a plumb. From whence ariseth; first, the <hi>Communication of properties</hi> betweene the natures; when by reason of the unity of the person, wee attribute that to one nature which is common to the other, not by <hi>confusion</hi> or <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,</hi> but by <hi>Communion</hi> in <hi>one end</hi> and in <hi>one person</hi>; as when the Scriptures attribute <hi>Humane properties to the Divine Nature.</hi> The <hi>Lord of Life was slaine, Act.</hi> 3.15. <hi>God purchased the Church with his owne bloud, Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>They crucified the Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. Or <hi>Divine to the Humane Nature.</hi> As <hi>the Sonne of Man came downe from heaven, Ioh.</hi> 3.13. and <hi>the Sonne of Man shall ascend where hee was before, Ioh.</hi> 6.62. Or when both natures worke with their severall concurrence unto the same worke, as to <hi>walke on the waters, to rise out of the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:16264:220"/>
grave, &amp;c.</hi> By which <hi>Communication of properties</hi> vertue is derived from the Altar to the Sacrifice in as much as it was the Lord of Glory which was crucified. So that his passions were in regard of the person which bare them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, both <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> because the person was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> Secondly, from the unity of the person supporting the Humane Nature with the Divine, ariseth the <hi>Appliablenesse of one sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto all men.</hi> Because the Person of the Sonne is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more than equivalent to the persons of all men, as one Diamond to many thousand pebbles; and because the obedience of this sacrifice was the obedience of God, and therefore cannot but have more vertue and well-pleasingnesse in it, than there can bee demerit or malignity in the sinne of man.</p>
            <p>Now this Person in whose unity the two Natures are conjoyned, is the second person in the Holy Trinity. He was the person against whom the first sinne was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally committed, for it was an affectation of wisedome and to bee like unto God; (as the falling-sinne now is the sinne against the third person) and therefore the mercy is the more glorious that hee did undertake the expiation. By him the world was made, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.3. and therefore being spoiled hee was pleased to new make it againe, and to bring many Sonnes unto glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. Hee was the expresse image of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. And therefore by him are wee renewed after Gods image againe, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. He was the Sonne of God by Nature, and therefore the mercy was againe the more glorified in his making us Sonnes by Adoption, and so joynt heirs with himselfe who was the heire of all things.</p>
            <p>So then such an high Priest it became us to have, as should bee first an equall <hi>middle person</hi> between God and Man. In regard of God towards man an officer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to declare his Righteousnesse, and in regard of
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:16264:221"/>
man towards God a suretie ready to purchase their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and deliverance. Secondly, such an one as should bee <hi>one with us</hi> in the fellowship of <hi>our nature,</hi> passions, infirmities and temptations, that so hee might the more readily suffer for us, who in so many things suffered with us; and <hi>one with God the</hi> Father in his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> that so by the vertue of his sufferings and resurrection he might bee able both to satisfie his Iustice, to justifie our persons, to sanctifie our Nature, to perfume and purifie our services, to raise up our dead bodies, and to present us to his Father a glorious Church without spot or wrinkle. And both these in the <hi>Vnitie of one Person,</hi> that so by that meanes the Divine Nature might communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate vertue, merit, and acceptablenesse to the sufferings of the humane; and that the dignity of that person might countervaile the persons of all other men. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that person of the three, by whom the glory of the mercy should bee the more wonderfully magnified. In one word <hi>two things</hi> are requisite to our <hi>High Priest.</hi> A <hi>Grace of Vnion</hi> to make the person God and man in one Christ: and a <hi>Grace of Vnction,</hi> to fit him with such ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Spirit, as may enable him to the performance of so great a worke, <hi>Esai.</hi> 11.2.</p>
            <p>By all which wee should learne: First, to adore this great mysterie of God manifested in the flesh, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Spirit, the unsearchablenesse of that love, which appointed God to bee man, the Creator of the world to bee despised as a worme, for the salvation of such rebels, as might justly have been left under chaines of darknesse, and reserved to the same inevitable destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Devils which fell before them. Secondly, to have alwayes before our eyes the great hatefulnesse of sinne, which no sacrifice could have expiated but the bloud of God himselfe; and the great severity and inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablenesse of Gods Iustice against it, which no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction could pacifie, no obedience compensate, but the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:16264:221"/>
suffering and exinanition of himselfe. O what a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall that man bee in, who must stand or rather ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly sinke and bee crushed unto the weight of that wrath against sinne, which amazed and made heavie unto death the soule of Christ himselfe? which made him who had the strength of the <hi>Deitie</hi> to support him, the fulnesse of the <hi>Spirit</hi> to sanctifie, and prepare him, the message of an <hi>Angell</hi> to comfort him, the relation of a <hi>beloved Sonne</hi> to refresh him, the voyce of his <hi>Father</hi> from heaven testifying unto him that hee was heard in what hee feared, the assurance of an <hi>ensuing glorie</hi> and victorie to encourage him (none of which shall be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wicked in hell, who shall not onely bee the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of his vengeance, but which will bee as grievous as that, the everlasting objects of his hatred and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) which made I say even the Sonne of God himselfe, notwithstanding all these abatements, to pray with strong Cries, and bloudy drops, and woefull conflicts of soule against the Cup of his Fathers wrath, and to shrink and decline that very worke for which onely hee came into the world? Thirdly, to praise God for that <hi>great honour</hi> which hee hath conferred upon our nature in the flesh of his Sonne, which in him is anointed with more grace and glory, and filled with more vast and unmatcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfections than all the Angels in heaven are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether capable of; for though for a little while hee was made lower than the Angels for the purpose of his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, yet hee is now sat downe on the right hand of the Majesty on high, Angels, and Authorities, and Powers being made subject unto him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.6-9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.4-13. And for the <hi>infinite mercy</hi> which hee hath shewed to our soules, bodies, and persons in the sacrifice of his Sonne; in our reconciliation and favour with him, in the justification of our persons from the guilt of sinne, in the sanctification of our nature from the corruption of sinne, in the inheritance reserved in heaven for us, in the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:16264:222"/>
Communion and fellowship wee have with Christ in his merits, power, Priviledges, and heavenly likenesse. <hi>Now,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>wee are Sonnes, and it doth not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare what wee shall bee: but wee know that when hee shall appeare, wee shall bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From these things which have been spoken of the <hi>Personall Qualifications</hi> of our High Priest, it will bee easie to finde out the <hi>third particular</hi> inquired into, touching the <hi>Acts or Offices of Christs Priesthood</hi>; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touching the parts of the same Action, for it is all but one. <hi>Two Acts</hi> there are wherein the execution of this office doth consist. The first, an <hi>Act of Oblation</hi> of himselfe once for all, as an adequate sacrifice, and full compensation for the sinnes of the whole world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.26. Our <hi>Debt</hi> unto God was <hi>Twofold.</hi> As we were his <hi>Creatures,</hi> so wee owed unto him a <hi>Debt</hi> of <hi>Active Obedience</hi> in doing the Duties of the whole Law, and as wee are his <hi>prisoners,</hi> so wee owed unto him a Debt of <hi>passive obedience</hi> in suffering willingly and throughly the Curses of the Law. And under this Law Christ was made, to redeeme us by his fulfilling all that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse who were under the precepts and penalties of the Law our selves.<note place="margin">

            <p>The second Act in the worke of Christs Priesthood is the act of <hi>Application,</hi> or <hi>virtuall continuation</hi> of this Sacrifice to the end of the world; and that is in the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Christ</hi>; unto which there is prerequired a power and prevalency over all his enemies, to breake through the guilt of sinne, the Curse of the Law, and the chaines of death, with which it was impossible that hee should bee held. The vision which <hi>Moses</hi> had of the <hi>burning bush,</hi> was an excellent resemblance of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Christ. The Bush noted the Sacrifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fire, the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; the continuance and prevailing of the bush against the fire, the victorie of Christ and breaking through all those sufferings, which would utterly have devoured any other man. And this <hi>power</hi> of Christ was shewed in his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> wherein hee was declared to bee the <hi>Sonne of God with power, Rom.</hi> 1.4. and in his <hi>ascension</hi> when hee led all his <hi>Enemies captive, Eph.</hi> 4.8. and in his <hi>sitting at the right hand of God,</hi> farre above all principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. All which did make way to the presenting of his Sacrifice before the mercy-seate, which is the consummation thereof, and without which hee had not been a Priest. <hi>Wee have such an high Priest,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>as is set downe on the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens, for if hee were on earth hee should not bee a Priest, seeing that there are Priests which offer gifts according to the Law, Heb.</hi> 8.1.4. It was the same <hi>continued action,</hi> whereby the Priest did offer without the Holy place, and did then bring the bloud into the holiest of all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.11. For the reason why it was shed was to present it to the mercy-seate, and to shew it unto
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:16264:224"/>
the Lord there. So Christs act or office was not ended, nor fit to denominate him a complete Priest, till hee did enter with bloud, and present his offering in the holiest of all not made with hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. And therefore he had not been a Priest if hee should have continued on the earth, for there was another Priesthood there, which was not to give place but upon the accomplishment of his; for the whole figure was to passe away when the whole truth was come. Now Christs <hi>Oblation</hi> was the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the <hi>Truth</hi> prefigured in the Priests <hi>Sacrificing of the Beast,</hi> and his <hi>entrance into heaven</hi> was the <hi>Truth</hi> prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in the Priests carrying of the <hi>bloud into the holiest of all.</hi> And therefore both these were to bee accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, before the Leviticall Priesthood did give place.</p>
            <p>Here then it will bee needfull for the more full unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the <hi>Priesthood of Christ</hi> to open the Doctrine of his <hi>Intercession</hi> at the right hand of his Father. The Apostle calleth it the <hi>Appearing of Christ for us, Heb.</hi> 9.24. which is <hi>verbum forense,</hi> an expression borrowed from the custome of humane courts; for as in them when the plaintiffe or defendant is called, their <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As the high Priest went into the sanctuary with the names of the twelve Tribes upon his breast: so Christ entred into the holiest of all with our persons, and in our behalfe, in which respect the Apostle saith that he was <hi>Apprehended of Christ, Phil.</hi> 3.12. and that we doe <hi>sit together in heavenly places with him, Eph.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Merit,</hi> and <hi>Efficacie</hi> are the two things which set forth the vertue of Christs Sacrifice by which hee hath reconciled us to his Father. The <hi>Merit</hi> of Christ, being a <hi>Redundant merit,</hi> and having in it a plentifull redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:16264:224"/>
and a sufficient salvation, hath in it two things: First, there is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, an expiation, or <hi>satisfaction</hi> by way of <hi>price.</hi> Secondly, there is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an <hi>Inheritance</hi> by way of <hi>purchase,</hi> and <hi>acquisition, Eph.</hi> 1.14. Hee was made of a woman, <hi>made under the Law,</hi> for two ends, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that hee might <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme</hi> us from the curse under which wee lay, and that hee might purchase for us <hi>the inheritance</hi> which we had forfeited before; for so by <hi>adoption</hi> in that place I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand in a complexed and generall sense every good thing which belongs unto us in the right of our sonship with Christ, and that is the <hi>Inheritance of glory, Rom.</hi> 8.17.23. Now all this effected by the obedience of <hi>Christs death</hi>; for in that was the act of <hi>impetration</hi> or procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, consisting in the treaty betweene God and Christ. But there is yet further required an <hi>execution,</hi> a reall effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualnesse, and <hi>actuall application of these</hi> to us. As it must bee in <hi>regard of God</hi> a <hi>satisfaction</hi> and a <hi>purchase,</hi> so it must bee likewise in <hi>regard of us</hi> an actuall <hi>redemption</hi> and <hi>inheritance.</hi> And this is done by the <hi>intercession of Christ,</hi> which is the <hi>commemoration,</hi> or rather <hi>continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Sacrifice.</hi> He offered it but <hi>once,</hi> and yet hee is a Priest <hi>for ever,</hi> because the Sacrifice once offered doth for ever remaine before the mercy-seate. Thus as in many of the Legall Oblations there was first <hi>mactatio,</hi> and then <hi>Ostensio:</hi> First, the beast was slaine on the Altar, and then the bloud was together with incense brought before the mercy-seate, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.11-15.

<pb n="430" facs="tcp:16264:225"/>
his life did conferre redemption upon us. And therefore in the Scriptures our justification and salvation are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the <hi>Life of Christ.</hi> Hee was delivered for our offences, and <hi>Rose againe for our justification, Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>If Christ bee not raised your faith is vaine,</hi> you are yet in your sinnes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. Hee shall convince the world <hi>of righteousnesse, because I goe to my Father, Ioh.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Because I live you shall live also, Ioh.</hi> 14.19. If wee bee dead with Christ, wee beleeve that wee shall also <hi>live with him, Rom.</hi> 6.8. Being <hi>made perfect,</hi> or consecrated for ever, he became the Author of eternall salvation unto all them that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8.7.28. Hee is <hi>able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to save, because hee ever liveth, Heb.</hi> 7.25. Wee were reconciled in his death; but had he there rested, we could never have been acquitted nor entred in, for hee was to bee our forerunner. And therefore the Apostle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>much more</hi> to the Life of Christ. <hi>Much more being reconciled shall wee bee saved by his life, Rom.</hi> 5.10. Not in point of merit, but onely of efficacy for us; as in buying Land, the laying downe of the price giveth a man a <hi>meritorious interest,</hi> but the delivering of the deeds, the resigning of the propertie, the yeelding up of the possession giveth a man <hi>an actuall interest</hi> in that which hee hath purchased: so the death of Christ <hi>deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> but the intercession and life of Christ <hi>applieth</hi> sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto us. It was not barely Christs dying, but his <hi>Dying victoriously,</hi> so that it was impossible for death to hold him, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.24. which was the ground of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Hee could not justifie us, till hee was declared to bee justified himselfe; therefore the Apostle saith, that he was <hi>Iustified by the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. Namely by that Spirit, which quickned him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4.8.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. When Christ offered himselfe a Sacrifice for sinne, hee was <hi>numbred amongst transgressors, Mark.</hi> 15.28. Hee bare our sinnes along with him on the tree, and so died under the <hi>wrongs of men,</hi> and under the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> in
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:16264:225"/>
both respects as a <hi>guilty person</hi>; but when hee was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit of holinesse, he then threw off the sinnes of the world from his shoulder, and made it appeare that hee was a righteous person, and that his righteousnesse was the righteousnesse of the world. So then our faith and hope was begun in Christs death, but was finished in his life, he was the <hi>Author</hi> of it, by <hi>enduring the crosse,</hi> and hee was the <hi>finisher</hi> of it, by <hi>sitting downe on the right hand of the throne of God, Heb.</hi> 12.2. The Apostle summes up all together. <hi>It is God that justifieth, who is hee that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather that is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us, Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34.</p>
            <p>Now then to shew more distinctly the nature and excellencie of Christs <hi>Intercession:</hi> It consisteth in these particulars: First, his <hi>appearance,</hi> or the <hi>presenting of his person in our nature and in his owne,</hi> as a <hi>publick person,</hi> a <hi>mediator,</hi> a sponsor and a <hi>pledge</hi> for us; as <hi>Iuda</hi> was both a mediator to request, and a suretie to engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to beare the blame for ever with his Father for his brother <hi>Benjamin, Gen.</hi> 43.8, 9. And <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>Onesimus,</hi> a <hi>Mediator,</hi> I beseech thee for my Sonne <hi>Onesimus, Phil. v.</hi> 9, 10. And a <hi>sponsor,</hi> If hee hath wronged thee, or oweth the ought, put that on mine account, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay it, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19. So Christ is both a mediator and surety for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22.8.6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the presenting of his <hi>merits</hi> as a <hi>publike sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> for the debt of sinne, and as a <hi>publike price</hi> for the purchase of Glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y; for the Iustice of God was not to be intreated or pacified without a satisfaction; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where Christ is called an <hi>Advocate,</hi> hee is called a <hi>Propitiation</hi> too, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. Because hee doth not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for us, but in the right and vertue of the price which hee payed. For <hi>the Lord spared not his Sonne,</hi> but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him up for us all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. Hee dealt in the full rigour of his Iustice with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:16264:226"/>Thirdly, in the name of his person, and for the vigour and vertue of his merits, there is a presenting of his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,</hi> his <hi>will,</hi> his request, and interpellation for us, and so applying both unto us. <hi>Father, I will</hi> that they also whom thou hast given mee, be with me where I am, &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.24.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to all this doth answere the <hi>consent of the Father,</hi> in whose bosome hee is, <hi>who heareth him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, Ioh.</hi> 11.42. And in <hi>whom he is well pleased, Math.</hi> 17.5. Who called him to this office of being as it were Master of Requests in the behalfe of his Church, and promised to heare him in his petitions,<note place="margin">

In which sense the Apostle saith, that the bloud of Christ is a <hi>speaking</hi> or interceding <hi>Bloud, Heb.</hi> 12.24.</p>
            <p>By all which wee may observe the impiety of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:16264:226"/>
Doctrine, which distinguisheth between Mediators of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and Mediatores of <hi>Intercession,</hi> affirming that though the Saints are not redeemers of the world, yet they are (as the courtiers of heaven) Mediators of Intercession for us, and so may bee sought unto by us. To which I answer, that wee must distinguish of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, or praying for another. There is one <hi>private,</hi> and another <hi>publike,</hi> (which some learned men have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Christs owne Prayers:) or praying out of <hi>Charitie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cameron. de Eccl. pag</hi> 122.</note> and out of <hi>Iustice</hi> or <hi>Office:</hi> or thirdly, praying out of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,</hi> with feare and trembling, or out of <hi>Authoritie,</hi> which is not properly Prayer, (for <hi>Prayer</hi> in its strictest sense is a proposing of requests for things unmerited, which wee expect <hi>ex vi promissi</hi> out of Gods gratious promise, and not <hi>ex vi pretii,</hi> out of any price or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase;) but the <hi>presenting of the will and good pleasure of Christ to his Father,</hi> that hee may thereunto put his seale and consent, the desiring of a thing so, as that hee hath withall a right joyntly of bestowing it, who doth desire it. That the Saints in heaven, and the blessed Angels doe pray for the State of the Church militant, as well as rejoyce at their conversion, in as much as charity remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth after this life, seemeth to bee granted by <hi>Cyprian,</hi>

To bee such a <hi>mediator</hi> belongs onely to Christ, because <hi>True intercession</hi> (as it is a publike, and authoritative act) is founded upon the satisfactory merits of the person interceding. Hee cannot bee a right Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, who is not a propitiation too. And therefore the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:16264:227"/>
Papists are faine to venture so farre as to affirme that the intercession of the Saints with God for us is grounded upon the vertue of their owne merits.<note place="margin">

But this is a very wicked Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. First, because it shareth the Glory of Christ, and communicateth it to others. Secondly, because it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth Gods worship to others. Thirdly, because under pretence of modesty and humility; it bringeth in a cursed boldnesse to denie the faith, and driveth children from their Father unto servants, expressely therein gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying the Apostle, who biddeth us <hi>make our requests knowne to God, Phil.</hi> 4.6.

               <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. whereas one chiefe reason of turning to the Saints and Angels is because sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men must not <hi>dare</hi> to present themselves or their services unto God in their owne persons, but by the helpe of those Saints that are in more favour with God, and with whom they may bee bolder.</p>
            <p>Now from this Doctrine of Christs <hi>intercession</hi> many and great are the benefits which come unto the Church of God. As first, our <hi>fellowship</hi> with the Father and his Sonne; I pray for these, that as thou Father art in mee and I in thee, <hi>they also may bee one in us, Ioh.</hi> 17.21. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the gift of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> I will pray the Father, and hee <hi>shall give you another comforter,</hi> that hee may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.16, 17. all the comforts, and workings of the Spirit in our hearts, which wee enjoy are fruits of the <hi>intercession</hi> of Christ. Thirdly, <hi>protection</hi> against all our spirituall enemies. <hi>Who is he that condemneth?</hi> it is Christ that died, yea rather that is risen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, <hi>who also maketh intercession for us, Rom.</hi> 8.34. I pray that thou <hi>wouldst keepe them from the evill, Ioh.</hi> 17.15. But are not the faithfull subject to evils, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:16264:227"/>
and temptations still? how then is that part of the intercession of Christ made good unto us? for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hereof wee must know that the intercession of Christ is available to a faithfull man presently; but yet in a manner suteable and convenient to the present estate and condition of the Church, so that there may bee left roome for another life, and therefore wee must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all presently done. As the Sunne shineth on the Moone by leasurely degrees, till shee come to her full light; or as if the King grant a pardon to bee drawen; though the grant bee of the whole thing at once, yet it cannot bee written and sealed but word after word, and line after line, and action after action: so the grant of our holinesse is made unto Christ at first, but in the execution thereof, there is line upon line precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little; such an order by Christ observed in the distribution of his Spirit and grace, as is most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teable to a life of faith, and to the hope wee have of a better Kingdome. I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not, saith Christ unto <hi>Peter,</hi> yet wee see it did shake and totter, <hi>non rogavit ut ne deficeret, sed ut ne prorsus deficeret,</hi> the Prayer was not that there might be no fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at all, but that it might not utterly, and totally faile.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>assurance of our sitting in heavenly places.</hi> His sitting in heavenly places hath raised us up together and <hi>made sit with him, Eph.</hi> 2.6. First, because he sitteth there in our flesh. Secondly, because hee sitteth there in our behalfe. Thirdly, because hee sitteth there as our Center, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2. And so is neere unto us, <hi>natura, officio &amp; spiritu,</hi> by the unity of the same nature with us; by the quality of his office or Sponsorship for us; and by the Communion and fellowship of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Strength against our sins:</hi> for from his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in heaven, which is his Intercession; the Apostle inferres the <hi>writing of the Law in our hearts, Hebr.</hi> 8.4.6.9, 10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="436" facs="tcp:16264:228"/>Sixthly, the <hi>sanctification of our services:</hi> of which the Leviticall Priests were a type, who were to <hi>beare the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the holy things of the children of Israel,</hi> that they might be accepted, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. He is the Angell of the Covenant, who hath a golden Censer, to offer up the prayers of the Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3. There is a three-fold evill in man; First, an <hi>Evill of state</hi> or condition under the <hi>guilt of sinne.</hi> Secondly, an <hi>Evill of nature,</hi> under the <hi>corruption of sinne,</hi> and under the indisposition and inep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of all our faculties unto good. Thirdly, an <hi>Evill</hi> in all our <hi>services,</hi> by the <hi>adherencie of sin,</hi> for that which toucheth an uncleane thing, is made uncleane, and the best wine mixed with water, will lose much of its strength and native spirits. Now Christ by his <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and <hi>merits justifieth</hi> our <hi>persons</hi> from the guilt of sinne; and by his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> doth in measure <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> our <hi>faculties,</hi> and cure them of that corruption of sin which cleaves unto them. And lastly, by his <hi>incense</hi> and <hi>intercession</hi> doth cleanse our <hi>services,</hi> from the noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse and adherencie of sinne, so that in them the Lord smelleth a sweet savour; and so the Apostle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the contributions of the Saints towards his necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, and well pleasing unto God, Phil.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. And this is a benefit which runneth through the whole life of a Christian; all the ordinary workes of our calling (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of our service unto God, for in them we worke as servants to the same Master) are unto us sanctified, and to the Father made acceptable by the intercession of his Sonne, <hi>who hath made us Priests, to offer all our sacrifices with acceptance upon this Altar, Revel.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Esay</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>56.7.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, the <hi>Inward interpellation</hi> of the soule it selfe for it selfe, which is, as it were, the eccho of Christs intercession in our hearts: The <hi>Spirit maketh intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us with groanes which cannot be uttered, Rom.</hi> 8.26.
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:16264:228"/>
The same Spirit groaneth <hi>in us,</hi> and more fully and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly by Christ prayeth <hi>for us. These things I speake in the world,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves, Ioh.</hi> 17.13. that is, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, I have made this prayer in the world, and left a record and patterne of it in the Church, that they feeling the same heavenly desires kindled in their owne hearts, may bee comforted in the workings of that Spirit of prayer in them, which testifieth to their soules the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of that intercession which I shall make for them in heaven.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>Patience</hi> and unweariednesse in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: <hi>Let us runne with patience the race that is set before us,</hi> looking unto Jesus the Authour and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the Crosse, despising the shame, and <hi>is sate downe at the right hand of the Throne of God, Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>Confidence</hi> in our approches to the throne of Grace: <hi>Seeing then that we have a great high Priest that is passed into the heavens, Iesus the Sonne of God, let us hold fast our profession, and come boldly unto the throne of Grace, Heb.</hi> 4.14.—16. And againe, This man after hee had offered one Sacrifice for sinnes for ever, <hi>sate downe on the right hand of God,</hi> from hence-forth expecting till his enemies be made his foot-stoole: from whence the Apostle inferreth, <hi>Having therefore boldnesse to enter into the Holiest by the bloud of Iesus</hi>; and having an high Priest over the house of God, <hi>Let us draw neere with a true heart, in full assurance of faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12—23.</p>
            <p>And all these things are certaine to us in the vertue of this <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ: First, because the Father <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him, and answereth him, Ioh.</hi> 11.42.12.28. and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to this office, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5. Secondly, because the Father <hi>loveth us; I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himselfe loveth you, because you have loved me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.26, 27. Thirdly, because
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:16264:229"/>
as Christ hath a <hi>Prayer</hi> to intercede for us, so hath hee also a <hi>Power</hi> to conferre that upon us for which he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he shall give you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comforter, Ioh.</hi> 14.16. <hi>If I goe not away, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, Ioh.</hi> 16.7. That which Christ by his prayer obtained for us, by his power hee conferreth upon us; and therefore in the <hi>Psalme</hi> he is said to <hi>Receive gifts for men,</hi> noting the fruit of his intercession, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.18. and in the Apostle, <hi>to give gifts unto men,</hi> noting the power and fulnesse of his person, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.8. Having <hi>received</hi> of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath <hi>shed forth</hi> this which you now see and heare, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33. Thus great, and thus certaine are the benefits which come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church from the <hi>Intercession of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth thing inquired into about the Priesthood of Christ, was, what is the <hi>Vertue,</hi> and fruits thereof, and they may be all comprized in two general words: there is <hi>Solutio de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>its</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the paiment of our debt, and <hi>Redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia meriti,</hi> an overplus, and redundancie of merit. <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> whereby we are redeemed from under the Law; and an <hi>Acquisition,</hi> or purchase of an inheritance and priviledges for us. The obedience of Christ hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble relation in it, there is, first, <hi>Ratio legalis justitiae,</hi> the relation of a legall righteousnesse; as it beares exact and compleat conformitie to the Law, will, and decree of his Father. Secondly, there is <hi>ratio superlegalis meriti,</hi> the relation of a merit over and beyond the Law; for though it were <hi>nostrum debitum,</hi> that which we did necessarily owe, yet it was <hi>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m indebitum,</hi> that which of himselfe he was not bound unto, but by voluntary susception, and covenant with his Father, for it was the bloud and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of God himselfe.</p>
            <p>Here then first is to be considered his <hi>payment</hi> of that debt which we did owe unto God, in which respect he is said to <hi>Beare our sinnes.</hi> To <hi>beare</hi> sinne, is to have the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:16264:229"/>
burden of the guilt of sin and malediction of the Law to lye upon a man; so it is said, he that troubleth you, <hi>shall beare his judgement, Gal.</hi> 5.10.

               </gap>edemption that is in Jesus Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19—24.</p>
            <p>To open this point of <hi>Iustification by imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi>: We must note that two things are pre-required
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:16264:230"/>
to denominate a man a righteous man. First, there must be extant a <hi>righteousnesse</hi> which is apt and <hi>able to justifie.</hi> Secondly, there must be a right and <hi>propriety</hi> to it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it commeth to passe that it doth <hi>actually justifie.</hi> We must then first inquire what the righteousnesse is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man may be justified. <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> consisteth in a relation of <hi>rectitude and conformitie. God made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> but they have sought out many inventions, and turned into many crooked diverticles of their owne, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. A wicked man loveth <hi>crooked wayes,</hi> to wander up and downe in his owne course, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.22. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.16. whereas a righteous man loveth <hi>strait wayes, Heb.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.8. because righteousnesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in rectitude: and this presupposeth some <hi>Rule,</hi> unto which this conformitie must referre. The <hi>primitive</hi> and originall prototype, or <hi>Rule</hi> of holinesse, is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God himselfe, so farre-forth as his Image is communicable to the creature, or at least so farre forth as it was at the first implanted in man: <hi>Be yee perfect, as your father which is in heaven is perfect, Matth.</hi> 5.48. It is not meant of his infinite perfection, (for it was the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> to aime at being as God, in absolutenesse and independent excellencie) but of that perfection of his, which is in the Word, set forth unto us for an Image and patterne whereunto to conforme our selves. Therefore the <hi>secondary rule</hi> of righteousnesse, or rather the same rule unto us revealed, is the <hi>Law of God</hi> written in his Word, in the which Gods holinesse, so farre as it is our example, exhibiteth it selfe to the soule, as the Sun doth communicate its light thorow the beame which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes it. Now in the <hi>Law</hi> there are two things; one principall, <hi>Obedience</hi>; the other secondary, <hi>Malediction,</hi> upon supposition of disobedience: <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them, Gal.</hi> 3.10. So then, upon supposition of the sinne of man, two things are required
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:16264:231"/>
unto <hi>Iustification,</hi> the expiation of sin, by suffering the curse, and the fulfilling of righteousnesse <hi>de novo,</hi> againe. Man created might have beene justified by obedience onely, but man lapsed cannot otherwise appeare righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Gods sight, but by a double obedience, the one <hi>passive,</hi> for the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of his vindicative justice, as wee are his <hi>prisoners</hi>; the other <hi>active,</hi> in proportion to his remunerative justice, as we are his <hi>creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides this that there must be a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghteousnesse extant, there is required in the person to be justified or denominated thereby a <hi>propriety</hi> thereunto, that it may be <hi>His righteousnesse, Ier.</hi> 33.16. Now there may be a two-fold proprietie to righteousnesse, according to a two-fold manner of unitie. <hi>(Vnitas enim praestantis est fundamentum proprietatis ad officium praestitum)</hi> First, there is a <hi>personall</hi> and individuall <hi>unity,</hi> whereby a man is <hi>unus in se,</hi> one in and by himselfe, and so hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie to a dutie performed, because it is performed in his owne person, and by himselfe alone. Secondly, there is a <hi>common unity,</hi> whereby a man is <hi>unus cum alio,</hi> one with another, or whereby many are <hi>unum in aliquo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> one in and with some other thing which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and originall of them all. And this is the ground of <hi>Righteousnesse imputed</hi>; for in the Law a man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by performing intire obedience in his owne person, for the Law requireth righteousnesse to be performed by a created and implanted strength, and doth not put, suppose, or indulge any common principle thereof out of a mans selfe: Therefore legall righteousnesse is most properly called <hi>Our owne righteousnesse,</hi> and is set in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the righteousnesse of God, or that which is by grace imputed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. Wee see then that in this matter of imputation either of sinne or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, for the cleering of God from any injustice or partiality in his proceedings, there must ever bee some <hi>unity</hi> or other betweene the parties, he whose fact is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:16264:231"/>
and the other to whom it is imputed: It would be prodigious and against reason to conceive that the fall of Angels should be imputed unto men, becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e men had no unity in condition either of nature, or covenant with the Angels, as we have in both with <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>common unity</hi> is two-fold, either <hi>naturall,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us and <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom we were seminally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and originally represented; for otherwise than in and with <hi>Adam</hi> there could at the beginning be no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with mankinde, which should <hi>ex aequo</hi> reach unto all particular persons in all ages and places of the world: Or <hi>Voluntary,</hi> as betweene a man and his <hi>suretie,</hi> who, <hi>in conspectu fori,</hi> are but as <hi>one person.</hi> And this must be <hi>mutuall,</hi> the one party undertaking to doe for the other, and the other yeelding and consenting thereunto; as betweene us and Christ, for Christ volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily undertooke for us, and we by the Spirit of Christ are perswaded and made willing to consent, and by faith to cast our sins upon Christ, and to lay hold on him. And besides <hi>the will of the parties</hi> who are, the one by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, the other by compassion and suretiship engaged in the debt; there is required <hi>the will and consent of the Iudge,</hi> to whom the debt is due, and to whom it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the right of his jurisdiction, to appoint such a forme of proceeding for the recovery of his right, as may stand best with the honour of his person, and the satisfaction of his justice, who if he would, might in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour have refused any surety, and have exacted the whole debt of those very persons by whose onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault it grew. And thus it comes to passe that by grace we have fellowship with the second <hi>Adam,</hi> as by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the first, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45—48. So then betweene Christ and us there must be an <hi>unity,</hi> or else there can be no <hi>imputation.</hi> And therefore it is that we are said to be <hi>justified by faith,</hi> and that <hi>faith is imputed for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Rom.</hi> 4.5. not the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>credere,</hi> the act of beleeving,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:16264:232"/>
as if that were, <hi>in se,</hi> accounted righteousnesse, as it is a worke proceeding from us by grace; because it is <hi>Vincu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> and <hi>instrumentum unionis,</hi> the bond of union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us and Christ, and by that meanes makes way to the imputation of Christs righteousnesse unto us. Therefore we are said to be <hi>buried,</hi> and <hi>crucified</hi> in and with Christ, by the vertue of faith concorporating Christ and a Christian together, and communicating the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of his sufferings and resurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. <hi>If I be lifted up,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>I will draw all men after me; crucem conscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, &amp; me illuc adduxit,</hi> when Christ hanged on the crosse, we in a sort were there too. As in <hi>Adam</hi> we were all in Paradise, by a naturall and seminall vertue; so in Christ by a spiritual vertue, wherby in due time faith was to be begotten in us, and so we to have an actuall being of grace from him, as after our reall existence we have an actuall being of nature from <hi>Adam.</hi> Thus wee see that Christ did for us fulfill all righteousnesse, by his passive meriting and making satisfaction unto the remission of sinnes. By his active, covering our inabilities, and doing that in perfection for us, which we could not doe for our selves. First, he suffered <hi>our punishment,</hi> he was <hi>woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our transgression, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed, Esay</hi> 53.5. If it be here objected, that an innocent person ought not to suffer for a nocent, for guilt is inseparable from sinne; <hi>The son shall not beare the iniquitie of his father, neither shall the father beare the iniquitie of the sonne, the soule that sinneth the same shall die, Ezek.</hi> 18.20. For the cleering of this objection, we must note that there is a two-fold manner of guilt (as I before touched) either such as growes out of <hi>sinne inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> which is the <hi>deserving of punishment,</hi> as it is in us: or such as growes out of <hi>sinne imputed,</hi> and that not by reason of union naturall, as the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne is
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:16264:232"/>
imputed unto us (which manner of imputation is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>funda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>entum demeriti,</hi> and causeth us to deserve punishment) but <hi>voluntary</hi> by way of <hi>vadimony and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</hi> And so guilt is onely a free and willing obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse unto that punishment which another hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. Amongst sinfull men it is true that the sonne shall not beare the punishment of the fathers sinne: first, because he is altogether personally distinct. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because he is not appointed so to doe, as Christ was, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.18. Thirdly, because hee is not able to beare them, so as to take them off from his father as Christ did ours: He was himselfe able to stand under our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without sinking, and was able by suffering them, to take them off from us, because his person was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable in dignitie, and therefore (by the grace of God, and the act of his Divine jurisdiction in ordering the way to his owne satisfaction) equivalent in justice unto all ours. Fourthly, because he hath alreadie too many of his owne to beare. But yet, if the wil of the son goe along with the father in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sinning, it is not strange, nor unusuall for him to suffer for his fathers and his owne sin together, as for the <hi>continuation</hi> of the same offence; because, though hee doe not will the punishment, (as Christ did ours) yet imitating and continuing the sin, there is <hi>Volitum in causa,</hi> for the punishment too.</p>
            <p>Now for an answer and resolution of the question,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Grot. de satisfactione Christi, cap.</hi> 4, 5.</note> whether an innocent person may suffer for a nocent, wee must note first that God out of his Dominion over all things, may cast paines upon an innocent person, as it is manifest he did upon Christ: And what ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint could any creature have against God, if he should have created it in fire, and made the place of its habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the instrument of its paine?

               </note> thus is a commonwealth universally sinfull, a few righteous men may as parts of that sinfull society be justly subject to those temporary evils which the sinnes of the society have contracted, and the people may justly suffer for the sinnes of the Princes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. and hee for theirs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.25. secondly, <hi>Naturall,</hi> as betweene parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, so the Lord visited the sinnes of <hi>Dathan</hi> upon his little ones, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.27.33. thirdly, <hi>Mysticall</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and wife, so the Lord punished the sinnes of <hi>Amaziah</hi> the priest of Bethel by giving over his wife unto whoredome, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.17. and wee see in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the husband is liable to be charged and censured for the exorbitancies of his wife; fourthly, <hi>Stipulatory</hi> and by <hi>consent,</hi> as in the case of <hi>fidejussores</hi> or <hi>obsides,</hi> who are punished for the sinnes of others whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and in whose place they stand as a caution and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment against injuries which might be feared, as we see in the parable of the prisoner committed to the custody of another person, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.39-42. fifthly, <hi>Possesso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
               <pb n="448" facs="tcp:16264:234"/>
as betweene a man and his goods, and so wee finde that a man was to offer no beast for a sinne offering but that which was <hi>his owne, Levit.</hi> 5.6, 7. Now in all these respects there was in some manner conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us and Christ, He conversed amongst men, and was a member of that Tribe and society amongst whom he lived, and therefore was together with them under that Romane yoke which was then upon the people, and in that relation paid tribute unto <hi>Caesar:</hi> hee had the nature and seed of man and so was subject to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and naturall infirmities without sinne: Hee was mystically married unto his Church, and therefore was answerable for the debts and misdemeanours of the Church. He entred into covenant, and became suretie for man, and therefore was liable to mans engagements. Lastly, hee became the possession, in some sort, of his Church: whence it is that we are said to receive him, and to have him, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.12. not by way of <hi>Dominion</hi> (for so we are his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19.) but by way of <hi>communion and propriety</hi>; and therefore though wee cannot offer him up unto God in sacrifice for our sinnes, yet we may in our faith and prayers shew him unto his Father, and hold him up as our owne armour and fence against the wrath of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is required in the innocent person suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, that he have a <hi>free and full dominion</hi> over that from which hee parteth, in his suffering for another. As in suretiship, a man hath free dominion over his money, and therefore in that respect he may engage himselfe to pay another mans debt; but he hath not a free dominion over himselfe or his owne life, and therefore he may not part with a member of his owne in commutation for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others, (as <hi>Zaleucus</hi> did for his sonne) nor be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to lay downe his owne life for the delivering of another from death, except in such cases as the Word of God li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth and alloweth. But Christ was Lord of his owne
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:16264:234"/>
life, and had therefore power to lay it downe and to take it up. And this power he had (though he were in all points subject to the Law as we are) not solely by vertue of the hypostaticall union, which did not for the time exempt him from any of the obligations of the Law, but by vertue of a particular command, constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and designation to that service of laying downe his life. <hi>This commandement have I received of my Father, Ioh.</hi> 10.18.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it is required that this Power be ample enough to breake thorow the sufferings he undertaketh, and to re-assume his life, and former condition againe. <hi>I have power to lay it downe, and I have power to take it up.</hi> So then the summe of all is this; by the most just, wise, and mercifull will of God, by his owne most obedient and voluntary susception, Christ Jesus, being one with us in a manifold and most secret union, and having full power to lay downe, and to take up his life againe by speciall command and allowance of his Father given him, did most justly, without injury to himselfe, or dishonour to, or injustice in his Father, suffer the punishment of their sinnes, with whom he had so neere an union, and who could not themselves have suffred them with obedience in their owne persons, or with so much glory to Gods justice, mercy and wisdome.</p>
            <p>If it be here againe objected, that sin in the Scripture is said to be <hi>pardoned,</hi> which seems contrary to this pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and satisfaction. To answer this, wee must note, first, that in the rigour of the Law, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xa seq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itur ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put,</hi> the delinquent himselfe is in person to suffer the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie denounced, for the Law is, In the day that <hi>Thou</hi> eatest <hi>thou shalt dye</hi>; and the soule that sinneth <hi>it shall die.</hi> Every man shall beare his <hi>owne burthen, Gal.</hi> 6.5. So that the Law, as it stands in its owne rigour, doth not admit of any commutation, or substitution of one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Secondly, therefore, that another person suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:16264:235"/>
may procure a discharge to the person guilty, and be valide to free him, the will, consent and mercy of him to whom the infliction of the punishment belongeth must concurre, and his over-ruling power must dispence, though not with the substance of the Lawes demands, yet with the manner of execution, and with that rigour, which bindes wrath peremptorily upon the head onely of him that hath deserved it. So then wee see both these things doe sweetly concurre; first, a precedent satisfaction by paying the debt; and yet secondly, a true pardon and remission thereof to that partie which should have paid it, and out of mercy towards him, a dispencing with the rigor of that Law, which in strictnesse would not admit any other to pay it for him.</p>
            <p>Thus wee see how Christ hath suffered our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, hee <hi>did all obedience,</hi> and fulfilled all actions of righteousnesse for us; <hi>for such an high Priest became us who is holy, harmelesse, undefiled, separate from sinners, Heb.</hi> 7.26. Hee came not into the world but for us, and therefore hee neither suffered, nor did any thing but for us. As the colour of the glasse is by the favor of the Sunne-beame shining through it made the color of the wall, not inherent in it, but relucent upon it, by an extrinsecall affection: so the righteousnesse of Christ by the favor of God is so <hi>imputed unto us,</hi> as that wee are <hi>quoad gratiosum Dei conspectum,</hi> righteous too. In which sense I understand those words, <hi>Hee hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held iniquitie in Iacob, neither hath he seen perversenesse in Israel, Num.</hi> 23.21. Though it is indeed in him, yet the Lord looketh on him as cloathed with the righteousnesse of Christ, and so is said not to see it, as the eye seeth the color of the glasse in the wall, and therefore cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that other inherent color of its owne, which yet it knoweth to bee in it.</p>
            <p>Now of this Doctrine of <hi>Iustification by Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse imputed</hi> wee may make a <hi>double use.</hi> First, it
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:16264:235"/>
may teach us that great dutie of <hi>selfe-deniall</hi>; wee see no righteousnesse will justifie us but Christs, and his will not consist but with the deniall of our owne. And surely what-ever the professions of men in word may bee, there is not any one dutie in all Christian Religion of more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie than this, to trust Christ onely with our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To doe holy duties of hearing, reading, praying, meditating, almesgiving, or any other actions of charity or devotion, and yet still to abhorre our selves and our workes, to esteeme our selves after wee have done all, unprofitable servants, and worthy of many st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ipes: to doe good things, and not to rest in them; to owne the shame and dung of our solemne services: when we have done all the good workes wee can, to say with <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, Remember mee,</hi> ô my God, concerning this, <hi>and spare me according to the greatnesse of thy mercie, Nehem.</hi> 13.22. and with <hi>David, To thee ô Lord, belongeth mercie, for thou renderest to every man according to his worke, Psal.</hi> 62.12. It is thy mercy to reward us according to the uprightnesse of our workes, who mightest in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confound us for the imperfection of our workes. To give God the praise of our working, and to take to ourselves the shame of polluting his workes in us. There is no Doctrine so diametrally contrary to the merits of Christ, and the redemption of the world thereby, as justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by workes. No Papist in the world is or can bee more contentious for good workes than wee both in our Doctrine and in our prayers, and in our exhortations to the people. We say no faith justifieth us before God but <hi>a working faith,</hi> no man is righteous in the sight of men, nor to bee so esteemed, but by <hi>workes of holinesse; without holinesse</hi> no man shall see God, hee that is Christs is <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good workes,</hi> purifieth himselfe even as hee is pure, and walketh as hee did in this world. Here onely is the difference; we <hi>doe them,</hi> because they are our <hi>Dutie,</hi> and testifications of our love and thankfulnesse to Christ, and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:16264:236"/>
of the workings of his Spirit in our hearts; but wee <hi>dare not trust in them,</hi> as that by which wee hope to stand or fall before the tribunall of Gods Iustice, because they are at best mingled with our corruptions, and therefore doe themselves stand in need of a high Priest to take off their iniquity. Wee know enough in Christ to depend on, we never can finde enough in our selves. And this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence wee have, if God would ever have had us justified by workes, hee would have given us grace enough to fulfill the whole Law, and not have left a Prayer upon publike record for us every day to repeat, and to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all our owne Prayers by, <hi>forgive us our trespasses.</hi> For how dares that man say, I shall be justified by my workes, who must every day say, <hi>Lord forgive mee my sinnes, and bee mercifull unto mee a sinner.</hi> Nay though wee could fulfill the whole Law perfectly, yet from the guilt of sinnes formerly contracted wee could no other way bee justified, than by laying hold by faith on the satisfaction and sufferings of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it may teach us <hi>confidence</hi> against all sinnes, corruptions, and temptations. <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, &amp;c.</hi> Satan is the blackest enemie, and sinne is the worst thing hee can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage against mee, or my soule is or can bee subject unto; for <hi>Hell is not so evill as sinne.</hi> In as much as Hell is of Gods making, but sinne onely of mine. Hell is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mee, but sinne is committed against God. Now I know Christ came to destroy the workes, and to answer the arguments and reasonings of the Devill. Thou canst not stand before God, saith Satan, for thou art a grievous sinner, and he is a devouring fire. But faith can answere, Christ is able both to cover and to cure my sinne, to make it vanish as a miste, and to put it as farre out of mine owne sight, as the East is from the West. But thou hast nothing to doe with Christ, thy sinnes are so many and
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:16264:236"/>
so foule; surely the bloud of Christ is more acceptable to my soule, and much more honourable and pretious in it selfe, when it covereth a multitude of sinnes. <hi>Paul</hi> was a persecutor, a Blasphemer, and injurious, the greatest of all sinners, and yet hee obtained mercy, that hee might be for a patterne of all long-suffering to those that should after beleeve in Christ. If I had as much sinne upon my soule as thou hast, yet faith could unlade them all upon Christ, &amp; Christ could swallow them all up in his mercy. But thou hast still nothing to doe with him, because thou continuest in thy sinne. But doth hee not call mee, invite me, beseech mee, command me to come unto him? If then I have a heart to answer his call, hee hath a hand to draw me to himselfe, though all the gates of Hell, and powers of darknesse, or sinnes of the world stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene. But thou obeyest not this call. True indeed and pittifull it is, that I am dull of hearing, and slow of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the voice of Christ, I want much faith: but yet Lord thou dost not use, to quench the smoaking flax, or to breake the bruized reed; I beleeve, and thou art able to helpe mine unbeleefe. I am resolved to venture my soule upon thy mercy, to throw away all mine owne loading, and to cleave onely to this planck of salvation. But faith purifieth the heart, whereas thou art uncleane still. True indeed, and miserable man I am therefore, that the motions of sinne doe worke in my members. But yet Lord I hate every false heart; I delight in thy Law with mine innerman, I doe that which I would not, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to thy Law that it is good, I desire to know thy will, to feare thy name, &amp; to follow thee whithersoever thou leadest mee. But these are but emptie velleities, the wishings and wouldings of an evill heart. Lord to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the shame of my failings, but to thee belongeth the glory of thy mercy and forgivenesse. Too true it is that I doe not all I should: but doe I allow my selfe in any thing that I should not? doe I make use of mine infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:16264:237"/>
to justifie my selfe by them, or shelter my selfe under them, or dispence with my selfe in them? though I doe not the things I should, yet I love them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, my heart, and Spirit, and all the desires of my soule are towards them; I hate, abhorre, and fight with my selfe for not doing them. I am ashamed of mine infirmities, as the blemishes of my profession, I am weary of them, and groane under them as the burdens of my soule: I have no lust, but I am willing to know it, and when I know, to crucifie it. I heare of no further measure of grace, but I admire it, and hunger after it, and presse on to it. I can take Christ and affliction, Christ and persecution together. I can take Christ without the world, I can take Christ without my selfe. I have no unjust gaine, but I am ready to restore it. No time have I lost by earthly businesse from Gods service, but I am ready to redeeme it. I have followed no sinfull pleasure, but I am ready to abandon it, no evill company but I mightily abhorre it. I never sware an oath, but I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it with a bleeding conscience; I never neglected a duty but I can recount it with revenge and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I doe not in any man see the Image of Christ, but I love him the more dearly for it, and abhorre my selfe for being so much unlike it. I know, Satan, I shall speed never the worse with God, because I have thee for mine enemie. I know I shall speed much the better, because I have my selfe for mine enemie. Certainly hee that can take Christ offer'd, that can in all points admit him, as well to purifie as to justifie, as well to rule as save, as well his grace as his mercie, neede not feare all the powers of darknesse, nor all the armies of the foulest sinnes which Satan can charge his conscience withall.</p>
            <p>The second great vertue and fruit of the Priesthood of Christ was <hi>ex redundantia meriti,</hi> from the redundancy and overflowing of his merit. First, hee doth <hi>merit to have a Church</hi>; for the very being of the Church is the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:16264:237"/>
effect of that great price which he payed; therefore the Church is called a <hi>purchased people,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Ask of mee, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, Psal.</hi> 2.8. when hee made his soule an offering for sinne, hee did by that meanes see his seed, and divide a portion with the great, <hi>Esai.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12. The delivering and selecting of the Saints out of this present evill world was the end of Christs Sacrifice, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. Secondly, hee did <hi>merit all such good things</hi> for the Church, as the great love of himselfe and his Father towards the Church did resolve to conferre upon it. They may I conceive be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to two heads: First, <hi>Immunitie from evill,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is left to bee removed after the payment of our debt, or taking off from us the guilt, and obligation unto punishment. Such are the <hi>Dominion of Sinne. Sinne shall not have dominion over you, Rom.</hi> 6.14. The <hi>Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Iesus, hath made mee free from the Law of Sinne and of Death, Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>He that committeth sinne is the servant of sinne; but if the Sonne shall make you free, you shall bee free indeed, Ioh.</hi> 8.34-36. <hi>Hee that is borne of God doth not commit sinne,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9. That is, he is not an artificer of sinne, one that maketh it his trade and profession, and therefore bringeth it to any perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Hee hath received a <hi>Spirit of Iudgement,</hi> that chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth up his lusts, and a <hi>Spirit of burning,</hi> which worketh out his drosse, <hi>Esai.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2. Such is, The <hi>Vanity of our Minde,</hi> whereby wee are naturally unable to thinke, or to cherish a good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17. The <hi>Ignorance, and hardnesse of our hearts,</hi> unable to perceive, or delight in any spirituall thing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24, 25.45. The <hi>Spirit of disobedience and</hi> habituall strangenesse and aversenesse from God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Iob</hi> 20.14. Such are also all those <hi>slavish, affrightfull, and contumacious effects of the Law in</hi> terrifying the conscience, irritating the concupiscence, and compelling the froward heart to an unwilling and
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:16264:238"/>
unwelcome conformitie. The Law is now made our counseller, a delight to the inner man, that which was a lion before, hath now food and sweetnesse in it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Many Priviledges</hi> and dignities in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that principall and generall one, which is our <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie unto Christ</hi>; from whence by the fellowship of his holy and quickning Spirit, wee have an <hi>unction</hi> which teacheth us his wayes, and his voyce, which <hi>sanctifieth our nature,</hi> by the participation of the divine nature, that is, by the renewing of Gods most holy and righteous Image in us. Which <hi>sanctifieth our Persons,</hi> that they may bee spirituall Kings and Priests. <hi>Kings,</hi> to order our owne thoughts, affections, desires, studies towards him, to fight with principalities, powers, corruptions, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies. <hi>Priests,</hi> to offer up our bodies, soules, prayers, thanksgivings, almes, spirituall services upon that Altar, which is before his mercy-seate, and to slay and mortifie our lusts and earthly members; which <hi>sanctifieth all our actions,</hi> that they may bee services to him and his Church, acceptable to him, and profitable to others. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from this unity with him growes <hi>our adoption,</hi> which is another fruit of his Sacrifice. Hee was made of a woman, made under the Law, that wee might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>The Adoption of Sonnes, Gal.</hi> 4.5. By which wee have free accesse to call upon God in the vertue of his Sacrifice, sure supplies in all our wants, because our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father knoweth all our needs, a most certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and salvation in hope; for we are already <hi>saved by hope, Rom.</hi> 8.24. and Christ is to us the <hi>Hope of Glory, Col.</hi> 1.27. Lastly, there is from hence <hi>our exaltation,</hi> in our finall victory and resurrection, by the fellowship and vertue of his victory over death, as the first fruits of ours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20.49. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. And in our complete sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, being carried in our soules and bodies to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to himselfe without spot and blamelesse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26, 27. and to bee brought unto God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. Now
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:16264:238"/>
to take all in one view, what a summe of mercy is here together. Remission of all sinnes, discharge of all debts, deliverance from all curses; joy, peace, triumph, security, exaltation above all evils, enemies, or feares; a peculiar, purchased, roiall seed, (the gift of God the Father to his Sonne) deliverance from the dominion and service of all sinne, vanity, ignorance, hardnesse, disobedience, bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, coaction, terror; sanctification of our persons, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, lives, actions; adoption, hope, victory, resurrection, salvation, glory. O what a price was that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it? O what manner of persons ought we to bee for whom it was procured?</p>
            <p>The fifth thing to be spoken of about the Priesthood of Christ I shall dispatch in one word, which is the <hi>Duty</hi> wee owe upon all this. First, then wee should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive so great a grace in vaine, but by faith lay hold upon it, and make use of it. <hi>Let us feare,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>lest a promise being left us, of entring into his rest, any of you should seeme to come short of it; for unto us was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell preached as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it, Heb.</hi> 4.1, 2. God in Christ is but <hi>reconcileable</hi> unto us, <hi>One with us in his good will,</hi> and in his procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of peace. When two parties are at variance, there is no actuall peace without the mutuall consent of both againe; till wee by faith give our consent, and actually turne unto God, and seeke his favor, and lay hold on the mercy which is set before us; though God be one, in that hee sendeth a mediator, and maketh tender of reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with us, yet this grace of his is to us in vaine, because wee continue his enemies still. The Sunne is set in the heavens for a publike light, yet it benefiteth none but those who open their eyes, to admit and make use of its light. A court of justice or equity is a publike sanctuary, yet it actually relieveth none but those that seek unto it. Christ is a publike and universall salvation, set up for all
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:16264:239"/>
comers, and appliable to all particulars, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. Hee is not willing that any should perish, but <hi>that all should come to repentance,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Hee tasted death for every man, Heb.</hi> 2.9. But all this is not beneficiall unto life, but onely to those that receive him. Onely those that receive him are by these mercies of his made the Sonnes of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. without faith they abide his enemies still. God in Christ publisheth himselfe a God of peace and unity towards us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. And setteth forth Christ as an all-sufficient treasure of mercy to all that in the sense of their owne misery will fly unto him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. But till men beleeve, and are thus willing to yeeld their owne consents, and to meete his reconciliation towards them, with theirs towards him, his wrath abideth upon them still; for by beleeving onely he will have his sonnes death <hi>actually effectuall,</hi> though it were <hi>sufficient</hi> before. O therefore let us not venture to beare the wrath of God, the curse of sinne, the weight of the Law, upon our owne shoulders, when wee have so present a remedie, and so willing a friend at hand to ease us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we should labour to feele the vertue of the Priesthood and Sacrifice of Christ working in us, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our consciences from dead workes, renewing our nature, cleansing us from the power and pollution of sinne; for when by the hand of faith, and the sweete ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit wee are therewithall sprinkled, wee shall then make it all our study to hate, and to forbeare sinne, which squeezed out so pretious bloud, and wrung such bitter cries from so mercifull a high Priest; to live no longer to our selves, that is, <hi>secundum hominem,</hi> as men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.7. After our owne lusts and wayes: but (as men that are not their owne, but his that bought them,) to live in his service, and to his glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2. All that wee can doe is too little to answere so great love. Love to emptie himselfe, to humble himselfe, to bee God in the flesh, to bee God

on a Crosse, to take off from us the hatred, fury and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of his Father, to restore us to our primitive purity &amp; condition againe. Why should it be esteemed a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thing to bee most rigorously conscionable, &amp; exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumspect, in such a service as unto which wee are engaged with so infinite, and unsearchable bounty? Hee payed our debt to the uttermost farthing, drunk every drop of our bitter Cup, and saved us <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>throughly:</hi> why should not wee labour to performe his service, and to fulfill every one of his most sweete commands to the uttermost too?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, wee should learne to walke before him with all reverence and feare, as men that have received a Kingdome which cannot bee moved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. And with frequent consideration of the high Priest of our profession, that we may not in presumption of his mercy, harden our hearts, or depart from God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1.8. But in due remembrance of the end of his Sacrifice, which was to purchase to himselfe a peculiar people, be zealous of all good workes, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we should learne confidence and boldnesse towards him, who is a great, a faithfull, and a mercifull high Priest; this use the Apostle makes of it. <hi>Seeing we have a great high Priest-let us hold fast our profession-and come with boldnesse unto the throne of grace, Heb.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16. And againe, <hi>Having therefore boldnesse to enter into the holiest by the bloud of Iesus-and having an high Priest over the house of God, let us draw neere with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 10.19-22.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, wee learne perseverance and stedfastnesse in our profession, because he is able to carry u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> through and save us to the uttermost. This is that which indeed makes us partakers of Christ. <hi>Wee are made partakers of him, if wee hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast to the end, Heb.</hi> 3.14. The considering of him, of his perseverance in finishing his owne worke, and our faith, and his power
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:16264:240"/>
and ability to save us to the uttermost, will keepe us from fainting in our service and the profession we have taken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, 3.10.23.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, we have hereby accesse to present our prayers, and all our spirituall Sacrifices upon this Altar, sprinkled with the bloud of that great Sacrifice, and liberty to come unto God by him who liveth to make intercession for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>In him wee have accesse with confidence by faith, Eph.</hi> 3.12. Therefore the Lord is said to have his <hi>eyes open to our Prayers, to hearken unto them,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 8.52. Because hee first looketh upon our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in Christ, before hee receiveth or admitteth any of our services.</p>
            <p>Lastly, wee ought frequently to celebrate the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and to commemorate the Benefits of this Sacrifice wherein God hath been so much glorified, and wee so wonderfully saved. Therefore the Lord hath of purpose instituted a sacred ordinance in his Church, in the roome of the Paschall Lambe, that as that was a prefiguration of Christs death expected, so this should to all ages of the Church bee a resemblance and commemoration of the same exhibited. <hi>So often as yee eate this Bread, and drinke this Cup, yee shew forth the Lords death till hee come,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. For in the ordinances hee is <hi>crucified before our eyes, Gal.</hi> 3.1. Therefore the Apostle more than once inferres from the consideration of this Sacrifice and office of Christ, our dutie of not forsaking the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Saints, and of exhorting and provoking one another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13.10.24, 25.</p>
            <p>Now I proceed to the last thing mentioned in the words concerning the Priest-hood of Christ, and that is about the <hi>Order of it. Thou art a Priest [for ever after the Order of Melchisedek.] Secundum verbum,</hi> or <hi>secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum morem &amp; rationem:</hi> the Apostle readeth it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, according to the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Melchisedeks</hi> Priesthood. Of this <hi>Melchisedek,</hi> wee finde mention made but in two
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:16264:240"/>
places onely of the whole Old Testament, and in both very briefly; the first in the History of <hi>Abraham</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the slaughter of the Kings, when <hi>Melchisedek,</hi> being the Priest of the most high God, brought forth bread and wine, and blessed him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18, 19, 20. and the other in this place. And for this cause the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, and his <hi>Order</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>hard to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, Heb.</hi> 5.11. It was so then, and so it would bee still, if <hi>S. Paul</hi> had not cleered the difficulties, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wherin the Type and the Antitype did fully answere; which hee hath largely done in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>For understanding and cleering the particulars which are herein considerable,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Cameron Quaest. in Hebr.</hi>
               </note> here are some questions which offer themselves. First, who <hi>Melchisedek</hi> was? Secondly, what is meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his Order? Thirdly, why Christ was to bee a Priest after his Order, and not after <hi>Aarons?</hi> Fourthly, why hee brought forth bread and wine?

palace of <hi>Melchisedek</hi> were in his dayes conceived to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. Tedious I might be in insisting on this point who <hi>Melchisedek</hi> was. But when I finde the Holy Ghost purposely concealing his name, genealogie, beginning, ending, and descent, and that to speciall purpose; I cannot but wonder that men should toile themselves in the darke to finde out that of which they have not the least ground of solide conjecture, and the inevidence whereof is expressely recorded, to make <hi>Melchisedek</hi> thereby the fitter type of Christs everlasting Priesthood.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what is meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> It is as much as the state, condition, or prescribed Rule of <hi>Melchisedek</hi>; and that was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>After the power of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse life, Heb.</hi> 7.16. Not by a corporeall unction, legall ceremony, or the intervening act of a humane ordination: but by a heavenly institution, and immediate unction of the Spirit of Life, by that extraordinary manner whereby hee was to bee both King and Priest unto God, as <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedek</hi> was.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Why was hee not a Priest after the order of <hi>Aaron?</hi> The Apostle giveth us an answere, <hi>Because the Law made nothing perfect,</hi> but was <hi>weake and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> and therefore was to bee abolished, and to give place to another Priesthood. Men were not to rest in it, but by it to bee led to him who was to abolish it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.11, 12. as the morning-starre leadeth to the sunne, and at the rising thereof vanisheth. The ministery and promises of Christ were <hi>better</hi> than those of the Law; and therefore his Priest-hood, which was the office of dispencing them, was to be <hi>more excellent</hi> likewise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8 6. For when the Law and covenant were to bee abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, the Priesthood in which they were established, was to die likewise.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Why <hi>Melchisedek</hi> brought forth bread and wine? The Papists, that they may have something to build the idolatry of their masse upon, make <hi>Melchisedek</hi>
               <pb n="463" facs="tcp:16264:241"/>
to <hi>Sacrifice bread and wine,</hi> as a Type of the Eucharist. I will not fall into so tedious a controversie, as no way tending to edification, and infinite litigations there have been between the parts already about it. In one word; Wee grant that the Ancients doe frequently make it <hi>a Type of the Eucharist</hi> but onely by way of <hi>allusion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Glass. Philolog. Sacra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pag</hi> 423.</note> not of <hi>literall prediction,</hi> or <hi>strict prefiguration</hi>; as that, out of Egypt have I called my Sonne, and in Rama was there a voyce heard, which were literally and historically true in another sense, are yet by way of allusion applied by the Evangelist unto the History of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.15.18. But wee may note; first, it is not <hi>Sacrificavit,</hi> but <hi>Protulit,</hi> hee brought it forth, he did not offer it up.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Loco suprà ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato.</hi>
               </note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he brought it forth to <hi>Abraham</hi> as <hi>a Prince</hi> to entertaine him after his conquest, as <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and from him <hi>Cajetan</hi> understand it; not as a Priest to God. Thirdly, hee, if hee did offer, he offered bread and wine truely, these men, onely the lying shapes thereof, and not bread and wine it selfe which they say are transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated into another thing. Fourthly, the Priest-hood of <hi>Melchisedek</hi> as Type, and of Christ as the substance, was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Priesthood which could not passe unto any other either as successor or vicar to one or the other, and it was onely by divine and immediate unction; but the Papists make themselves Priests by humane and ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall ordination to offer that which they say <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedek</hi> offered; and by that meanes most insolently make themselves either successors, or vicars, or sharers, and co-partners and workers together with him and his Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, Christ Iesus, in the offices of such a Priesthood as was totally uncommunicable, and intransient, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24. and so most sacril<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>giously rob him of that honor which hee hath assumed to himselfe as his peculiar office.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, what kinde of blessing it was wherewith <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedek</hi> blessed <hi>Abraham?</hi> To this I answer, that there is a <hi>twofold Benediction.</hi> The one <hi>Charitativa,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

love, and so any man may blesse another by way of eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation or well wishing: <hi>The blessing of the Lord bee upon you, we blesse you in the name of the Lord, Psal.</hi> 129.8. the other <hi>Autoritativa,</hi> as a King, a Priest, an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary superiour and publike person, by a way of office, and to the purpose of effecting, and reall conveying the blessing it selfe desired: <hi>without all contradiction,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>the lesse is blessed of the greater, Hebr.</hi> 7.7. and such was this of <hi>Melchisedek. Benedictio obsignans,</hi> a seale, assurance, and effectuall confirmation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise before made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, in what manner he received Tithes? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer with <hi>Calvin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quod debebat Abraham Deo, solvit in manum Melchisedec.

Since gifts, <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> gifts, though they prove not a generall inferioritie in him that receives them, yet they prove that in that case there is something which may be imputed, and which deserves acknowledgement. But in this particular all the acknowledgements are from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Melchisedek.</hi> Besides, nothing was here by <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Melchisedek</hi> done after an arbitrary manner, but <hi>Extraordinario spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus afflatu &amp; ex officio,</hi> on both sides, as learned <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> hath observed.</p>
            <p>Lastly, in what sense hee was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. without father, mother, or genealogie? I answer with <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Chrysost.</hi>
               </note> that it is not meant literally and strictly; but onely the Scripture takes notice of him as an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary man, without signifying his line, beginning, end, or race, (as <hi>Tiberius</hi> said of <hi>Rufus,</hi> that he was <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo ex se natus</hi>) that so he might be the fitter to typifie Christs person and excellencie in whom those things were really true, which are onely <hi>quoad nos,</hi> spoken of the type, of whose beginning, end, or parentage, wee
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:16264:242"/>
neither have, nor can have any knowledge. These things thus premised, it will bee easie for you to preoccupate those observations, which grow betweene the Type and the Antitype, which therefore I will but cursorily propose.</p>
            <p>Note, first, that Christs Priesthood is such as did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a kingdome with it, for <hi>Melchisedek</hi> was King of <hi>Salem, and Priest of the most high God.</hi>] This, Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> and from him <hi>Ambrose,</hi> report to have been meant by the <hi>order of Melchisedek,</hi> namely, <hi>Regale Sacerdoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> that Christ was to be a <hi>Royall Priest.</hi> By way of merit purchasing a kingdome of his Father, and by way of conquest recovering it to himselfe out of the hands of his enemies; this mystery was obscurely intimated, in the marriages allowed between the regall and sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall tribes of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> which confusion was in the other Tribes interdicted, as I have before observed.</p>
            <p>Note, secondly, that Christ by offering up himselfe a Sacrifice unto God, is become unto his people <hi>a King of Righteousnesse,</hi> or <hi>the Lord our righteousnesse:</hi> in which sense he is called <hi>The Prince of life, Act.</hi> 3.15. that is, he hath all power given him as a Prince, to quicken, and to justifie whom hee will, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.20, 21. And this comes from his Sacrifice and perfect obedience to us imputed, and by us with faith implyed and apprehended; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fulfilled the righteousnesse of the Law, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himselfe by rising from the dead, he became, being thus made perfect, the Author of righteousnesse and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. We had in us a <hi>whole kingdome of sin,</hi> and therefore requisite there was in him that should justifie us <hi>a kingdome of Grace,</hi> and righteousnesse, <hi>That as sinne raigned unto death, even so might Grace through righteousnesse raigne unto eternall life by Iesus Christ our Lord, Rom.</hi> 5.21. and therefore wee are said to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>righteousnesse of God, Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22. that is, such a righteousnesse as is <hi>ours by gift and grace, not by
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:16264:243"/>
nature, Rom.</hi> 10.3. and such a righteousnesse as <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe did performe, though in the humane nature, in our behalfe, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>And this is the ground of all our comfort, the best di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in all our miseries and extremities whither to flie. A King is the greatest officer amongst men, and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and state is for the supply, defence, and honour of his people: He is <hi>Custos Tabularum,</hi> the Father, and the Keeper of the Lawes. If I want any of that justice and equity, of which his sacred Bosome is the publike trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I may freely beg it of him, because he is an Officer to dispence righteousnesse unto his subjects; so also is Christ unto his Church. I finde my selfe in a miserable condition, condemned by the conscience of sinne, by the testimony of the Word, by the accusations of Satan, full of discomforts; God is a God of justice, and all fire, my selfe a creature of sin, and all stubble; Satan the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser of the brethren, who labours to blow up the wrath of God against me. In this case what shall I doe? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>God hath set his King on Sion</hi>; and he is a King that hath life and righteousnesse to give to mee; that hath grace enough to quench all sin, and the envenomed darts of Satan, in whom there is erected a court of peace and mercy, whereunto to appeale from the severity of God, from the importunity of the Devill, and from the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations and testimonies of our owne hearts. And indeed he had need be a King of righteousnesse that shall justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie men, for our justification is in the remission of our sins; and to pardon sins, and dispence with Lawes is a regall dignitie; and God taketh it as his owne high and peculiar prerogative, <hi>I, even I am he who blotteth out thine iniquity for mine owne sake, and will not remember thy sinnes, Esay</hi> 43.25. No man, or Angell, or created power, no merit, no obedience, no rivers of oyle, nor mountaines of cattell, no prayers, teares, or torments, can wipe out the staines, or remove the guilt of any
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:16264:243"/>
sinne, <hi>I onely, even I</hi> and none else can doe it. None but a Divine and Royall Power can subdue sinne, <hi>Mica</hi> 7.18.</p>
            <p>And this is a ground of a second comfort, that being a King of righteousnesse he is rich in it, and hath treasures to bestow; that as we have a kingdome, a treasure, and abundance of sin; so we have a King that hath alwayes a residue of spirit and grace, that hath a most redundant righteousnesse <hi>from faith to faith, Rom.</hi> 1.17. A mans faith can never over-grow the righteousnesse of our King. If we had all the faith that ever was in the world put into one man, all that could not over-claspe the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ, or be too bigge for it. As if a man had a thousand eyes, and they should one after another looke on the Sunne, yet still the light would be revealed from eye to eye; or as if a man should goe up by ten thousand steps to the top of the highest mountaine, yet he could never over-looke all the earth, or fix his eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all visible objects, but should still have more earth and heaven discovered unto him from step to step: so there is an immensitie in the righteousnesse and mercy of God, which cannot be exhausted by any sins, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, and comprehended by any faith of men. As God dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Note thirdly, <hi>Melchisedek</hi> was <hi>King of Salem,</hi> that is, of Peace. Here are two things to be noted, the <hi>Place,</hi> a Citie of the Canaanites, and <hi>the signification</hi> thereof, which is <hi>Peace:</hi> First then we must observe, that <hi>Christ is a King of Canaanites,</hi> of Gentiles, of those that lived in abominable lusts: <hi>Such were some of you, but you are
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:16264:244"/>
washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Iesus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. Be a man never so sinfull or uncleane, he hath not enough to pose or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus the mercy and righteousnesse of Christ; hee can bring reconciliation and peace amongst Jebusites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; though our father were an Amorite, our mother an Hittite, though wee were Gentiles, estranged from God in our thoughts, lives, hopes, ends: though we had justified Sodome and Samaria by our abominations, yet he can make us <hi>nigh by his bloud,</hi> he can make <hi>our crimsin sins as white as snow,</hi> he can for all that <hi>establish an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting covenant unto us, Ephes.</hi> 2.11—14. <hi>Esay</hi> 1.18. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 16.60—63. I was a blasphemer, a persecutour, very injurious to the Spirit of Grace in his Saints, I wasted, I worried, I haled into prison, I breathed out threatnings, I was mad, &amp; made havocke of the Church, I was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one step of the unpardonable sinne, nothing but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance betweene that and my soule; <hi>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in mee first Iesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a patterne to them who should hereafter beleeve on him to life everlasting,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13—16.</p>
            <p>Let us make Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> use of it: First, <hi>To love and to beleeve in Christ,</hi> to accept as a most faithfull and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy saying, that Christ came to save sinners; indefinitely, without restriction, without limitation; and me, though the chiefest of all others. Though I had more sinnes than earth or hell can lay upon me, yet if I feele them as heavie weights, and if I am willing to forsake them all, let me not dishonour the power and unsearchable riches of Christs bloud, even for such a sinner there is mercy. Secondly, <hi>To breake forth into Saint Pauls</hi> acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Now unto the King eternall, immortall, invisible, and onely wise God,</hi> to him that is a King of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and therefore hath abundance for me, that is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and yet was borne in time for me; immortall, yet
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:16264:244"/>
died for me; invisible, yet was manifested in the flesh for me, the onely wise God, and who made use of that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to reconcile himselfe to mee, and by the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of preaching doth save the world; <hi>bee honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, from the signification of the word, we may note, <hi>Where Christ is a King of righteousnesse, hee is a King of Peace too.</hi> So the Prophet calleth him, <hi>the Prince of Peace, Esay</hi> 6.9. a Creator and dispencer of peace. It is his <hi>owne</hi> by proprietie and purchace, and he leaves it unto us: <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you, Ioh.</hi> 14.27. The world is either <hi>fallax</hi> or <hi>inops,</hi> either it deceives, or it is deficient; but Peace is <hi>mine,</hi> and I can give it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> calleth him by the name of <hi>Righteousnesse, Ier.</hi> 33.16. So the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> calleth him by the name of <hi>Peace, This man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our Land, Mic.</hi> 5.5. To which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alleaging, calleth him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>our peace, Ephes.</hi> 2.14. By him we have peace with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled, and <hi>recti in curia</hi> againe, being justified by faith, <hi>we have peace with God,</hi> through our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. so that the heart can chalenge all the world to lay any thing to its charge. By him wee have <hi>peace with our owne consciences,</hi> for being sprinkled with his bloud, they are cleansed from dead workes, and so we have the <hi>witnesse in our selves,</hi> as the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. By him wee have <hi>peace with men.</hi> No more malice, envie, or hatred of one another, after once the kindnesse and love of God our Saviour towards man appeared, Tit. 3.3, 4. All par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wals are taken downe, and they which were two before, are both made <hi>one in him, Ephes.</hi> 2.14. and then there is towards the brethren a love of communion, towards the weake a love of pitie, towards the poore a love of bounty, either <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. either
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:16264:245"/>
brotherly love, or generall love, towards those without mercy, charity, compassion, forgivenes, towards al good works. By him we have <hi>peace with the creatures,</hi> we use them with comfort, with liberty, with delight, with pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with charity, with mercy, as glasses in the which we see, and as steps by the which we draw neerer to God. No rust in our gold or silver, no moth, nor pride in our garment, no lewdnes in our liberty, no hand against the wall, no flying roll against the stone or beame of the house, no gravell in our bread, no gall in our drinke, no snare on our table, no feares in our bed, no destruction in our prosperitie; in all estates we can rejoyce, we can doe and suffer all through Christ that strengtheneth us. We are <hi>under the custodie of peace</hi>; it keepes our hearts and mindes from feares of enemies, and maketh us serve the Lord with confidence, boldnesse and securitie, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The workes of righteousnesse are in peace, and the effect of righteousnesse is quietnesse and assurance for ever.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 32.17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Note fourthly, from both these, that is, from a peace grounded in righteousnesse, needs must <hi>Blessednesse</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, for it is the blessednesse of a creature to be reunited, and one with his Maker, to have all controversies ended, all distances swallowed up, all partitions taken downe, and therefore the Apostle useth <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes</hi> as terms promiscuous.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.5—9.</note> All men seek for blessednes, it is the summe and collection of all desires, a man loveth nothing but in order &amp; subordination unto that. And by nature wee are all children of wrath, and held under by the curse, so many sinnes as we have committed, so many deaths &amp; curses have we heaped upon our soules, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wals of separation have we set up between us &amp; God, who is the fountaine of blessednesse. Till all they be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, removed, forgiven and forgotten, the creature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be blessed. <hi>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and whose sinnes are covered, Rom.</hi> 4.7. All the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions which wee have from the most high God
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:16264:245"/>
come unto us from the intercession and mediation of Christ. His sacrifice and prayers give us interest in the all-sufficiencie of him that is above all, and so are a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity unto us against all adverse power or feare, for what or whom need that man feare, that is one with the most high God? <hi>If God be for us, who can be against us? Rom.</hi> 8.31. When God blesseth, his blessing is ever with ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and successe, it cannot be reversed, it cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed: <hi>Hath he said, and shall he not doe it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? Behold,</hi> saith <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, I have received commandement to blesse, and hee hath blessed, and cannot reverse it, Numb.</hi> 23.19, 20.</p>
            <p>Note fifthly, from <hi>Melchisedeks</hi> meeting <hi>Abraham</hi> returning from the slaughter of the Kings, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>the great forwardnesse that is in Christ to meet and to blesse his people,</hi> when they have beene in his service. <hi>Thou meetest him that rejoyceth and worketh righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Esay</hi> 64.5. <hi>I said I will confesse my sinnes, and thou forgavest the iniquitie of my sinne, Psal.</hi> 32.5. No sooner did <hi>David</hi> resolve in his heart to returne to God, but presently the Lord prevented him with his mercy, and anticipated his servants confession with pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse; <hi>Thou preventest him with the blessings of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Psal.</hi> 21.3. As the father of the Prodigall, when he was yet a great way off, far from that perfection which might in strictnesse be required, yet, because hee had set his face homeward, and was now resolved to sue for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and re-admittance; when he saw him, he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and <hi>ranne</hi> (the fathers mercy was swi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter than the sonnes repentance) and fell on his necke and kissed him, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. We doe not finde the Lord so hastie in his punishments, He is <hi>slow to anger, and doth not stirre up all his wrath</hi> together. He is patient, and long-suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance; hee comes, and hee comes againe, and the third yeere he forbeares, before he cuts
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:16264:246"/>
downe a barren tree: But when hee comes with a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, hee doth not delay, but prevents his people with goodnesse and mercy. O how forward ought we to be to serve him, who is so ready to meet us in his way, and to blesse us?</p>
            <p>Note sixthly, from the refection and preparations which <hi>Melchisedek</hi> made for <hi>Abraham</hi> and for his men, we may observe, That <hi>Christ as King and Priest is a comforter and refresher of his people in all their spirituall wearinesse,</hi> and after all their services. This was the end of his unction to heale, and to comfort his people. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because hee hath <hi>annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to preach the Gospell to the poore, he hath sent mee to heale the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and a recovering of sight to the blinde, to set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie them that are bruized, and to preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord, Luke</hi> 4.18, 19. To provide <hi>a feast of fatted things,</hi> of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined, Esay 25.6. To mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To speake words in season to those that are weary, and to make broken and dry bones to rejoyce, and to flourish like an herb, <hi>Esay</hi> 50.4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Esay</hi> 66.14.</p>
            <p>And this is a strong argument to hold up the patience, faith, and hope of men in his service, and in all spirituall assaults; we have a <hi>Melchisedek</hi> which after our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is ended, and our victory obtained will give us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments at the last, and will meet us with his mercies. If we faint not, but wait a while, we shall see the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, that in the end he is very pitifull and of tender mercy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.11. He is neere at hand, his comming draweth nigh: <hi>He is neere that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth mee, who will contend with m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

challenge and defiance to al enemies, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Esai.</hi> 50.8, 9. <hi>Iob</hi> went forth mourning, and had a great warre to fight; but the Lord blessed his latter end more than his beginning, and after his battle was ended met him like <hi>Melchizedek</hi> with redoubled mercies. <hi>David, Hezekiah, Heman</hi> the Ezrahite, and many of the Saints after their example, have had sore and dismall conflicts, but at length their comforts have beene proportionable to their wrestlings, they never wanted a <hi>Melchizedek</hi> after their combats to refresh them. <hi>Rejoyce not against mee, O mine enemie, when I fall I shall rise, when I sit in darkenesse the Lord shall bee a light unto me: I will beare the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him untill he plead my cause and execute judgement for me, he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousnesse, Mic.</hi> 7.8, 9. He hath strength, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, refection, spirit, to put into those that fight his battles, though they bee but as <hi>Abraham,</hi> a family of three hundred men, against foure kings, yet hee can cut <hi>Rahab,</hi> and wound the dragon, and make a way in the sea for the ransomed to passe over, and cause his redeemed to returne with singing, and with joy and gladnesse upon their heads, <hi>I, even I am he that comforteth you, who art thou that shouldest bee affraid of a man that shall dye, and of the sonne of man that shall bee as grasse? Esai.</hi> 51.12.</p>
            <p>Note, seventhly, from <hi>Melchisedeks receiving of tithes from Abraham</hi> (which the Apostle taketh speciall notice of foure or five times together in one Chapt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2, 4, 6, 8, 9.) we may observe, <hi>That Christ is a receiver of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and tribute from his people</hi>; There was never any type of Christ as a Priest, but he received tithes, and that not in the right of any thing in himselfe, but meerely in the vertue of his typicall office, so that originally they did manifestly pertaine to that principall Priest, whom these represented, whose personall <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>If it objected, why then did not Christ in his life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive tithes? I answer, first, because though hee were the substance, yet the standing typicall priesthood was not abolished till after his ministery on earth was finished, for his priesthood was not consummate till his sitting at the right hand of God: secondly, because he tooke upon him a voluntary poverty for especiall reasons belonging to the state of his humiliation, and to the dispensation of mans Redemption, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8.9. You will say, now Christs priesthood is consummate, and hee himselfe is in heaven, whither no tithes can bee sent; therefore none are due, because he hath no typicall priests in earth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him. I answer, though hee bee in heaven in his body, yet he is on earth in his ministery, and in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the vertue of his sacrifice; and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospell are <hi>in his stead,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. and ought to bee received <hi>as Christ himselfe, Gal.</hi> 4.14. so then men are not by this excused from rendering Gods dues unto him; first, because there is in respect of him, whose sacrifice we commemorate and shew forth to the people, due a <hi>Testification of homage unto him</hi>; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because in respect of us there is due a <hi>Reward of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> for the labourer is worthy of his hire: to lay all together in one view, in as much as all the types of Christ, as a Priest, have received <hi>tithes</hi> as due, and in as much as that right was not grounded upon any thing in or from themselves, but upon their <hi>typicall office,</hi> and so did originally pertaine to the <hi>Principall Priest,</hi> whom they typified; and in as much as his person and office is <hi>eternall,</hi> and therefore such are all the <hi>annexa,</hi> and dues thereof; and in as much as he hath no where dispenced with, or denied, or refused, or revoked this right which from him as the principall all his types ever enjoyed: and lastly, in as much as hee hath left to the Ministers of
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:16264:247"/>
his Word, the dispensation of his sacrifice, and made them his <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> and in <hi>his stead</hi> to the Church, to set forth him crucified in his ordinances: for my part I doe not see why unto them in the name and right of their Master, those rights should not be due, which were manifestly his in his types, and of which himselfe hath no where in his Word declared any revocation.</p>

and commands of the Gospell. God is not lesse mindefull of Ministers under the Gospell, than of those under the Law. Now then, if you will not beleeve that a liberall maintenance is now by God allotted unto us, looke what he did allot to them; first, looke upon the <hi>proportion of their persons,</hi> and then upon the <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their maintenance:</hi> for their persons it would not be hard to prove that the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi>

                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Seldens <hi>Review of his History, Cap.</hi> 2.</note> though the thirteenth part of the people in regard of their civill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, were not yet the fortieth part of the people. Looke into the numbring of them, and compare <hi>Num.</hi> 1.46. with <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.39. The other Tribes were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred from twentie yeeres old and upward, all that were able to beare armes, which was to the age of fifty yeeres, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> reports; for at that age they were supposed to be unserviceable for warre; and yet thus their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber amounted to sixe hundred and three thousand five hundred and fiftie men able to goe to warre. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites on the other side were numbred from one moneth old and upward, and yet the whole summe amounted but to twentie two thousand. Now conjecture the number of those in the other Tribes who were under twentie yeeres of age, and who were too old for warlike service to be but halfe as many as the rest, yet the whole number of the Tribes reckoned from their infancie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will amount at the least to nine hundred two thousand men. Of which number, the number of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites is just the one and fortieth part. After we finde that they increased to a mightie number more, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.3. but the whole people increased accordingly, for the tribe of Judah which was before but seventie foure thousand, was then five hundred thousand, and in <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphats</hi> time eleven hundred thousand at least, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. well then, the Levites were but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of the people (not so much) so that that Tribe was but almost a quarter as numerous as the rest. Now
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:16264:249"/>
looke in the next place to the <hi>Proportion of their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi> One would thinke that the fortieth part of the people could require but the fortieth part of the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in proportion. But first they had the <hi>Tenth of all the increase</hi> of seed, and fruit, and great and small cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.30. Secondly, they had <hi>fortie eight cities</hi> with suburbs for gardens and for cattell, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.2. Which cities were next to the best, and in many tribes the best of all; in <hi>Iuda, Hebron,</hi> in <hi>Benjamin, Gibeon,</hi> both Roiall Cities; so that those Cities with about a mile suburb to every one of them can come to little lesse than the wealth of one tribe alone, in that little countrie, which from Dan to Beersheba was but about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and sixtie miles long. Thirdly, they had all the <hi>first fruits</hi> of cleane and uncleane beasts, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.13. Of the fruits of the earth and the fleece of the sheepe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10.35. of men to bee redeemed, <hi>Num.</hi> 18.15. Fourthly, the meate <hi>Offerings,</hi> the sinne offerings, the trespasse offerings, the heave offerings, and the wave offerings, were all theirs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.9, 10, 11. Fifthly, they had all <hi>vowes, and voluntary oblations,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations, and every hallowed thing, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.8, 9. Sixthly, excepting the Holocaust they had either the shoulder, or the breast, or the skinne, or <hi>something of every Sacrifice</hi> which was offered, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.3. Seventhly, the males were to appeare three times a yeare before the Lord, and they were not to come <hi>empty handed, Exod.</hi> 23.15.17. Lastly, unto them did belong many <hi>recompences of injurie,</hi> which was the resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the principall, and a fifth part, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.7, 8. Now put the Tithes, the Cities, and these other constant revenews together, and the Priests and Levites, who were but about a quarter as many as one tribe, had yet about three times the revenews of one tribe.</p>
            <p>But to leave this Argument. Let us consider what the Apostle saith; <hi>let him that is taught in the word commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate

Who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milke of the flock. Say I these things as a man</hi> (that is, am I partiall? doe I speake meerly out of affection, and humane favor to mine owne cause, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?) or, <hi>saith not the Law the same also? For it is written in the Law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne. Doth God take care for Oxen? or saith hee it altogether for our sakes?</hi> That is, doth God provide Lawes for rewarding and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the labor of brute beasts, and doth hee leave the maintenance and honor of his owne immediate officers to the arbitrary and pinching allowances of covetous and cruel men? <hi>For our sakes no doubt this is written, That hee that ploweth should plow in hope, and that hee that thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth in hope should bee partaker of his hope.</hi> That is, that the encouragement of the Ministers in their service might depend upon such a hope as is grounded on Gods Law and provision, and that they might not bee left to the wills and allowances of those men against whose sinnes they were sent. And this the Apostle proveth by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument drawne from a most unanswerable equitie. <hi>If wee have sowen unto you spirituall things, is it a great thing if wee shall reape your carnall things?</hi> If you doe rightly judge of those heavenly treasures which wee bring in abundance unto you, impossible it is that you should judge our paines and service towards your immortall and pretious soules sufficiently rewarded with a narrow and hungry proportion of earthly and perishable things. <hi>Doe yee not know that they which minister about holy

And alas, how many men preach the Gospell, and yet can scarce finde the first and meanest of all these supplies?

who understand these words of God the Father; the words are an <hi>Apostrophe</hi> of the Prophet to those at whose right hand the Lord Iesus is. Some make it an <hi>Apostrophe to God the Father,</hi> a triumphall and thankfull prediction of that power and Iudgement which he hath given to this his <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the Sonne at his right hand. Because that thereby the phrase retaineth the same signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and sense which it had in the first <hi>verse.</hi> As if <hi>David</hi> had said, O God, the Father of all power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, worthy art thou of all praise, thanksgiving and honor who hast given such power to thy Sonne in the behalfe of thy Church, as to smite through Kings, and judge heathen, and pull downe the chiefe of his enemies, and to subdue all things to himselfe; and these read it thus, <hi>O Lord, hee that is at thy right hand shall strike through Kings, &amp;c.</hi> Others make it to be <hi>an Apostrophe to the Church,</hi> and so to bee a phrase not expressing Christs exaltation, as <hi>verse</hi> 1. But his care and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over his Church, his readinesse, to assist and defend his owne people against all the injuries and assaults of adverse power. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>A wise mans heart is at his right hand, but a fooles heart is at his left, Eccl.</hi> 10.2. That is, his heart is ready and prepared to execute any wife counsels or godly resolutions; as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>My heart is prepared ô God, my heart is prepared, I will sing and give thankes.</hi> But a fooles heart when hee should doe any thing is like his left hand, to seeke of skill, unactive and unprepared; when hee walketh by the way <hi>his heart faileth him, vers.</hi> 3. And this readinesse and present helpe of God to defend and guide his Church is expressed frequently by his being at the right hand thereof. <hi>Because the Lord is at my right hand I shall not bee moved, Psal.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Hee shall stand at the right hand of the poore to save him, Psal.</hi> 109.31. <hi>I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, feare not I will helpe thee, Esai.</hi> 31.13. As if <hi>David</hi> had said, Bee not

dismayed nor cast downe ô yee subjects of this King, as if being exalted to Gods right hand, hee had given over the care and protection of his people; for as hee is at the right hand of his Father in glory and majesty; so is he at your right hand too, standing to execute judgement on your enemies, and to reveale the power of his arme to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you in your protection.</p>
            <p>Now the reasons of this phrase and expression as I conceive are these two. First, to note that Christs power, providence, and protection doe not exclude, but onely strengthen, assist, and prosper the ordinary and just en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors of the Church for themselves. The Lord is <hi>not at our left hand</hi> to succor us in our idlenesse and negligence, but <hi>at our working hand</hi> to give successe to our honest endeavors. The <hi>sword of the Lord</hi> doth not fight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>sword of Gedeon, Iudg.</hi> 7.18. In the miracles of Christ when hee fed and feasted men, hee never created wine or bread of nothing, but blessed, and so changed, or multiplied that which was by humane industry prepared before. Our Savior had fish and bread of his owne, and yet hee would have his Disciples put in their net and catch, and bring of their owne, to note unto us, that Gods power and providence, must not exclude but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage mans industry, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21.9, 10. Hee protecteth us <hi>in viis nostris, non in praecipitiis,</hi> in our wayes, not in our precipices or presumptions, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.11. So long then as the Church is valiant and constant in withstanding the enemies of her peace &amp; prosperity, God is undoubtedly with her to blesse that courage, and to strengthen that right hand; so long as <hi>Moses</hi> held up his hand, God fought for Israel. There was <hi>Ioshuas</hi> sword, and <hi>Moses</hi> his hand or prayer, and upon those Gods blessing, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.12, 13. And they were all to concurre. If the sword should cease, the Prayer would doe no good; for God will not bee tempted: If the Prayer faint, the sword is in vaine, for God will not bee neglected. As in a curious
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:16264:253"/>
Clock stopp any wheele and you hinder the whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If God promise to bee present, <hi>Ioshua</hi> must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to bee couragious, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 1.5.6.9. Secondly, to note unto us the care and militarie wisedome of Christ our Captaine to meete with and to prevent our enemies, and to intercept their blowes against us; for wee may observe in the Scripture that <hi>Satan plieth the right hand of the Church,</hi> laboureth to weaken and assault us where there is most danger towards him. Let <hi>Satan stand at his right hand, Psal.</hi> 109.6. That is, either give him over to the rage of Satan, that hee may bee hurried to execute his will, or set Satan to hinder him in his mischievous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. Thus <hi>Satan stood at the right hand of Ioshua the high Priest to resist him, Zech.</hi> 3.1. Noting the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous and indefatigable endeavors of Satan to resist, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint, and overthrow the workes of the worthies in Gods Church (<hi>I would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and againe, but Satan hindered us,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.18.) And to divert the strength of men upon his service. And therefore to rebuke him, and to shew to the Church that our strength is from him, and due unto him hee also stands there to outvie the temptations and impulsions of Satan.</p>
            <p>These are the two expositions which are given of these words, <hi>The Lord at thy right hand.</hi> Now though of all places of Scripture there is indeed but one literall sense; yet when two are given, which both tend unto the same generall scope, and are suteable not onely to the analogie of faith, but to the meaning mainely aimed at by the Holy Ghost in the place, and when there is no apparant evidence in the face of the Text, for preferring one before the other: I thinke it is not unfit to embrace both; and so something I shall touch upon both senses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall strike through,</hi> or wound, or make gore bloudie, <hi>Kings in the day of his wrath.</hi>] The word is, <hi>Hath stricken through Kings.</hi> It is a Prophesie of things future, spoken

as of things to bee done. <hi>To strike thorow,</hi> notes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete victory and full confusion of the enemie, an in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wound, that they may stagger, and fall, and rise up no more, and that affliction may not arise a second time, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.9. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.8. The onely difficulty is what is meant by <hi>Kings</hi>; for which wee must note that the Kingdome of Christ is spirituall, and his warre spirituall, and therefore his enemies for the most part spirituall. Therefore I take it wee are hereby to understand the most potent enemies of Christ; whether <hi>spirituall,</hi> wee wrestle not against flesh and bloud, but against principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and powers, and spirituall wickednesse in high places, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.

And their overthrow for persecuting the Church. But since all sorts of Christs enemies are called Kings in Scripture, and all of them doe push at his Kingdome in the Church, I see no ground why wee may not by Kings understand them all, with their subjects, armies, and associates. As in great victories the Lords and principall men are said to be overcome, when the servants and souldiers are routed and slaine.</p>

the insolency and malice of the enemie, when his fury is fully stirred up and provoked, when the just and full time of his glory is come; That it may appeare that they are overcome not by time, or chance, or humane power, or secular concurrence, but onely by the power of his wrath hee will doe it. Christ is never destitute of power, but in wisedome hee hath ordered the times of his Church, when to have his Church suffer and beare witnesse to him, and when to triumph in his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances. So the meaning of this clause is this, when the day of recompence is come, when the sinnes and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his enemie is ripe, when the utmost period of his patience is expired, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>The Lord at thy right hand.</hi>] According to the two-fold Apostrophe before mentioned, here are two observations which I will but touch. First, that God the Father is worthy to have all the power, Majesty, and judgement which hee hath given to his Sonne our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, for our protection, salvation and defence, most thankfully and triumphantly acknowledged to him. We finde our Savior himselfe praising God in this behalfe, that hee had delivered all things into his hand, even power to make Babes beleeve on him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25.27. And this <hi>S. Paul</hi> is frequent in, namely in praising and glorifying God for Christ. O wretched man that I am who shall deliver mee, &amp;c. <hi>I thanke God through Iesus Christ our Lord, Rom.</hi> 7.25. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, 17. All the promises of God are in him yea, and in him Amen, <hi>to the Glory of God by us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19, 20. Hee gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for our sinnes, that hee might deliver us from this present evill world according to the will of God and our Father, <hi>to whom bee glory for ever and ever, Amen, Gal.</hi> 1.4, 5. Every tongue must confesse that Iesus Christ is Lord <hi>to the Glory of God the Father, Phil.</hi> 2.11.</p>
            <p>And reason there is that it should thus bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to the Father, because hee hath all his Kingdome and power in the Church from the Father. <hi>All power is given unto mee. Hee hath given him a name above every name</hi>; and this the Sonne hath revealed to us, that so hee might <hi>manifest the name,</hi> that is, get glory to his Father thereby, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.6, 7. For in Christ it was God that recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:16264:255"/>
the world to himselfe. Secondly, hee hath it all given unto him in our nature, in our behalfe, and as our head, so that wee in the gifts of God to him were onely respected, and therefore wee have reason to praise God for them. It was not indeed given to him strictly (for it was not to him <hi>Beneficium</hi> but <hi>Onus,</hi> an office, but not a benefit) but to him for us, or to us in and by him. In all the victories, deliverances, refreshments, experiences of Gods power and goodnesse wee must ever remember to praise God in and through his Sonne, to acknowledge the power of his right hand, which is not now against his Church, but against the enemies of his Church. For therefore the deliverance of his Church is ascribed to Gods <hi>Right hand,</hi> because hee hath there one to plead, to intreat, to move his right hand in our behalfe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all our distresses, in all conflicts and temptations, wee must by faith looke up <hi>unto Gods right hand,</hi> put him in remembrance of that faithfulnesse, righteousnesse, atonement, and intercession which is there made in our behalfe. There wee shall have matter enough to fill our mouths and hearts with praises, and triumph, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in him. <hi>It is Christ who is at the right hand of God; who shall separate us from the Love of Christ, Rom.</hi> 8.34, 35. Here are two arguments of the Churches safety and triumph. The <hi>Love</hi> of Christ, and the <hi>Honor</hi> of Christ. Hee loveth all his to the end. But what good can love doe without power? Therefore hee that loveth us is exalted by God, and hath all power given him for this purpose that his love may doe us good. In the conflicts of my corruptions (which are an adversary too wise, too subtile, too numberlesse for mee to vanquish,) I may yet when I am driven to <hi>Pauls</hi> extremity, rest in his thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and looking up to Iesus, who will be the finisher of every good worke which hee beginnes, and seeing him at Gods right hand, may triumph in the power and office which God hath given to his Sonne there, which
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:16264:255"/>
is, to subdue our iniquities, and to sanctifie us by his Truth, and by that residue of Spirit which he keepeth for the Church, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.17, 19. for that Prayer is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, as it were, and counterpane of Christs Intercession: for, saith he, <hi>I come to thee, and speake these things in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in them, ver.</hi> 13. that is, that they having a <hi>specimen</hi> and forme of that Intercession which with thee I shall make for them, left upon publike record for them to looke on, and there finding, that their sanctification is the businesse of my sitting at thy right hand, may in the midst of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts and conflicts of their corruption have a full joy and triumph in the honour which thou hast given me. I am beset with the temptations of mine enemies, and persecutions for the Name of Christ; In this case I may give God praise for the power which hee hath given to his Sonne, I may from mine enemies appeale unto Gods right hand, I may like <hi>Stephen</hi> when the stones and buffets are about my soule looke up by faith, &amp; see there my Captain standing up in my defence, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.55. I may acknowledge unto God the power given unto his Sonne, that though nothing of all this fall upon me without his provision and permission, yet sure I am that he hath power and mercy in his right hand, that though mine enemies were as strong as a combination and armie of kings, yet the Lord at his right hand hath from him in my behalfe received power enough, to strike through kings when the day of his wrath is come.</p>
            <p>Note, secondly, Christ is at the right hand of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, present with them, and prepared to defend them from all their enemies, <hi>present by his Spirit</hi> to strengthen, comfort, and uphold them, enabling them to glory and rejoyce in all their sufferings, as knowing that they are but for a moment, and that which is needfull <hi>to purge their faith,</hi> and to make them beare their shame, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Esai.</hi> 27.8, 9. and <hi>to glorifie the
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:16264:256"/>
consequent power of Christ,</hi> which shall bee revealed to their joy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13. when hee will recompence dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us in mercy, and to our enemies in severity, <hi>Esai.</hi> 54.7, 8.61.7. <hi>present by his mighty power, and by his Angels,</hi> to rescue, deliver and protect them, to bee as a wall of fire, as a shield, a buckler, a rocke, a Captaine to his people, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.5.</p>
            <p>And this is the ground of all the Churches comfort that more is with them than against them: the enemies have combinations and confederacies of men, but the Church hath <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with them, <hi>Esai.</hi> 8.9, 10. none can pull Christ from the right hand of God, or from the right hand of his people: that is, none can take away either his power or his love from his people. The Church and truth can never bee crush'd and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, no more than a rocke with the raging of the waves: they are <hi>Heavenly things,</hi> and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of earth or hell can reach to corrupt them. It was but a vaine attempt of the Gyants to build a tower to heaven: The <hi>world was made</hi> that there might be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a <hi>Church</hi> to worship and contemplate that God which made it; therefore in the creation God never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted till he came to a Church, to note that that was the end thereof; and therefore it is easier to pull downe the world, and to shake in peeces the frame of nature, than to ruine the Church. The <hi>Church hath Christ for her husband,</hi> hee to whom all knees must bend, hee whom every tongue must confesse, hee who will subdue all things to himselfe, so she hath <hi>Love, Power</hi> and <hi>Iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi> all three very strong things on her side. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the onely way to be safe, is to keepe Christ at our right hand, to hold fast his truth, worship, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for so long as we have <hi>Immanuel,</hi> all adverse pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is but flesh, and all flesh is but grasse, withered in a moment when God will blow upon it.</p>
            <p>Note thirdly, <hi>Christ in his appointed time will utterly
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:16264:256"/>
overthrow the greatest enemies of his Kingdome, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Church from under the sorest oppressions.</hi> There is not any one argument in the holy Scriptures more frequently repeated, than this of Christs victories; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured they were in the deliverances of Israel out of Egypt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2, 4. In the deliverance of the Arke out of the waters, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21, 22. in the deliverance of the Iewes from Babylon, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Esai.</hi> 11.10-12.15. To note that in the sorest extremities and greatest impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities God will shew himselfe jealous for his people. This victorie is expressed by <hi>treading of a wine-presse, Esai.</hi> 63.1, 6. when there are none to helpe, when the Church is brought to sorest extremities, though multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes meete against her as many as the grapes in a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they shall all be but as Clusters of grapes, he shall squeeze out their bloud like wine, and make his Church to thresh them, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.20. <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.12. <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.13. <hi>By the dissipation of smoke out of a Chimnie,</hi> they shall bee as the smoke out of the Chimnie, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.3. As <hi>Athanasius</hi> used to say of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, that hee was but <hi>Nubecula quae citò transiret,</hi> a little cloud, which would quickly be blowne away: smoke when it breakes out of a Chimnie with a horrible blacknesse threatneth to blot out the Sunne, and to invade and choake up all the ayre, but a little blast of winde scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth it, and anon nothing thereof appeares. <hi>By fire consuming thornes and briars, Esai.</hi> 10.17. While they be folded together as thornes, and while they are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as drunkards, that is, while they have plotted their counsels, and confederacies so curiously that no man dares so much as touch them, and while they are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the pride and confidence of their own strength, they shall then be devoured as stubble that is fully dry, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.10. <hi>Esai.</hi> 27.4.31.9.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Scripture calleth Christ a <hi>Man of war, Exod.</hi> 15.3. Because he is furnished with all Arts of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:16264:257"/>
               <hi>Power invincible,</hi> as a Lion amongst shepheards, so is he amongst his enemies, <hi>Esai.</hi> 31.4. <hi>wisedome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable</hi> which must stand, v. 1, 2. If hee purpose, none can disappoint him, <hi>Esai.</hi> 14.27. <hi>Authority</hi> by the least intimation to gather together all the forces of the world against the enemies of his Church. If he but hisse unto them, they presently come in troops, <hi>Esai.</hi> 5.26.7.18. He can <hi>command</hi> helpe for his people, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 71.3. <hi>Ier.</hi> 47.7. and, if that should faile, he can create helpe for his people, as hee did for Israel, when hee wrought miracles to deliver them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.22.</p>
            <p>We may more profitably consider the truth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of this point, by discovering it in the severall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Christ and his people. First, the great enemie of the seed of the woman is the <hi>Serpent,</hi> that great red Dragon, whose names are all names of enmity. The <hi>Accuser,</hi> the <hi>Tempter,</hi> the <hi>Destroyer,</hi> the <hi>Devourer,</hi> the <hi>Envious man,</hi> furnished with <hi>much strength,</hi> and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie succour, legions of principalities and powers atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on him; and with <hi>much wisedome,</hi> which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the wiles, and traines, and craftines of Satan. And his Arts of destroying men are two. To <hi>tempt</hi> and <hi>to accuse.</hi> His Temptations are twofold: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto <hi>Sinne,</hi> or unto <hi>discomfort:</hi> either to make us offend God, or to make us disquiet our selves: either to wound us or to vexe us. And in all these his Arts Christ our Captain will tread him under our feet, and will give his Church the victory at the last, either by <hi>Arming us with sufficiency of grace and faith in his Victories,</hi> putting us by his Spirit in minde of his Temptations, which taught him compassion towards us who are so much weaker, and encouraging our hearts to cry out unto him who is our mercifull and compassionate high priest, like a ravished woman in our extremities, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. stirring up our faith to lay hold on him when we are in darkenesse; and our spirit of Adoption to cry
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:16264:257"/>
unto him when wee are in danger; and our spirit of wisedome to solve the objections to discerne the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Satan, and to prepare and arme our hearts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to wrestle with him. Or else <hi>by rebuking of him,</hi> pulling in his chaine, and chasing him away, and, as our second, undertaking the combate in person for us, when he is ready to prevaile, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.1, 2. Thus he overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him as a <hi>Tempter,</hi> and ever giveth some either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable or profitable issue out of them.</p>
            <p>He likewise overcommeth him as an <hi>Accuser.</hi> Satan accuseth the Saints either <hi>by way of complaint</hi> and na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things which they have done, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.10. which the Apostle calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his laying of crimes to the charge of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. and thus Christ over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth him by his <hi>Intercession,</hi> and in the hearts of his Saints by making them judge and accuse themselves, that they may be able to cleere themselves too, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 7.11. Or hee accuseth <hi>by way of suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or preconjecture,</hi> as hee did <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. and herein likewise Christ overcommeth him in his servants, by permitting him to tempt and vexe them, that they may come the purer out of the fire, and by putting a holy suspition and jealousie into them over their owne hearts, which may still bee a meanes to prevent them against evils that are likely to assault them, to teach them in every condition, as well possible as present, how to walke acceptably before God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11, 13.</p>
            <p>Another great enemie of the Kingdome of Christ is, the <hi>lust</hi> of our owne evill nature. <hi>The carnall minde is enmitie against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. Enmity in grieving, vexing, and quenching the holy Spirit in us, and lusting enviously against his grace, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.4, 5. And here also Christ overcommeth, by the prevailing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Spirit, giving us <hi>more Grace,</hi> demolishing the kingdome of sinne, and judging the prince of this world
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:16264:258"/>
which before did rule in the children of disobedience. And this he doth by the judgement Seat, and Scepter of his Spirit in the heart: for the judgement of the Spirit is too hard for the principality of Satan, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.11. The Spirit of Christ is a <hi>victorious Spirit.</hi> He bringeth forth his <hi>judgement unto victory, Matth.</hi> 12.20. <hi>Esai.</hi> 4.4. Hee worketh out by degrees the drosse and impurity of our nature, and services. First, by faith fixing upon better promises and hopes than lust can make, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 26. Secondly, by watchfulnesse, eying corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and so stirring up those arguments and principles which are strongest against them, <hi>Iob</hi> 31.1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.1. Thirdly, by leading us to more acquaintance with God in knowledge, love and communion, <hi>Iob</hi> 22.21. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.3. and so fetching more wisedome and strength from him: for this is the way that wee get all our strength, even by learning of him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12. Fourthly, by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heart to hate, and to complaine of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to bemone it selfe, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.18, 19. Fifthly, by bringing the heart into the light, there to approve and judge its acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.20. by setting it alwayes in Gods eye, that it may not sinne against him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.8. Sixthly, by convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the heart of the beauty and excellencie of Grace, of the unlikenesse of sinne to God, and so making the soule more full of desires for the one, and against the other, <hi>Esai.</hi> 26.8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. and thus kindling lust against lust, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. Seventhly, by being alwayes a present Monitour and Watchman in the soule, to supply it with spirituall weapons and reasonings against the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of lust, <hi>Esai.</hi> 30.31. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26. Lastly, in one word, by daily supplies from the residue of Spirit which is in our head, whereby according to the proportion and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the members, he floweth into them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. This is that seed, that leaven, that vitall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, which is ever in the heart, setting it selfe against
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:16264:258"/>
the workings and life of lust, and by little and little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting it away as fire doth water.</p>
            <p>The grand instrument of Satan and lust (who are the two leaders in this warre against Christ) is the <hi>wicked world.</hi> The power, malice, wisedome, learning, or any other either naturall or acquir'd abilities of evill men: for even in an earthly respect by the word <hi>kings,</hi> we are not onely to understand those Monarchs, and princes of the earth who set themselves against Christ; but all such as excell in any such worldly abilities as may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that opposition. It notes the strength, policie, pride and greatnesse of minde, or scorne of subjection, which is in the heart against Christ. So that <hi>king</hi> heere stands in opposition to <hi>subject,</hi> they who reject Christs yoke, and breake his bonds asunder, and will not have him to raigne over them, those are the <hi>kings</hi> in the Text. And these also will hee smite through and confound by the Power of his Word, and the strength of his arme. The Lord gave the Word, great was the company of those that published it. <hi>Kings of armies did fly apace, and she that tarried at home divided the spoile, Psal.</hi> 68.11, 12. <hi>Tophet is ordained of old, for the king it is prepared, Esai.</hi> 30.33. Come, and gather your selves together unto the Supper of the great God. <hi>That ye may eate the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captaines, and the flesh of mightie men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great, &amp;c. Revel.</hi> 19.17, 18. As for those mine enemies <hi>which would not that I should raigne over them, bring them hither, and slay them before me, Luk.</hi> 19.27. <hi>Be wise now, ye kings, be instructed, ye Iudges of the earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 2.10, 11, 12</note> 
               <hi>Serve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trembling; kisse the Sonne lest he bee angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.</hi> Thus the Lord over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth his Churches enemies, and protecteth it against al their greatest preparations, &amp; most formidable power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:16264:259"/>And this he doth severall wayes; sometimes, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting their forces from his Church into some other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary channell, or ambitious designe of their owne. Thus <hi>Rabshakah</hi> and his hoast were called from Iudah, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.7, 8. so the Lord promised his people that when they went up to appeare before him thrice a yeere he would divert the desires of their enemies from their land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.24. Thus <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, having but two maine plots to honour (as he supposed) his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and his idols withall, the subduing of the Persian, and the rooting out of the Galileans, as he called them; was prevented from this by being first overthrowne in the other; for the prosperous successe of which expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he vowed unto his idoll-gods a sacrifice of all the Christians in the Empire,<note place="margin">

Sometimes by infatuating, and implanting a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of giddinesse and distraction in the enemies of his Church, making them destitute both of counsell and courage. When God would punish Babylon (which was a type of the enemies of Christs Kingdome) hee made their hearts melt, that they should bee amazed at one another, and their faces should be like flames, <hi>Esay</hi> 13.7, 8. that is, not onely pale like a flame, but rather, as I conceive, full of varietie of fearefull impressions, and distracted passions: nothing so tremulous, so various, so easily bended every way with the smallest blast as a flame: so their feare should make their bloud and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in their faces to tremble, quiver, and varie, to come and goe like a thinne flame in them; so God threatneth to mingle a perverse spirit, to make the spirit of Egypt faile in them, and their wisedome to perish, <hi>Esal.</hi> 19.1, 2, 3, 14, 17. and thus likewise the Lord dealt with <hi>Iulian</hi> in that Persian expedition, he put a spirit of folly in him to burne his ships,<note place="margin">

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by hardning them unto a most desperate prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their owne ruine, as in the case of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to lift at the stone so long, till it loosen, and fall upon them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.44.

By these and a world the like meanes doth the Lord overthrow the enemies of his kingdome.</p>
            <p>Now all this is <hi>In the day of his wrath,</hi> or in his owne due time: where we may note by the way, that Christ hath wrath in him aswell as mercie. Though hee be by wicked and secure men misconceived, as if he were only compassionate: yet <hi>laesa patientia fit furor,</hi> he will more sorely judge them hereafter, whom hee doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade nor allure here. So mercifull he is, that he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Lambe</hi> for meeknesse, and yet so terrible, that he is called a <hi>Lion</hi> for fury. It is true, <hi>fury is not in him,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to those that apprehend his strength and make their peace with him, <hi>Esay</hi> 27.4.6. But yet to those that will not kisse, that is, not love, worship, nor obey him, hee
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:16264:261"/>
can with a little wrath shew himselfe very terrible, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.12. He commeth <hi>first with peace, Luke</hi> 10.5. but it is <hi>Pax concessa,</hi> not <hi>pax emendicata,</hi> a peace mercifully of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, not a peace growing out of any necessity or exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies on his part, and so wrought by way of composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his owne advantages. The peace of a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.10. A peace which putteth conditions to those to whom it is granted, that they shall be tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and servants unto him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.10, 11, 12. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle saith, that he came to preach or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime peace, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.17. but if we reject it, he then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the directions of <hi>Ioshua, These mine enemies which would not have me to raigne over them, bring them hither and slay them before me, Luke</hi> 19.27.</p>
            <p>But the maine thing here to be noted is, that Christ hath <hi>a Day,</hi> a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a prefixed, and constituted time wherein hee will be avenged on the greatest of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. When he forbeares, and suffers them to prevaile, yet still he holdeth the line in his owne hand, the hooke of his decree is in their nostrils, and he can take them short when hee will. It is never want of power, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or love to his Church, that their quarrell is not presently revenged; but all these are fitted to his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory. The Lord seemeth to neglect, to breake up the hedge, to sleepe while his Church is sinking (as Christ to his Disciples seemed carelesse, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.38, 39.) so frequently in Scripture the Saints expostulate with God in an humble and mourning debate, <hi>Why sleepest thou, O Lord? Arise, cast us not off for ever, Psal.</hi> 44.23. <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.8, 9. But God hath his <hi>quare</hi> against us too for this infirmitie and haste of ours: <hi>Why sayest thou O Iacob, and speakest O Israel, my way is hid from the Lord, and my judgement is passed over from my God?</hi> That is, he hath not taken notice of my calamitie. <hi>Hast thou not knowne, hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:16264:261"/>
neither is weary? There is no searching of his understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Esay</hi> 40.27, 28. He is wonderfull in counsell and excellent in working; and therefore he doth not slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nor sleepe: but only in wisdome ordereth times and seasons, that there may in the end be the greater glory unto him, and, in the things done, the more beautie. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> is <hi>beautifull in its time</hi>; if you gather it before, it loseth both its beauty and vertue. It would bee a madnesse for a man to mow downe his corne when it is in the greene blade. Hee waiteth, saith the Apostle, for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.7. Now the Prophet assureth us, that <hi>Light,</hi> that is, comfort, refreshment, peace, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>is sowne for the righteous, Psal.</hi> 97.11. It was sowen for the people of God when they were in captivity, though to themselves they seemed as dead men in their graves, yet indeed they were dead but as seed in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, which revived againe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 126.5, 6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord likewise (like Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) is said <hi>to wait,</hi> that he may be gracious to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Esay</hi> 30.18. Though a man suffer never so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and be most violently kept out of his owne right, yet he must wait till time and mature proceedings have brought on his matters to a triall; therefore the Lord calleth it <hi>The yeare of recompences for the controversies of Sion, Esay</hi> 34.8. It is not for private men to order the periods, or stints, or revolutions of times wherein busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are to be tried; but publike authoritie constitutes that, and every man must wait for the appointed time: so the Church must not set God the times when it would bee heard or eased; but must trust his wisedome and power, <hi>Ier.</hi> 49.19. for there is a <hi>set time</hi> wherein he will have mercy upon Sion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.13.</p>
            <p>Now this Time is ruled and bounded by these consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations: First, when the sinne of the enemie is growen ripe, and his heart proud and insolent against God and
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:16264:262"/>
his people; when he trampleth upon the poore, when he sacrificeth to his owne net, when he adoreth his owne counsels, when he deifieth his owne condition, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that none can pull him downe; then is it a time for God to shew himselfe, and to stir up his glory. <hi>It is time</hi> (saith <hi>David) for thee, O Lord, to worke, for they have made void thy Law, Psal.</hi> 119.126. So outragious they are, that their fury runneth over from thy servants to thine ordinances, to blot out the very records of heaven, the name and feare of God out of the earth. And this reason and period of time wee finde frequently in the Scriptures given: <hi>In the fourth generation they shall come hither againe, for the iniquitie of the Amorites is not yet full, Gen.</hi> 15.16. It is not growen to that ripenesse and compasse, as I in my wise, secret, and patient providence will permit. <hi>O thou that dwellest upon many waters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in treasures</hi> (saith the Lord to Babylon) <hi>thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousnesse, Ier.</hi> 51.13. when men have filled up the measure of their sinne, then is their end come; bee their wealth, or safety, or their naturall, or acquired munition never so great: <hi>Put you in the sickle,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>for the harvest is ripe, come get you downe for the presse is full, the fats over-flow, for the wickednesse is great, Ioel</hi> 3.13. When wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is so great, that it filleth all the vessels, then is the Lord ready to put in his sickle, and to cut it downe.</p>
            <p>It is further demanded <hi>when sinne is full?</hi> To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that there are three things principally which set forth the fulnesse of sinne, <hi>Vniversality, Impudence</hi> and <hi>Obstinacy:</hi> First, when a whole Land is filled with it, that there are none to intercede or to stand in the gap, when from Streets to Palaces, from Houses to Courts, from Schooles to Churches, from every corner sinne breaketh forth, so that bloud toucheth bloud. <hi>The Land is full of adulterers,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>because of swearers the Land mourneth—for both Priest and Prophet are profane,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:16264:262"/>
yea in my house have I found their wickednesse, saith the Lord, Ier.</hi> 23.10, 11. when in every place, and at every view there are new, and <hi>more abominations, Ezek.</hi> 8.17.<note place="margin">Esay 48.4. Ier. 3.3.</note> 
               <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.1-6. Secondly, when sinne is <hi>impudent,</hi> whorish and outragious; when there is no feare, modesty or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, but it breaketh all bonds, and like a raging sea overrunneth the bankes. <hi>They declare their sinne as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>

This is that which the Apostle calleth <hi>An excesse of riot,</hi> and the Prophet, a <hi>rushing like an horse into the battell.</hi> Now when God thus gives a man over, sinne will not be long a filling up; when lusts breake forth, and throng to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when from concupiscence sinne goes on to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and delight, to formation and contrivance, to birth and execution, to education, and custome, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances and defence, to glory and boasting, to insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,<note place="margin">

               </note> hardnesse, and a reprobate sense, then there is such a fulnesse in sinne as is neere unto cursing, the very next step is hell. Lastly, when sinne holds out in <hi>stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornenesse,</hi> and is incorrigible, when the remedy is refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the pardon rejected, the peace not accepted; Then is sinne come to its fulnesse. The sinne of the Amorites was never quite full, but when they rejected that peace, mercy, and subjection to Gods people, which was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them first. But when men sinne against those meanes of grace which are sent unto them, and <hi>leave no remedie</hi> to themselves; no marvell if the Lord give them over, and let in the enemie upon them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must take heed of finishing sinne, for it is <hi>not sin,</hi> but the consummation and <hi>finishing of sinne</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes a man.</p>
            <p>Now when thus the sinne of the enemie is growne so ripe, that it breaketh forth into pride and insultation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods people, then is the Lords time to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:16264:263" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>I will restore health unto thee,</hi> saith the Lord to his Church, <hi>and I will heale thee of thy wounds, because they called thee an out-cast, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is Sion whom no man seeketh after, Ier.</hi> 30.17. see <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25.3.28.6—9. <hi>Obad.</hi> v. 3, 4. when the high wayes were waste, and the way-faring man ceased, and the enemie regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no man— <hi>Now, saith the Lord, will I arise, now will I be exalted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Esay</hi> 33.8—11. when the enemies help forward the affliction of Gods people, and by their pride and insultation doe double the misery which is upon them, then will the Lord returne to them in mercies, and be sore displeased with his enemies, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>Esay</hi> 40.2.47.5, 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when Gods people are throughly humbled and purged, for God useth wicked men but as his staffe or weapon, as his fire or fan to correct and purge them, <hi>Esay</hi> 10.12. He intendeth not in his punishments such severity against them, as against their enemies: if the rod be for the childe, the fire is for the rod, <hi>Esay</hi> 27.7, 8.9. When men are so smitten, that they can returne to him that smiteth them, and not revolt more and more, for God will not throw any more darts at those who are sunke and dead already: when they are stirred in their hearts joyntly to seeke the Lord, and to meet him in the way of his judgements, and to compassionate and favour the dust of Sion, then is the day of his wrath; for when Gods time to deliver a people is come, he will more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly stirre up the hearts of his people to pray for it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.16.17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2.3. whereas, when he will destroy a people, hee will not suffer his Saints to pray, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when all humane hopes and expectations are gone, when a people is so pilled and broken, that they have no courage, meanes, succours or probabilities left, then is Gods time to deliver his Church, and to punish his enemies: <hi>The Lord shall judge his people, and repent
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:16264:263"/>
himselfe for his Servants, when hee seeth that their power is gone, Deut.</hi> 32.36. <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.20, 109·31. In one word when the preparations and premises as it were unto Gods glory are best ordered, and put together, then is the day of his wrath come.</p>
            <p>The Church then need not to bee cast downe with the insultation of her enemies,<note place="margin">Deut. 20.3, 4. Esai. 51.12, 13. Deut. 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6, 7, 8.</note> since Christ is the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever; such as hee was ever to his Church, such hee is still. If hee have delivered his Church from the pride of her enemies heretofore, his power, truth, watchfulnesse, compassion is the same still; and by faith in them wee may rebuke Satan, wee may chide away the weaknesse and feare of our owne hearts, wee may rejoice against those that insult over us, when they rage most wee may hope their time is short, and that it is but the biting of a wounded beast. Therefore wee finde the Saints in Scripture arme themselves against present dangers, with the consideration of what God hath done for his Church in times past, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.7, 8.74.13-18. <hi>Esai.</hi> 51.9, 10, 11. <hi>Habak.</hi> 3. And in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the same truth and power breake forth into a holy scorne of their enemies, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.8, 9, 10. <hi>Esai.</hi> 50.8, 9. In the sorest extremities wee may fix our faith on God, and hee delighteth to bee depended upon alone, when all outward helpes and probabilities faile, see <hi>Esai.</hi> 41.17, 18. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. A million of men came against <hi>Asa,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 31.8.</note> one of the hugest hoasts of men that were ever read of, yet by relying on God they were all delivered into his hand; and the reason is added, because God hath eyes, and strength, or as hee is described, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5, 6. Seven hornes and seven eyes, much wisedome, and much power to shew himselfe valiant in the behalfe of those that walke uprightly, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.8, 9.</p>
            <p>Wee should learne likewise to rejoyce and triumph with all thankfulnesse of heart when Christ subdueth the enemies of his Kingdome, and giveth deliverance and
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:16264:264"/>
refreshment to his people. When hee maketh his hand knowen to his servants, and his fury to his enemies, then should all they that love Hierusalem rejoyce, <hi>Esai.</hi> 66.10. Thus the Church after they were delivered from the malice of <hi>Haman</hi> instituted days of joy and feasting, <hi>Ester</hi> 9.22. It is a signe of an evill heart against the peace and prosperity of the Church of Christ, to envie, or slight, or thinke basely of the instruments and wayes whereby Christ delivereth it; as wee see in <hi>Tobiah</hi> and <hi>Sanballat, Nehem.</hi> 4.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Lastly, wee should learne wisedome to lay hold on the times and seasons of Gods peace, because hee hath a day of wrath too; to apprehend the offers and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of grace. Christ had been at the Churches dore, and had knocked for admittance; but neglecting that season, hee was gone, and much shee suffer'd before shee could finde him againe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2-7. When the Lord speaketh unto us in his ordinances, and by the secret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and perswasions of his holy Spirit, wee should not deferre, nor put him off, as <hi>Felix</hi> did <hi>Paul</hi> to some other time, but pursue the occasion, and set our selves to doe every duty <hi>in Gods time.</hi> There is a time for every worke, and it is beautifull onely in its time; and therefore fit it is, that wee should observe wisely the signes and nature of the times, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.2. And accordingly proportion our devotions for the Church and our selves. It is the worst losse of time, to let slip the seasons of grace, and spirituall wisedome, till it may bee Gods time of mercy is passed over. If thou hadst knowen in this <hi>thy day</hi> the thing that concerne thy Peace. But now thy day is over, and my day of wrath is come, they are now hidden from thine eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee shall judge amongst the Heathen.</hi>] By <hi>heathen</hi> we are to understand the same with <hi>Enemies, vers.</hi> 1. and <hi>People, Esai.</hi> 63.6. Meaning all the armies and swarmes of Christs enemies either spirituall or secular. The word
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:16264:264"/>
               <hi>Gentiles</hi> was a word of great contempt and detestation amongst God people,<note place="margin">

Therefore the Apostle saith of the Ephesians, that in times passed <hi>they had been Gentiles in the flesh, Eph.</hi> 2.11. As if by being Christians they had ceased to bee Gentiles, or rather that word had ceased to bee a terme of reproach. So that <hi>Gentile</hi> was a word of scorne, as <hi>Samaritan, Ioh.</hi> 8.48. or <hi>Canaanite, Ezek.</hi> 16.3. or <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, Matth.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. And therefore wee finde those two still joyned together <hi>Publicans and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>; and so the Apostle joyneth these two words <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and sinners, Gal.</hi> 2.15. So then the word <hi>Heathen</hi> is added by <hi>David</hi> to the enemies of Christ, to render them the more odious, and to expresse their more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and hatefull condition; and therefore when God would cast notable reproach upon his people hee calleth them <hi>Sodomites, and Gentiles, Esai.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.3. So then the meaning is, his most abject and hatefull enemies, that are unto him as Iewes and Samaritans, hee shall judge, that is, hee shall condemne and punish them.</p>
            <p>Whence wee may note, That <hi>Christs victorie over his enemies shall bee by way of pleading and disceptation.</hi> His military is likewise a judiciary proceeding grounded upon righteous and established Lawes. Therefore the day of Gods wrath is called a time of vengeance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the <hi>Controversies of Sion, Esai.</hi> 34.8. To shew that the Lord doth not take vengeance but by way of debate. And therefore when hee punisheth, hee is said to plead with men. The Priest said not where is the Lord, and they that handle the Law knew mee not, &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the Lord, and with your Childrens Children will I plead, Ier.</hi> 2.8, 9. So to <hi>plead</hi> and to <hi>take vengeance</hi> goe together, <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.36. And the Lord is said to <hi>reprove with equitie</hi>; and to smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; that
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:16264:265"/>
is, to convince, and argue before hee doth punish, <hi>Esai.</hi> 11.4. as wee see in the case of <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 18.21-33. Herein the Lord sheweth that all our misery beginnes at our selves. That if wee perish, it is because we would not take his counsell, nor be guided by his will; That hee did not sell us to any of his creditors, but that for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities we <hi>sold our selves, Esai.</hi> 50.1. In humane warres, though never so regularly and righteously ordered, yet many particular men may perish without any personall guilt of their owne. <hi>Delirant Reges, plectuntur Achivi.</hi> But in these warres of Christ, there shall not a man pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, till hee bee first convinc'd by a judiciary proceeding, of his owne demerit. Every mouth must bee stopp'd, and all the world by the evidence and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their owne conscience become guilty before God, before his wrath shall seise upon them. The Lord sent <hi>Noah</hi> to preach, before hee sent a floud to destroy the old world. He argued with <hi>Adam</hi> before he thrust him out of Paradise. The voyce goeth ever before the rod, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.9. This course our Savior observed towards him who had not the wedding garment. First, convinced him till hee was speechlesse, and then cast him into utter darknesse, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.12, 13. And this course the Lord tooke with his people when hee punished them, <hi>Esai.</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>Amos</hi> 2.11.3.7. For hee will have the consciences of men to subscribe, and acknowledge the justnesse of his proceedings, and to condemne themselves by their owne witnesse; when hee entreth into judgement hee doth it by <hi>line and plummet, Esai.</hi> 28.17. In proportion to the meanes of grace neglected, to the patience and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance abused, to the times of grace overslipped, to the purity of the Law violated and profaned. We must take heed therefore of continuing Gentiles, of being aliens from that commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant of promise, of living without God in the world. No man can with hope or comfort say, <hi>Enter not
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:16264:265"/>
into judgement,</hi> but hee who is the <hi>Lords servant,</hi> and of his houshold; wee must be all ingrafted into the naturall Olive, and become the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iewes by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> before Christ will bee our peace or reconcile us unto his Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29.11.17-24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11-14.</p>

            <p>Others understand the meanes whereby Christ should

thus lift up his head and exalt himselfe above all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his Kingdome, namely by his <hi>Passion,</hi> and <hi>suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi>; by death destroying death and him that had the power of death, which is the Devill.

               <hi>He shall drinke of the brooke in the way</hi>] By Brooke then or Torrent we may understand the wrath of God, and the rage of men. The afflictions and sufferings which befell Christ. And this is a very frequent Metaphore in holy Scriptures to understand afflictions by water, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.4, 5.42.7.69.1.124.4, 5. So the wrath of the Lord is called a streame, and a lake, <hi>Esay</hi> 30.33. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.20.

It is said in the History of Christs passion, when he was going to wrestle with that woefull agony in the garden, that <hi>hee passed over the brooke Cedron. Ioh.</hi> 18.1. And we may observe in the History of the Kings, that when the good Kings <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Asa,</hi> and <hi>Iosiah,</hi> purged the Citie and the Temple of idolatry, <hi>they burnt the cursed things at the brooke Kidron, and cast them thereinto,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 16. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.16.30.14. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.6. To note un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us that that brooke was the sinke, as it were, of the Temple, that into which al the <hi>purgamenta,</hi> and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of Gods house, all the <hi>cursed things</hi> were to bee cast; with relation whereunto it is not improbable that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> by a propheticall spirit might noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the sufferings of Christ, by drinking of that cursed brooke over which hee was to passe, to signifie that on
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:16264:267"/>
him all the faithfull might lay and powre ut their sins, who is therefore said to be <hi>made sinne and a curse for us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. As the people when they laid their hands on the head of the sacrifice, did thereby, as it were, unload all their sinnes upon it.</p>
            <p>Now as waters signifie Afflictions; so there are two words with relation thereunto, which signifie suffering of afflictions, and they are both applied unto Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.22. Are yee able to <hi>drinke</hi> of the cup that I shall drinke of, or be <hi>baptized</hi> with that Baptisme that I am baptized with? He that drinketh hath the water in him; he that is dipped or plunged, hath the water about him: So it notes the universalitie of the wrath which Christ suffered, it was <hi>within him, My soule is heavie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death</hi>; and it was all <hi>about him,</hi> betrayed by <hi>Iudas,</hi> accused by Iewes, forsaken by Disciples, mocked by <hi>Herod,</hi> condemned by <hi>Pilate,</hi> buffeted by the servants, nailed by the souldiers, reviled by the theeves and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, and which was all in all, forsaken by his Father.

               </gap>, a great and fixed gulfe, which all the world can neither wade thorow, nor remove. The Law at first was an easie and smooth way to righteousnesse, and from thence to salvation, but now every step thereof sinkes as low as hell. It is written within and without with cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which way soever a man stirres, he findes nothing but death before him: one mans way by the civility of his education, the ingenuitie of his disposition, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of other ends or relations, may seeme more smooth and plausible than anothers, but by nature they all runne into hell, as all rivers, though never so different in other circumstances, runne into the sea. It is as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a naturall man of himselfe to escape damnation, as it is to make himselfe no childe of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> or not to have beene begotten by fleshly parents. The <hi>Gulfe</hi> of sin in our nature cannot be cleansed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Guilt</hi> thereof cannot be removed. The <hi>Image</hi> we have lost is by us <hi>unrepairable</hi>; the <hi>Law</hi> we have violated, <hi>inoxorable</hi>; the <hi>Iustice</hi> we have injured, <hi>unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfiable</hi>; the <hi>concupiscence</hi> of our nature <hi>insatiable, sinne</hi> an aversion from an <hi>infinite</hi> good, and a conversion to the creature infinitely; and therefore the <hi>Guilt</hi> thereof infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and <hi>unremoveable</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="516" facs="tcp:16264:268"/>We should learne often to meditate on this point, to finde our selves reduced unto these straits and impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that we cannot see which way to turne, or to helpe our selves, for that is the onely way to draw us unto Christ. Every man naturally loves to be in the first place beholding to himselfe; in any extremity, if his owne wits, purse, projects, or endevours will helpe him out, hee lookes no further; but when all his owne succours have forsaken him, then hee seekes abroad. It is much more true in the matter of salvation; no man ever did begin at Christ, but went unto him upon meere necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when he had experience of the emptinesse of all his other succours and dependencies, we all by nature are offended at him, and will not have him to reigne over us, till thereunto we be forced by the evidence of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and unpreventable misery, under which without him we must sinke for ever. This is of all other the most urging argument unto men at first to consider, that there is a torrent of curses, a sea of death, a raigne of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, a hell of sinne within, and a hell of torments without betweene them and their salvation; and there is no drop of that sea, no scruple of that curse, no title of that Law, which must not all be either fulfilled or endured. Suppose that God should summon thy guilty soule to a sudden apparance before his tribunall of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and should there begin to deale with thee even at thy mothers wombe: Alas, thou wouldest be utterly gone there; even there a seed of evill doers, the spawne of viperous and serpentine parents, a cursed childe, a childe of wrath, an exact image of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and of the bloud of Satan. But then here is after this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a catalogue, and history of sinnes of forty, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or three score yeeres long. And in them every inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate motion of the will, every sudden stirring, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret working of inward lust, every idle word, every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane aspect, every impertinencie and irregularity of
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:16264:268"/>
life, scored up against thy poore soule, and each of them to be produced at the last, and either answered or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged. O where shall the ungodly and sinners appeare if they have not right in Christ? And how should men labour to be secured in that right? Who would suffer so many millions of obligations and indictments to lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and God, uncancelled, and not labour to have them taken out of the way? Now the onely way to be brought hereunto is, to deny our selves and all we doe; to doe no good thing for this end that we may rest in it, or rely upon it when we have done, but after all to judge our selves unprofitable servants: when wee have prayed, to see hell betweene heaven and our prayers; when wee have preached, to see hell betweene heaven and our sermons; when we have done any worke of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, to see hell between heaven and all our services, if God should marke what is amisse in them, and should enter into judgement with us: In one word, to see hell betweene heaven and any thing in the world else, save onely betweene Christ and heaven. Till in this manner men be qualified for mercy, they will have no heart to desire it, and God hath no purpose to conferre it. Christ must be esteemed worthy of all acceptation, before God bestowes him: and the way so to esteeme of him is, to feele our selves the greatest of all sinners. And when the soule is thus once humbled with the taste and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that worme-wood and gall which is in sinne, there is then an immediate passage unto hope and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.19—22. and that hope is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Christ hath drunken up, and dried that torrent of curses</hi> which was betweene us and heaven, and hath made a passage through them all by himselfe unto his Fathers Kingdome. He was made sinne and a curse for us, that so hee might swallow up sinne and death, and might bee the destruction of hell, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.14. I will here but touch upon two things. First, <hi>What Christ suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
               <pb n="518" facs="tcp:16264:269"/>
Secondly, <hi>why he suffered:</hi> for understanding of the first we must note, first, that Christ <hi>Humane</hi> nature was by the <hi>hypostaticall Vnion</hi> exalted unto many dignities, which to all the Creatures in the world besides are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incommunicable; as the communication of properties, the adoration of Angels, the primogenitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the cooperation with the Deitie in many mighty workes, the satisfaction of an infinite Justice by a finite passion, &amp;c. Exalted likewise it was <hi>by his spirituall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> above all his fellowes, with that unmeasurable ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of grace, as wonderfully surpasseth the united and cumulated perfections of all the Angels in heaven. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee must note likewise, that all these things Christ received for the worke of mans Redemption, and therefore he had them in such a maner as was most sute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and convenient for the execution of that worke. Now Christ was to fulfill that worke by a way of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and obedience, by death to destroy him that had the power of death, as <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Goliahs</hi> sword slew him that was master of the sword. As there fell a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tempestuous winde upon the red sea, whereby the passage was opened for Israel to goe out of Egypt into Canaan; so Christ was to be torne and divided by his sufferings, that so there might be a passage for us to God, through that sea of wrath which was betweene our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt and our Canaan, our sinne and our Salvation. Here then are two generall Rules to be observed concerning the sufferings of Christ. First, that the Oeconomie or dispensation of his Mediatorship is the measure of all that he suffered. So much as that required, he did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and more he did not: for though he suffered as man, yet he suffered not because he was a man, but because he was a Mediator. Secondly, in as much as a Mediatour betweene God and sinners was to be holy and separate from sinners (for if he should have beene a sinner, he had beene one of the parties, and not a Mediator) therefore
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:16264:269"/>
none of those sufferings which are repugnant to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and, by consequence, unserviceable to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of his office, could belong unto him. Such things then as did no way prejudice the plenitude of his grace, the union of his natures, the quality of his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, such things as were suteable to his person, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for our pardon, such as were possible for him, and such as were necessary for us, those things he suffered as the punishments of our sinnes.</p>
            <p>Now punishments are of severall sorts; some are sins, some onely from sinnes. Some things in severall respects are both sinnes and punishments. <note n="*" place="margin">

As hardnesse of heart, and a reprobate sense. Other punishments are <hi>from sinne,</hi> and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard sinne is two wayes considerable, either as <hi>inherent,</hi> or as <hi>imputed:</hi> from sinne as <hi>inherent,</hi> or from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousnesse of sinne in a mans selfe, doth arise remorse, or torment and the worme of conscience. Againe, sinne as <hi>imputed</hi> may be considered two wayes; either it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi> upon a ground <hi>in nature,</hi> because the persons to whom it is imputed are <hi>naturally one</hi> with him that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally committed it, and so it doth <hi>seminally</hi> descend, and is derived upon them. Thus <hi>Adams</hi> sinne of eating the forbidden fruit is imputed unto us, and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof on us derived, namely the privation of Gods Image, and the corruption of our nature. Or else it is <hi>imputed</hi> upon a ground of <hi>voluntary contract,</hi> vadimonie, or susception, so that the guilt thereupon growing is not a <hi>derived,</hi> but an <hi>assumed guilt,</hi> which did not bring with it any <hi>desert,</hi> or worthinesse to suffer, but onely an obligation and obnoxiousnesse thereunto. As if a sober and honest person be suretie for a prodigall and luxurious man, who spending his estate upon courses of intemperance and excesse, hath disabled himselfe to
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:16264:270"/>
pay any of his debts; the one doth for his vitious disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility deserve imprisonment, unto which the other is as liable as he, though without any such personall desert. Now then the punishments which Christ suffered are onely such as agree unto sinne thus imputed, <note n="*" place="margin">

Againe, in punishments we are to distinguish betweene <hi>punishments inflicted</hi> from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and <hi>punishments ingenerated,</hi> and immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting from the condition of the person that suffereth. Or betweene the <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> of the men that are punished. Punishments inflicted are those paines and dolorous impressions which God either by his owne immediate hand, or by the ministery of such instruments as he is pleased to use, doth lay upon the soule or body of a man. Punishments ingenerated are those which grow out of the <hi>weakenesse</hi> and <hi>wickednesse</hi> of the person lying under the sore and invincible pressure of those paines which are thus inflicted. As Blasphemie, despaire, and the worme of conscience. In one word, some evils of punishment are <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Infirmitates quaedam vitiosae, quaedam miserae. Aug.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>vitious,</hi> either <hi>formally</hi> in themselves or <hi>fundamentally,</hi> and by way of connotation in regard of the originals thereof in the person suffering them. Others are onely <hi>dolorous</hi> and <hi>miserable,</hi> which presse nature, but doe no way defile it, nor referre to any either pollution or impotency in the person suffering them, and of this sort onely were the punishments of Christ.</p>
            <p>Now these punishments which Christ thus suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red are either <hi>inchoate</hi> or <hi>consummate; inchoate,</hi> as all those penall defects of our nature which neither were sinnes, nor grounded upon the inherence of sinnes (for hee tooke not our personall, but onely our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall defects.) And these were either corporeall, as hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thirst, wearinesse, and the like; or spirituall, as feare, griefe, sorrow, temptations, &amp;c. <hi>consummate,</hi> were those which he suffered at last. And these likewise were either corporeall, as shame, mockings, buffets,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:16264:270"/>
trials, scourgings, condemnation, an ignominious and a cursed death. Or spirituall, and those were principally two. First, a punishment of <hi>Dereliction. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee? Matth.</hi> 27.46. There was some kinde of separation betweene God and Christ during the time of his sufferings for sinne in that cursed manner. For understanding wherof we must note that he had a <hi>fourfold Vnion</hi> unto God? First, <hi>In his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which was so fast united in his person to the divine, that death it selfe did not separate it either from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or from the deitie. It was the Lord that lay in the grave. Secondly, <hi>In Love,</hi> and so there was never any separation neither, but when hee hanged on the Crosse, hee was still the beloved Sonne of his Father, in whom hee was well pleased. Thirdly, <hi>In the Communion of his Spirit and Holinesse</hi>; and in that regard likewise there was no disunion, for hee was offered up as a lambe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot or blemish. Lastly, <hi>In the fruition of the light of his countenance,</hi> and of his glory and favor, and in this respect there was for the time of his sufferings a dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>subtractione visionis, non dissolutione unionis,</hi> by the withdrawing of his countenance, not by the dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his union. Hee looked upon Christ as a God armed against the sinnes of the world which were then upon him. Secondly, There was a <hi>punishment of male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> Hee did undergoe the curse of the Law, hee did graple with the wrath of God, and with the powers of darknesse, hee felt the scourges due unto our sinnes in his humane nature, which squeezed and wrung from him those strong cries, those deepe and woefull complaints, that bloudy and bitter sweate, which drew compassion from the very rocks. And surely it is no derogation to the dignity of Christs person, but on the other side a great magnifying of the Iustice of God against sinne, of the power of Christ against the Law, and of the mercy of them both towards sinners, to affirme, that the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:16264:271"/>
of Christ, what-ever they were in <hi>specie</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the kinde of them, were yet <hi>in pondere,</hi> in their weight and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, equally grievous with those which we should have suffered; for being in all things save sinne like unto us, and most of all in his liablenesse to the curse of the Law (so farre as it did not necessarily denotate either sinne inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or weaknesse to breake through in the person suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering) why hee should not bee obnoxious to as great extremities of paine, I see no reason; for no degree of meere anguish and dolor can bee unbefitting the person of him who was to bee knowne by that Title, <hi>A man of sorrowes.</hi> And surely farre more indignity it was to him to suffer a violent death of body from the hands of base men, than to suffer with patience, obedience, and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie farre sorer stripes from the hand of God his Father, who was pleased upon him to lay the iniquity of us all.</p>
            <p>For the second thing proposed, <hi>Why Christ suffered</hi> these things; The Scripture giveth principally these <hi>five reasons:</hi> First, to execute the decrees of his Father, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.27, 28. Secondly, to fulfill the prophesies, prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and predictions of Holy Scriptures, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.46. Thirdly, to magnifie his mercy, and free love to sinners, and most impotent enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. Fourthly, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Righteousnesse and truth of God against sinne, who would not bee reconciled with sinners but upon a legall expiation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. For although wee may not limit the unsearchable wisedome and wayes of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug. de Trin. lib.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp; de Agone Christiano, To.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> as if hee could no other way have saved man; yet wee are bound to adore this meanes, as being by him selected out of that infinite treasure of his owne counsell, as most <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi> to set forth his wonderfull hate of sinne, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable Iustice and severity against it, his unsearchable riches of love and mercy towards sinners, and in all things to make way to the manifestation of his glory. Lastly, To shew forth his owne power which had strength to stand under all this punishment of sinne, and
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:16264:271"/>
at last to shake it off and to declare himselfe to bee the Sonne of God by the resurrection from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. For though Christ did exceedingly feare, and for that seeme to decline and pray against these his passions: yet none of that was out of jealousie, or suspicion that hee should not breake through them. But hee feared them as being paines <hi>unavoidable,</hi> which hee was most certainly to suffer; and as paines very <hi>heavie</hi> and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, which hee should not overcome without much bitternesse, and very woefull conflict. Now for a word of the last Clause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore shall hee lift up the Head.</hi>] Wee may hence observe, that <hi>Christ hath conquered all his sufferings by his owne power.</hi> As in his passion when hee suffered hee <hi>Bowed downe his head</hi> before-hand, and gave up the ghost with a loud voice, to note that his sufferings were voluntary, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.30. So in his resurrection hee is said to <hi>lift up his head himselfe,</hi> to note that hee had <hi>life in himselfe,</hi> that hee was the <hi>Prince of Life,</hi> that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him to be held under by death (as we were by the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6.) And that his exaltation was <hi>voluntary</hi> likewise and from his owne power, for he was not to have any assistant in the worke of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to doe all alone, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19.5.26.10.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p>If it bee objected that Christ was raised from the dead <hi>by the Glory of his Father,</hi> and that hee raised him up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33. To this I answer that this was not by way of supplement and succor to make up any defect of power in Christ; but onely <hi>by way of consent to</hi> Christs owne power and action, that so men might joyntly honour the Sonne and the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.19-26. Or by the <hi>Glorie of the Father</hi> wee may understand that glorious power which the Father gave unto his Sonne in the flesh, to have life in himselfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.26. annexing thereunto a command to exercise the same Power, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
               <pb n="524" facs="tcp:16264:272"/>
10.18. Or hee is said to bee raised by himselfe and his Father both, because that Holy Spirit which immediatly quickned him (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.) was both his and his Fathers. It was not any personall thing wherein the Sonne differ'd from the Father which raised Iesus from the dead, but that Spirit which was common to them both.</p>
            <p>To conclude then with the consideration of those great benefits, and that excellent use which this resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ doth serve for unto us. First, it assureth us of the <hi>accomplishment of his workes of mediation on earth,</hi> and that he is now in the execution of those other offices which remaine to bee fulfilled by him in heaven for the application of his Sacrifice unto us; for having in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection justified himselfe hee thereby rose for our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification likewise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. For if the debt had not been taken quite off by the suretie, it would have lien upon the principall still. And therefore the Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the resurrection by this that Gods mercies are <hi>sure, Act.</hi> 13.34. Whereas if Christ were not risen from the dead wee should bee yet in our sinnes, and so by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the mercies of <hi>David</hi> should have failed us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17, 18. And for this reason it is (as I conceive) that the Lord sent an Angell to remove the stone from the mouth of the sepulcher; not to supply any want of power in him, who could himselfe have roled away the stone with one of his fingers; but as a Iudge when the Law is satisfied sendeth an officer to open the prison-doores to him who hath made that satisfaction; so the Father to testifie that his Iustice was fully satisfied with the price which his Sonne had paid, sent an officer of heaven to open the doores of the grave, and as it were to hold away the hangings while his Lord came forth of his bed-chamber.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it assureth us of our <hi>resurrection</hi>; for as the head must rise before the members, so the members are
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:16264:272"/>
sure to follow the Head. The wicked shall rise by his <hi>Iudiciary power,</hi> but not by the vertue and fellowship of his <hi>Resurrection</hi>; as the faithfull, who are therefore called <hi>Children of the Resurrection, Luk.</hi> 20.36. 1 Cor. 15.20-23. Thirdly, it doth by a secret and spirituall vertue renew and <hi>sanctifie our Nature, Rom.</hi> 6.4. For the acts of Christs mediation in his sufferings and victories are spiritually appliable and effectuall in us unto answerable effects. His death to the mortification of sinne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7. And his resurrection, to the quickning of us in holinesse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. Fourthly, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth us in all other calamities of life which may befall us; hee that raised up himselfe from the dead, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and power to deliver us from all evill and to keepe us from falling. This is the summe of <hi>Iobs</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God will raise me up at the last day, therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly hee is able (if it stand with my good and his owne glory) to lift me up from this dunghill againe, <hi>Iob</hi> 19.27. And this is Gods argument to comfort his people in patient waiting upon him in their afflictions, because their dead bodies shall live, and they that dwell in the dust shall awake and sing, <hi>Esai.</hi> 26.19. Lastly, it serveth to draw our thoughts and affections from earth unto heaven; Because things of a nature should move unto one another. Now saith the Apostle, <hi>Our conversation is in heaven, from whence wee looke for a Saviour, even the Lord Iesus Christ; who shall change our vile Body, and make it like unto his glorious Body, according to the working whereby hee is able to subdue all things unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi> To him with the Father and the Holy Ghost, three persons, and one God, bee all honor, glory, Majesty and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for ever, Amen.</p>
