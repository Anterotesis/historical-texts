            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I ſhall thus begin: <hi>James Naylor</hi> of <hi>Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> in the County of <hi>Yorke,</hi> a deluded and deluding Quaker and Impoſter, rode <hi>October</hi> laſt through a Village called <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> about a mile from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſix more, one whereof a yong man, whoſe head was bare, leading his horſe by the bridle, and another uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before him, thorough the durty way in which the Carts and Horſes and none elſe uſually goe. And with them two men
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43656:5"/>
on horſeback with each of them a woman behind him, and one woman walking on the better way or path. In this poſture did they màrch, and in ſuch a caſe, that one <hi>Georſe Witherley</hi> noting their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, asked them to come in the better rode, adding that God expected no ſuch extremity: but they continued on their way, not anſwering in any other notes, but what were muſicall, ſinging <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabbath,</hi> &amp;c. Thus continued they, till by their wandring they came to the Almſehouſe within the Suburbs of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where one of the women alighted, and ſhe with the other of her own ſex lovingly marcht on each ſide of <hi>Naylor</hi>'s Horſe. This <hi>Witherley</hi> ſaith, he ſuppoſes they could not be leſſe deep in the muddy way then to the knees, and he ſaith they ſang, but ſometimes with ſuch a buzzing mel-<hi>ODIOVS</hi> noyſe that he could not underſtand what it was. This the ſaid <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therley</hi> gave in upon his oath. Thus did they reach <hi>Ratcliff-gate,</hi> with <hi>Timothy</hi>

               <hi>Wedlock</hi> of <hi>Devon</hi> bare-headed, and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha Symonds</hi> with the bridle on one ſide, and <hi>Hannah Stranger</hi> on the other ſide of the Horſe; this <hi>Martha Simonds</hi> is the wiſe of <hi>Thomas Simonds</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binder, and <hi>Hannah Stranger</hi> is the Wife of <hi>John Stranger</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Combmaker, who ſung <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> Thus did he ride to the high Croſſe in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and after that to the <hi>White-hart</hi> in <hi>Broadſtreet,</hi> vvhere there lies two eminent Quakers, by name, <hi>Dennis Holliſter,</hi> and <hi>Henry Row;</hi> of vvhich the Magiſtrates hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig they vvere apprehended and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to priſon.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43656:7"/>
which <hi>Abraham</hi> did and was glad, and ſo ſhall all that are of faithfull <hi>Abraham:</hi> O ſuffer me to ſpeake what the Lord hath moved. There is one temptation neere, the like unto the firſt, and is like the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, but it is not, and therefore it muſt be deſtroyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh it deſileth and hateth the innocent; I beſeech thee wait, my ſoule travelleth to ſee a pure Image brought forth, and the enemy ſtrive to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, that he may keep me alwaies ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, and ever ſeeking, and never ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, nor never rejoycing: But he in whom I have believed will ſhortly tread ſatan under our feet, and then ſhalt thou and thine return to <hi>Zion</hi> with everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings and praiſes. But till then better is the houſe of mourning then rejoycing, for he that was made a perfect example, when he had faſted the appointed time of his father, vvas tempted to eate, and to ſhew a miracle, to prove himſelfe to be the Sonne of God: But man lives not by bread, ſaid he, and now no more by that

vviſdom ſhall he live on vvhich he hath long fed as on bread, and as his food hath been ſo muſt his faſt be, and then at the end temptation, to as low a thing as a ſtone, that if it vvere poſſible the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and the miracles vvould deceive the elect, innocent, and righteous branch of holineſs. But be his vvils never ſo many, the time comes he ſhall leave thee, for he is faithfull, vvho hath promiſed he vvill not leave the Throne of <hi>David</hi> vvithout a man to ſit upon thereon, vvhich ſhall judge the poore vvith righteouſneſſe, and the World vvith equity. This ſhall ſhortly come to paſſe, and then ſhall the viſion ſpeak and not lie. O let innocency be thy beloved, and righteouſneſſe thy Spouſe, that thy fathers lambs may rejoyce in thy pure and cleare unſpotted image of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and purity, vvhich my ſoul believeth I ſhall ſee, and ſo in the faith reſt. I am in patience, vvait, and the power vvill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from ſubtilty, though under never ſo zealous a pretence of innocent vviſdom

it be, yet ſhall the Lord not ſuffer his holy one to ſee corruption, nor his ſoule to lie in Hell, but will cauſe the mountain to melt at his preſence, and the little hills to bring him peace; O I am ready to fear as a ſervant, and to obey as a child. If I have ſpoken words too high, love hath conſtrained me, which is as ſtrong as death, and with the ſame ſpirit cover them as they are ſpoken with, and then ſhall the ſpirit of <hi>David</hi> be witneſſed, who refuſed not words though from his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants mouth; if they were in the fear, I am his ſervant, and he my Maſter, whom I love and fear, and truſt I ſhall do unto the end.</p>

My well beloved thou art like a Roe, or young Hart upon the mountains of Spices, where thy beloved Spouſe hath long been calling thee to come away, but hath been but lately heard of thee. Now it lies ſomething upon me that thou mindſt to ſee her, for the ſpirit and power of God is with her; And there is given to her much of excellent and innocent wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ariſſen and ariſing in her, which will make all the honeſt-hearted to praiſe the Lord alone, and no more ſet up ſelf. And therefore let not my Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter have any jealouſie again of her, for ſhe is highly beloved of the Lord, and that ſhall all ſee who come to know the Lord. And now he doth bleſſe them that bleſſe his, and curſe them that curſe his: for this hath the Lord ſhewed me, That her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I am the Son of God, but I have many Brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Have any called thee by the name of Jeſus?</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Not as unto the viſible, but as Jeſus, the Chriſt that is in me.</p>
            <p>Q. Doſt thou own the name of the King of <hi>Iſrael?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not as a creature, but if they give it Chriſt within I own it, and have a Kingdom but not of this world, my Kingdome is of another world, of which thou watſt not.</p>
            <p>Q. Whether or no art thou the Prophet of the moſt high?</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Judge is but one, and is witneſſed in me, and is the Chriſt, there muſt not be any joyned with him: if they ſpeak of the ſpirit in me, I own it only as God is manifeſt in the fleſh, according as God dwelleth in me, and judgeth there himſelf.</p>
            <p>Q. By whom were you ſent?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By him who hath ſent the ſpirit of his Son in me to try, not as to carnal matters, but belonging to the Kingdome of God, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the Father and the Son, by judge of all ſpirits to be guided by none.</p>

Q. Is not the written word of God the guide?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The written word declares of it, and what is not according to that is not true.</p>
            <p>Q. Whether art thou more ſent then others, or whether others be not ſent in that meaſure?</p>
            <p>

            <p>Q. Was your birth mortal or immortal?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not according to the Natural birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but according to the Spiritual birth, born of the immortal ſeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Wert thou ever called the Lambe of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I look not back to things behind, but there might be ſome ſuch thing in the letter; I am a lamb, and have ſought it long before I could witneſſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Who the mother, or whether or no is ſhe a virgin?</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Who is thy mother according to thy ſpirituall birth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No carnall creature.</p>
            <p>Q. Who then?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:43656:11"/>
               <hi>A.</hi>—To this he refuſed to anſwer.</p>
            <p>Q. Is the hope of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in thee?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The hope is in Chriſt, and as Chriſt is in me ſo far the hope of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtands; Chriſt is in me the hope of glory.</p>
            <p>Q. What more hope is there in thee then in others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> None can know but them of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt give an account.</p>
            <p>Q. Art thou the everlaſting Son of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Where God is manifeſt in the fleſh, there is the everlaſting Son, and I do witneſs God in the fleſh; I am the Son of God, and the Son of God is but one.</p>
            <p>Q. Art thou the Prince of peace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Prince of everlaſting peace is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in me.</p>
            <p>Q. Why doſt thou not reprove thoſe that give thee theſe attributes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I have ſaid nothing unto them but ſuch things are written.</p>
            <p>Q. Is thy name Jeſus?</p>

               <hi>A.</hi>—And here.</p>
            <p>Q. Is there no other Jeſus beſides thee?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Theſe queſtions he forbore either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm or to contradict them.</p>
            <p>Q. Art thou the everlaſting Son of God, the King of righteouſneſs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I am, and the everlaſting righteouſneſs is wrought in me, if ye were acquainted with the Father, ye would alſo be acquainted with me.</p>
            <p>Q. Did any kiſſe thy feet?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It might be they did, but I minded them not.</p>
            <p>Q. When thou waſt called the King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> didſt thou not anſwer, thou ſayeſt it.</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Yea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. How doſt thou provide for a lively hood.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I was guided and directed by my father.</p>

            <p>ONE of <hi>James Naylers</hi> Diſciples ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving attained to ſome knowledge in the French-tongue, went over into France to a City called Burdeaux, where entring into a Congregation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, he began after his wonted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner here in England, to cry out in the open Congregation againſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, calling him conjurer, lyer, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, deceiver; and the elders and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being aſtoniſhed at the novelty, and reputing him a mad-man, came and told him, that they had laws in France, to protect the Congregations either of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts or Proteſtants from any diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance; and thruſt him forth of their Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:43656:20"/>
Vpon which, he went into the Church-yard, and upon a ſtone conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his diſcourſe, which drew the whole Congregation out of the Church, after him, and cauſed the Miniſter to give over: and the elders coming again to him, told him, that he being a ſtranger they were willing to favour him; but ſeeing he did continue his diſturbance, they would commit him to juſtice: he told them, Juſtice was never in that place until his appearance.</p>
            <p>Vpon that, they took him a way to the Governour: where being brought, with his hat on, he asked the Governour what he was; who told him he was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of that place, under the King of France: he ſaid, that he would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him as Governour, his Government being carnal: and a certain Biſhop being with the Governour, who was a Papiſt, deſiring that he might queſtion him, and demanding what he was, he told him he was an Engliſh-man, and ſent of the Lord to prepare his way: he demanded
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43656:21"/>
of the Biſhop what he was; who told him, he was a Biſhop: whereupon he replied, that againſt him he was ſent, who was one of the locuſts that was ſent forth of the bottomleſs pit; and that the wepons he had with him was fitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him and the whole kingdom of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, who was held in darkneſs and blindneſs; and that he was to pour out Vials of the fathers wrath upon him. The Governor of Burdeaux perceving ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the people to be infected with his Doctrine, demanded if there was any ſhip ready to ſayl for England; which being informed of, he therein ſhipt him, being not willing to uſe extremity to a ſtranger, but cauſed ſome ſix or ſeven who had been infected with his doctrine to be whipped through the ſtreets.</p>

            <p>Firſt, in what he teſtifieth before ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient witneſſes, ſee the brief Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Northern Quakers, pag. 22. that he was as holy, juſt, and good, as God himſelf. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he in a letter to one in Lancaſter expreſly ſaith, That he that expected to be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt that died at Jeruſalem, ſhall be deceived: ſee Mr. <hi>Billingſly</hi>'s Defence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, pag. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, in a letter I had in my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, but now lent to a friend, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Paſtor and other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Congregation in the North, whereof <hi>Nayler</hi> once was a member, till for his apoſtacy he was excommunicated, It is offered to be proved, and by them teſtified to be true, that one Mris. <hi>Roper,</hi> her husband being gon on ſome occaſion from her a long voyage, this <hi>Nayler</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents her company, and was ſeen to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle her upon his knee, and kiſs her laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly, and in that time of his ſociety with her, ſhe was brought to bed with a child, when her husband had been abſent ſeven and fourty weeks to a day from her; and on a time he was ſeen to dance her in a private room; and having kiſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43656:23"/>
her very often, ſhe took occaſion to ſay, Now <hi>James,</hi> what would the world ſay if they ſhould ſee us in this poſture? to which he ſaid ſomewhat, but he was ſo low, that it could not be heard. This was objected againſt him, but he denied to anſwer it before the ſaid Church; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting, that he would not ſpeak to them that ſpoke not immediately by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in that when I had diſcourſe with him concerning perfect perfection, at the Bull and Mouth, he ſaid I was a liar to ſay he owned it; then <hi>I</hi> proved it from his own writings, as that he ſaid, they that ſay they have faith, and their life is not the life of Chriſt, and them that ſay they have faith, &amp; yet they cannot be ſaved from their ſins but in part in this world, them &amp; their faith I deny, &amp;c. To which he hypocritically ſaid, that I was a lyer to ſay that he owned it in himſelf, though he diſowned it in others. And when I had objected any thing againſt what he ſaid, he would deny it ſo ſoon as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43656:23"/>
he had ſpoke it: which to convince the people of his lying deceits, I deſired them that ſtood by me, to Remember that he ſaid, All that are in the world are of the world, in direct oppoſition to that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. I pray not holy father that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the world, but preſerve them from the evil of the world; which I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed him with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which he called me lyer; for he ſaid, he ſaid not ſo; I then deſired them that heard him to teſtifie to the truth, againſt the lyer and his deceit, which they did, but his ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impudence was ſuch, that he ſaid, Should a thouſand ſay ſo, they were all lyers, with much more to the like effect.</p>

               <p>HE is a man of a ruddy complexion, brown hair, and flank, hanging a little below his jaw-bones; of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent height; not very long viſaged, nor very round; cloſe ſhaven; a ſad down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look, and melancholy countenance; a little band, cloſe to his coller, with no bandſtrings; his hat hanging over his brows; his noſe neither high nor low, but riſing a little in the middle.</p>

               <p>A Friend of mine being deſirous to be reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a doubt, as, Whether that which was reported of that Heretical Sect were more then they erred in, or leſs then they erroneouſly maintained contrary to the Truth; he went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Meeting within Alderſgate: where he had no ſooner entered that Synagogue of Satan, but the then-ſpeaker (namely, <hi>George Fox)</hi> cried out, (but on what occaſion, he knoweth not) <hi>Quakers, Quakes, Earth's above God,</hi> in the open houſe before hundreds then preſent. At which my friend wondered: and preſſing forwards a little into the multitude, he ſaw ſome diſputing upon the ſame words: who demanding what was the matter, one anſwered, that <hi>George Fox</hi> ſaid <hi>Earth is above God;</hi> and here is one faith, that whatſoever <hi>George Fox</hi> ſhould or did ſay, he would maintain: (pointing to a young man then ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by) to whom my friend replyed, he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken a harder task then he was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: for God was the Creator of the earth, and all things elſe; and therefore above the earth, and not the earth above him that created it, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the workman is above his work: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

an Artificer ſhall by Art compoſe any thing that is never ſo excellent, yet it can claim no equality with the maker, in regard that what is excellent in it, is the makers excellency, and not its own: for, deſtroy the work, and the workman can make the like; but deſtroy the workman with the work, and both periſh. To which he replied, He did not mean the earth under our feet, but earthly ſin in man. To which my friend replyed, that now his blaſphemy was worſe then it was before: for take the earth ſimply in it ſelf, it hath no prejudice towards God; but ſin is that which ſeeks Gods deſtruction, and therefore he was not to be converſed with, being of ſo diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical an opinion.</p>
