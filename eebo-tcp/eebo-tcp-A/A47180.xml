            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following Treatiſe is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be any direct or compleat Anſwer to the Book, called, <hi>A Defence of a Paper, entituled, Goſpel-Truths, againſt the Exceptions of the Biſhop of</hi> Cork<hi>'s Teſtimony. By</hi> William Penn. <hi>Printed 1698,</hi> that Work belonging not to me, but to the Biſhop of <hi>Cork,</hi> who, as I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informed, doth intend to give him a meet Anſwer to his Book: In the mean while I hoped it would be acceptable both to the Biſhop, and to many good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, thus far to interpoſe in the Defence of the Common Cauſe of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith;</hi> eſpecially in the detecting of ſome of the <hi>greateſt Fallacies W. P.</hi> hath uſed in his Book, under a ſeeming <hi>Diſguiſe and Vizard</hi> of Chriſtianity, really to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and deſtroy it; I being of late Years better acquainted with <hi>W. P</hi>'s Fallacious way of Writing than probably the Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> is. If this ſmall Treatiſe comes to
<pb facs="tcp:101140:3"/>
the <hi>Biſhop's</hi> Hand, before he publiſh his Anſwer to <hi>W. P.</hi> he will find that he hath been more charitable to him, than indeed he deſerved; and that he had in his large Charity, judged him more <hi>Orthodox</hi> than he really is, although <hi>W. P.</hi> has made but an ill uſe of his Charity, and has badly requited him, with many uncivil as well as unjuſt Reflections, ſome of which I thought it was but Juſtice that I ſhould vindicate the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> from; and the rather becauſe I ſuppoſe, the <hi>Biſhop's</hi> Innocency and Station may lead him in great part to neglect them, as not being ſo proper for him to notice, as for another that ſtands by, and beholds their mutual Treatment of each other, which according to my beſt underſtanding and obſervation, as fair as it hath been on the <hi>Biſhop's</hi> part, hath been as unfair on the part of <hi>W. P.</hi> who as he treats him not with the leaſt due reſpect to his Station, ſo nor indeed as a Chriſtian.</p>

               <head>Section 1.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>W. P<hi>'s Fallacy, in calling the Illumination of the Holy Ghoſt, which to him is nothing but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Illumination given to all Mankind, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Scriptures a double and agreeing Record of true Religion. His falſe Notion of Heaven and Hell, denying the Locality of them. His abuſive Reflection on the Biſhop of</hi> Cork, <hi>his keeping the true Hell to himſelf. His Fallacy in pretending to the Biſhop, that he owned the Holy Trinity; where as in his</hi> Sandy Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>he hath expreſly denied it, and argued againſt it. His denying that outward Perſon that ſuffered at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to be properly the Son of God. His denying that the Body of Chriſt, was any part of Christ; and his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with</hi> G. W. <hi>and other Quakers, in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Humanity of Chriſt, to be any part of the true Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 1. HE ſaith, <hi>The Teſtimony of the Scriptures of Truth, and the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Holy Ghoſt, are the double and agreeing Record of true Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101140:4"/>
In this he is very Fallacious in the very entrance, this Illumination of the Holy Ghoſt, he will have to be that which is given to be a general Rule to all Mankind, (ſee his Diſcourſe concerning <hi>the General Rule of Faith and Life,</hi> Printed by <hi>T. Sowle</hi> 1699.) But how is that, together with the Scriptures, a double and agreeing Record? whereas that general Rule that he contendeth is given to all Mankind [to wit, that general Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as given to <hi>Infidel Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and the Heathen World] is no Record to any one Article of the Apoſtles Creed, or any one peculiar Doctrine of Chriſtianity, but only to ſome few Precepts of Morality, and general Piety towards God. Yea, <hi>W. P.</hi> hath confeſſed (ſee his <hi>Page</hi> 32 of that Diſcourſe) That neither he nor his Brethren have any new ſuperadded Revelation concerning <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Fall, and Chriſt's Birth, Death and Sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſaith, It is not neceſſary. Therefore the Illumination that he ſets up for the General Rule to <hi>Quakers</hi> and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, is not any Record agreeing with the Scriptures in any one particular Article of the Chriſtian Faith, or poſitive Precept of the Goſpel, peculiar to the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as diſtinct from <hi>Deiſm</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſm.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 2. In his firſt Section the makes <hi>the eternal Reward of Happineſs to be given to all them that fear God;</hi> without the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101140:4"/>
of any Faith towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, conſidered as both God and Man, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining the eternal Happineſs; nor is there the leaſt hint of any ſuch Faith being neceſſary in all his Sections. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſaith, <hi>They that fear him not, ſhall be turned into Hell,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> did well obſerve: What <hi>W. P.</hi> means by <hi>Hell,</hi> by that Paper no one knows; but elſewhere what he means either by Heaven or Hell, he hath ſufficiently told us in his <hi>Rejoinder</hi> to <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> p. 179. <hi>viz.</hi> To aſſert the Locality of Heaven and Hell is too Carnal, indeed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan.</hi> Seeing them <hi>W. P.</hi> doth not own any place without us, to be either Heaven or Hell, it is eaſie to underſtand what Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Hell <hi>W. P.</hi> is for, to wit, the Light within that's his only Heaven, and Darkneſs within his only Hell, which is the old Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Notion, that is deſtructive to the great Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, ſuch as, that Chriſt is bodily aſcended into a real Local Heaven without us, which Heavens all the Saints ſhall after the Reſurrection, in their glorified Bodies he taken up into; and the Bodies of the Wicked together with their Souls, ſhall be caſt into Hell, that is, a place of Torment, as really as the other is a place of Joy and Felicity. It is prodigiouſly Shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Aſtoniſhing in <hi>W. P.</hi> that though he knew in his Conſcience he did not mean <hi>Hell</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101140:5"/>
in the common ſenſe of Chriſtians, which without doubt is the Biſhop's ſenſe, to wit, a real place of Torment without us, yet that he ſhould ſo treat, the Biſhop, and ſo rudely and unchriſtianly reflect upon him by a conſequence as falſe as it is foul and dirty, ſaying in his <hi>Page</hi> 40, <hi>either one of theſe is an Article of his belief, or elſe he keeps the true Hell to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 2. In his ſecond Section, though he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to expreſs his and his Brethrens Faith in Scripture Words, that <hi>there are Three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Spirit, and theſe three are really one;</hi> yet in his former Books, particularly in his <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> never yet retracted by him, he hath ſufficiently diſcovered his groſs and vile error, in that fundamental Doctrine of the Chriſtian Faith, thus arguing not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt their being Three Perſons, but their being Three, (otherwiſe than Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, which was the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Hereſie) <hi>ſince the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is God, (which their opinion neceſſitates them to confeſs) then unleſs the Father, Son and Spirit are three diſtinct nothings, they muſt be three diſtinct Subſtances, and conſequently three diſtinct God's.</hi> And he bringeth Five Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their being a Holy Three, <hi>P.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>In his Third Section, he ſeemeth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his and his Brethrens Faith in Scripture
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101140:5"/>
terms. But this his profeſſed Faith is quite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with what he hath delivered in his other Books, here he ſaith, <hi>That the Word was made Fleſh and dwelt among Men, and was and is the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth his beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Death for every Man, and dyed for Sin, that we might dye to Sin.</hi> But as it hath been above ſhewed, out of his <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> he hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued againſt any ſuch diſtinction as of the Father and the Son in the God-head, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a plurality of God's, and though here he profeſſeth to believe that this only begotten Son, dyed for Sin, yet in his <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Apology Page</hi> 146 he ſaith, <hi>That the outward Perſon that ſuffered was properly the Son of God, we utterly deny.</hi> And in his <hi>guide mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken</hi> P. 25. <hi>Chriſt Co-eſſential and Co-eternal with his Father</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of being made Man, of his Dying, Riſing and Aſcending into Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. [he ſaith of all this, that it is] <hi>confuſed Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and by Rote Canting, by paths of vain Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and Invention, reſults of Factious and corrupted Counſels.</hi> And in his <hi>Rejoinder</hi> to <hi>John Faldo Page</hi> 299. he plainly denyes, that the Body of Chriſt was any conſtitutive part of Chriſt, and for ſeven leaves together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends againſt <hi>John Faldo, That Chriſt did not Dye, nor hang on the Croſs,</hi> but only the Body, which he will not have to be any part of him. To this Doctrine of <hi>W. P.</hi> doth that of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101140:6"/>
                  <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> agree (a Man as great, or rather much greater, among the <hi>Quakers</hi> as <hi>W.

                  <p>
                     <hi>His Fallacy in pretending to own Juſtification by Chriſt the Propitiation, in Contradiction to what he hath delivered in his</hi> Serious Apology, <hi>and</hi> Sandy Foundation, <hi>and his fallacious way of ſtating the Doctrine of Juſtification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he miſrepreſents his Opponents.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN his fourth Section, as ſeemingly Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox as he profeſſeth himſelf to be, as fallacious and inſincere he is, ſeeing he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his own Conſcience, that what he hath here delivered, is utterly inconſiſtent with what is extant in his other Books, never as yet retracted by him; nor doth either he, or his Brethren, own any change of perſwaſion from what they had, ever ſince they came under the profeſſion of <hi>Quakers;</hi> but as one of them hath lately ſaid in Print, <hi>As God is the ſame, and Truth is the ſame, ſo his People are the ſame,</hi> viz. the <hi>Quakers.</hi> I ſhall firſt ſet down his preſent profeſſion of what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves concerning Juſtification, as followeth, <q>That as we are only Juſtified from the guilt of Sin by Chriſt the Propitiation, and not by works of Righteouſneſs that we have done, ſo there is an abſolute neceſſity that we receive and obey to unfeigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and amendment of Life, the Holy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101140:7"/>
Light and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, in order to obtain that Remiſſionand Juſtification from Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> But in contradiction to this, ſee what his Doctrine is in his <hi>Serious Apology, P.</hi> 148. <hi>And indeed,</hi> ſays <hi>W. P. this we deny, viz. Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath fulfilled in his own Perſon for us, (wholly without us) and boldly affirm it in the Name of the Lord to be, the Doctrine of Devils and an Arm of the Sea of Corruption, which does now deluge the whole World.</hi> Note Reader, If according to <hi>W. P</hi>'s former words, we <hi>Only</hi> are Juſtified from the guilt of Sin by Chriſt the Propitiation, and not by works of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that we have done; then it is plainly evident, by the ſame Doctrine, that we are Juſtified by the Righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath fulfilled in his own Perſon for us, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without us, for theſe two manners of Speech, are perfectly equivalent, <hi>viz. That we are only Juſtified from the guilt of Sin by Chriſt the propitiation, and that we are Juſtified by the Righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath fulfilled in his own Perſon wholly without us.</hi> The word <hi>Only</hi> plainly importing the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt <hi>Wholly</hi> without us, unleſs there be ſome great fallacy in <hi>W. P</hi>'s words, as the ſequel will make appear a little after. But if we take theſe two quotations in their genuine Senſe, the one, that we are Juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt <hi>Only, i. e. Wholly</hi> without us, from the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101140:7"/>
guilt of Sin; and the other that this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we are Juſtified by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which Chriſt hath fulfilled in his own Perſon for us, wholly without us; and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm it in the Name of the Lord to be the Doctrine of Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is a perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency and contradiction. And yet now <hi>W. P.</hi> doth teach the ſame Doctrine, which formerly he called the Doctrine of Devils, without any change of his perſwaſion; as he plainly tells in the concluſion of his Paper, <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath all along been the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtream and tendency both of our Miniſtry. and Writings, as our books will make appear.</hi> But what a Forehead of Bras muſt <hi>W. P.</hi> have, with ſo great confidence to aſſert ſo known an untruth! Again, the ſame <hi>W. P.</hi> in his forecited <hi>Serious Apology</hi> thus argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>(P</hi> 148.) againſt Chriſt's imputative Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. <hi>Death came by actual Sin, not imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, therefore Juſtification unto Life, came by actual Righteouſneſs not imput ative.</hi> Note Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, If we are not Juſtified by Chriſt's impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (which he calls imputative) Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as here he aſſerts, how can this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with his now ſaying, that we are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the guilt of Sin, by Chriſt the Propitiation.</p>
               <p>Again in his <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> from <hi>P.</hi> 24, to <hi>P.</hi> 32. he pretends to bring arguments from both Scripture and Reaſon, to refute
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101140:8"/>
the Juſtification of impure Perſons by an imputative Righteouſneſs: I ſhall quote a few paſſages out of many, to ſhew the inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his late and former Doctrine about Juſtification from the guilt of Sin. <hi>P.</hi> 25. from. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 20, 26, 27, 28. He draws this Argument, <hi>That the Condemnation or Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Perſons, is not from the imputation of anothers Righteouſneſs, but the actual performance, and keeping of God's Righteous Statutes or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, otherwiſe God ſhould forget to be equal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again in <hi>P.</hi> 26. he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is ſo far from telling them of their being Juſtified, abiding in his Love, by virtue of his Obedience imputed unto them, that unleſs they obey his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and obey for themſelves, they ſhall be ſo remote from an acceptance, as wholly to be caſt out, in all which Chriſt is</hi> but <hi>our example.</hi> Where note Reader, the words <hi>BUT our example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again in the ſame <hi>Page, Nor let any fancy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Chriſt hath ſo fulfilled it for them, as to exclude their Obedience, from being requiſite to their acceptance,</hi> BUT <hi>only as their pattern.</hi> Where note again Reader, theſe words <hi>but only as their pattern.</hi> This is plain Socinianiſm.</p>
               <p>Again in <hi>P.</hi> 27. he thus argueth, If <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and acceptance with God, or the contrary, are to be reaped from the Works, that a Man ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101140:8"/>
                  <hi>either to the Fleſh, or to the Spirit, then is the Doctrine of acceptance and ground of rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the works of another</hi> utterly excluded, <hi>every Man reaping according to what he hath ſown, and bearing his own Burden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Reader, thou ſeeſt how earneſtly he hath contended againſt all Juſtification from the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, wrought in his own Perſon without us, though in this late Paper of Goſpel Truths he ſeems fully to aſſert it. I ſhall not need to inſiſt at large, to ſhew his fallacious way of ſtating the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about Juſtification by Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs without us, and of his reaſoning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. As if theſe againſt whom he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth did plead for a Juſtification, or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt actually imputed to Men, wholly unſanctified, and remaining altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a ſtate of diſobedience, wherein he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unfairly repreſents them. But whereas he pleads at ſuch a high rate, that none are Juſtified, while having the leaſt Sin or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, ſo as that none are Juſtified, but who perfectly, in all points, without the leaſt ſinful defect or imperfection, obey the Law of God, and come up in their Obedience to the outmoſt demand of the Law, as the whole ſtrain of his Arguments run: by this rate of arguing, either <hi>W. P.</hi> and all his Brethren, are under a ſtate of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Curſe of the Law, If they have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101140:9"/>
the leaſt impurity, or ſinful defect, and have not attained a ſinleſs perfection, which yet can be proved ſufficiently they have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and ſome of them, have ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in them, as to confeſs they have not yet arrived unto. And <hi>W. P.</hi> would do but equally in the caſe, to tell us, whether he is ſuch a Sinleſs Perſon, that anſwers every demand of Juſtice, and who in his obedience, comes up to the higheſt perfection of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the moſt Holy Law of God doth now at this preſent require of him. If he thinks he is, he is miſerably miſtaken, while his ſinful Imperfections in his aſſerting ſuch groſs Untruths for Truths, and ſome of them againſt the Conviction of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are ſo manifeſt, that he who runs may read them; beſides a great vein of Pride, Levity and Vanity of Mind, and Scornful Diſdain, that appears running through his pretended Anſwer to the Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> his modeſt Obſervations; and his moſt uncivil Language and Epithets he hath uſed in his former Books, never to this day repented of, ſo far as we can underſtand, given by him to his Opponents in his ſeveral Books of Controverſie, whereof the Author of <hi>The Snake in the Graſs,</hi> hath given a large Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Fallacy, in ſeeming to own Juſtification by Chriſt the Propitiation; whereas by Chriſt the Propitiation, he doth not mean the Man Chriſt without, but the Light within. His bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in his</hi> Sandy Foundation, <hi>to throw down three great Fundamentals of Chriſtianity,</hi> viz. The Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, The Doctrine of Chriſt's Satisfaction, and the Doctrine of Juſtification by Chriſt's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs. <hi>His excluding Faith in Chriſt Crucified, from being neceſſary to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and placing it wholly on Repentance and Obedience; his agreement with</hi> G.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUT under this ſeemingly fair acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of <hi>W. P.</hi> that we are only ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified from the Guilt of Sin by Chriſt the Propitiation, let us ſearch, whither there be not even in this acknowledgment, <hi>The Snake in the Graſs:</hi> If <hi>W. P.</hi> remain in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Perſwaſion, as he affirmeth he doth, by his former Books I ſhall clearly prove, that by Chriſt the Propitiation, he doth not mean the Man Chriſt Jeſus, as he outwardly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Death, and the ſhedding of his Blood outwardly for the Remiſſion of our Sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great and only Propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of Men; and thereby by his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101140:10"/>
moſt perfect Satisfaction, paying to Divine Juſtice the Debt of our Sins. In his <hi>Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> p. 97. he contendeth, That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Lamb in the Paſſover (under the Law) were not proper Figures of Chriſt without, but of Chriſt the promiſed Seed within: <hi>One outward thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>cannot be the proper Figure of another; nor is it the way of Holy Scripture ſo to teach, the outward Lamb ſhews forth the inward.</hi> And in Page 145, he ſaith, <hi>As the outward Jew had an outward Prieſt, at whoſe mouth he ought to ſeek the Law, ſo the Jew inward and Circumciſion in Spirit has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Spiritual High Prieſt, the King, Ruler, Judge, Law-giver, High Prieſt, Law, Rule, Temple, are all Spiritual,</hi> i. e. Inward. And in his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> p. 284. he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>That Chriſt offers himſelf in his Children, in the nature of a mediating Sacrifice to appeaſe the Wrath of God.</hi> Again in his <hi>Sandy Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> from p. 16 to p. 24. he diſputes againſt the Satisfaction of Chriſt, giving this Title to his Diſputation, <hi>The vulgar Doctrine of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, being dependent on the ſecond Perſon of the imagined Trinity refuted from Scripture,</hi> to p. 20, and from p. 20 refuted from right reaſon to p. 24, where p. 17. arguing from <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 33, 34. he ſaith, <hi>Here is God's meer Grace aſſerted againſt the pretended neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a Satisfaction to procure his Remiſſion.</hi> And p. 18. he argueth thus, <hi>And forgive us</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:101140:10"/>
                  <hi>our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors. Where nothing can be more obvious</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>than that which is forgiven is not paid. And if it is our Duty to forgive without a Satisfaction received, and that God is to forgive us, as we forgive them, then is a Satisfaction</hi> Totally excluded. And from <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 9. he concludes, ſo that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion came by believing his Teſtimony, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Precepts, and not by a</hi> Pretended Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Thus Reader do but obſerve, how <hi>Proteus</hi> like he changes his ſhapes, one while to argue againſt any Satisfaction of Chriſt to God, for the Debt of our Sins, by which the nature of Chriſt's propitiatory Sacrifice is wholly deſtroy'd. Another while after he has thrown down Chriſt's being our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice without us, he ſets up an <hi>Imaginary Sacrifice of Chriſt, the Lamb ſlain within, the high Prieſt within:</hi> Whereas were his Arguments of any force (as they are not) they would be as much againſt Chriſt's being a Propitiation (by his Satisfaction to Divine Juſtice for our Sins) within Men as without them.</p>
               <p>In one thing his Cunning is obſervable, though mix'd with horrid Ignorance and Folly, and bold Preſumption, that he makes the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth betwixt the Father and the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, the Doctrine of Chriſt's Satisfaction, and the Doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101140:11"/>
by Chriſt's imputed Righteouſneſs, ſo cloſely joyned together, that they fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if the firſt of them falls; and ſo he makes his bold attempt againſt the firſt, that by throwing down the firſt, he may throw down the ſecond, and by that means the third; and having, as he thinks, effectually done the buſineſs, he entitles his Book, <hi>The Sandy Foundation ſhaken;</hi> which is in effect to ſay, The Foundation of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion ſhaken, in order to introduce Deiſm and Heatheniſm into Chriſtendom. But he ſhall one day know (if he know it not before he dye, which God grant that he may) that the Foundation, he calls <hi>The Sandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> is not Sandy, but ſtands on that Rock on which the Church of Chriſt is built, that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt; and if he repent not of this Blaſphemy, which I pray God he may, this Rock will grind him to powder.</p>
               <p>There is yet one main thing further, that is needful to be noticed, in this fourth Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, before I leave it, and that is, That whereas he aſſerts, there is an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that we receive and obey to unfeigned Repentance and amendment of Life, the Holy Light and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, in order to obtain that Remiſſion and Juſtification from Sin, for which he cites <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22 to 26. 8. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5 7. he mentions not one
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101140:11"/>
word of the abſolute neceſſity of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, as he outwardly ſuffered Death for our Sins, and thereby became the Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for Sin, though he expreſly aſſerts the abſolute neceſſity of Repentance, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and amendment of Life; and though one of the Scriptures quoted by him in Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Verſe, <hi>viz Rom.</hi> 3. 22 to 26. expreſly mentions Faith in his Blood for Remiſſion of Sin; yet he knowing himſelf in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that he was not for any ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Faith in Chriſt, or in his Blood, as above expreſs'd, he did purpoſely omit it. And if he, or any for him, ſhall ſay, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it, though he did not expreſs it: I ſay, as he did not expreſs it, ſo he did not imply it, which I prove from the following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 1. Seeing he not only expreſs'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but aſſerted it to be abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Remiſſion of Sin; had he thought Faith in Chriſt, as he outwardly died, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to our obtaining Remiſſion of Sins, no doubt he would have expreſſed that too, either there, or ſome where at leaſt, in ſome of his Books; but upon all the ſearch I have made, I have not found it any where in his books, and indeed very rarely in any of the books of his Brethren. 2. But on the contrary, I have found, that both he and <hi>G. W.</hi> eſpecially, (and diverſe others, as I have proved by Quotations out of their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101140:12"/>
books in my third Narrative) have expreſly oppoſed this Faith, to wit, in Chriſt as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Crucified, and in his blood as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſhed, by way of Propitiation, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Divine Juſtice for our Sins. <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Quakeriſm a new Nick-name for old Chriſtianity,</hi> p. 6. ſaith, <hi>Faith in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Chriſt's outward Manifeſtation, is a deadly Poyſon theſe latter Ages has been infected with.</hi> And in his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to <hi>John Faldo,</hi> p. 333. he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt in the Gentiles is a greater Myſtery, than Chriſt as he was made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the Fleſh. It's ſtrange</hi> (ſaith he in oppoſition to <hi>J. F.</hi> who aſſerted like a true Chriſtian, <hi>That Chriſt, as he was made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the Fleſh, was a greater Myſtery than Chriſt in the Gentiles) that ſhould be counted moſt myſterious, which was the Introduction to the Myſtery; and theſe Tranſactions counted moſt difficult, that were by the Divine Wiſdom of God, ordained as ſo many facile Repreſentations of what was to be accompliſhed in Man.</hi> And page 335. <hi>In ſhort</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is to exclude the true My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Godlineſs, which is Chriſt manifeſted in his Children.</hi> Thus we ſee he makes Chriſt's Death and Sufferings without us (which he calls Tranſactions) as ſo many facile Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of what was to be accompliſhed in Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> of his being Crucified within, and his blood inwardly ſhed; and his offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf inwardly in his Children, in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101140:12"/>
nature of a mediating Sacrifice, to appeaſe the Wrath of God. Thus alſo we ſee how he hath deſtroyed the great Object of the Chriſtian Faith, which is Chriſt as he was outwardly Crucified, being the great Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our Sins. And <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> his elder Brother in Ignorance and Error, hath given him a Copy to write after, in his <hi>Truth defending the Quakers,</hi> p. 65. he ſaith, <hi>Faith in Chriſt without Men, is contrary to the Apoſtles Doctrine.</hi> And p. 66. he ſaith, <hi>The Blood of Chriſt's Humanity, the Apoſtle doth not tell us of, Chriſt's Blood is Spiritual.</hi> And in his <hi>Light and Life,</hi> p. 56. he ſaith, <hi>The Blood of the Covenant is inward and Spiritual.</hi> P. 59, 60. <hi>Chriſt's Blood that was outwardly ſhed, not the Antitype or Subſtance ſignified by the Blood of Beaſts ſhed under the Law.</hi> And p. 8. he ſaith, <hi>To look to Chriſt Crucified at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and in Heaven, and to be revealed in us by his Spirit, is a Contradiction.</hi> 3. According to that Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principle laid down by <hi>W. P.</hi> in his Diſcourſe of the General Rule of Faith and Life, he muſt needs exclude Faith in Chriſt, as he was outwardly born, died, and roſe again, not only from being abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our Salvation, but from being given to us at all, (otherwiſe than barely hiſtorically,) for ſeeing according to him the Light in every Man, only as giving the ordinary Diſcoveries, that all Mankind have,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101140:13"/>
is the Rule of Faith to every Man, no Man either doth or can believe (otherwiſe than barely hiſtorically) what the Light within hath not revealed; but the Light within, as it hath not revealed the Birth, Death and Sufferings of Chriſt to every Man, ſo by <hi>W. P</hi>'s Confeſſion, it hath not revealed theſe things to him, or his Brethren, for he grants, they belong to extraordinary Revelation, and fall not within the ordinary Diſcoveries given to Mankind, and are none of the abſolute Neceſſaries of Religion, and that ſuch Revelation is not neceſſary; and yet without ſuch internal extraordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of theſe things, they cannot have the certain Faith of them, as he confeſſeth.</p>

the Biſhop) <hi>had well conſidered the Force and Comprehenſiveneſs of our Belief concerning Chriſt,</hi> That pleaſeth him ſo well, <hi>he might have ſaved himſelf the trouble of what he has publiſhed to the World upon the reſt of them; for whoever believes in Chriſt, as a Propitiation in order to Remiſſion of Sins, and Juſtification of Sinners, can hardly disbelieve any Fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Religion. Since every ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt neceſſarily believe in God, becauſe it is with him alone Man is to be juſtified. To be ſure he muſt believe in Chriſt, for that is the very Propoſition; he muſt alſo believe in the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe he is the Author of his Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Repentance and Belief, he muſt believe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell, Rewards and Puniſhments, and conſequently the Reſurrection of the Juſt and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. For why ſhould he be concerned about the being freed from the Guilt of his Sin, if he were unaccountable in another World. So that acknowledging the neceſſity of Chriſt, as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, in order to the Remiſſion of Sin, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the main Doctrine of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And as ſo many Lines drawn from the Circumference to the Center, they all meet and center in Chriſt: And indeed it is as the Navel of Chriſtianity, and Characteriſtick of that Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were this confeſſion of <hi>W. P.</hi> as ſincere as it is ſeemingly fair, it would prove that his Doctrine were indeed Chriſtian, and no
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101140:14"/>
doubt might, and ought to give to the Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op or any other that were doubtful in the caſe, good Satisfaction, of the Chriſtianity of his Doctrine. But that all this is meer paint and equivocation, what I have above quoted out of his Books, fairly and fully, doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prove, That the profeſſion <hi>W. P.</hi> made of his belief, in his <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> pleaſed the Biſhop ſo well, [whereof <hi>W. P.</hi> takes ſuch particular and great notice, and thereby takes occaſion to blame his diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, as well as his troubling himſelf, with publiſhing what he hath done to the World. Yea, <hi>W. P.</hi> makes it next to impoſſible, that it was the firſt time the Biſhop hath heard of that Doctrine among them, <hi>viz.</hi> the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the neceſſity of Chriſt, as a propitiation, in order to the remiſſion of Sins, and Juſtifying them as Sinners from Guilt.] I ſay, that this his profeſſion pleaſed the Biſhop ſo well, did proceed from the Biſhops great Charity, and Moderation, Charitably believing that <hi>W. P</hi>'s Heart and Pen did go along together; but as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath made an ill uſe of the Biſhop's Charity and Judgment, thus impertinently to reflect on him, ſo it is fit, the Biſhop ſhould be better acquainted with <hi>W. P</hi>'s equivocations, and double dealings with him, which he may eaſily find out by an indifferent ſearch into his former Books. <hi>W. P.</hi> in his above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101140:15"/>
confeſſion, profeſſeth his belief in Chriſt as a propitiation; and this he would ſeem to make the Navel of Chriſtianity and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick of that Religion. But what doth <hi>W. P.</hi> mean by Chriſt the Propitiation, and Faith in him as ſuch? doth he mean the ſame that the Bishop meaneth, and all ſincere Chriſtians? Nay, nothing leſs, Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as he is the Light and Life, as he offers up himſelf within his Children, in the Nature of a Mediating Sacrifice, the Lamb within but not the Lamb without, the High-Prieſt within, is the Propitiation, and his blood as ſhed within which is the Life, and the Life is the Light within, (as he hath both printed and preached,) is that Propitiation,</p>
               <p>And certainly, did he mean that Faith in the Man Chriſt without us, as he outwardly was crucified, was neceſſary to Chriſtianity, and the Characteriſtick of that Religion, and that the acknowledgment of Chriſt as ſuch, was neceſſary to conſtitute a Chriſtian, he would not plead, that a meer Juſt Man, who has no Faith in Chriſt, <hi>as the Word Incarnate, is a Chriſtian; and that he who believes in God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt is God, as he has argued in his addreſs to Proteſtants.</hi> And did he really think, that to believe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chriſt, to wit, as outwardly cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and raiſed again, to be the Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was the Navel of Chriſtianity, and the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101140:15"/>
Characteriſtick of that Religion, he would not have excluded that Faith from the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſaries of Religion, as he hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done in his diſcourſe concerning the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule of Faith and Life. Nor would he have ſet up the Light within every Man, with reſpect to its ordinary diſcoveries of Moral Piety and Juſtice without any Revelation of Chriſt, as he came outwardly in the Fleſh, to be the general Rule of Faith to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as well as to all Heathens; which is making Deiſm and Chriſtianity but one and the ſame thing; tho' now he ſeems to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them, by calling Chriſtianity that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion whereof the Faith and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt the Propitiation is the Navel and Characteriſtick. But ſeeing <hi>W. P.</hi> doth ſo Groſly prevaricate and equivocate, about Chriſt the Propitiation and Faith in him as ſuch; and that it hath been proved, he hath not the true Faith of Chriſt the Propitiation, nor ſo much as a true notion of it; 'tis fit to apply <hi>W. P</hi>'s words againſt himſelf, and to Argue from his words by the Rule of contraries. As whoever believes in Chriſt as a Propitiation, in order to remiſſion of Sins, can hardly disbelieve any Fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Religion; ſo by good conſequence contrariwiſe, whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not in Chriſt, as a Propitiation, (in the true ſenſe of Scripture generally received
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101140:16"/>
by all true Chriſtians,) to wit, as outwardly Crucified, Dead and Raiſed again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can hardly believe any Fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Religion; but <hi>W. P.</hi> believes not in Chriſt as a Propitiation, in order to remiſſion of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the true ſenſe of Scripture, generally received by all true Chriſtians; therefore <hi>W. P.</hi> hardly believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Religion, to wit, as peculiar to the ſame. The firſt propoſition is proved, by the Rule of contraries from <hi>W. P</hi>'s aſſertion, as I think he will readily confeſs, the ſecond propoſition, which is the Aſſumption, is fully proved from what is above at large quoted by me out of his former Books, never to this day retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. And though he reckoneth up, the Doctrine of the Trinity, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Father, of Chriſt the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, the Doctrine of Heaven and Hell, the Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the Juſt and Unjuſt, to be Fundamental Doctrines, yea, and the main of Chriſtian Doctrine; yet from what is above proved out of his Books, he hath plainly oppoſed the true Chriſtian Doctrine both of the Holy Trinity, and of Heaven and Hell; and as plainly he hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the Juſt and Unjuſt, in their reſpective Bodies, as I have fully proved in my third Narrative; and ſo have his Brethren, <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:101140:16"/>
                  <hi>Richard Hubberthorne</hi> and others, only at preſent I ſhall quote theſe following paſſages out of ſome of his former Books, in his <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt Railing,</hi> in anſwer to <hi>Tho. Hicks, P.</hi> 138. he thus plainly argueth againſt the deceaſed Saints looking for any future Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body, which <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> argued for. <hi>Is the Joy of the Ancients</hi> (ſaith <hi>W. P.) now in Glory imperfect, or are they in Heaven but by halves? But why muſt the Felicity of the Soul depend upon that of the Body? Is it not to make the Soul a kind of Window, to be without its beloved Body, a better ſort of Purgatory</hi> Again <hi>P.</hi> 134. <hi>If a thing can be the ſame, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding changed, for ſhame, let us never make ſo much ſtir againſt the Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, for the abſurdity of it is rather out-done than equalled by this carnal Reſurrection.</hi> Again in his anſwer to <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> called the <hi>Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of</hi> J. Faldo's <hi>Vindication, P.</hi> 369. <hi>It's ſown a Natural Body, It's raiſed a Spiritual Body, and I do utterly deny</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that this Text is concerned in the Reſurrection of Man's carnal Body at all, but the States of Men under the Firſt and Second</hi> Adam: <hi>Men are ſown into the World Natural, but they are raiſed Spiritual, through him who is the Reſurrection and the Life, and ſo they are Sons of the Second</hi> Adam.</p>
               <p>Nor need any to wonder why <hi>W. P.</hi> and his Brethren ſhould disbelieve all theſe fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Doctrines of Chriſtianity, (which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101140:17"/>
now he profeſſeth to own, and that as Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, but ſtill quite in a moſt differing Senſe from all true Chriſtians) for with what certainty can he or they believe them, they acknowledge not the Holy Scriptures to be the Rule of their Faith in any of theſe things, or indeed of any others, they have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Truth of any of theſe he now calls Fundamentals, from the Rule of Faith ſet up by them, which is the Light within them, with reſpect to its ordinary Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries given to Mankind; but none of theſe Fundamental Doctrines above mentioned, fall within theſe ordinary Diſcoveries, as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath confeſſed for they belong to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Revelation: And if he ſhould affirm, they did belong to the ordinary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries given to Mankind, he cannot prove it: What obſcure Knowledge any of them, called Heathen Philoſophers, had of any of theſe great Myſteries: <hi>W. P.</hi> cannot prove they had it from the Light within, but Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally either from the Jews, and ancient Patriarchs and Prophets, or from ſome among themſelves prophetically inſpired, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> the which report, were it true, doth not prove, that the Knowledge and Faith of theſe great Fundamentals did fall within the ordinary diſcoveries of the Light within given to Mankind in general.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN his Page 30, he proceeds in his unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and uncivil Treatment of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, unjuſtly charging him, <hi>as if the Text</hi> 1 John 5. 7. <hi>were defective with the Biſhop, and as if he did render the Text it ſelf ſhort; which</hi> (ſaith <hi>W.

               <p>The Biſhop might well enough, without charging any defect on the Text (as he doth not in the leaſt) charge a defect on this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>W. P.</hi> and his Brethren, becauſe though given in one Scripture Text, yet he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101140:18"/>
had juſt cauſe to queſtion not to be given in the true ſenſe of that Scripture; for moſt that are unſound, as touching the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, even <hi>Socinians</hi> as well as others will profeſs, yea, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to give their Faith in the Text, yea, and all other Texts of the like nature, who yet are profeſſed Unbelievers of the true Doctrine of the Holy Trinity: And though <hi>W. P.</hi> and his Brethren will frankly confeſs, they believe that the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, are one God, one in Subſtance and Eſſence; and thus think to clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of <hi>Socinianſm,</hi> yet he and they at the ſame time are groſly guilty of <hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi> acknowledging no diſtinction betwixt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, other than No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, or at moſt in Manifeſtation and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>ad extra,</hi> and with relation to the Creatures. So that <hi>W. P</hi>'s Notion and Faith of the Holy. Trinity, which he calls the Scripture Trinity, but it is not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Trinity, but the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Trinity, is no other than this, that as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are one God, one Eſſence, and Being; ſo the Father is the Son, and the Son is the Father; and the Holy Ghoſt is the Son, and the Son is the Holy Ghoſt; for as I have quoted him above in his <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> he diſputeth not only againſt their <hi>being Three Perſons,</hi> but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101140:18"/>
                  <hi>againſt their being Three, or Three He's;</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, <hi>That if the Father be God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghoſt God, then unleſs they are Three diſtinct Nothings, they are Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Subſtances, and conſequently Three diſtinct God's:</hi> Which is as weakly and Sophiſtically argued by <hi>W. P.</hi> as if he had argued, If the three Dimenſions of a Body be three diſtinct Dimenſions, then unleſs they are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Nothings, they are three diſtinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and conſequently three diſtinct Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; which I only bring to ſhew the ſilly Sophiſtry of his Argument; but not that I think this glorious Myſtery of the Trinity can be duly repreſented by this Similitude, or any other natural Similitude whatſoever; though it is a certain truth, that the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the three divine relative Properties in the divine Eſſence, prove them no more to be Three Gods, than the diſtinction of the three Dimenſions in a Body, prove that they are three Bodies. And had <hi>W. P.</hi> given the Profeſſion of his Faith in all the other Texts of Scripture, that are commonly underſtood by true Chriſtians, to prove the true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in their relative and perſonal Properties: Yet ſeeing, as hath been fully proved, <hi>W. P.</hi> hath quite another ſenſe of all thoſe Texts, than the true Scripture ſenſe received by all true Chriſtians, the Biſhop might well enough
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101140:19"/>
charge <hi>W. P</hi>'s Faith with being defective, for his impoſing a wrong ſenſe on the ſound Scripture words, as he hath done, and which it is like the Biſhop had juſt occaſion of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion he had done in ſome of his books. Doth <hi>W. P.</hi> think, that if a ſuſpected Papiſt, to clear himſelf of being free of that Popiſh Error of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> ſhould profeſs his Faith in that one Text of Scripture, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body;</hi> would this juſtly clear him of that Suſpicion, ſeeing he may be guilty of that Error, for all his Scripture Confeſſion; it being the common Policy of the greateſt Hereticks, to profeſs their Faith in Scripture words, while by their other words they have made it appear, that they have a Heretical Senſe, as in the preſent caſe is fully evident.</p>
               <p>In Page 31. To excuſe his Equivocation, about his owning Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God, he tells the Biſhop, we call him the beloved Son of God, the only begotten of the Father. And in Page 32 and 33, he tells, they have called him Chriſt, who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and Conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, again and again, yea, that they have not confeſſed his Name leſs than nine times in that Paper. And from this takes occaſion to blame the Biſhop with uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, and being beſide the buſineſs. <hi>And if we have ſaid ſo</hi> (ſaith <hi>W. P.) muſt not the</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:101140:19"/>
                  <hi>Biſhop be extreamly beſide the buſineſs? His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitàbleneſs is as obvious, I will not ſay his Untruth. What ſhall I ſay to his Story of ſome of our Friends, whom he makes to affirm, that Chriſt is not aſcended into Heaven, he is in us. Can it touch us, or ſhould he have ſaid it, and not have proved it? Is that fair and candid; Is it charitable, ſuppoſing it were true, which does not appear? Or is it juſt to inſinuate upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as dubious? But let it be never ſo true</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it cannot conclude the People, if not the Act of the People. The Church of</hi> England <hi>has Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of very different Sentiments, would the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop think it fair, the common Belief of the Church ſhould thereby be concluded.</hi> And in Page 35, he ſaith, <hi>So that though we did not dwell upon Points, but were conciſe in our Expreſſions, yet whatever is implied, or is implicable from any Aſſertion, Juſtice as well as Charity always grants; and ſo would the Biſhop have done, had they been uppermoſt in his Mind when his Pen run ſo faſt againſt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is prodigious Fallacy and Preſumption in <hi>W. P.</hi> thus to treat the Biſhop, or any Chriſtian Man, when he did know in his Conſcience, how far both he and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for all his ſeeming fair Confeſſions, were and ſtill are guilty, in both theſe things, in which the Biſhop very modeſtly doth but blame them, for not expreſſing thoſe Matters more fully and clearly, to take away Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101140:20"/>
out of the Minds of ſome who might be jealous of their Sincerity, as they have but too great ground ſo to be. For as to the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Whither he that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and dyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was the Chriſt and the Son of God truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly? To this <hi>W. P.</hi> hath expreſly oppoſed, in his <hi>Serious Apology,</hi> p. 146. <hi>That the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Perſon that ſuffered, was properly the Son of God, we utterly deny.</hi> It's true, <hi>W. P.</hi> hath called him that was ſo born, Chriſt, and the Son of God; yet that will not prove that he believed him ſo to be truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly: The <hi>Socinians</hi> call Chriſt the Son of God, and yet deny his eternal Generation. And ſo <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> and others of them, call the Man that was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> Chriſt and the Son of God, by ſome Figure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Son of God, the true Chriſt, was in that Man; as the thing containing gets the Name of the thing contained, by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonimy: But ſtill they deny that that Man was properly the Son of God, or that he was God: And accordingly <hi>G. W.</hi> hath found fault again and again, with that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Chriſt his being God-man, calling it unſcripture Language, and alledging it is no where to be found but in the Pope's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons: Hence it is that they deny that Chriſt hath our Nature in Heaven, or that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of a Humane Nature or Body; though
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101140:20"/>
they grant he had a Body, but deny that he conſiſts of it as any part of him; as a Man may have a Coat or Garment, but doth not conſiſt of it: The Foundation of which Error is, that they do not believe the Hypoſtatical or Perſonal Union of the two Natures, ſo as to conſtitute one Chriſt, they will have Chriſt to be nothing properly but the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and that is the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, as well as the Son; as I have plainly proved in my third Narrative eſpecially. And as concerning their denying Chriſt's Aſcenſion into Heaven; firſt, ſeeing <hi>W. P.</hi> denieth the Locality of Heaven, as well as of Hell, he muſt needs grant that Chriſt's Body is either no where aſcended, or is every where, which laſt he ſeems to be for, p. 35. quoting <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10. that <hi>he aſcended far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things.</hi> Then (ſaith he) he is in Man cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly. But as he was the Divine Word, he did fill all things, and was in Man before he aſcended; but this Text doth not prove that his Body filleth all things, for the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not, Whither the Godhead is preſent in all things (which yet is well known ſome of the Quakers have denied, and ſome of them in <hi>Penſilvania</hi> charged me in a publick Meeting with Blaſphemy for aſſerting it) but whither the Body of Chriſt, now ſince his Aſcenſion, is in all things, and every
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101140:21"/>
where; If not every where, then but ſome where; and that ſome-where is a Local Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which <hi>W. P.</hi> hath ſaid is <hi>Mahometan; E. Burrough</hi> charg'd <hi>John Bunnion</hi> with Wickedneſs, for ſaying, <hi>Chriſt was in Heaven in our Nature:</hi> And for the ſame did <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> blame <hi>John Horn,</hi> as I have ſhewn in my Narratives. And ſaith <hi>G. W.</hi> in his <hi>Nature of Chriſtianity,</hi> p. 41. <hi>That Chriſt exiſteth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly bodily without us at God's right hand.</hi> What Scripture hath he <hi>(viz.</hi> his Opponent <hi>R. G.)</hi> for theſe words? <hi>W. Bailey</hi> will have it, That <hi>Chriſt aſcended into Heaven in no body but what came down from Heaven.</hi> All which, and much more is proved out of my three Narratives, the third eſpecially. And whereas he ſaith, <hi>Let it be never ſo true, it cannot affect the People, if not the act of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Church of</hi> England <hi>has Doctors of very differing Sentiments,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, what any one of your Teachers have aſſerted, in Print eſpecially, it affects your Second days Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that licenſeth all your Teachers Books, and yet profeſs to be all one and the ſame in all that ye believe, as God and Truth is the ſame: And if the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath Teachers of different Sentiments in leſſer Matters, yet not in Fundamentals, ſo far as ſhe knows; and if they had, and ſhe ſhould know it, and not cenſure them, it would affect her: From all which it appears,

that <hi>W.

               <p>In his <hi>Page</hi> 51. and 52. <hi>W.

P.</hi> calls one of the ſevereſt Perſecutions, <hi>This to me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is one of the ſevereſt Perſecutions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Spiritual things are only to be Spiritually, diſcern'd and underſtood. I would fain know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how a regenerate Man can poſſibly make a Carnal Man underſtand the new Birth, yea, he chargeth it to look Antichristian, as well as unreaſonable,</hi> and he quotes diverſe places
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101140:22"/>
of Scripture, which he at leaſt implicitly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels at the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as if the <hi>Biſhop</hi> were the <hi>Unregenerate and Natural Man;</hi> that becauſe he is ſo, he cannot underſtand <hi>W.

P.</hi> (that's born after the Spirit,) and his Brethren, <hi>with Tongue and Pen, when he and others, ſuch as he can no longer commit violence upon their Perſons and Eſtates;</hi> and as if the Biſhop were <hi>a very Nicodemus</hi> in the Doctrine of the new Birth. All which (it plainly appears) and much more, <hi>W. P.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly and implicitly levels at the Biſhop, otherwiſe why quotes he ſuch places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with ſuch large diſcourſes on them, if not to point to him; and that his want of the new Birth, and being but a Natural Man, tho' not wanting Academical Learning, made him uncapable of underſtanding <hi>W. P</hi>'s Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Doctrine about the Light within; and after his inſtance of the blindneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the High-Prieſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in not diſcerning the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> when he came, he infers, <hi>let the Biſhop alſo have a care:</hi> and he further tells the Biſhop, he ſhould be glad to ſee the Biſhop's evidence, for the knowledge of God, by the Revelation of the Son of God in his own Soul.</p>
               <p>To give my ſenſe freely, ſo far as I am able to underſtand, the Biſhop hath given a better
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101140:23"/>
account and evidence of his knowledge in the Myſtery of God, and of Chriſt, by his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Scriptural and ſound expreſſions, than <hi>W. P.</hi> and I ſuppoſe, in his manner of Life, is nothing inferior to him. And what evidence of his true knowledge by Internall Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Revelation can <hi>W. P.</hi> give, or has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that the Biſhop cannot give, yea hath not given in this very caſe; Is it enough for <hi>W. P.</hi> to ſay, he has it, and the Biſhop has it not? Or wherein do <hi>W. P</hi>'s fruits of a holy Life, give more evidence of his knowledge and experience of the new Birth, than theſe of the Biſhop? I ſhall firſt take notice of the Biſhop's ſound words, in giving his ſenſe, how the Conſcience of Man is enlightned to know and believe aright, the Doctrines and Articles of Faith, neceſſary to Salvation. <hi>Conſcience</hi> (ſaith the Biſhop) <hi>opened by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, under the Miniſtry of the word</hi> (Acts 16. 14.) <hi>does and muſt take in its Light from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture,</hi> quoting <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 105. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 8. 20. <hi>Now theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are intelligible, this Rule is fixt and certain, nothing of which can be ſaid of your Light within.</hi> This ſhort diſcourſe of the Biſhop, gives a more true and intelligible account of the Light within, as it is in every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, which the Biſhop has contained within three lines, than <hi>W. P</hi>'s ramble in his Ten pages of his Book, and in the many hundred
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101140:23"/>
pages of his other Books, that he hath ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about it, to render it intelligible, even to natural and unconverted Men, for to ſuch he did write as well as unto others; and yet now he affirms it is not intelligible to natural Men, (ſuch as he thinks the Biſhop is) for want of experience of the new Birth. And poſitively aſſerts <hi>P.</hi> 49. that our <hi>Natural Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Faculty</hi> is our <hi>ſight</hi> but not our <hi>Light,</hi> that by which we diſcern, and Judge what the <hi>Divine Light</hi> ſhews us. And in <hi>P.</hi> 50. he ſaith, <hi>The Biſhop's</hi> Natural Conſcience, <hi>muſt only mean a Capacity that Man has by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is in his Creation, of making a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf, his Duty and Actions, according to the Judgment of God manifeſted to him</hi> by the Light of Chriſt within. Now ſince <hi>W. P.</hi> muſt needs grant, that the Biſhop (ſuppoſe but a natural Man, as <hi>W. P.</hi> moſt uncharitably will needs have him to be) has a Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the Natural Rational faculty of the Soul, which is the <hi>Sight,</hi> or <hi>Eye</hi> by which he can diſcern and Judge what the <hi>Divine Light</hi> ſhews him; and alſo that <hi>W. P.</hi> ſtrongly aſſerts, that all Men have the <hi>Divine Light</hi> in them; and conſequently the Biſhop muſt have it alſo, what hinders but that the Biſhop ſhould underſtand <hi>W. P</hi>'s Doctrine about the Light within, were it really intelligible, ſeeing by <hi>W. P</hi>'s confeſſion the Biſhop has not only the <hi>Light within</hi> him the ſame that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101140:24"/>
                  <hi>W. P.</hi> hath, but the ſame <hi>Sight</hi> within him alſo; that is, as <hi>W. P.</hi> defines it, the ſame <hi>Natural Rational Faculty,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which is the Capacity, whereby to ſee or diſcern what the divine Light ſhews. Beſides it were all to no purpoſe for <hi>W. P.</hi> and all the Teachers among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to preach ſo frequently to Natural and Wicked Men, exhorting them to mind the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, obey it and give up to its Leadings, if they were not capable to underſtand it, as <hi>W. P.</hi> here ſaith they are not, though in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to his and his Brethrens daily Practiſe. But according to the Doctrine of the Holy Scripture, the Spiritual or inward Eye of the Mind of regenerate Perſons, whereby they diſcern Spiritual and Divine Objects, is not the Natural Rational Faculty, or Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſcience, which all Men (though vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious) generally have, but ſome more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spiritual Faculty in the Soul, ſuperior to the Natural Rational Faculty, as the Natural Rational Faculty is ſuperior to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty, the which ſuperior Spiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Soul, above the Natural Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal faculty is ſhut up, or as it were extinct, in meer Natural Men, until it be opened and awakened in them by the Spiritual Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and new Birth, according to <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. (above quoted by the Biſhop) and <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. And how much more agreeable
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101140:24"/>
is it to the Holy Scripture, to ſay, that true Divine Faith is the Sight of regenerated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whereby they look to Chriſt the great object and Author of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. than that the Natural Rational Faculty is it, as <hi>W. P.</hi> ſaith it is. But by <hi>W. P</hi>'s diſcourſe both here and elſewhere, he ſeems to be as ignorant of the Spiritual <hi>Sight</hi> of the regenerated Soul, as of the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Divine Light</hi> whereby it is enlightned; and the Biſhop has given a far more true account of both in three lines, than <hi>W. P.</hi> has done either in this or all his other Books, in which ſuccinct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſive definition of the Biſhop, <hi>theſe two things</hi> are worthily to be obſerved, <hi>the firſt is,</hi> that that which makes the Conſcience of Man capable to know and <hi>believe aright,</hi> the Doctrines and Articles of Faith neceſſary to Salvation, is, that <hi>the Conſcience be opened by the Holy Spirit,</hi> for which he citeth <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. <hi>How the Lord opened the Heart of</hi> Lydia, <hi>that ſhe attended unto the things which were ſpoken of</hi> Paul. And as by opening of the Heart, in <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. is underſtood a ſpecial Illumination of the Holy Ghoſt, by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, given to <hi>Lydia,</hi> whoſe Heart the Lord thus opened (which ſhe had not before, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the common Illumination, which ſhe had before) ſo no doubt the Biſhop hath the ſame ſence of it in agreement with the Doctrine of the 39 Articles of the Church
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101140:25"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> that aſſerteth the neceſſity of a ſpecial Illumination of the Holy Ghoſt (above and beyond the common Illumination given to Mankind in general) to give the ſaving Knowledge and Faith of Chriſtian Doctrine to any who have it. But this ſpecial Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination given to Believers only in. Chriſt Crucified, <hi>W. P.</hi> doth not acknowledge, he thinks the common Illumination given to <hi>Infidel Jews, Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient without any thing elſe, or without any ſuperadded Illumination in ſpecial; for to grant any ſuch ſuperadded ſpecial Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being neceſſary to the Faithful, would quite overturn <hi>W. P</hi>'s Fabrick of the General Rule of Faith and Life to all Mankind: And by this it appears, that the Biſhop's Doctrine about the Internal Illumination, or Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Chriſt by the Holy Ghoſt, as it is much more true than that of <hi>W. P</hi>'s, ſo it is much more excellent and ſublime, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhing Chriſtianity from Deiſm; whereas <hi>W. P</hi>'s Doctrine about the inward Illumination doth confound them, and make them one and the ſame thing. The ſecond thing that is worthy to be noticed in this ſuccinct and comprehenſive Definition given by the Biſhop, is, that the Conſcience is thus opened, <hi>i. e.</hi> illuminated and inſpired by the Holy Spirit under the Miniſtry of the Word, and ſo does and muſt take in its <hi>Light</hi> from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101140:25"/>
Holy Scripture, to wit, the Light of the Chriſtian Doctrine, which the Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from the Scriptures inſtrumentally, the Holy Scripture being the Inſtrument of the Spirit, and of his preparing, whereby he doth enlighten the Hearts of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, both to believe the Truth, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the depth of the Chriſtian Doctrine.</p>

Salvation, the extraordinary Revelation of theſe Truths, without all outward means of Inſtruction, being given only to ſome ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons, as the Prophets and Apoſtles, but was never given in any Age to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nay, nor to all the Faithful in any Age, for even in the days of the Apoſtles, when Prophetical Inſpiration, and extraordinary Revelation did moſt abound in the Church, it was not given to all the Faithful, but only to ſome, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Do all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie?</hi> Intimating they did not, though a Manifeſtation of the Spirit was given to every one to profit withall, yet that was not the extraordinary Revelation given to the Apoſtles and Prophets, but the ordinary given to the Faithful, to enable them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and underſtand what was outwardly taught them, by the Apoſtles and Prophets Words and Writings.</p>
               <p>Having thus taken a view of the Biſhop's Chriſtian ſound Scriptural Doctrine, both of Chriſt's Light within by the Illumination of the Holy Spirit, and of the Scripture Light without, as joyntly neceſſary (in God's ordinary way of working) to the Faithful, the which Scripture Light, as in reſpect of the Doctrine, Laws, Commands, Precepts and Promiſes of God delivered therein, the Biſhop hath well proved from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 105. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20. and which Scripture-light
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101140:27"/>
may in a true ſenſe be called (though more remotely) the Spirits Light. In the next place, let us take a view of <hi>W. P.</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and unſcriptural Doctrine of the Light within, which he ſaith in his page 48, is with him and his Brethren a Fundamental, which one while he calls Chriſt, the Word God; another while the Light of Chriſt, a Manifeſtation in the Soul of Man, of Chriſt, the Word God. This Light within, his great Fundamental, as given to all Mankind, even to them who have not the Scripture, nor any external Revelation of Chriſt, as he outwardly came in the Fleſh; he will not have it to be <hi>the Law of God in the Heart of Man, nor the Impreſſions and Principles which are born, and come with us into the World,</hi> page 50. <hi>As the Work is not the Work-man, ſo they are not properly the Light of Chriſt, but the bleſſed Fruit and Effect of the Light of Chriſt, the word God in Man, which ſhines in the Heart, and gives him the Knowledge of God, and of his Duty to him; ſo that the innate Notions, or inward Knowledge we have of God, is from this true Light that lighteth every Man coming into the World, but is not that Light if ſelf.</hi> But why then doth he ſo confound the Work with the Work-man, as one while he tells us, the Light within is Chriſt; another while a Manifeſtation in the Soul of Man of Chriſt, the Word God. Is not the Manifeſtation of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101140:28"/>
Chriſt in the Soul of Man, a Work of Chriſt? How then is it Chriſt himſelf the Word God? <hi>W. P.</hi> may remember how his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>G. W.</hi> in his <hi>Light and Life</hi> recommended by him, hath argued againſt the Body of Chriſt being Chriſt, for if it were, it would have this Senſe, <hi>the Chriſt of Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>the Jeſus of Jeſus,</hi> which to him is Nonſence: Is it not great Nonſence to ſay, The Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Chriſt, to wit, the Act or Effect of his Illumination in the Soul, is Chriſt himſelf? The Body of Chriſt, together with his Soul, are conſtitutive parts of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood Nature, perſonally united to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; and may and do receive the Name of Chriſt and Jeſus, as the parts do receive the Name of the whole; but the Manifeſtation of Chriſt in the Soul of Man, is no part of Chriſt's Manhood, nor of his Godhead which hath no parts, but is only a Work of Chriſt in the Soul of Man, by which it is enlightned And as the Work ſuppoſeth the Work-man, or Worker, to be preſent in the Soul, to wit, Chriſt conſidered as the Word God, which the Biſhop to be ſure, in the true Sence, will acknowledge, ſo the Work-man ſuppoſeth the Work as neceſſary to be wrought in the Soul; for Chriſt, as he is the Word God, conſidered ſimply, whither as in himſelf, or as in Men, is no <hi>Light</hi> to Men; but as he hath his Work and Operation in them to enlighten
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101140:28"/>
them, though in and to himſelf, he <hi>is Light and Life eſſentially,</hi> but to Men he is ſo, by his Operations in them, and ſo is called Light to Men, by a Metonimy, of the Name of the Effect given to the Cauſe. Such is Mens weakneſs, at leaſt in this Mortal State, that we have no immediate Knowledge of the Eſſence of any Creature, we know their Eſſence but by their Operations; nay, we have no immediate Knowledge either of the Eſſence of our Bodies, or of our Souls, but only by their Operations: Hence it is that the greateſt Philoſophers are at a loſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Eſſence of any thing, becauſe our Knowledge doth not immediately reach their Eſſence, but only by their Operation; when we ſee the Body of a Man, Beaſt or Tree, we ſee not the Eſſence of theſe Bodies, but the outward Forms, and Shapes, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of them, all which are but their acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and not their Eſſence or Subſtance; and if we have no immediate Knowledge of any Creatures Eſſence or Subſtance, great or ſmall, how can or dare we preſume to ſay or think, we ſee even with our inward Eyes or Sight (what <hi>W. P.</hi> calls the natural rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Faculty, for that's all the inward Sight even of the Light within, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in the beſt of Men) the Eſſence of the Divine Word, the Word God, by whom all things were created, by immediate Sight or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101140:29"/>
Perception; for as <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 1. 18. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4 12. <hi>No Man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> [to wit, as in himſelf, in his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Eſſence and eſſential Glory.] And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He dwelleth in the Light, which none can approach unto, whom no Man hath ſeen, or can ſee,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 16. If then we ſee not, or know not this Divine Work-man, (who is in us, and in all things, becauſe he is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent) by any immediate Perception, Sight or Knowledge of him, it is only by ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Manifeſtation and Operation of him in us, which is only and alone what he pleaſeth to give us as a moſt free Agent.</p>

W.</hi> hath profeſſed elſewhere, who have affirmed, that they are wronged by their Adverſaries charging them, with holding that Chriſt is in every Man; <hi>Which</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we never affirmed that Chriſt was in every Man, but a Light from Chriſt was in every Man;</hi> and ſince that they vary it thus, that they do not affirm, <hi>that whole Chriſt is in every Man,</hi> or in any Man, though contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their great A poſtle <hi>G. F.</hi> who hath affirmed, <hi>(Great Myſt.</hi> p. 249.) that they <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>have whole Chriſt in them,</hi> Chriſt-God, and Chriſt-Man, Fleſh and Spirit, which <hi>W. P.</hi> hath deſended, arguing, that ſeeing they eat his Fleſh, it muſt be in them;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101140:30"/>
falſly reaſoning from a Metaphorical eating to a literal: Now if the by the Fleſh of Chriſt; which <hi>W. P.</hi> ſaith they have in them, they mean not Chriſt's Body of Fleſh, which was Nailed to the Croſs, and yet have whole Chriſt in them, both God and Man, Fleſh and Spirit, it evidently followeth, that that outward Fleſh was not part of him; for they have whole Chriſt in them, God and Man, Fleſh and Spirit, and yet they have none of that Fleſh in them which was Nailed to the Croſs; beſides how improper, or rather ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd it is for <hi>W. P.</hi> to talk of whole Chriſt, conſidered as the word God, and meaſures or parts of Chriſt, ſeeing the Godhead of the Word, which is one and the ſame God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Father, hath no parts nor paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as both the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of all true Chriſtian Churches doth hold; though <hi>G. F.</hi> hath made the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to have</hi> parts, and that <hi>the Soul of Man is a part of God;</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> hath affirmed, that <hi>Chriſt ſuffereth by Mens Sins, as he is God, or in his Godhead.</hi> See his <hi>Divinity of Chriſt, Page</hi> 56.</p>
               <p>And let <hi>W. P.</hi> ſhift and ſhuffle and wind and turn ever ſo much, he can never make it intelligible to any Man, that the <hi>Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> ſimply as the word <hi>God</hi> and abſtractly conſidered, without all ſpecial Illumination, and without the Doctrine of the Goſpel as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101140:31"/>
outwardly delivered us in the Holy Scriptures doth teach us and all Men, all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation; ſeeing by his plain confeſſion in his diſcourſe concerning <hi>The general Rule of Faith and Life,</hi> he acknowledgeth that the Light within by its common diſcoveries, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to Men the knowledge of Chriſt's Incarnation, Birth, Death and Sufferings, but that they belong to extraordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And therefore that knowledge and Faith, to wit, of Chriſt's Incarnation, Birth, Death and Sufferings, by <hi>W. P</hi>'s Doctrine, is not neceſſary to his Salvation, though he has a Hiſtorical Knowledge and Faith of it, yet that is not neceſſary, for it is not certain to him whither true of falſe, he has no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Revelation of it, and that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Mankind teacheth nothing of it. And <hi>W. P.</hi> and his Brethren are guilty of a great Fallacy and piece of Sophiſtry, to cry out againſt all their Opponents, as guilty of Blaſphemy, for denying the ſufficiency of the Light within to Salvation, without any thing elſe. Seeing that Light within is Chriſt, for it is as much as to ſay, Chriſt is not ſufficient to Salvation. And thus ſome of them have charged me in particular, to whom I have anſwered, that ſeeing Chriſt is truly Chriſt without us as well as within us, and much more gloriouſly manifeſted in the Fleſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, If it is no blaſphemy to ſay, Chriſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101140:31"/>
without us cannot ſave us, without his being in us, as they will readily grant, ſo nor is it Blaſphemy to ſay, Chriſt within us cannot ſave us, without Chriſt without us. And with reſpect to Chriſt's inward Teaching and Illumination, they groſly and fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly prevaricate in ſtating the queſtion, as whither the <hi>Light within,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Word God</hi> is a Light ſufficient to Teach or Guide every Man the way to Eternal Salvation: Thus they think to have their Opponents every way at a diſadvantage, and to catch them in their Dilemma, if they ſay, Yea, the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> have gained the point, as they imagine: If they ſay Nay, they are guilty of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt Chriſt <hi>the word God within</hi> them, as not being ſufficient. But this Sophiſtical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma is eaſily diſcovered and anſwered, for by the ſufficiency of the <hi>Light within</hi> every Man to guide to Salvation, is not meant what Chriſt the <hi>Word God</hi> can reveal, to and in every Man; for who queſtions that, that he can do it abundantly; but the true ſtate of the queſtion is, What he doth reveal to and in every Man, that is or may be a ſufficient diſcovery to him, for his eternal Salvation, <hi>W. P.</hi> and his Brethren hold the affirmative, the Biſhop, and all true Chriſtians, Yea all but meer <hi>Deiſts,</hi> hold the Negative, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt conſidered as <hi>the word God,</hi> doth not reveal to and in every Man: As for example,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101140:32"/>
not to any of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or any others here here in <hi>England,</hi> all that is ſufficient to their Salvation, by the common Illumination, without ſpecial ſuperadded Illuminations of Chriſt by the Holy Spirit, that is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than the common, in the uſe of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, to wit, the Doctrines of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, outwardly Preached, or at leaſtwiſe read to us or by us. If they ſay it doth, then let them not only tell us, but prove to us, intelligibly, to convince our Natural Rational Faculty, (which <hi>W. P.</hi> calleth the Eye or Sight, whereby the Soul of every Man is capable to diſcern, what the Light within ſheweth,) that the <hi>Light in them,</hi> by its common Illumination, without all outward means of Inſtruction, from or by the Holy Scriptures hath taught them, one or more of the Twelve Articles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed, according to the true ſenſe of Scripture, and generally received by all true Chriſtians; If they confeſs it hath not taugh: them any one of them, it evidently follows, that they think not any one of them is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to their Faith or Chriſtianity, <hi>i. e.</hi> their Deiſm for Salvation. And yet it is ſtrange, that <hi>W. P.</hi> ſhould be ſo fallacious as as to affirm, that the Doctrines of God, of Chriſt, of the Holy Ghoſt, of remiſſion of Sin, and Juſtification from the guilt of Sin, by Chriſt the Propitiation, the Reſurrection
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101140:32"/>
of the Dead are Fundamentals of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, none of which the Light within them, without Scripture, hath taught him to believe as I think he hath plainly confeſſed; and yet it hath taught him all that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Salvation without Scripture, he having denyed that the Scripture is the Rule of his, or their Faith, as touching any of theſe matters, and conſequently not ſo much as the Inſtrument, whereby the Holy Spirit has wrought that Faith in him; therefore what Faith he or they have of theſe things, is but Hiſtorical and Uncertain; and as the old Heavens that muſt paſs away, and which hath already paſſed away from them, ſeeing they pretend they are come to the new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens already. And yet he is ſo fallacious to ſay <hi>P.</hi> 97. <hi>It is generally thought that we do not hold the common Doctrines of Chriſtianity, but have introduced new and erroneous ones in lieu thereof.</hi> This I have ſufficiently proved to be true, here and elſewhere, and ſo have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers done the ſame. But what followeth, <hi>Whereas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we plainly and entirely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Truths contained in that called the Apoſtles Creed.</hi> Yes ſay I, juſt ſo, as he may ſay, they plainly and entirely believe the Truths in the <hi>Turks</hi> Alcoran, which may be ſuppoſed to have ſome Truths, though many more falſities. This ſaying of his ſeems to have a mental Reſervation, as if there were ſome
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101140:33"/>
things in that Creed that were not Truths. <hi>W. P.</hi> would do well to tell us plainly what they are.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101140:33"/>
to Men under a Goſpel-Miniſtry, as is evident by the due conſideration of them, as for <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. allowing it to be meant of the common Illumination, and diverſe other places of Scripture, that might be brought to prove that there is ſuch a common Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, from the word God in all Men, as a preparatory Miniſtration, this doth not prove that that common Illumination is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, without the ſpecial that is given to the Faithful. And whereas he ſaith in his 6th Article or Section of his <hi>Goſpel Truths, They that turn not at the reproofs thereof,</hi> (to wit, the Light within, with reſpect to its common Illumination) <hi>and will not repent, and live and walk according to it, ſhall dye in their Sins; and where Chriſt is gone, they ſhall never come.</hi> Tho' there be a Truth in the words he has here ſet down, yet he quite miſapplies that place of Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 8. 24. and fallaciouſly leaves out the foregoing words which are theſe, <hi>For if ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your Sins</hi> and as it is in v 21. <hi>And whither I go ye cannot come;</hi> by which words it is plainly evident, that for their Sin of not believing in Chriſt God-man without them, eſpecially, they were to dye in their Sins.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101140:34"/>
Illumination, reproving for common Sins; whereas it's plain from v. 9. that the Sin of which eſpecially the Comforter, <hi>viz.</hi> The Holy Spirit ſhould convince Men, ſhould be the Sin of unbelief, <hi>viz.</hi> For not believing that that very Man that ſpoke unto them, was the Chriſt of God the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Redeemer and Saviour of the World.

Why God hath not given the External Revelation of the Goſpel Doctrine, concerning Chriſt the Propitiation as he outwardly dyed for the Sins of Men, nor the ſpecial Illumination, nor conviction of the Spirit, that ordinarily accompanieth the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101140:34"/>
outward Preaching of the Goſpel to many parts of Mankind, belongeth to the depth of his moſt righteous Judgments, againſt which we have no cauſe to diſpute, but to cry out with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 11. 33. <hi>O the depth of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God, how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his ways, paſt finding out;</hi> and alſo with Holy Admiration and Thankfulneſs to bleſs God, that he has given us the Light of his Goſpel, both by the Doctrine of it outwardly, and by the ſpecial Illuminations of his Spirit and Divine word inwardly, which he has not given to many others, though we were not more worthy of it than they: So that what the Pſalmiſt ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Jewiſh Church of old, may be well and fitly applied to the Chriſtian Church, and Nations in Chriſtendom, where the Goſpel is preached, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47. 19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his Statutes and his Judgments unto</hi> Iſrael; <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with any Nation; and as for his Judgments, they have not known them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth all that I have ſaid on this Head, render Salvation impoſſible to theſe parts of Mankind, to whom the Light of the Goſpel hath not ſhined outwardly, by any external Revelation of it; ſeeing God can ſupply that defect, by ways and methods unknown to us, who worketh by his Spirit, when,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101140:35"/>
where, and how he pleaſeth; it is ſufficient to us, to know, that the ordinary way and means, that God hath provided for Mens eternal Salvation, is by outward means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to wit, the Doctrine of the Goſpel, as outwardly delivered us in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is always accompanied with the ſpecial Illumination of Chriſt, by the Holy Spirit, to all that ſhall obtain eternal Salvation; and that there is no other way or name under Heaven, whereby Men muſt be-ſaved, but the Name of Jeſus; nor no Promiſe of Salvation to any, but through Faith in that Name, even of Chriſt as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly he came, and was and is a Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for our Sins: And though God can Save, and hath ſaved ſome, without the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of the Word as outwardly preached; yet this will not prove, that ever any was or ſhall be ſaved by the meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Illumination given to all Men, which yet is <hi>W.

and Faith in him, the great and only Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for Sin, which is <hi>W. P</hi>'s great Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental he hath not proved, and the Greek Calends will ſooner come, than ever he, or any for him can prove it.</p>
               <p>In his Page 21 he tells us, <hi>The</hi> Nature <hi>of this excellent Principle, the Light within every Man, is to diſcover Sin, reprove for it, and lead out of it, all ſuch as love and obey the Convictions thereof.</hi> That the Principle of the <hi>Light within,</hi> even with reſpect to its common Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to and in every Man, is excellent, is granted; and I do not think will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Biſhop, or any true Chriſtian; but he derogates greatly from the Excellency of it, to tell us, the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, is to do ſo and ſo, as if it were a natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Agent; as it is the nature of the Fire to burn, of the Sun to give light, I ask <hi>W. P.</hi> Is it the nature of the word God to Create, as a neceſſary Agent? If it is the nature of the Divine word to Create, he could not but Create, otherwiſe he ſhould change his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as becauſe it is the nature of the Fire to burn, if it did not burn, it ſhould change its nature. And if it be the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>word God,</hi> to diſcover Sin, and reprove for it, and lead out of it, then that Divine word can do no otherwiſe; and conſequently is he not a neceſſary, and not a free Agent? It had been better, and more Sound and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101140:36"/>
for <hi>W. P.</hi> to have ſaid, It is the good will and pleaſure of the Divine word, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove for Sin, and alſo of the <hi>Spirit, who bloweth where he pleaſeth,</hi> according to the old Latin Tranſlation, and which the Greek well beareth, and was generally ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Ancients, both Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, <hi>Spiritus ſpirat ubi vult, The Spirit breatheth where he willeth and pleaſeth,</hi> in all to diſcover and reprove for Sin, and yet not in all abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to bring them out of Sin; or to work that Obedience in all, ſo as to be brought out of Sin. It had wont to be a Doctrine among the Quakers, that God giveth a Day of Viſitation, which may expire and paſs over ſome before they dye; and yet even ſuch, after their day of Viſitation is expired, have that Light in them which reproveth for Sin: And as the Viſitation of ſome may be expired, ſo the Viſitation of others may be yet to come; the outward Sun, though a natural and neceſſary Agent, yet ſhineth not to all at once; when it is ſetting to ſome, it is riſing to others; and when it is midnight to ſome, it is mid-day to others, that is, an Emblem of the ſhining of this Divine Sun in Mens Hearts; and which, if I well remember, <hi>W. P.</hi> hath ſome where uſed in ſome of his Books, but is not too far to be ſtretched; for though the outward Sun ſhine to all at one time or another, yet ſome
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101140:36"/>
parts of the Earth have not that Influence of the Sun, that ſufficeth to ripen the Fruits of the Earth to ſuſtain Humane Life, or preſerve from unſupportable Cold, as under the North and South Poles, and near adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent parts, where ſcarce ever any of Mankind yet was, or could come; and no doubt the word God doth in ſome ſort enlighten the Devils, and all the Fallen Angels, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth them ſeverely for their Sins, ſo that they believe and tremble; but is it the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Divine Word in them, to lead out of Sin, all ſuch of the Devils and Fallen Angels, as love and obey the Convictions thereof? Were not this to <hi>ſupponere non ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pmendum,</hi> to ſuppoſe what is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that any of the Devils or Fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels can love and obey the Convictions thereof? And is it not thus alſo with many Men, though they have ſome real Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the common Illumination of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word, yet barely and meerly by the common Illumination given unto them by the ſame, until God viſit with ſpecial Illumination, and his ſpecial Grace and Favour, they are held as in Iron Chains and Bonds, ſo that they cannot come out, their Priſon door is ſhut, they are incloſed in great Darkneſs, even thick Darkneſs like that of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo that they cannot come out, though they have ſo much Light that ſhineth in their Darkneſs, as to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101140:37"/>
diſcover Sin, and reprove for it, in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, yet power is not given them, to leave their Sins and come out of them, except God viſit with ſome more powerful Viſitation of his ſpecial Illumination and Grace, above what is common to all Mankind. The way for <hi>W. P.</hi> to have proved, that <hi>this Light</hi> in every Man, teacheth him ſufficiently all that is needful to Salvation, had been to have given a more full deſcription of the <hi>Light within</hi> than he hath given, and then made Application, as thus, The <hi>Light within,</hi> whom ever it <hi>enlightneth</hi> with a <hi>ſaving Illumination,</hi> that fully ſufficeth to guide to Salvation, without any ſuperadded Illumination differing in ſpecie (only allowing the neceſſity of greater Degrees in the ſame ſpecie) it not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth Sin to them, convinceth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth for it, and woundeth the Heart and Conſcience with the Senſe of God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Wrath, and Curſe due for Sin, but ſheweth them the Remedy the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as he died for our Sins, and by his Death on the Croſs, became the Propitiation for our Sins, and is now the Propitiation for us, as he is in Heaven, at God's right Hand, in the true Nature of Man, ever living to make Interceſſion for us. But all this the <hi>Light within</hi> doth by the common Illumination in every Man, therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>W. P.</hi> knowing that he could not affirm
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101140:37"/>
this of the Light within, as only enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the common Illumination, fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly after his ordinary manner, leaves out the chief Matter, which was, that the Light within every Man, not only diſcovers to every Man his Sin, but diſcovers the great Remedy, to wit, Chriſt the Propitiation for Sin, by whom the Guilt and Curſe due for Sin, is taken away from all ſuch as ſincerely believe in him, which ſincere Faith is always accompanied with ſincere Repentance, and new Obedience.</p>

In his 7th and 8th Sections, he proceedeth with the like fallacy, telling us, how he and his Brethren, are prepared and aſſiſted by this principle, in Praying, Praiſing, and Preaching to others the way of God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as they wait in their Aſſemblies, to feel God's Spirit, to open and move upon their Hearts, that they may Preach in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as well as in words, and that they thus wait, before they dare offer Sacrifice to the Lord.</p>
               <p>How far this is falſe in matter of Fact, is well enough known to their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and the unſound words they moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſe both in Preaching and Praying, is a plain Demonſtration of it, that they are not generally acted, or moved by the Spirit of God, in their Prayings or Preachings: If the manner of their Praying and Preaching is as the manner of their Writing, which they will ſay, is the ſame; for they as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly pretend to write by the Motion of the Spirit of God, as to Preach and Pray by it. But can it be ſuppoſed that Men are acted or moved by the Spirit of God, to bring forth ſo many falſe Doctrines, vile Hereſies and Errors, and groſs Untruths and Fallacies, and uncharitable Judgments and Perverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Opponents words, as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do in their writings generally. But what way to the Kingdom do they Preach?
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101140:39"/>
Poſſibly they will ſay, Chriſt, who ſaid he was the way: But how do they Preach him to be the way? Juſt as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where Preached him in Print, to wit, as the Word God and the Light within, whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to diſcover Sin, and lead out of it, all ſuch who Love and obey the Convictions of it, and that only and alone by the common Illumination, which by <hi>W. P</hi>'s confeſſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers nothing of Chriſt as he became a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our Sins, by his Death on the Croſs. The great ſubject of the Apoſtles Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was Chriſt Crucified, and remiſſion of Sin, by Faith in him; and how all Spiritual Bleſſings, yea, the gift of the Holy Spirit himſelf, comes to us by the Crucified Jeſus, and Faith in him: but little or nothing of this ſort of Preaching is to be found either in your Meetings, or Books, but much againſt it; though to cover your Vile Errors, you will now and then ſeem to own it, but forgetting your ſelves, quickly diſown it all again. Yea <hi>W. P.</hi> knoweth in his Conſcience, how both publickly and privately he hath blamed me, and charged me with my being an Apoſtate, for my aſſerting the neceſſity of Friends Preaching this Faith, to wit, in Chriſt as he dyed for our Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as being abſolutely neceſſary to Regeneration, for us to have this Faith, and to know and experience Chriſt formed in us, and to live, dwell and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101140:40"/>
Rule in us. For this my Chriſtian Teſtimony, he charged me at <hi>Ratcliff Meeting,</hi> that <hi>I did what in me lay to pluck up the Teſtimony of Truth by the Roots.</hi> And at the Yearly Meeting at <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet</hi> in the Year 1694, he ſtood up, and accuſed me before ſome hundred Friends of them called the Miniſtry and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that I was ſeeking to bring in a <hi>New method of Preaching</hi> among Friends, which was to Preach <hi>Chriſt without,</hi> and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith in him, in order to bring People to the knowledge and experience of the new Birth, and Chriſt in them, as he dwells in the Saints: And alſo he knows in his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when and where, and to whom he hath accuſed me for Preaching Chriſt without in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Chriſt within; which God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth I never did: And therefore in his ſo doing he hath falſly accuſed me, though his and his Brethrens falſe Notions of Chriſt within, as above explained, I have oppoſed, and by God's help ſhall oppoſe, and witneſs againſt while I live. But the true Scripture ſenſe of Chriſt within, as the <hi>Word God</hi> and of Chriſt <hi>the Word made Fleſh without us,</hi> who is ſtill but one Chriſt, and of his ſufficiency to our Salvation, both as without us and within us; without us, as he came to procure and purchaſe it for us by his Blood and Merits, and within us by his Spiritual appearance and ſpecial Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Spirit, in the uſe of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101140:40"/>
means, to apply it to us, and to work the bleſſed and glorious effect of it in us, I have owned, and ſtill hope to own it, to the end of my days.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>W.

                     <hi>His uncivil Treatment of the Biſhop of</hi> Cork, <hi>as if he were Ignorant of Regeneration, and the way how it is wrought. The Biſhop has ſoundly and Christianly explained the Doctrine of Regeneration, and the way how it is wrought.</hi> W.

His Fallacy in ſeeming to agree to the Biſhop's Aſſertion from that Text</hi> Rom. 10. 9. <hi>His Fallaeious Argument, that becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Leads and Rules, therefore the Spirit is the Rule detected; the Ruler and the Rule diſtinct. The great Bleſſing and Advantage of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, being a means to preſerve us, by the Grace of God, and aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, from</hi> Satan's <hi>Deluſions and Impoſtures.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN his 26th <hi>Page</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I think nothing makes a Man a true Chriſtian but Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Power of the Son of God revealed in the Soul, converting it to God.</hi> And in his <hi>P.</hi> 29 he ſaith, <hi>I would have my Reader reflect well upon this great and Eſſential Truth, Tho he were as Big as a Biſhop.</hi> Reader, what thinkſt thou of this Uncivil, Proud and Diſdainful Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! But ſo far as I underſtand, <hi>W. P.</hi> ſheweth himſelf, as if he were much more big than a Biſhop, he treats the Modeſt and humble Biſhop as if he were one of his meaneſt ſubjects. But for all <hi>W. P</hi>'s pretence,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101140:41"/>
to be ſo Skilful in that great and eſſential Truth of the neceſſity of Regeneration, and the manner and way of its being wrought above and beyond the Biſhop, the Biſhop has beyond all doubt, in his ſhort Teſtimony, in three or four lines on that Head, made it evident, that he underſtands the Myſtery of Regeneration, and the manner how it is wrought, better than <hi>W. P.</hi> for all his Big and Lordly thoughts he has of himſelf, and for all his Big talk of the new Creature and Self-denial, there is great a deal more of it in his Books than in his Life. But mark, how <hi>W. P.</hi> deſcribes the manner how Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wrought; That it is by the power of the Son of God revealed in the Soul, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to God, which are ſuch general words and terms, and true when taken in a true Scripture ſenſe, that not only every Biſhop, but every Curate of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and every ordinary Chriſtian can ſay the ſame. But under theſe general Words <hi>W. P.</hi> hideth a great Fallacy; what doth <hi>W. P.</hi> mean by the power of the Son of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Soul converting it to God? No other thing, but the power of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Illumination of the Light within, given to <hi>Infidel Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and all moral <hi>Heathens,</hi> who if they are but meer Juſt Men, according to <hi>W. P</hi>'s <hi>Goſpel and Syſtem of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> they are Regenerated Perſons, though
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101140:42"/>
they have no ſpecial Illumination of the Holy Spirit, giving them any inward and ſpiritual knowledge and Faith of the Son of God, <hi>as the word Incarnate,</hi> or <hi>word made Fleſh,</hi> and as he was Miraculouſly conceived by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and born of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> dyed for our Sins and roſe again. None of all this doth the common and ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the Light within teach <hi>W. P.</hi> and his Brethren, and yet this is all he ſets up, in order to bring People to the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and to become the Sons of God. Not only the Biſhop, but the meaneſt Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his Dioceſs, I charitably think can give a better account, according to Scripture, of the manner how Regeneration is wrought in Men, to wit, by receiving Chriſt, through a lively Faith wrought in them, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Power of the Son of God inwardly revealed in them, and by the Doctrine of Chriſt outwardly Preached in God's ordinary way, and believing in his Name, according to all his Offices, <hi>viz.</hi> his prophetical, prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Kingly Office. The Faith and perſwaſion of the great Love of God, in giving his Son to dye for us, and of the great Love of Chriſt who gave himſelf for us, inwardly revealed in us, not by the common Illumination given to <hi>Heathens,</hi> but by ſpecial Illumination of Chriſt in our Hearts, perſwading us of the truth and certainty of the Scriptures Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101140:42"/>
and Teſtimony concerning this Love works <hi>that change</hi> in us, that the Scripture calls <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or the <hi>New Creature;</hi> for thus the Scripture witneſſeth, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. <hi>To as many as received him he gave them Power to become the Sons of God, even to as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his Name.</hi> And this believing in his Name, was not only a believing his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, or Light in them, but by ſpecial Illumination and operation of his mighty power in them, believing in him, as he outwardly came in the Fleſh, dyed for our Sins and roſe again, as our King, Prieſt and Prophet without us, as well as the Light within or <hi>Word God</hi> within us, as <hi>Paul</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ye are all the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. to wit, as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Crucified and raiſed again. And as <hi>John</hi> teſtified, 1. <hi>John</hi> 5. 1. Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth (to wit, with a ſincere Faith) that Jeſus, (even that very Jeſus that was born of <hi>Mary)</hi> is the Chriſt is born of God. But none of all this Faith doth <hi>W. P.</hi> think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Regeneration or Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for otherwiſe it would exclude all his <hi>Deiſt</hi> Brethren, and moral Juſt Men among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> from being Regenerate Perſons and his ſort of Chriſtians; whereas the Biſhop hath plainly owned the neceſſity of this Faith to Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and eternal Salvation, in his ſound
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101140:43"/>
but ſhort Chriſtian Teſtimony; and <hi>W. P.</hi> taken notice of it, and ſeems (but moſt falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly) to agree to it in his <hi>Page</hi> 44. <hi>In the firſt part of his note</hi> (ſaith <hi>W. P.) I agree with him, that all who rightly believe the Text,</hi> Rom. 10. 9. <hi>Will be Saved; for that muſt be by the Illumination, and working of the ſaving Power of Chriſt in the Heart, that he can ſo believe.</hi> Here <hi>W. P.</hi> and the Biſhop would ſeem to agree, for no doubt the Biſhop doth ſo believe. But O the ſtupendious falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>W. P.</hi> in this very thing! <hi>All that Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe the Text</hi> Rom. 10. 9. <hi>Will be Saved.</hi> But what if they do not believe it at all, or but only Hiſtorically, and in the mean time Love and obey the convictions and common diſcoveries of the Light within, given gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to <hi>Heathens,</hi> according to <hi>W. P.</hi> they are Regenerated, and ſhall be ſaved. Can there be a greater fallacy, and greater Jeſuitical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation under Heaven? The Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Working of the ſaving Power of Chriſt in the Heart, he will have it to be none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther either in him, or any of his Brethren, or any elſe, but the common Illumination that every <hi>Heathen</hi> hath, or may have, which yet he confeſſeth diſcovereth nothing of Chriſt, as he outwardly dyed and roſe again; that diſcovery belonging to extraordinary Revelation, as he acknowledgeth, and yet pretends not to have any ſuch thing.</p>

In his 150th <hi>Page</hi> he thus Argueth, <hi>That which Leads, Rules, and that which Rules is a Rule to them that follow it.</hi> But the Spirit Leads, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c. It is juſt ſuch a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſm as this: That which ploweth is the Plow, but the Plow-Man Ploweth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Plow-Man is the Plow. This is a piece of dull Sophiſtry, and ſhews <hi>W. P.</hi> to be no very good Logician. But further to ſhew his Sophiſtry, by an <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem,</hi> that which Rules, is a Rule to them that follow it. But <hi>W. P</hi>'s <hi>Juſtices of Peace in Penſilvania,</hi> Rule the People there, and ſo doth his <hi>Deputy Governour; Ergo,</hi> he and they are <hi>the Rule</hi> to that People But then what need of any Laws?

Can any King on Earth be more Arbitrary? It hath pleaſed God Almighty, whoſe Will is moſt Holy and Juſt for ever, to give us an External Revelation of his Will concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our whole Duty, and that as well to us under the New Teſtament, as to them under the Old; and that that External Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, contained in the Holy Scriptures, (ſetting aſide ſome Ceremonial precepts, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101140:44"/>
ſome other peculiar to the Jewiſh Nation) ſhould be our general Rule to inſtruct us, both what to believe and what to do, and this part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give example to all Kings, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to do the like as all good and pious Kings and Governours have done, <hi>viz.</hi> To give forth Laws, and publickly to have them recorded, that the People may have the due notice of them, and regard to them; and partly to prevent the Deluſions and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of Deceivers, and Spirits of Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, who would wonderfully prevail to deceive the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity; were there no outward Rule of Faith and Life eſtabliſhed by God himſelf, one would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Revelation, and another his, and Thouſands of contradictory Revelations would daily appear and deceive many, were it not for the eſtabliſhed Rule of God's Will and Word, outwardly revealed and recorded in the Holy Scriptures. It's true, there are too many Deceptions ſtill, and Deceivers, and all pretending that their Doctrine is conformable to the Holy Scriptures. But notwithſtanding, ſo long as the publick Standard of God's Holy Word and Will remains with us in the Holy Scriptures, they are a ſufficient Armory to us by the Grace of God, and aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, out of which to bring ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Armour both to withſtand and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101140:44"/>
all Hereſies and pernicious Doctrines. Nor would <hi>W. P</hi>'s Fundamental Principle, of bringing all to the General Rule of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary Diſcoveries of the Light within, given to all Mankind, be any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in the caſe; for beſides, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries that he ſets up for, are not the ſame to all Nations and Perſons, as can eaſily be proved: Ten thouſands would break through the Hedge of his General Rule, of binding them to the common Diſcoveries given to all Mankind, (as moſt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers</hi> do) and would highly pretend to new and ſpecial Diſcoveries given to them by the Light within, and to none others; and the reaſon they will alledge, that it is not given to others, is their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs; and eſpecially that like <hi>Corah,</hi> they Rebel againſt their Spiritual Guides and Leaders. Thus we may ſee the great need of an outward Rule, and the great Goodneſs of God, that he hath given us one, full and perfectly ſufficient to be a Rule of our Faith and Life in all neceſſary Caſes.</p>
               <p>And beſides, If <hi>W. P</hi>'s Argument have any Truth in it, it would infer, that Chriſt, or the Spirit, abſtractly conſidered from all Revelation, both Internal and External, ſhould be the Rule, becauſe he is the Ruler; If the Ruler and the Rule muſt ſtill be one

and the ſame thing, then ſuppoſe all Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation Internal as well as External ſhould ceaſe, Chriſt or the Spirit ſhould be the Rule, becauſe the Ruler: Who ſees not the Fallacy and Sophiſtry of <hi>W. P</hi>'s Argument here? Hath not every common Artificer his Rule of Wood or Braſs, that is not the Man himſelf, but the Inſtrument that he hath made and prepared for his uſe. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Rule, by which their Faith was ruled in what they Prophecied, was not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but the internal Revelation of the Spirit, the Spirit was their Guide and Ruler, but not, to ſpeak properly, their Rule, but the Revelation they had, or things revealed, that was their Rule; and ſo now, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Revelation of the ſame Truths, is the Rule of our Faith, whereby to believe them; as the Spirit inwardly by his ſecret Illumination, perſwades us of their Truth and certainty, not by any new verbal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, but by Sealing to the Record out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly given.</p>

               <p>AND this leads me to detect another Fallacy of his, which ſhall be the laſt I intend to notice, though I could detect many more, but theſe I think will ſuffice, to ſhew how Fallacious he is. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hear him once more: In his Page 106 and 107, after he has moſt groſly alledged, that he has the concurring Teſtimony and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101140:46"/>
Aſſent of the beſt and firſt Reformers, as well as Martyrs and Fathers, to confirm his Fundamental, <hi>viz. That not the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures without, but the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is the Rule of Faith and Life; and that the Light or Spirit within, is ſomething at leaſt co-ordinate, if not ſuperior and antecedent to the Scripture: Which is more</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>than we ſaid before, and conſequently is the Rule of Faith and Life, ſuperior to the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having in my late Treatiſe of <hi>W. P</hi>'s <hi>Deiſm,</hi> reſcued the Fathers and firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers from his Perverſions, I ſhall only now take notice of his fallacious Inference by this his Argument. The Light or Spirit within is ſomething ſuperior and antecedent in way of Excellency to the Scripture; therefore it is the ſuperior and antecedent Rule above the Scripture, the Propoſition is granted, and I know none that ever denied it; to wit, That the Spirit, which is God, is greater and more excellent than the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But then it followeth not, that it is the greater or more excellent Rule; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, properly ſpeaking, it is no Rule at all. Right Logicians will tell him, if he will go and learn of them, (which it is to be ſuſpected, for all that he was a Student at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he has great need to do) that things in a different kind are not to be compared. If it were asked of <hi>W. P.</hi> whither a Knife
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101140:46"/>
of Gold, or a Knife of Steel, were the beſt Knife; he would anſwer ſurely, though Gold is ſuperior to Steel, and more excellent, yet it is not fit to be a Knife, and Men make not the blades of Knives of Gold. So though the Spirit be ſuperior to the Revelation of it, whither Internal or External, yet not the Spirit but his Revelation is the Rule; and Internal Revelation was the Rule to the Prophets, whereby they believed their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies; and what internal Revelation was to them, external Revelation is to us; though we have not that internal Revelation that they had, which was Prophetical and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, but the Spirit internally by way of Seal, Sealing to us the Truth and Certainty of the external Revelation, gives us as ſure ground for the certainty of our Faith, as they had of theirs. But this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Seal of the Spirit is no Rule, either co-ordinate with the Scripture, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to it, becauſe it doth not propoſe to us by it ſelf, all the things neceſſary to be believed by us, in verbal Propoſitions, as the Seal of a Bond, though it is a Proof and Evidence to the Truth of the Bond, yet it tells us not the Contents of it. And now becauſe the Biſhop found fault with his calling the Scripture without, and the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Spirit within, the double and agreeing Record of true Religion; as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101140:47"/>
indeed well he might ſo do in <hi>W. P</hi>'s ſenſe (though in a qualified and ſober ſenſe it may be acknowledged) as perceiving the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſenſe that <hi>W. P.</hi> had of thoſe words well obſerved by the Biſhop, <hi>That they will not believe what Scripture ſaith, except the Light within them dictate the ſame:</hi> And yet none of them can juſtly ſay, that the Light within doth dictate to them by it ſelf, one Article of that called the Apoſtles Creed; yea, <hi>W. P.</hi> doth not ſo much as pretend that it doth to him; yet moſt uncivilly he falls upon the Biſhop p. 107, telling him, <hi>It muſt be his turn now to pity the Biſhop: And truly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I do it with all my Heart:</hi> And this it ſeems in retaliation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's tender Expreſſion of his Pitty and Compaſſion towards ſome well-meaning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons among them, who are miſlead by their Teachers. But for what muſt he needs <hi>Pity the Biſhop?</hi> Why, for his ſuppoſed Ignorance, that he will not allow the Spirit to be ſuperior to the Scripture: But this is <hi>W. P</hi>'s Fallacy and Ignorance, and not the Biſhop's; the Biſhop owneth with all true Chriſtians, the Spirit to be ſuperior to the Scriptures, as the Author and Lord of them, and who uſeth them as his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Work man uſeth a Rule or Tool that he worketh withal; but the Biſhop, and all ſound Chriſtians think, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101140:47"/>
it is no diſhonour to the Spirit, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Office proper to him, which is to Rule, and the Office proper to the Scripture to be the Rule and Inſtrument, in the Hand and Management of the Spirit. And thus the Office of the Scripture is a far inferior Office to the Office of the Spirit, as the Servant and his Office, is inferior to the Maſter and his Office; but to put the Spirit in the Office of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is to degrade the Maſter, and put him in the Servant's place.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing I ſhall notice in this Book of <hi>W. P.</hi> is not ſo properly a Fallacy, as a down-right open-faced Falſhood, and falſe Charge and Accuſation againſt all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants whatſoever, except themſelves, who though they affect the Name of Proteſtants, yet for the vaſt diſagreement of Doctrine betwixt them, even in Fundamentals, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve neither the Name of Proteſtants, nor Chriſtians ſo much as at large. The Accuſation is this Page 97, That the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Diſſenters, and generally all Proteſtants, <hi>Confine the Operations of the Spirit to the firſt or Apoſtolical Times, as if theſe did not want them as much; or that Chriſt would be leſs Propitious, where his Gifts were not leſs needful.</hi> This I ſay, is a down-right falſe Accuſation, the contrary of which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101140:48"/>
cvidently appears from all the ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Faith, of all the Proteſtant Churches truly owned to be ſuch, and which alſo appears from the afore-cited words of the Biſhop in his Teſtimony, where he owns, That Conſcience muſt be opened by the Holy Spirit, under the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word, citing <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. to take in its Light (to wit, the Doctrine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally) from the Holy Scriptures. Can this be done, without an Operation of the Holy Spirit? If <hi>W. P.</hi> ſay Nay, it cannot; then his own words are an Evidence againſt the Falſity of his Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Again, That he chargeth it on them, that Miniſters are made ſuch, and preach without the Spirit; and the People wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping without the Spirit, which is too raſh and uncharitable Judgment in him ſo to affirm, without any Caution or Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: How doth it appear, that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Preach and Pray with the Spirit, and all others do not? Will the Quakers ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it prove it? Or doth the great Noiſe of their Preaching and Praying by the Spirit, from an elevated high-flown Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, through their Spiritual Pride, prove it to be ſo; oft-times where there is greateſt noiſe and ſhew, there is leaſt Reality and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101140:48"/>
Subſtance. Surely if Preaching and Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more unſound Doctrine than all others do, and uncharitable Judgments of them, that do really excel them both in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Piety, be proofs that they are not acted by the Spirit of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in either their Preaching or Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and who are ſcarce ever heard to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their ſinful Imperfections, or ask Forgiveneſs of them: If theſe be Marks of Men ſenſual, and not having the Spirit, notwithſtanding of their Boaſtings, [Laodicea <hi>and Phariſee like]</hi> they are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to be found among them. It is indeed matter of Regrate and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there is ſo little Preaching and Praying with the Spirit, among many of all ſorts, as the little Succeſs it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth doth manifeſt in many places; yet bleſſed be God for what is among many of all the ſeveral Churches; and were there but more Love and Charity, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Self-denial, it might certainly be hoped, that God would give more of his Spirit: And for ſuch a Time, I joyn with all ſincere Chriſtians, both to Hope and Pray,</p>

               <hi>A</hi> Synopſis, <hi>or ſhort View of</hi> W. P<hi>'s Deiſm and Scepticiſm, collected out of his Book, called,</hi> A Diſcourſe of the General Rule of Faith and Life, and Judge of Controverſie, <hi>firſt Printed in the Year</hi> 1673, <hi>as an</hi> Appendix <hi>to his</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Quaker, <hi>and Reprinted in this preſent Year</hi> 1699. <hi>Compared with ſome Paſſages in his other Books. With ſome plain and neceſſary Conſequences, naturally flowing from the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Doctrine therein delivered by him.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. ALL Mankind hath one General Rule of Faith and Life, <hi>Page</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This General Rule of Faith and Life cannot be the Scripture, becauſe all Men have not the Scripture, and becauſe of their uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty (unleſs upon the ground of inward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Revelation) and for their Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and many other Reaſons given by him (in the following Pages) to the number of about fourteen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The General Rule of Faith and Life, muſt be the Light in every Man's Conſcience, <hi>P.</hi> 6, 7.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Light in every Man's Conſcience is the Rule of Faith and Life, not abſtractly and ſeperately conſidered from the inward Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries it giveth, but with reſpect thereunto. For without ſome inward Diſcovery, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Men nothing, and therefore it can be no Rule to any Man, but with reſpect to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſcoveries.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:101140:50"/>
5. The inward diſcoveries of the Light within, are of two ſorts, <hi>P.</hi> 32. the one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſuch as were given to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, concerning <hi>Adam's</hi> fall and the extraordinary manifeſtation of God, in the Fleſh of that Man called Jeſus Chriſt, whom ſome call the Son of God: But <hi>that he was properly the Son of God we utterly deny,</hi> faith <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Serious Apology, P.</hi> 146. The other ordinary, ſuch as fall within the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſcoveries given to all Mankind.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Light within is the general Rule of Faith and Life, not with reſpect to theſe extraordinary diſcoveries above mentioned, <hi>P.</hi> 32. but with reſpect to the ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries given to Mankind in general univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We have no need that the Light within ſhould give us any of theſe extraordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, <hi>P.</hi> 32. concerning <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, and that extraordinary manifeſtation of God in the Fleſh of that Man, improperly called the Son of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe the Hiſtorical account of theſe things is extant in Scripture, and it not being needful to be given us, by any new inward Revelation, we may conclude it is not given to any of us; it ſufficeth we have the Hiſtorical account of them given us in Scripture, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to beget in us a Hiſtorical Faith of theſe things, without any new inward Revelation of them, ſuch as was given to the Prophets and Apoſtles</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:101140:50"/>
8. The Hiſtorical account of theſe things, though it may be called a Hiſtorical Rule of the Hiſtorical Faith of them, yet it cannot be called, the Rule of Faith and Life that is neceſſary to Salvation. For as all have not this Hiſtorical Faith, becauſe the Hiſtory hath not reached them; ſo to them who have the Hiſtory, the Hiſtorical Faith doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them to Salvation, but doth far rather hurt them, <hi>It is at beſt but the Old Heavens, that are to be wrapped up as a Scrowl,</hi> as he ſaith expreſly in his concluſion near the end of his Book, called <hi>A Diſcourſe concerning the general Rule,</hi> &amp;c. And in his Book called, <hi>Quakeriſm a new Nick-name for Old Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, P.</hi> 6. he ſaith, <hi>Faith in the Hiſtory of Chriſt's outward manifeſtation, is a deadly Poyſon theſe latter Ages has been inſected with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Seeing the Scriptures are uncertain, with reſpect to all thoſe extraordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, upon the foundation of all others, who are not <hi>Quakers,</hi> as <hi>W. P.</hi> argueth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, and can only be certain to ſuch as have inward extraordinary Revelation of thoſe things, which <hi>W. P.</hi> confeſſeth are not needful, <hi>P.</hi> 32. and are not given to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers</hi> more than to others, it neceſſarily follows, according to <hi>W. P</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrine, that the Faith of all thoſe Doctrines concerning <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, and Chriſt's Birth, Death and Sufferings is uncertain, as well to the <hi>Quakers</hi> as other, becauſe, as he affirmeth,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101140:51"/>
the Scriptures that give the account of thoſe things are uncertain, unleſs upon the ground of inward extraordinary Revelation, which neither the <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor any others now have.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Seeing therefore no Men in our days have theſe extraordinary diſcoveries given them by inward Divine Revelation, ſuch as the Prophets had, concerning <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, and Chriſt's Birth, Death and Sufferings, and many other things in controverſie betwixt the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Homouſians, Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians, Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which cannot be certain to us, and whereof we can have no certain Faith, without inward divine Revelation, which is given to none in our days, as touching theſe things, it is beſt to leave all aſſerting of them, or diſputing about them, becauſe we have no certainty of the truth of them by the common diſcoveries of the Light within, that is the general Rule of Faith and Life.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Whatever we read, or hear read, or Preached to us, with Scripture proofs, do not further oblige us to believe or practiſe them, but as the common, and ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries given to all Mankind, as well as to us, Teach the ſame things.</p>
            <p>Although we may Hiſtorically believe theſe extraordinary things, concerning <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt above mentioned, as we believe other Hiſtorical things, yet we are under no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to believe them by any command of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101140:51"/>
God, nor is the not believing them our Sin, becauſe they fall not within the ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the Light within given univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Mankind, which are the Rule of our Faith and Life, and of all Mankind, and we have no certainty of them, and therefore we are under no Obligation to believe them.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The common and ordinary diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries given to all Mankind by the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, are theſe which <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Work of the Law writ in the Heart,</hi> and which ſome of the Ancients Philoſophers called <hi>the Noble pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts writ in the Heart of Man;</hi> and which <hi>W. P.</hi> calleth, the <hi>Eternal precepts of the Spirit in the Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>the Teſtimony of the Spirit, which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is the true Rule,</hi> viz. of Faith and Life, (univerſally given to us and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,) <hi>P.</hi> 14. and 25.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Theſe common and ordinary diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Light within given to all Mankind, are but few, ſuch <hi>as, that God is, that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him; That the way of God is a way of Purity, Patience, Meekneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> Theſe and none other but theſe, and ſuch like common and ordinary diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries given to all Mankind by the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, concerning general Piety towards God as a Creator, and Moral Juſtice and Temperance towards Men, are <hi>the abſolute Neceſſaries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> neceſſary to be believed and practiſed by us for Salvation.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:101140:52"/>
15. One great uſe of this Doctrine of <hi>W. P.</hi> and his Brethren (if he and they can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved) is, that it would bring all Men to be of one Religion, by their Belief and Practiſe of theſe few things of Moral Piety and Juſtice, according to the common and ordinary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries given to all Mankind.</p>
            <p n="16">16. This one Religion is <hi>Deiſin,</hi> which how much ſoever undervalued by falſe Chriſtians, (whoſe Faith is Hiſtorical in a Chriſt without them) is all one with true Chriſtianity, they are but two Names to one and the ſame thing, as every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is a true <hi>Deiſt,</hi> ſo every true <hi>Deiſt</hi> is a true <hi>Chriſtian, for he who believes in God, believes in Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt is God. And what is Chriſt, but Juſtice, Meekneſs, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> (ſaith <hi>W. P. Addreſs to Proteſt.</hi> p. 119. 2d Edit.) <hi>therefore every Juſt, Meek and Patient Man, is the true Chriſtian,</hi> [be he a profeſſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel concerning <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth, Jew, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> or <hi>Pagan.] The meer Juſt Man ought not to be excluded the Communion of Chriſtians,</hi> ſaith he.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Another great uſe of this Doctrine of <hi>W. P.</hi> is (as he thinks) that it would, if duly improved, put an end to all the Controverſies and Heats among all Perſwaſions, not only of thoſe called Chriſtians of all ſorts, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants, Arians</hi> and <hi>Homouſians, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Trinitarians</hi> (which four he expreſly mentions, <hi>P.</hi> 45.) but even betwixt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (notwithſtanding of their profeſſed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101140:52"/>
Unbelief, as concerning <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and betwixt <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by the ſame reaſon, ſo that they may own another to be their <hi>Chriſtian Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. And ſeeing the Name <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> it may be laid aſide, as alſo the Names <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for it is not the outward Name of any thing that ſaveth, nor doth the Light within Men, by its common diſcovery teach them that Name. And becauſe many are diſſatisfied to call the <hi>Light within Chriſt and Jeſus,</hi> as <hi>Socinians, Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and many others of thoſe called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> let it ſuffice to call it by the name <hi>Light,</hi> which is owned by all, and is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to none, and all may be called <hi>Deiſts,</hi> or Profeſſors of the <hi>Light within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. And ieeing many alſo are diſſatisfied, to ſay, or think, that <hi>the Light within every Man is God, or any Supernatural and Divine Principle,</hi> but think it is nothing other but <hi>Conſcience,</hi> or the <hi>natural Light</hi> of Man's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, let that Diſpute alſo come to an end, for Men may agree about the common Dictates and Diſcoveries of it, though they agree not about the Nature and Eſſence of it, ſo as to know what it is, they ſhall have the Benefit of it, to be happy, by obeying it, though they know not what it is; as the Plow-man has the ſame Benefit that the beſt Philoſopher has of the Sun in the Firmament, though he knows not what the Sun is, either for Subſtance, Quantity or Quality.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:101140:53"/>
20. One great Pinch and Difficulty in the caſe, is, certainly to know the juſt Extent and Number of the common Diſcoveries of the Light within, given to all Mankind; as whither the ſame number of thoſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Precepts and Laws writ in every Man's Heart, be given to all Men; and whither ſome of thoſe which <hi>W. P.</hi> will ſay are the Dictates of the <hi>Light within</hi> Men univerſally, will not be denied by others even of his Brethren, to be the Dictates of the <hi>Light within;</hi> as particularly, whither atteſting the Name of God in worldly matters, when controverted, is condemned by the <hi>Light within:</hi> Whither <hi>Self-defence by carnal Weapons</hi> be againſt the Dictates of the <hi>Light within,</hi> for many of his Brethren think both are not: Whither all <hi>G. F</hi>'s Orders about outward things, oppoſed by many Quakers, are the Dictates of the <hi>Light within,</hi> with reſpect to its ordinary Diſcoveries; and whither the Quakers, eſpecially <hi>G. F.</hi> have not ſet up for ſome new Revelations and Commands, beſide the common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the <hi>Light within,</hi> though they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the external Revelations and Commands of Chriſt in the Scripture, that are not taught them by the common Diſcoveries of the <hi>Light within.</hi>
