         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And after the ſayde three bookes foloweth the

the ſayed noble Princes out of Frenche, it coulde
not folowe the Latin ſo nigh nor ſo directlie as
if it had bene tranſlated out of Latin. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is nowe tranſlated out of Latin, and yet
neuertheleſſe it keepeth the ſubſtaunce and the
effect of the firſt tranſlation out of Frenche,

<pb facs="tcp:3160:8"/>
it is often times ſeene, that ſome perſons

haue litle ſweetenes therein, and that is,
for that they haue not the ſpirite of

true vnderſtanding of Chriſtes Goſpels,
we muſt ſtudy to conforme our life to his

a man to reaſon high ſecrete miſteries of

he diſpleaſeth the Trinitie? Truely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge.
For high curious reaſons make

lyfe maketh hym beloued with God. I
had rather feele compunction of hearte

what ſhould it profite thee without gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

is vanitie, but to loue God, and onely to
ſerue him. This is the moſt noble and the
moſte excellent wiſdome that may be in
any creature, by deſpiſinge of this world
to drawe daylie neerer and neerer to the
kingedome of heauen. It is therefore a
great vanitie to labour inordinatlie for
worldly riches, which ſhortlye ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe,

Howe great a vanitie is it alſo to deſire
a longe life, and litle to care for a good
life: to heede thinges preſent, and not to
prouide for thinges that are to come:
to loue thinges that ſhortlie ſhall paſſe

prouerbe ofte in thy minde, That the eye

and damnable. Truely if we doo
ſo, we haue eyes but we ſee not. And
what auayleth vs the knowledge of the

nothing. He to whom the euerlaſting

of many vayne opinions, and
of that worde al thinges proceede, and
all thinges openlye ſhewe and crye, that
he is God. No man without him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth

but he to whom al thinges is one,
and he that all thinges draweth into
one, aud all thinges ſetteth in one,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3160:10"/>
and deſireth nothinge but one, may
quickly be eſtabliſhed in heart, and be
fully pacifyed in God. O truth that
God art, make me one with thee in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
charitie, for all that I reade, heare,
or ſee without thee, is greeuous to me,
for in thee is all that I wil or maye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
Let all Doctours be ſtil in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and let all creatures keepe them
in ſilence, and thou only Lord ſpeake to
my ſoule. The more that man is ioyned
to thee, and the more that he is gathered
together in thee, the more he vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
without labour high ſecrete miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
for he hath receyued from aboue
the light of vnderſtanding. A cleane,
pure, and a ſtable hart is not broken ne
lightly ouercome with ghoſtely labours,
for he doeth al thing to the honour of
God: and for that he is cleerely mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed
to him ſelf, therfore he coueteth
to be free from folowing his owne wil.
VVhat hindereth thee more then thy
affections not fully mortifyed to the wl
of the ſpirite? truelye nothing more. A
good deuout man ſo ordereth his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
buſines, that it draweth not him
to the loue of it, but that he compell it
to be obedient to the wil of the ſpirite,
&amp; to the right iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of reaſon. VVho
hath a ſtronger battayle then he that
laboureth for to ouercome him ſelfe? and
<pb facs="tcp:3160:11"/>
that ſhoulde be our dayly labour &amp; our
dayly deſire to ouercome our ſelfe, that
we may be made ſtronger in ſpirite, and
increaſe daily fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better to better. Euery
perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life hath ſome imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
annexed vnto it, and there is no
knowledge in this worlde but that it is
mixt with ſome blindens of ignorance.
And therfore a meeke knowing of our
ſelfe is a more ſurer way to God; then is
the ſearching for highnes of cunning.
Cunning wel ordred is not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
for it is good and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of God:
but a clean conſcience and a vertuous
life is muche better, &amp; more to be deſired.
Becauſe ſome men ſtudye to haue cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
rather then to liue well, therfore
they erre many times, and bring forth
litle good fruite or none. O if they
woulde be as buſye to auoyde ſinne, and
to plante vertues in their ſoules as they
be to moue queſtions, there ſhoulde not
be ſo many euill thinges ſeene in the

it ſhall not be aſked of vs, what
we haue read, but what we haue done,
nor howe well we haue ſayde, but howe

where be all the great clerkes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3160:11"/>
when they liued, they flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
greatly in their learning, and now
other men occupy their prebendes &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
and I can not tell whether they
think any thing on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: in their life they
were holden great in the world, &amp; nowe
is litle ſpeaking of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. O howe ſhortly
paſſeth away the glorye of this world,
with al the falſe deceauable pleſures of
it? would to God their life had accorded
well with their learning, for then had
they well ſtudied and read. How many
periſhe dayly in this worlde by vayne
cunning, that care litle for a good life,
ne for the ſeruice of God. And becauſe
they deſire rather to be great in the
worlde then to be meeke, therfore they
vaniſhe awaye in their learninges as
ſmoke in the ayre. Truely he is great
that hath great charitie: and he is great
that is litle in his owne ſight, and that
ſetteth at nought all worldly honour.
And he is very wiſe, that accompteth all
worldly pleaſures as vile dounge, ſo
that he maye winne Chriſte. And that perſon
is very wel taught, that forſaketh
his owne will, and foloweth the will of
God.</p>

for they driue a man to beholde

here but as in an exile, and be
learned therby to know, that he ought
not to put his truſt in any worldly thing.
It is good alſo, that we ſuffer ſometime
contradiction, and that we be holden of

though we doo well and intend well:
far ſuch thinges helpe vs to meekenes,

Therefore a man ought to ſettle him ſelfe

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S longe as we liue i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this world
we may not be fully without
temptation. For as Iob ſayth,
temptation is the life of man
vpon earth, therefore euery
man ſhould beware well againſt his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3160:18"/>
and watche in prayers that
the ghoſtly enemy finde not time &amp; place
to deceiue him, which neuer ſleepeth, but
alwaye goeth about, ſeekinge whom he
may deuoure. There is no man ſo perfect
nor ſo holye in this worlde, that he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
hath not temptations. And we may
not fully be without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for though they
be for the time verye greeuous and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet if they be reſiſted, they be verye
profitable: for a man by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſuch
temptations is made more meeke, and is
alſo purged &amp; informed in diuers maner,
which he ſhould neuer haue knowen, but
by experience of ſuche temptations. All
bleſſed Sainctes that nowe be crowned
in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, grewe and profited by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and tribulations, and thoſe that
coulde not well beare temptations, but
were finallye ouercome, be taken perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
priſoners in hell. There is no order
ſo holy, ne no place ſo ſecrete, that is fully
without temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and there is no man
that is fully free from it here in this life:
for in our corrupt body we beare the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whereby we be tempted, that is, our
inordinate concupiſcence, wherein we
were borne. As one temptation goeth,
another commeth, and ſo we ſhall alway
haue ſomewhat to ſuffer: and the cauſe
is, for we haue loſt our innocencie. Many
folke ſeeke to flee temptation, and they
<pb facs="tcp:3160:19"/>
fall the more greeuouſlie into it: For by
onely fleeing we may not haue victory,
but by meekenes &amp; patience we be made
ſtronger then al our enemies. He that
only flieth the outward occaſiòns, and
cutteth not away the inordinate deſires
hid inwardly in the heart, ſhal litle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
and temptations ſhal lightly come
to him againe, and greeue him more then
they did fyrſte, by litle and litle with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and ſufferaunce, &amp; with the helpe
of God, thou ſhal ſooner ouercome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
then with thine owne ſtrength
and importunitie. In thy temptation it
is good that thou ofte aſke counſayle, &amp;
that thou be not rigorous to no perſon
that is tempted: but be glad to comfort
him, as thou wouldeſt be comforted. The
beginning of all euil temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s is inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie
of mind, &amp; to litle a truſt in God.
For as a ſhip without guide is driuen
hither and thither with euery ſtorme, ſo
an vnſtable man that anone leaueth his
good purpoſe in God, is diuerſlye tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted.
The fyre proueth gold, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
proueth the righteous man. VVe
know not many times what we can
ſuffer, but temptation ſheweth plainely
what we are, and what vertue is in vs.
It is neceſſary in the beginning of euery
temptation to be wel ware, for then
the enemy is ſoone ouercome, if he be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3160:19"/>
not ſuffered to enter into the heart, but
that he be reſiſted and ſhut out aſſoone as
he proffereth to enter: For as a bodily me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
is verie late miniſtred, when the
ſickenes hath bene ſuffred to increaſe by
longe continuance: ſo is it of temptation.
Firſte commeth to the minde an vncleane
thought, and after foloweth a ſtronge
imagination, and then delectation and
diuers euill motions, and in the ende fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
a full aſſent, and ſo by litle &amp; litle
the enemy hath ful entrie, for he was not
wiſely reſiſted in the beginninge: and the
more ſlowe that a man is in reſiſting, the
more weake he is to reſiſt, &amp; the enemye
is daylie the more ſtronger againſt him.
Some perſons haue their greateſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in the beginninge of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion,
ſome in the ende, and ſome in
maner all their lyfe tyme be troubled
therewith, and there be many that be but
lightlie tempted, and all this commeth of
the great wiſedome and righteouſnes of
God, which knoweth the ſtate &amp; merite
of euery perſon, &amp; ordeineth all thinges
for the beſt, and to the euerlaſtinge health
and ſaluation of his elect &amp; choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Therefore we ſhal not diſpayre when
we be tempted, but ſhall the more ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
praye vnto God, that he of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
goodnes and fatherlie pitie vouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſe
to helpe vs in euery ende, and that
he, (according to the ſayinge of S Pauie)
<pb facs="tcp:3160:20"/>
ſo preuent vs with his grace in euerye
temptation, that we may be able to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne.
Let vs then meeken our ſoules
vnder the ſtronge hand of allmyghtie
God, for he will ſaue all them, and exalt
all them that be here meeke and lowly
in ſpirite. In temptations and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
a man is proued howe much he hath
profited, and his merite is thereby the
greater before God, and his vertues are
the more openlie ſhewed. It is no great
meruaile if a man be feruent and deuoute
when he feeleth no griefe: but if he can
ſuffer patientlie in time of temptation or
other aduerſitie, and therewithall can
alſo ſtirre himſelfe to feruour of ſpirite,
it is a token, that he ſhall greatly profite
hereafter in vertue and grace. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
be kept from many great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and yet daylie they be ouercome
through litle and ſmall occaſions, and
that is of the great goodnes and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of God to keepe them in meeknes,
that they ſhall not truſt ne preſume

Angels clene and pure, ſhining in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
we ought euery daye to renewe our
purpoſe in God, and to ſtirre our heart
do feruor and deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though it were
the firſte daye of our conuerſion, &amp; dayly
we ſhall pray and ſay thus: Helpe me my
Lorde Ieſu, that I may perſeuer in good
purpoſe, and in thy holy ſeruice vnto my
death, &amp; that I may nowe this preſent
daye perfectly beginne, for it is nothinge
that I haue done in time paſt. After our
purpoſe, and after our intent ſhalbe our
reward: And though our intent be neuer
ſo good, yet it is neceſſarie, that we put
therto a good will, and a great diligence.
For if he that often times purpoſeth to
doe well and to profite in vertue, yet
fayleth in his doing, what ſhall he doe
then, who ſeldome or neuer taketh ſuch
purpoſe? Let vs intend to doe the beſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3160:25"/>
we can, and yet our good purpoſe may
happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be hindred and letted in diuers
maners. And our ſpeciall hinderaunce is
this, that we ſo lihgtly leaue of our good
exerciſes that we haue vſed to doe before
time: for it is ſeldome ſeene, that a good
purpoſe wilfully broken may be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
agayne without great ſpirituall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance.
The purpoſe of righteous men
dependeth in the grace of God more then
in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or in their owne wiſedome:
for man purpoſeth, but God diſpoſeth: ne
the waye that man ſhall walke in this
worlde, is not in himſelfe, but in the grace
of God. If a good cuſtome be ſometime
left of for helpe of our neighbour, it may
ſoone be recouered: but if it be left of
through ſlouth, or through our owne
negligence, it will greatlie hinder vs, and
hardly will it be recouered agayne. Thus
it appereth, that though we incorage our
ſelues all that we can to doe well, yet it
is good that we alwaye take ſuch good
purpoſe, eſpeciallie againſt ſuch thinges
as hinder vs moſte. VVe muſt alſo make
diligent ſearche both within vs &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

at the leaſt, that thou doe it once on the
day, euening or morning. In the morning
thou ſhalt take a good purpoſe for that
<pb facs="tcp:3160:26"/>
daye folowinge, and at night thou ſhalte
diſcuſſe diligentlie, how thou haſt beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
thee the daye before, in worde, in
deede, and in thought: for in them we
doe ofte offend God aud our neighbour.
Arme thee as Chriſtes true knyght with
meeknes and charitie, againſt all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of the enemie. Refraine glotonie, and
thou ſhalt the more lightlie refrayne all
carnall deſires. Let not the ghoſtly enemy
finde thee all ylde, but that thou be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge,
writing, prayinge deuoutlie, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge,
or ſome other good labour doinge,
for the comminaltie. Bodily exerciſes are
to be done diſcretelie: for that that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to one, is ſometime hurtfull to
another: and alſo ſpirituall labours done
of denotion, are more ſure, done in priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
then in open place. And thou muſt
beware, that thou be not more readie to
priuate deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, then to them, that thou
arte bounde to by duetie of thy religion.
But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy duetie is fulfilled, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adde
thereto, after as thy deuotion gyueth. All
may not vſe one maner of exerciſe, but
one in one maner, another in another
maner, as they ſhall feele to be moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Alſo, as the time requireth,
ſo diuers exerciſes are to be vſed, for one
maner of exerciſe is neceſſary on the holy
daye, another on the feriall daye: one in
time of temptation, another in time of
Peace and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolation: one when we haue
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3160:26"/>
ſweetenes in deuotion, another, when
deuotion withdraweth. Alſo againſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
feaſtes we ought to be more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in good workes, and deuoutlie to call for
helpe to the bleſſed Saintes, that then be
worſhipped in the Churche of God, then
in other times, and to diſpoſe our ſelues
in like maner, as if we ſhoulde then be
taken out of this world, and be brought
into the euerlaſtinge feaſt in heauen. And
fith that bliſſe is yet differred from vs for
a time, we may well thinke, that we be
not yet readye nor worthye to come
therto. And therefore we ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
our ſelues to be more readie another

ſeruaunt, whom our Lorde, when he ſhall
come at the hour of death, ſhall finde

vp high aboue all earthlie thinges, into
the euerlaſtinge ioye and bliſſe in the

that we know well when we talke long,
for it is not ſo harde to keepe allwaye ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,

when we ſpeake much. It is alſo more

to go forth into the world, and not offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
Therefore he that intendeth to come to
an inwarde ſetting of his heart in God,
and to haue the grace of deuotion, muſt
with our Sauiour Chriſte. withdrawe

nor no man is ſure in prelacie, but he

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3160:27"/>
that he hath a cleane conſcience: ne

And on the contrarywiſe, the ſuretie of

Therefore thinke thy ſelfe neuer ſure in

Thy ſenſuall appetite moueth thee to go

alwaye the matter of true ſorowe, and of

to liue in this world is but miſerie: and

Now thou purpoſeſt to beware, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt

VVherefore it were expedient to

O the great dulnes and hardnes of mans
heart, that only thinketh on thinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
&amp; litle prouideth for the life to come.
If thou diddeſt well, thou ſhouldeſt ſo
behaue thy ſelfe in euery deede, and in
euery thought, as thou ſhouldeſt in this
inſtant dye. If thou haddeſt a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
thou ſhouldeſt not muche feare
death. It were better for thee to leaue
ſinne, then feare death. O my deere bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if thou be not readie this daye, how
ſhalt thou be readie to morow? To mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is a daye vncertaine, and thou canſte
not tel, whether thou ſhalt liue ſo longe.
VVhat profite is it to vs to liue longe,
when we therby ſo litle amende our life?
Longe life doth not alwaye bringe vs to
amendment, but ofte times increaſeth
more ſinne. VVoulde to God that we
might be one daye well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant in this
world? Manie recken their yeares of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion,
and yet there is but litle fruite
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3160:33"/>
of amendment, nor of any good example
ſeene in their conuerſation. If it be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to die, peraduenture it is more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous
to liue long. Bleſſed be thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that euer haue the houre of death
before their eyes, and that euerie daye
diſpoſe themſelues to die. If thou euer
ſaweſt anye man die, remember that thou
muſt needelie goe the ſame waye. In the
morninge doubt whether thou ſhalt liue
to night, &amp; at night thinke not thy ſelfe
ſure to liue till to morowe. Be alwaye
readie, and liue in ſuch maner, that death
finde thee not vnprouided. Remember
howe many haue died ſodenlie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided,
for our Lorde hath called them
in ſuch an houre as they leaſte thought.
And when that laſt hour ſhall come, thou
ſhalt begin to feele all otherwiſe of thy
life paſſed, then thou haſte done before:
and thou ſhalt then ſorowe greatlie, that
thou haſt beene ſo ſlowe and negligent
in the ſeruice of God as thou haſte beene.
O how happie and wiſe is he therfore,
that laboreth nowe to ſtand in ſuch ſtate
in this lyfe, as he would be founde in at
his death. Truely, a perfect deſpiſing of
the worlde, and a feruent deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
in vertue, a loue to be taught, a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
labour in workes of penaunce, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

and a willing ſuffering of all aduerſities
for the loue of God, ſhall geue vs a great
<pb facs="tcp:3160:34"/>
truſte, that we ſhall die wel. Now, whileſt
thou art in health, thou mayeſt doo many
good deedes, but if thou be ſicke, I can
not tell, what thou mayeſt doe: For why,
fewe be amended through ſicknes. And
likewiſe, they that go muche on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
be ſeldome thereby made perfect
&amp; holye. Put not thy truſt in thy frendes
and thy neighbours, neither deferre thy
good deedes till after thy death: for thou
ſhalt ſoonet be forgotten then thou wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.
Better it is to prouide for thy ſelfe
betime, and to ſend ſome good deedes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, then to truſt to other, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture
will lightly forget thee: if thou
be not nowe buſie for thy ſelfe, &amp; for thine
owne ſoule health, who ſhall be buſie for
thee after thy death? Nowe is the time
very precious, but alas for ſorowe, that
thou ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſt the time ſo vnprofitablie, in
the which thou ſhouldeſt winne the life
euerlaſting. The time ſhal come, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou
ſhalt deſire one daye or one houre to

mighteſt thou now deliuer thy ſelfe, yf
thou wouldeſt alwaye in this lyfe dreade
to offend God, and alwaye haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge
of death ſuſpect. Therefore ſtudye
nowe to liue ſo, that at the houre of death
thou mayeſt rather ioye then dreade.
Learue nowe to dye to the worlde, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3160:34"/>
thou mayeſt then liue with Chriſt. Learnt

thou mayeſt then freelye go to Chriſte.
Chaſtiſe nowe thy bodye with penance,
that thou mayeſt then haue a ſure and a

if thou thinke to liue longe, ſith thou art
not ſure to lyue one daye to the ende.
Now many haue beene deceaued through

that ſuche a man was ſlayne, and ſuche a

And ſo the ende of all men is death, for

and folowe their ſteppes, that when thou

it, to ſee religious men deuoute and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent

and well taught in ghoſtlie learning: and
on the contrarye part, howe heauye and

and paine on euerie ſide, for he lackeeh
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3160:39"/>
the true inwarde comfort: and to ſeeke
the outward comfort he is prohibited.
Therefore a religious perſon that liueth
without diſcipline, is like to fall in great

ſhall alwaye be in anguiſhe and ſorowe,
for one thinge or other ſhall euer diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe

Nowe truelie, yf we ſhould neuer neede

He that is ſeruent and louinge, is alway

Thou haſte here no place of long abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

thou ſhalt feele great comforte in euery

euil wordes ſoeuer be ſpoken of thee,
they ſhall litle greeue thee. Our maiſter
Chriſte was deſpiſed in the worlde of all
men, and in his moſt neede was forſaken
of his acquaintaunce and frendes, and
lefte among ſhames and rebukes. He
would ſuffer wrongs, and be nought ſet

thou wilt ſuffer none aduerſitie, howe
mayeſt thou be the frende of Chriſte? It
behoueth thee to ſuffer with Chriſte, &amp;
for Chriſt, if thou wilt reigne with Chriſt.
Truely, if thou haddeſt once entred into

there taſted a litle of his loue, thou
ſhouldeſt litle care for lykinges or miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinges

rather haue greate ioye, when wronges
<pb facs="tcp:3160:43"/>

perfecte loue of God maketh a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlye
to deſpiſe him ſelfe. The true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
loue of God that is free from all
inordinate affections, maye anone turne
him ſelfe freelye to God, and lyfte him
ſelfe vp in ſpirite, in contemplation, and
fruitfullye reſt him in Chriſte. Alſo he, to
whom all thinges be eſteemed as they be,
and not as they be taken and thought to
be of wordly people, is very wiſe, and is
rather taught of God then of man. And
he that can inwardly lifte his minde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
to God, and litle regard outward
thinges, needeth not for to ſeeke for time
or place to goe to prayers, or to doe other
good deedes or vertuous occupations.
For the ghoſtlye man may ſoone gather
him ſelfe together, and fixe his minde in
God, for he neuer ſuffereth it to be fullye
occupied in outward thinges. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his outward laboures, &amp; his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlye
occupations neceſſary for the time,
hinder him not but litle, for as they come
ſo he applieth him ſelfe to them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
them alwaye to the will of God.
Moreouer, a man that is well ordred in
his ſoule, forceth litle the vnkind demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of worldlye people, ne yet their
proude behauiour. As muche as a man
loueth anye worldly thinge more then it
ſhould be beloued, ſo muche his minde is
hindred &amp; letted from the true ordinate
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3160:43"/>

affections, then whatſoeuer ſhould befall
to thee, ſhould goe to thy ghoſtlie profite,

dead to the worlde, nor thou art not
yet fullie ſeuered from the loue of earthly

the ſoule, as an vncleane loue to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
if thou forſake to be comforted by

beholde more perfectly heauenlie things,

VVhen a man ſeeketh no outward wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

hath wholly committed him ſelfe to God.
Alſo after the wordes of S. Paule, he that
commendeth him ſelfe, is not iuſtified,

that hath his minde alwaye lyfte vp to
God, and is not bounde with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate

riſe ſoone from weeping, when
Martha ſhewed her that her maiſter
Chriſte was nigh, &amp; called her? yes truly.
O that is an happie houre, when Ieſus
calleth vs from weeping to ioy of ſpirite.
Remember howe drye &amp; how vndeuout
thou art without Ieſu, and how vnwiſe,
how vayne, and how vncunning thou
art when thou deſireſt any thing beſide
Ieſu: truely that deſire is more hurtfull
to thee, than if thou haddeſt loſt all the
worlde. VVhat may this worlde gene
thee, but through the helpe of Ieſu? To
be without Ieſu is a payne of hel: and to
be with Ieſu is a pleaſaunte Paradiſe.
If Ieſu be with thee, there maye no eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
greue thee: &amp; he that findeth Ieſu,
findeth a great treaſure that is beſt aboue
all other treaſures: and he that Ioſeth

without Ieſu, and he his moſte riche that

well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſaunt with Ieſu, and to keepe
him is right great wiſedome. Be meke &amp;
peacefull, and Ieſu ſhall be with thee: be

mayeſt not long endure, and if Ieſu be
not thy freende moſte before all other,
thou ſhalt be verie heauye and deſolate,
and be lefte without all perfect frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
And therefore thou doeſt not wiſely
if thou truſt or ioye in any other thinge
beſide him. VVe ſhoulde rather chooſe to
haue all the worlde againſt vs, then to
offende God, and therefore of all that be
to thee lefe and dere, let thy Lorde Ieſu
be to thee moſte lefe and dere, and moſte
ſpecially beloued to thee aboue all other,
and let all other be beloued for him, and
he onelie for him ſelfe. Ieſu is onelie to be

be beloued and honoured of all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Neuer couer to be ſingulerly loued
or commended, for that belongeth onelye
to God, which hath none lyke vnto him,
and deſire not that any thinge be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied

pure &amp; cleane inwardly without letting
of any creature, as nigh as thou canſte:
for it behoueth thee to haue a right clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
and a pure hart to Ieſu, if thou wilt
knowe and feele howe ſwete he is. And
verily thou mayſt not come to that puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
vnleſſe thou be preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted and drawen

that he may beare the wantinge of them
both, and for the loue of God, and to his

it were a deſolation of ſpirite, and yet in
nothinge to ſeeke him ſelfe nor his owne

a man be mery and deuout in God when
grace commeth and viſiteth the ſoule?
for that houre is deſired of euery creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.
He rideth right ſafely, whom the grace
of God beareth &amp; ſupporteth: and what
maruell is it if he feele no burden, that is
borne vp by him that is almightie, and
that is led by the ſoueraigne guide that
is God him ſelfe? VVe be alwaye glad to
haue ſolace &amp; conſolation, but we would
hane no tribulation, nor we will not
lightly caſt from vs the falſe loue of our
ſelfe. The bleſſed Martyr Saint Laurence
through the loue of God mightily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the loue of the worlde, and of him
ſelfe, for he deſpiſed all that was likinge
and delectable in the worlde. And Sixtus
the Pope, whom he moſt loued for the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3160:51"/>
loue of God, he ſuffred meekelie to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; ſo through the loue of God
he ouercame the loue of man, &amp; for mans
comfort he choſe rather to folow the will
of God. Doe thou in like wiſe, and learne
to forſake ſome neceſſary and welbeloued
freende for the loue of God, and take it
not greeuouſlie, when thou art left or
forſaken of thy freende: for of neceſſitie
it behoueth worldlie frendes to be diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.
It behoueth a man to fight long,
and mightilye to ſtriue with him ſelfe,
before he ſhall learne fully to ouercome
him ſelfe, or be able freely and readlly to
ſet all his deſires in God. VVhen a man
loueth him ſelfe, and much truſteth to
him ſelf, he falleth anone to mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes:
but the verie true louer of Chriſte,
and the dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t folower of vertue, falleth
not ſo lightlye to them, neither ſeeketh
much ſuch ſenſible ſweetenes, ne ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely
delites, but rather is glad to ſuffer
great harde labours &amp; paine for the loue
of Chriſt. Neuertheleſſe, when ghoſtlye
comfort is ſent to thee of God, take to
meeklye, and geue humble thankes for it:
but knowe it for certain, that it is of the
great goodnes of God that ſendeth it to
thee, and not of thy deſeruing: and looke
thou be not therefore lift vp into pride,
nor that thou ioye much thereof, neither
preſume vainely therein, but rather that
thou be the more meeke for ſo noble a
<pb facs="tcp:3160:52"/>
gifte, and the more warie and fearefull in
all thy workes: for that time will paſſe
awaye, and the time of temptation will
ſhortlye folowe after. VVhen comfort is
withdrawen, diſpayre not therefore, but
meekelye and patiently abide the viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, for he is able, and of power
to geue thee more grace, and more ghoſtly
comfort, then thou haddeſt firſt. Suche
alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of grace is no new nor ſtraunge
thinge to them that haue had experience
in the waye of God, for in great Saintes,
and holye prophetes was many times
founde like alteration. VVherefore the
prophete Dauid ſayth: <hi>Ego dixi in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantia
mea, non mouebor in aeternum.</hi> That is
to ſaye, VVhen Dauid had aboundance
of ghoſtly comfort, he ſaide to our Lorde,
that he truſted he ſhould neuer be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from ſuch comfort. But after, when
grace withdrewe, he ſaide: <hi>Auertiſti faciem
tuam a me, &amp; factus ſum conturbatus.</hi> That is,
O Lord, thou haſt withdrawen thy ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
comfortes from me, and I am lefte in
great trouble and heauines: and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles,
he diſpaired not therfore, but
prayed hartily vnto our Lorde, and ſayd:
<hi>Ad to domine clamabo, &amp; ad deum meum depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabor.</hi>
That is to ſaye, I ſhall buſilye crye
to thee, O Lorde, and I ſhall meekelye
praye to thee for grace and comfort. And
anone he had the effecte of his prayer,
as he witneſſeth him ſelfe, ſaying thus:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3160:52"/>
                  <hi>Audiuit dominus, &amp; miſertus eſt mei, dominus
factus eſt adiutor meus,</hi> That is to ſay, Our
Lorde hath heard my prayer, and hath
had mercy on me, and hath nowe agayne
ſent me his helpe and ghoſtlye comforte.
And therefore he ſayth afterward: Lord,
thou haſt turned my ſorow into ioye, and
thou haſte belapped me with heauenlye
gladnes. And if almightie God hath thus
done with holy Saintes, it is not for vs
weake and feeble perſons to diſpayre,
though we ſometime haue feruour of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
and be ſometime left colde and voyd
of deuotion. The holy ghoſte goeth and
commeth after his pleaſure, and therefore
the holy man Iob ſayth: Lorde, thou gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
viſiteſt thy louer in the morning
tyde, that is to ſaye, in the time of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and ſodenlye thou proueſt him: that
is to ſay, in withdrawing ſuch comfortes
from him. VVherein then may I truſt, or
in whom may I haue any confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but
onelye in the great endleſſe grace and
mercy of God? for why? the company of
good men, nor the felowſhip of deuout
brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and faithfull frendes, neither the
hauing of holy bookes, or deuout trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes,
ne yet the hearing of ſweete ſonges,
or of deuout hymnes may litle auayle,
and bring forth but litle comfort to the
ſoule, when we are left to our owne frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and pouertie. And when we be ſo left,
there is no better remedie but patience,
<pb facs="tcp:3160:53"/>
with a whole reſigning of our owne will
to the will of God. I neuer yet founde
any religious perſon ſo perfect, but that
he had ſometime abſentinge of grace, or
ſome miniſhinge of feruour: and there
was neuer yet anye Saint ſo highlie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed,
but that he firſte or laſt had ſome
temptation. He is not worthy to haue the
high gift of contemplation, that hath not
ſuffred for God ſome tribulation. The
temptations goinge before, were wont
to be a ſoothfaſt token of heauenlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
ſhortly comminge after. And to them
that be founde ſtable in their temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
is promiſed by our Lorde great conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therfore he ſayth thus: He that
ouercommeth, I ſhall geue him to eate of
the tree of life. Heauenlie comfort is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
geuen to a man, that he may after
be more ſtronge to ſuffer aduerſities: but
after followeth temptation, that he be
not lifte vp into pride, and thinke hym
ſelfe worthie of ſuch conſolation. The
ghoſtlie enemie ſleepeth not, neither is
the fleſhe yet fullie mortified: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou ſhalte neuer ceaſſe to prepare

well in ſendinge ſuch comfortes, but we
doe not well, when we yeelde no thankes

Euery high thing in ſight of man, is not

that perfect men moſte couet, and moſte

much more greeuous ſhall it

of iudgement: Go ye from me ye curſed
people into the fire that euer ſhall laſt.
But thoſe that nowe gladlie heare and

when our Lorde ſhall come to iudge the

who conformed them ſelues here in this

the verye waye to the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and none but that? In the Croſſe is
health, in the Croſſe is life, in the Croſſe
is defenſe from our enemies, in the croſſe
is infuſion of heauenlie ſweetnes, in the
Croſſe is the ſtrength of minde, the ioye

<pb facs="tcp:3160:57"/>
full perfection of all holines, and there
is no health of ſoule, nor hope of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
life, but through vertue of the croſſe
Take therefore the Croſſe, and folowe
Ieſus, and thou ſhalt goe into the lyfe
euerlaſtinge. He hath gone before thee
bearinge his Croſſe, and died for thee
vpon the Croſſe, that thou ſhouldeſt in
like wiſe beare with him the Croſſe of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and tribulation, and that thou
ſhouldeſt be readie likewiſe for his loue
to ſuffer death, if neede require, as he
hath done for thee. If thou die with him,
thou ſhalt liue with him: and if thou be
felowe with him in paine, thou ſhalt be
with him in glorie. Beholde then how in
the Croſſe ſtandeth all, &amp; howe in dyinge
to the worlde lieth all our health, &amp; that
there is no other waye to true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace, but the waye of the Croſſe,
and of deadlie mortifyinge of the bodie
to the ſpirite. So whether thou wilt, and
ſeeke what thou liſt, and thou ſhalt neuer
finde aboue thee, nor beneath thee,
within thee, nor without thee, more
high, more excellent, nor more ſure waye
to Chriſt, then the waye of the holy croſſe.
Diſpoſe euery thinge after thy will and
thou ſhalt neuer finde, but that thou
muſt of neceſſitie ſomewhat ſuffer eyther
with thy will, or againſt thy will, and ſo
ſhalt thou alwaye finde the Croſſe: for
either thou ſhalt feele paine in thy bodie,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3160:57"/>
or in thy ſoule thou ſhalt haue trouble of
ſpirit. Thou ſhalt be ſometime as thou
were forſaken of God. Sometime thou
ſhalt be vexed with thy neighbour, and,
that is yet more painefull, thou ſhalt
ſometime be greeuous to thy ſelfe, and
thou ſhalt find no meane to be deliuered,
but that it behoueth thee to ſuffer til it
ſhall pleaſe almightie god of his goodnes
otherwiſe to diſpoſe for thee: for he will,
that thou ſhalt learne to ſuffer tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that thou mayeſt
therby learne, whollie to ſubmit thy ſelfe
to him, and by tribulation to be made
more meeke, then thou were at the firſt.
No man feeleth the paſſion of Chriſte ſo
effectuouſlie, as he that feeleth like paine
as Chriſte did. This Croſſe is alway rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and euery where it abideth thee, and
thou mayeſt not flee, nor fullie eſcape it,
wherſoeuer thou become, for in what
place ſoeuer thou art, thou ſhalt beare
thy ſelfe about with thee, and ſo alwaye
ſhalt thou finde thy ſelfe. Turne thee
where thou wilt, aboue thee, beneath
thee, within thee, and without thee, and
thou ſhalt finde this croſſe on euery ſide,
ſo that it ſhall be neceſſarie for thee, that
thou alwaye keepe thee in patience: and
that it behoueth thee to doe, if thou wilt
haue inwarde peace, and deſerue the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall

gladlie beare this Croſſe, it ſhall beare

thou deſireſt, where thou ſhalt neuer
after haue any thinge to ſuffer. And if
thou beare this Croſſe againſt thy will,
thou makeſt a great burden to thy ſelfe,
and it will be the more greeuous to thee,
and yet it behoueth thee to beare it. And
if it happen thee to put away one croſſe,
that is to ſaye, one tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet ſurely
another will come, and happlie more
greeuous then the firſt was. Troweſt
thou to eſcape, that neuer yet any mortal
man might eſcaped VVhat Saint in this
world hath beene without this Croſſe, &amp;
without ſome trouble? Trulie, our Lorde
Ieſu was not one houre without ſome
ſorowe and payne, as longe as he liued
here, for it behoued him to ſuffer death,
and to riſe againe, and ſo to enter into
his glorie: and how is it then, that thou
ſeekeſt any other waye to heauen then
this plaine high waye of the Croſſe? All
the life of Chriſt was Croſſe and martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and thou ſeekeſt pleaſure and ioy.
Thou erreſt greatlie, if thou ſeeke anye

mortall life is full of miſeries, and is all
beſet about and marked with Croſſes, &amp;
the more highlie that a man profiteth in
ſoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

finde, For by the ſooth faſtnes of Chriſtes
loue, wherein he daylie increaſeth, daylie
appeareth vnto him more and more the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3160:58"/>
paine of this exile. But neuertheleſſe, a
man thus vexed with paine, is not left
whollie without all comfort, for he ſeeth
well, that great fruite and high rewarde
ſhall growe vnto him by the bearinge of
his Croſſe. And when a man freelie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
him ſelfe to ſuch tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then
all the burden of tribulation is ſodenlie
turned into a great truſt of heauenlye
conſolation. And the more the fleſhe is
puniſhed with tribulation, the more is
the ſoule ſtrengthned daylie by inwarde
conſolation: And ſometime the ſoule ſhall
feele ſuch comfort in aduerſities, that
for the loue and deſire that it hath to be
conformed to Chriſte crucified, it woulde
not be without ſorowe and trouble: for it
conſidereth well, that the more that it
may ſuffer for his loue here, the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
ſhall he be to him in the life to
come. But this workinge is not in the
power of man, but through the grace of
God, that is to ſaye, that a frayle man
ſhould take and loue that, which his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie
kinde ſo much abhorreth and flieth:
for it is not in the power of man, gladlie
to beare the Croſſe, to loue the Croſſe, to
chaſtiſe the bodie, and to make it obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to the will of the ſpirite, to flee honours,
gladlie to ſuſtayne reproufes, to deſpiſe
him ſelfe, and to couet to be deſpiſed: pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientlie
to ſuffer aduerſities, with al
diſpleaſures thereof, and not to deſire
<pb facs="tcp:3160:59"/>
any maner of profite in this worlde. If
thou truſt in thy ſelfe, thou ſhaltneuer
bringe this matter about: but yf thou
truſt in God, he ſhall ſend thee ſtrength
from heauen, and the worlde, and the
fleſhe ſhalbe made ſubiect to thee: yea,
and if thou be ſtrongly armed with faith,
and be marked with the Croſſe of Chriſt,
as his houſholde ſeruant, thou ſhalt not
neede to feare thy ghoſtlie enemie, for he
ſhall alſo be made ſubiect to thee, ſo that
he ſhall haue no power againſt thee.
Purpoſe thy ſelfe therefore as a true
faythfull ſeruant of God, manfullye to
beare the Croſſe of thy Lorde Ieſu, that
for thy loue was crucified on the Croſſe:
prepare thy ſelfe to ſuffer all maner of
aduerſities and diſcommodities in this
wretched life: for ſo ſhall it be with thee,
wherſoeuer thou hide thee, and there is
no remedie to eſcape, but that thou muſt
keepe thy ſelfe alwaye in patience. If
thou deſire to be a deare and well belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

with him a draught of the chalice of his

ſelues, to bringe vs to the glorye that is
ordeined for vs in the life to come, yea,
though thou thy ſelfe mighteſt ſuffer aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as all men do. VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meſt to
that degree of patience, that tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is

thou truſt, that it is wel with thee, &amp; that
thou art in good eſtate, for thou haſte
founde paradiſe in earth. But as long as
it is greeuous to thee to ſuffer, and thou
ſeekeſt to flee, ſo long it is not well with
thee, neither art thou in the perfect way
of patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but if thou couldeſt bringe thy
ſelfe to that eſtate, that thou ſhouldeſt be
at, that is, to ſuffer gladly for God, and to
dye fully to the worlde, then ſhoulde it
ſhortlye be better with thee, and thou
ſhouldeſt finde great peace: but yet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thou were rapt with Paule into
the third heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thou ſhouldeſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be ſure without all aduerſitie: for
our Sauiour ſpeaking of S. Paul, after
he had bene rapt into heauen, ſayd thus
of him: I ſhall ſhewe him howe many
thinges he ſhall ſuffer for me. To ſuffer
therefore to thee remayneth, if thou wilt
loue thy Lorde Ieſu, and ſerue him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually.
VVould to god, that thou wexe
worthy, to ſuffer ſomewhat for his loue.
O howe great ioye ſhoulde it be to thee,
to ſuffer for him? what gladnes to all the
Saintes of heauen? and howe great edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb facs="tcp:3160:60"/>
to thy neighbour? All men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend
patience, and yet fewe men will ſuffer.
Righteouſly thou oughteſt to ſuffer ſome
litle thing for God, that ſuffereſt much
more for the worlde. And knowe this for
certaine, that after this bodily death
thou ſhalte yet lyue, &amp; the more that thou
canſt dye to thy ſelfe here, the more thou
beginneſt to liue to God. No man is apt
to receyue the heauenlie rewarde, but he
haue firſt learned to beare aduerſities for
the loue of Chriſte, for nothinge is more
acceptable to God, nor more profitable
to man in this worlde then to be glad to
ſuffer for Chriſt, in ſomuch that if it were
put in thy election, thou ſhouldeſt rather
choſe aduerſitie then proſperitie, for then
by the pacient ſufferinge thereof thou
ſhouldeſt be more like to Chriſte, and the
more confirmed to all his ſaintes. Our
merite, and our perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life ſtandeth
not in conſolations and ſweetnes, but
rather in ſufferinge of great greeuous
aduerſities and tribulations. For if there
had bene any nearer or better waye for
the health of mans ſoule then to ſuffer,
our Lorde Ieſu would haue ſhewed it by
wordes, or by examples: But for there
was not, therefore he openlie exhorted
his diſciples that folowed him, and all
other that deſired to folowe him, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
their owne will, and to take the
Croſſe of penance and folowe him, ſaying
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3160:60"/>
thus, VVho ſo will come after me, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
he his owne will, take he the Croue,
and folowe he me. Therefore all thinges
ſearched and redde, be this the finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
that by many tribulations it
behoueth vs to enter into the

affections and vices, and be made
apte and able to loue thee, ſtronge to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for thee, and ſtable to perſeuer in thee.
Loue is a great thinge and a good, and
onelie maketh heauye burdens light, and
beareth in like balaunce things pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:3160:67"/>
and diſpleaſant: it beareth a heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and feeleth it not, and maketh bitter
thinges to be ſauerie and ſweete. Alſo the
noble loue of Ieſu perfectlie printed in
mans ſoule, maketh a man to doe great
thinges, and ſtirreth him alwaye to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
perfection, and to growe more and
more in grace and goodnes. Loue will
alwaye haue his minde vpwarde to god,
and will not be occupied with loue of the
worlde. Loue will alſo be free from all
worldlie affections, that the inwarde
ſight of the ſoule be not darked or let,
nor that his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heauenly thinges
be put from his free libertie by inordinat
winninge or loſinge of worldly thinges.
Nothinge therefore is more ſweete then
loue, nothinge higher, nothinge ſtronger,
nothinge larger, nothinge ioyfuller, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
fuller, nor any thinge better in
heauen or in earth: for loue deſcendeth
from God, and may not reſt finallie in
anye thinge lower then God. Suche a
louer flieth high, he runneth ſwiftlie, he
is merie in God, he is free in ſoule, he
geneth all for all, and hath all in all: for
he reſteth in one high goodnes aboue all
thinges, of whom all goodnes floweth
and proceedeth the beholdeth not onelee
the gifte, but the geuer aboue all giftes.
Loue knoweth no meaſure, but is feruent
without meaſure. It feeleth no burden, it
regardeth no labour, it deſireth more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:3160:67"/>
it may attaine, it complaineth of none
impoſſibilitie, for it thinketh all thinge
that maye be done for his beloued, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and lawfull vnto him. Loue therefore
doth many great thinges, and bringeth
them to effect, wherein he that is no
louer fainteth and faileth. Loue waketh
muche, and ſleepeth litle, and ſleepinge
ſleepeth not: it fainteth, and is not werie:
is reſtrained of libertie, and is in great
freedome. He ſeeth cauſes of feare, and
feareth not, but as a quicke bronde or
ſparkle of fire, flameth alwaye vpwarde
by feruoure of loue into God, &amp; through
the eſpeciall helpe of grace is deliuered
from all perils and daungers. He that is
thus a ghoſtlie louer, knoweth well what
his voyce meanes, which ſayeth thus:
Thou Lorde God art my wholle loue and
my deſire, thou art all mine, and I all
thine. Spreade thou my heart into thy
loue, that I may taſte and feele howe
ſweete it is to ſerue thee, and how ioyful
it is to laude thee, aud to be as I were all
molten into thy loue. O I am bounden in
loue, and go farre aboue my ſelfe: for the
wonderfull great feruour that I feele of
thy vnſpeakeable goodnes, I ſhall ſinge
to thee the ſonge of loue, and I ſhall fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
thee my beloued by highnes of
thought, whereſoeuer thou go, and my
ſoule ſhall neuer be werie to prayſe thee
with the ioyfull ſonge of ghoſtlie loue,
<pb facs="tcp:3160:68"/>
that I ſhall ſing to thee. I ſhall loue thee
more then my ſelfe, and not my ſelfe but
for thee, and all other in thee and for
thee, as the lawe of loue commaundeth,
which is geuen by thee. Loue is ſwifte,
pure, meeke, ioyous and glad, ſtronge, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
faythfull, wiſe, forbearing, manlye,
&amp; neuer ſeeking him ſelfe, nor his owne
will, for whenſoeuer a man ſeeketh him
ſelfe, he falleth fro loue. Alſo loue is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect,
meeke, righteous, not tender,
not light, nor heedinge vayne thinges:
ſober, chaſte, ſtable, quiet, and well ſtabled
in his outwarde wittes. Alſo, loue is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
and obedient to his prelate, vile and
deſpiſable in his owne ſight, deuout and
thankfull to God, truſting, and alwaye
hoping in him, and that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath but
litle deuotion, or litle ſauor in him: for
without ſome ſorowe or payne no man
may lyue in loue. He that is not alwaye
redy to ſuffer, and to ſtand fullye at the
will of his beloued, is not woorthy to be
called a louer, for it behoueth a louer to
ſuffer gladlye all harde and bitter
thinges for his beloued, and not
to decline from his loue for
no contrariou thing
that may befall
vnto him.</p>

ſtrong to me, and thinke not that it is an

merite and no perdition. I knowe (ſayth

worſhip that thou art bounde to geue to
me and to my ſaintes, and from minde of
my paſſion, and from the remembraunce
of thine owne ſinnes, from a diligent
keeping of thy harte in good meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
and from a ſtedfaſt purpoſe to profite in

and to be ſoone werye with prayer, and
with readinge, and with all other good

let a man that he ſhall not be houſeled.
But beleue him not, nor care not for him
though he aſſayle thee neuer ſo muche.
Make all his malice returne to him ſelfe
agayne, and ſaye to him thus, Go from

for thou art foule and vglye, that

and all other neceſſaries for the body be
painefull and troubleſome to a feruent
ſpirite, which if it might, woulde alwaye

me therefore grace to vſe ſuch bodilye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries

I ſhall come ſoone, and helpe thee. It is

To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation is great grace required,
for it lifteth vp the ſoule, and rauiſheth
it vp in ſpirit aboue it ſelfe. And except a

as in his loue, and be perfectly and
fullie vnited to God, whatſoeuer he can,
or whatſoeuer he hath, either in vertue or

Therefore he ſhal haue but litle vertue, &amp;

and that learninge is muche more noble
and muche more worthy, that commeth

God, than that that is gotten by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
&amp; ſtudy of man. Many deſire to haue
the gifte of contemplation, but they will
not vſe ſuche thinges as be required to
contemplation. And one great let of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
is, that we ſtande ſo longe in
outward ſignes, and in ſenſible things, &amp;
take no heede of perfect mortifying our
body to the ſpirit. I wote not howe it is,
nor with what ſpirit we be led, nor what
we pretend, we that be called ſpirituall
perſons, that we take greater labour and
ſtudy for tranſitory thinges, than we doe
to knowe the inwarde ſtate of our owne
ſoule. But alas for ſorowe, anone as we
haue made a litle recollection to God, we
ten forth to outwarde thinges, and doe
not ſearch our owne conſcience with due
examination, as we ſhoulde do, nor we
heede not where our affection reſteth, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
ſorowe not that our deedes be ſo euill
&amp; ſo vnclene as they be. The people cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
them ſelfe with fleſhly vncle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes,
and therefore folowed the greate floode:
and veryly when our inward affection is
<pb facs="tcp:3160:100"/>

folowinge thervpon be alſo corrupted,
for of a cleane heart ſpringeth the fruite

                  </gap>outhfull, and to all thinge
vnprofitable. O Lorde, thou arte alwaye
one, euer ſhalt be one, alway good alway
righteous and holy, well, righteouſly and
bleſſedly diſpoſing all thinges after thy
wiſedome: but I wretche, that alway am
more redy &amp; prone to euill then to good,
am not alwaye abidinge in one, for ſeuen
times be chaunged vpon me. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
it ſhall be better with me, when it
ſhall pleaſe thee to put to thy helpinge
hand, for thou onely act he, that without
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3160:109"/>
man mayeſt helpe me, and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme and
ſtable me in thee, that mine heart ſhall
not ſo lightlie be changed from thee, but
that it maye be wholly fired in thee, and
finallye to reſt in thee. And verilye, if I
coulde caſt awaye from me all mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
either for getting of deuotion, or for
that I am compelled therto of neceſſitie,
for that I finde no comfort in man, then
might I well truſt in thy grace to haue of
thee newe viſitations, &amp; newe heauenlie
conſolation: But I confeſſe it for truth,
that I am vnworthy to haue anye ſuche
conſolations, and I thanke thee, as ofte
as anye good thinge commeth to me: for
all that is good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of thee. I am but
vanitie, and nought before thee, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
man, and a feeble, and therefore,
whereof maye I righteouſly glorifie my
ſelfe, or why ſhould I looke to be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
Truelye vaine glorie is a perillous
ſickenes, a greeuous peſtilence, &amp; a right
great vanitie: for it draweth a man from
the true ioy that he ſhould haue in God,
and robbeth him cleerelye of all heauenly
grace. For when a man pleaſeth him ſelfe,
he diſpleaſeth thee, &amp; when he delighteth
in mans prayſinges, he is depriued from
the true vertues: for the true ſtedfaſt ioye
&amp; gladnes is, to ioye in thee, &amp; not in him
ſelfe, in thy name, and not in his owne
vertue, nor in anye creature. Therefore
thy name be prayſed, and not mine, thy
<pb facs="tcp:3160:110"/>
workes be magnified, and not mine, and
thy goodnes be alwaye bleſſed, ſo that
nothing be geuen to me of the laude and
prayſing of man. Thou art my glory and
the ioy of my hart, in thee ſhall I be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
and alway ſhall I ioy in thee, and
in my ſelfe nothinge, but in my infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Let the Iewes ſeke glorye amonge
them ſelues, but I will ſeeke none but
that is onely of thee, for all mans glory,
all temporall honour, and all worldlye
highnes to thy eternall glorye compared,
is but as fooliſhnes, and a great vanitie.
O truth, O mercy, O bleſſed trinitie, to
thee be laude, honour, and glory euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly.
Amen.</p>

thing, and will not be mixte
with anye priuate loue, nor
with worldlye comfortes. It
behoueth thee therefore to
caſte awaye all lettinges of

thereof. Thoſe therefore a ſecrete place,
and loue to be alone, and keepe thee from
hearinge of vayne tales and fables, and
offer to God deuout prayers, and praye
hartily, that thou mayeſt haue a contrite

before all other thinges, for thou mayeſt
not haue minde on me, and therwithall
delite thee in tranſitorie pleaſures. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth
thee therefore to withdrawe thee
from thy deereſt freendes, and from all
thine acquaintaunce, and to ſequeſter thy

of all worldlye comfort as muche as thou
mayeſt. Thus prayed Saint Peter, that
all Chriſtien people might holde them
ſelues as ſtrangers, and as pilgrimes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
earth, for then they ſhoulde not ſet but
litle price by the comfort thereof. O howe

<pb facs="tcp:3160:127"/>
in his ſoule, that no worldlie
loue, nor yet the affection of no paſſinge
or tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſitorie thinge hath any rule in him.
But a weake feeble perſon newlie turned
to God, may not ſo lightlie haue his hart
ſeuered from earthlie likinge, nor the

And therefore if a man will perfectlie be

thou couet to come to that point, thou

lightned in ſoule. Euerye man
deſireth ſome goodnes, and pretendeth
ſomewhat of goodnes in all his wordes
and deedes, and therfore vnder pretence
of goodnes many be deceaued. Nature is
wylie, and full of deceit, and draweth
many to her, whom ſhe often times ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
and deceyueth, &amp; euer beholdeth her
owne wealth, as the ende of her worke.
<pb facs="tcp:3160:128"/>
But grace walketh ſimplye, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyte,
ſhe declineth from all euill, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
no gyle, but all thinges ſhe doth
purelye for God, in whom finallye ſhe
reſteth. Nature will not gladlye dye, nor
gladlye be oppreſſed or ouercome, neither
will ſhe gladlye be vnder other, ne be
kept in ſubiection: but grace ſtudieth
howe ſhe may be mortified to the world,
and to the fleſh. She reſiſteth ſenſualitie,
ſhe ſeeketh to be ſubiecte, ſhe deſireth to
be ouercome, ſhe will not vſe her owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie:
ſhe loueth to be holden vnder holy
diſcipline, and coueteth not to haue lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ouer anye one creature, but to lyue
and to ſtande alway vnder the dreade of
God, and for his loue is alwaye readie to
bowe her ſelfe meekely to euery creature.
Nature laboureth for her owne profite
and aduantage, &amp; muche beholdeth what
winning commeth to her by other. But
grace beholdeth not what is profitable
to her ſelfe, but what is profytable to
manye. Nature receaueth gladlye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

all honour and reuerence to God. Nature
dreadeth reprouinges and deſpiſing, but
grace ioyeth for the name of god to ſuffer
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, and take them when they come
as ſpeciall giftes of God. Nature loueth
idlenes and fleſhlie reſt, but grace can
not be ydle without doeinge ſome good

ſome profitable labours. Nature deſireth
faire thinges and curious, and abhorreth
vile thinges and groſſe: but grace deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

not harde thinges, nor refuſeth
not to be clad in poore olde clothing and

gladlie thinges temporall, ſhe ioyeth at
worldlie winninges, is heauie for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

euerlaſtinge, and truſteth not in thinges
temporall, nor is not troubled with the

a frowarde worde, for ſhe hath layde her
treaſure in God, and in ghoſtlie thinges
whiche may not periſhe. Nature is coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
&amp; more gladlie taketh than geueth,
and loueth muche to haue propertie and
priuate thinges: but grace is pitifull and
liberall to the poore, ſhe flieth ſinguler
profite, ſhe is content with litle, and
iudgeth it more bleſſed to geue then to
take. Nature inclineth to the loue of
creatures, to the loue of the fleſhe, and to
vanities and runnings about, and to ſee
newe thinges in the worlde: but grace
draweth a man to the loue of God, and
to the loue of vertues, ſhe renounceth all
creatures, ſhe flieth the world, ſhe hateth
deſires of the fleſhe, reſtrayneth libertie
and wandringes about, and eſcheweth
aſmuch as ſhe may to be ſeene among re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

ſome outwarde ſolace, wherein ſhe maye
faylably delight in her outwarde wittes:
but grace ſeeketh onelie to be comforted
in God, and to delight her in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

God, ſhe will no more of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall goodes
then ſhall neede for the gettinge of the
goodes euerlaſtinge, and careth not for
the vayne prayſe of the worlde. Nature
ioyeth greatlie in many freendes &amp; kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes,
and is glorified much of a noble

kinred ſhe ioyeth with mightie men: ſhe

alwaye comforteth good men more and
more to profite and growe in vertue and
goodnes, and to ſeeke daylie more higher

anone for wantinge of a right litle thing
that ſhe woulde haue, or for a litle world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

Nature inclynethe all thinges to her

ſhe maye: ſhe argueth for her ſelfe, and
ſtriueth and fighteth for her ſelfe: but
grace rendreth all thinges to God, of

For after that nature was vitiate &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
by the ſinne of the firſt man Adam,
the payne thereof deſcended into all his
poſteritie, ſo that, that nature which in
the firſt creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was good &amp; righteous, is
nowe taken for ſinne and corruption, ſo
farre forth, that the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that are now
lefte vnto nature, drawe man alwaye
vnto euill. And that is for this reaſon, for
<pb facs="tcp:3160:131"/>
that the litle ſtrength and mouinge to
goodnes, that yet remayneth in it, is as
a litle ſparcle of fire, that is hid and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilled
with aſhes, that is to ſaye, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
reaſon of man, which is all about
belapped and ouerhilled with darkenes
of ignoraunce, whiche neuertheleſſe hath
power yet to iudge betwixt good and
bad, and to ſhewe the diſtance and diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
betwixt true and falſe. Howbeit that
through weakenes of it ſelfe, it is not
able to fulfill all that it approueth, nor
hath not ſith the firſte ſinne of Adam the
full light of truth, nor the ſweetnes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to God as it had firſte. Of this
it commeth, moſt mercifull Lorde, that in
my inwarde man that is in the reaſon of
my ſoule, I delite me in thy lawes and in
thy teachinges, knowinge that they are
good, and righteous, and holie, and that
all ſinne is euill, and to be fled and eſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed:
and yet in my outwarde man, that
is to ſaye, in my fleſhelie felinge, I ſerue
the lawe of ſinne, when I obeye rather to
ſenſualitie then to reaſon. And of this it
foloweth alſo, that I will good, but to
perfourme it without thy grace I maye
not for weakenes of my ſelfe. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
I purpoſe to doe many good dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
but for that grace wanteth, that

it euidentlye, but for that I am ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with the heauye burden of this
corrupt bodye of ſynne, I lye ſtill, and
ryſe not to perfection: O Lorde, howe
neceſſarye therefore is thy grace to me,
to beginne well, to continue well, and to
ende well, for without thee I maye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
doe that good is. O heauenlye

ſuffiſe, nor yet this diſputation. Therfore,
when the ghoſtly enemy ſtirreth thee to
ſuch thinges, or if any curious men aſke
of thee ſuche queſtions, anſwer with the
prophete Dauid, and ſay thus, Lord thou
art righteous, &amp; thy iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are true,

are to be dread, &amp; not to be diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by mans wit, for they be to mans wit
incomprehenſible. Beware alſo that thou
ſearch not, nor reaſon not of the merites
of Saintes, which of them was holyer
then other, or which of them is higher in
heauen: Suche queſtions ofte times nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe
great ſtrifes and vnprofitable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoninges,
and proceede of pride &amp; vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,

that is to ſaye, when one laboureth
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3160:135"/>
to prefer this Saint, and another that.
And truely a deſire to knowe ſuch things
rather diſpleaſeth Saints then pleaſeth
them For I (ſaith our Lord) am not God
of diſcention and ſtrife, but of vnitie and
peace, the which peace ſtandeth rather in
true meekenes, than in exalting of them
ſelues. Some men be more ſtirred to loue
this Saint or that, and that with muche
greater affection, but truly that affection
is oft time more rather a manly affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
than a godlye. Am not I he that haue
made all Saints? yes truelye: and ouer
that I haue giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grace, and I haue
geuen them glorye: I knowe all their
merites, I preuented them with the
ſweetnes of my bleſſinges, I knewe my
elect and choſen people before the worlde
was made, I haue choſen them from the
worlde, they haue not choſen me, I called
them by my grace, I drewe them by my
mercy, I led them through temptations,
I ſent them inwarde comfortes, I gaue
them perſeueraunce, I crowned their
patience, I knowe the firſt man and the
laſte, I loue them all with an ineſtimable
loue. Thus I am to be prayſed in all my
Saintes, and aboue all thinges to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and honoured in all, and in euery of
them whom I haue ſo gloriouſſye ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifyed
and predeſtinate without anye
merites in them goeinge before. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that deſpyſeth the leaſte of my
<pb facs="tcp:3160:136"/>
Saintes, doth no honour to the greateſt,
for I haue made both the leſſe and the
more, and he that diſprayſeth any of my
Saintes, he diſprayſeth me and other of
my Saintes in the kingdome of heauen,
for they be all one, faſte vnited and knit
together in one ſure bonde of perfect
charitie. They feele all one thinge, and
they will all one thinge, and they loue
altogether all into one thinge, and they
loue me muche more then them ſelues, or
their own merites, for they be rapt about
themſelues, and be drawen from their
owne loue, and whollie be turned into
my loue, in the which they reſt by eternal
fruition. There is nothinge that maye
turne them from my loue, nor that may
thruſt them downe out of their glorie, for
they be full of eternall trueth, and burne
inwarldlie in ſoule with fyre of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinge
charitie, that neuer ſhall be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
Let all them ceaſe therefore that be
carnall and beaſtly, and that can not loue
but priuate ioye, to ſearche the ſtate of
my bleſſed Saintes in heauen, for they
put awaye, and adde to their merites as
they fauour, and not after the pleaſure of
the eternall truth of God. In many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
is great ignoraunce, but moſte ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
in them that haue ſo litle light of
ghoſtlie vnderſtanding, that they can not
loue any perſon with a cleane loue. Many
alſo be moued by a naturall affection, or
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3160:136"/>
by a worldly frendſhip to loue this ſaint
or that, and as they imagine in earthly
thinges, ſo they imagine of heauenlye
thinges, but there is a diſtaunce incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
betwixt thinges which imperfect
men imagine by naturall reaſon, and
which men truelye illumined with grace
beholde by heauenlye contemplation.
Beware therefore, my ſonne, to treate
curiouſly of ſuche thinges, for they paſſe
thy knowledge, and endeuour thy ſelfe,
that thou mayeſt be worthy ſo be nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred

who were holyer, or who ſhould be taken
greater in the kingdome of heauen, what
ſhoulde that knowledge auayle him, but
if he would therby the more meeke him
ſelfe, and the more ryſe thereby, into the
laude and prayſinge of my name? truelie
nothinge. Therefore he is much more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God that thinketh on the
greatnes of his ſinnes, and of the little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of his vertues, and howe farre he is
from the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the leaſt Saint that
is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then he that argueth of their
greatnes, or of their litlenes, or bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of life, forgettinge them ſelfe. It is
better alſo with deuout prayers, &amp; with
weepinges and teares meekelie to praye
to Saintes, and to call to them for helpe,
then vaynelie to ſearche for their perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
They be verie well contented with
<pb facs="tcp:3160:137"/>
the ioye that they haue, if men woulde
refrayne themſelues from ſuche vayne
arguments. They glorifie not them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
of their merites, ne they aſcribe no
goodnes to themſelues, but they referre
all goodnes to me, for they knowe well
that I of my infinite goodnes and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
haue geuen all vnto them. And they
be ſo muche fulfilled with loue of the
godhead, and with ouerpaſſing ioye, that
no glorie maye want in them, nor anye
felicitie. And the higher that they be in
heauen, the meeker be they in them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
and the more nighe and the more

Amen. Manye ſearche who is higheſt in

where all be great, for all that ſhall come

thou haſte ſpoken them, and they be now

of thy mouth, to the end they maye be the

Thy wordes of ſo great pietie, full of
ſweetnes and loue, greatly excite me. But
Lorde, my ſinnes feare me greatlie, and

O howe ſweete, and howe amyable a

And certainly, no vnprofitable thoughts

reuerence and deuotion ought we then

and beholde howe their bones and

vpon the Aultar, the moſt holie Saint of

it is greatlie to be ſorowed, that we be
ſo ſlowe and negligent, and that we be
ſtirred with no more affection to recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
Chriſt then we be, for in him ſtandeth
all merite and hope of them that ſhall be
ſaued. He is our health and our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
he is the comfortour of all that
liue in this worlde, and the eternall reſt
of all Saintes in heauen. And it is alſo
<pb facs="tcp:3160:143"/>
greatly to be ſorowed, that ſo many take
ſo litle heede of this high miſterie, which
gladdeth the heauen, and preſerueth all
the world. Alas the blindnes and hardnes
of mans hart, that taketh no greater
heede to ſo noble a gifte, but by the dayly
vſing thereof is negligent, and taketh
litle heede thereto. If this bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were miniſtred onelie in one place,
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate but by one prieſt in the world,
with how great deſire, thinkeſt thou, the

that Prieſt, that they myght ſee there
theſe heauenlie miſteries? Nowe there be
manye prieſtes, and Chriſte is offred in
many places, that the grace and loue of
God to man maye appeare ſo muche the

the more abrode throughout the worlde,
thankinges be to thee therefore, my Lord

he can: and therefore ſome men, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
diſpoſe them ſelues to it, haue more grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
temptations then they had before: for
as it is written in Iob, the wicked ſpirit
commeth amonge the children of God,
that he maye by his olde malice and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
trouble them, or make them ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
fearefull and perplexed, ſo that he
maye diminiſhe their affection, or take
awaye their fayth, if happilie he maye
thereby make them eyther vtterlye to
<pb facs="tcp:3160:154"/>
ceaſſe from beinge houſeled, or els that
they goe to it with litle deuotion. But it
is not any thing to care for al his craftes
and phantaſies, howe vyle and vgglye
ſoeuer they be, but all phantaſies are to
be throwen agayne at is owne head, and
he ſo far to be deſpiſed, that for all his
aſſaults and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions that he can ſtirre
vp, the holy communion be not omitted.
Sometime ouer much curiouſnes to haue
deuotion, or ouer great doubt of making
confeſſion, letteth muche this holye pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Doe therefore after the counſayle of
wiſe men, and put awaye all doubtfulnes
and ſcrupulouſnes, for they let the grace
of God, and deſtroy whollie the deuotion
of the minde. Alſo it is not good that for
any litle trouble or griefe, that thou leaue
this holie worke, but go lightlie and be
confeſſed and forgeue gladlye all that
haue offended thee. And if thou haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
any other, meekelie aſke of them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geueues,
and God ſhall right mercifully
forgeue thee. VVhat profiteth it longe to
tarie from confeſſion, or to deferre this
holie Communion? Purge thee firſt, and
quickelie caſt out thy venim, and haſte
thee after to take the medicine, and thou
ſhalt feele more profite thereby, then yf
thou tariedſt lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger for it. If thou deferre
it to daye for this thinge or that, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
we may happen to come a greater, and
ſo thou mayeſt be let longe from thy good
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3160:154"/>
purpoſe, and be made afterwarde more
vnapt vnto it. Therfore as ſoone as thou
canſt, diſcharge thy ſelfe from ſuche hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
and dulnes of minde, and fro all
ſlouth, for it nothing profiteth long to
be anguiſhed, long to go with trouble, &amp;
to ſequeſter him ſelfe for ſuche dayly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles,
fro the diuine miſteries: but it
doeth great hurt, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly bringeth
in greath ſlouth, and lacke of deuotion.
But alas for ſorowe, ſome ſlouthfull and
diſſolute perſons gladlye ſeeke cauſes to
tarye from confeſſion, and ſo defer the
longer this holye Communion: and that
they doe, to the intent that they ſhoulde
not be bounde to geue them ſelues to any
more ſure kepinge of them ſelues in time
to come, then they haue done before. But
alas, howe litle charitie, and ſlender de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
haue they that ſo lightly leaue of
ſo holie a thing, &amp; howe happie is he, and
howe acceptable to God that ſo liueth,
and that ſo keepeth his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience in ſuch
cleannes, that he is euerie daye readie, &amp;
hath good affection to be houſled, if it
were lawfull vnto him, &amp; that he might
doe it without note or ſlaunder? He that
ſometime abſtaineth of meekenes, or for
any other lawfull impediment, is to be
prayſed for his reuerence, but yf it be
through ſlouthfulnes, he ought to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him ſelfe, and to doe that in him is,
and our Lorde ſhall ſtrengthen his deſire
<pb facs="tcp:3160:155"/>
for his good will, for to a good will our
Lorde hath alwaye a ſpeciall reſpect, and
when he is lawfullie let, he ſhall haue a
good will and a meeke intent to it, and
ſo he ſhall not want the fruite of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
And verilie euerie deuout man
maye euerye daye, and euerye houre go
healthfullie, and without prohibition
vnto the ſpirituall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Chriſte,
that is to ſaye, in remembringe of his
paſſion, and neuertheleſſe, in certaine
dayes and times he is bounde to receaue
Sacramentally the bodie of his Redemer
with a great reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: and rather to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
therein the laude and honour of
God, then his owne conſolation. For ſo
ofte a man is houſled miſticallye and
inuiſibly, as he remembreth deuoutly the
miſterie of the incarnation of Chriſt, and
his paſſion, and is thereby kindled into
his loue. He that doeth prepare him ſelfe
for none other cauſe, but becauſe the feaſt
is comminge, or the cuſtome compelleth
him therto, he ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie be vnready
to it. Bleſſed is he therefore, that as ofte
as he ſayth Maſſe, or is houſled, offereth
him ſelfe vnto our Lorde in holie Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
Be not in ſayinge Maſſe ouer longe,
nor ouer ſhort, but keepe the good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
waye, as they doe with whom thou
liueſt: for thou oughteſt not do that
ſhoulde greeue other, or make them te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
but to keepe the common waye,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3160:155"/>
after the ordinance of the holie fathers,
and rather to confirme thy ſelfe to that
that ſhall be profitable to other, then to
folowe thine owne deuotion, or priuate

leadinge him into the inwarde ſecrettes
that be called Sancta Sanctorum, where
the inwarde ſecrettes of Scripture be

to drinke of thy chalice of health, in the

howe vndefiled ſhoulde be the heart of a

ſhoulde alwayes anone be graunted, and

<pb facs="tcp:3160:162"/>
that letteth grace or hideth it awaye,
if it maye be called litle, and not rather
great, that letteth and prohibiteth ſo
good a thinge, but whether it be litle or
great, if thou remoue it, and perfectlye

thee that thou deſireſt, and forthwith as
thou betakeſt thy ſelfe with all thine hart

nor that for thine owne pleaſure, but
whollye putteſt thy will to his will, thou
ſhalt finde thy ſelfe vnited to him, and

ſhall ſauour ſo well to thee, nor ſo muche

him ſelfe from all inordinate loue and
diſpleaſure of any worldlye thinge, ſhall
be more apte to receiue grace, and ſhall be
beſt worthy to haue the gift of deuotion.
For there our Lorde geueth his bleſſinge
where he findeth the veſſels empty and
voide. And the more perfectlye a man can
renounce him ſelfe &amp; all worldly things, &amp;
can by deſpiſing of him ſelfe the more die

faith, and of your ſelfe by due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your eſtate and condition, and of
the lawes of God for your conduct and
countenance: and thirdly, that you maye
haue grace and good will, accordinge to
the ſame ſtrength and knowledge, and
that hauinge vnto God a reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dreade,
you neuer offende in thought, worde or
deede, but that you may euer loue him for
him ſelfe, &amp; all his creatures in due order
for him, and in him. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue
caſe. Then muſt you praye for your
genitors, your progenitours and pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
that is to ſaye, your fathers and mothers
ſpirituall and carnall, as your ghoſtlye
fathers or ſpirituall ſouuerains, your
godfathers, your godmothers, your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
father and mother, your graundfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and graundmothers, your brothers
and ſiſters, and all your kin. In the third
place is the datiue caſe. There muſt you
<pb facs="tcp:3160:169"/>
praye for benefactours, good doers, of
whom you haue receaued any maner of
giftes ſpirituall or temporall, vnto the
welth of your ſoule or bodie. In the
fourth place is the accuſatiue caſe, where
you ſhoulde praye for your enemyes, ſuch
perſons as by any meanes haue anoyed,
hurt, or greeued you, either ghoſtly or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie,
that is to ſaye, in your ſoule or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
by anye ſuggeſtion, intiſinge, euill
counſaile, or euill example. In your fame
or good name by detraction, backbiting,
or ſlaundering, or yet by familier compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
For a perſon commonlie is reputed
and ſuppoſed to be of ſuch condition, as
they be, with whom he hath conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and companie. And for them that hurt
your bodie, either by ſtrokes, or by anye
other occaſion haue hindred the ſtate and
health thereof. And lykewiſe of your
worldlie goodes or poſſeſſions. For all
theſe maner of enemies muſt you praye,
that our Lord God would forgeue them
as you doe, and as you forgeuen woulde
be, and that they may come to right cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and peace. The fifth caſe is called
vocatiue, that is to ſaye, the calling caſe,
where you conuenientlie maye call, crie,
and pray vnto our Lorde for all maner of
perſons that be out of the ſtate of grace,
either by infidelitie, as Turkes, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and ſuche other: or els by errour, as
all maner of heretikes: or els by anye
<pb facs="tcp:3160:170"/>
deadly ſinne or offence to God. Praye for
all theſe maner of perſons, that they may
come vnto the right waye of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the ſixte and laſt place is the
ablatiue caſe, where thou muſt praye for
al them that be taken out of this life, and
that died or paſſed the ſame life in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and that nowe haue neede of prayer.
In the which you maye keepe a forme of
the ſame order that is before, that is to
ſay: In ſteede of the nominatiue, where
you prayed for your ſelfe, you may nowe
praye for all thoſe that doe bide in pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
for anye default or offence done by
your example or occaſion: and for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue
in the ſecond place, for your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes,
and all your kinne departed this
life. And in the thirde place for the dati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,
praye for your benefactours paſſed.
And for the accuſatiue in the fourth pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
you maye praye for them that liue in
payne, for any occaſion or enſample that
they gaue vnto you. And in the fifte place
for the vocatiue, praye for all them that
haue greateſt paines in purgatorie, and
leaſt helpe here by the ſuffrage of prayers.
And for the ablatiue in the ſixte and laſte
place, pray for all ſoules in generall. And
that you may be the more apte to praye,
call three thinges ofte times to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
that is to ſaye, what you haue
bene, what you be, and what you ſhall be.
Firſt, by reaſon of your bodie, you were
<pb facs="tcp:3160:170"/>
conceaued of the moſte filthie abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
matter of man, ſhameful to be ſpoken,
farre more vile then the ſlutche or ſlime
of the earth, and after borne in a ſinfull
ſoule, &amp; purged onely by grace. And nowe
(as vnto the bodie) you be a muckheape
or dunghill of filth, more vyle then any
vpon earth, if you remember what doth
iſſue daylie, and come forth out of the
meates of your bodie. And your ſoule is
daylie in ſome ſinne, or (at the leaſt) full
like to be. VVhat you ſhall be as vnto
your bodie, you maye ſee in experience,
wormes meate, and earth againe. And
what ſhall become of your ſoule, no man
in this world can aſſure you. To remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
then the ioyes of heauen, and paines
of hell, and that both be infinite, endles,
and without rebate, but both euer encre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge
and neuer ceaſing, neuer haue eaſe
nor teſt, but euer continue &amp; euerlaſtinge.
To remember then, I ſaye, theſe thinges
may greatly moue you to haue your ſelfe
in a good awayte, and to ſtudie howe you
may auoyd the one, &amp; obteyne the other.
Remember ſpecially howe great a loſſe it
is to looſe heauen, and howe vncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
gaines to winne helle, and howe
ſoone and howe lightlie either of them
may be gotten or loſt. VVhen any thinge
then of aduerſitie, hurt, or diſpleaſure
happen vnto you, thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or imagine,
that if you were in hell, you ſhould haue
<pb facs="tcp:3160:171"/>
the ſame diſpleaſure and manye worſe.
And ſo to auoyde thoſe, you ſhall here the
better ſuffer, and for our Lorde the more
patientlie beare all theſe that nowe be
preſent, or any that may come hereafter.
And in like maner, if any good proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
or pleaſure happen vnto you, thinke
then that if you were in heauen, you
ſhould haue that pleaſure and many m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
excellent ioyes. And ſo for the feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of thoſe ioyes, you ſhall ſet litle by
any worldlie comfort or pleaſure. A good
contemplation therefore may it be vnto
you in feaſtes of holie Saintes, to thinke
and record howe great paines they ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
here for the loue of our Lorde, and
howe ſhort theſe were, and howe ſoone
paſſed: and then againe how marueylous
reward they had therefore in ioye and
bliſſe euerlaſtinge. So the troubles and
tormentes of good perſons be ſoone and
ſhortlie gone and ended, and the ioyes
and pleaſures of ſinful perſons doe ſoone
fade and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e for euer. The good perſons
for their troubles ſuffered here vppon
earth, doe get and win eternall and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
glorie, which the euill perſons doe
loſe. And contrarie, theſe euill and ſinfull
perſons for their ioy and pleaſures here,
do receiue by exchaunge eternall and
euerlaſtinge ſhame &amp; rebuke, with paine
and wo vnſpeakeable. VVhen ſoeuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you be diſpoſed to ſluggiſhneſſe, or to be
<pb facs="tcp:3160:171"/>
drowſie, remiſſe in prayers, or dull in
deuotion, then take this litle worke, or
els ſome other good Treatiſe, and read
therin, and euer note well the contentes
thereof, and what is meant thereby. And
if you be not thereby deliuered or eaſed
thereof, then ſhift vnto ſome other worke
or occupation, ſo that euer you auoyde
ydlenes, and all vaine paſtimes, which in
dede is loſſe of time. And then remember,
that thoſe that nowe bide in paine, either
in hell, or yet in purgatorie, for ſuche ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
ſo paſſed or loſt, had rather then all
the world haue ſuch time to redeme their
paines by, as you maye haue if you will.
Time then vnto al perſons wel occupied,
is verie precious and deare. Beware well
therefore, howe you ſpend it or paſſe it,
for you can neuer reuoke it nor call it
backe. If the time paſſe you by trouble &amp;
vexation, thinke they be happie and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
that be paſt this wretched life, and
nowe in bliſſe, for they ſhall neuer haue
any ſuche miſerie. And when you feele a
comfort or conſolation ſpirituall, thanke.
God thereof, &amp; thinke the damned ſoules
ſhall neuer haue any ſuche pleaſure. And
thus let this be for your exerciſe in the
datiue. At night when you go to reſt, firſt
make accompt with your ſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
howe you haue ſpent or paſſed
the daye and time that was geuen you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
vſed in vertue, and howe you haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
<pb facs="tcp:3160:172"/>
your thoughtes, your wordes, &amp;
your workes. And if you finde no great
thing amiſſe, geue the whole laude and
praiſe vnto our Lorde God. And if you
perceaue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, that you haue miſpent
any part thereof, be ſorie therefore, and
beſeech our Lorde of mercy &amp; forgeuenes,
and promiſe, and verilie purpoſe to make
amendes the next daye. And if you haue
oportunitie thervpon, it ſhall be full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
for you to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed on the next
morow, and ſpecially, if the matter done,
ſaide or thought by deliberate conſent, do
greuouſlie weigh &amp; worke with a grudge
in your conſcience, then woulde I aduiſe
you neuer to eate nor drinke, till ye be
diſcharged thereof, if you maye conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientlie
get a goſtlie father. Nowe for a
concluſion of this worke, put before you,
as by caſe or ymagination two large
Cities, one full of trouble, turmoyle and
miſerie, &amp; let that be hel. The other Citie
ful of ioy, gladnes, comfort and pleaſure,
and let that be heauen. Loke wel on them
both, for in both be many dwellers and
great companye. Then caſt and thinke
within your ſelfe, what thing here might
ſo pleaſe you, that you ſhoulde choſe the
worſe citie, or what thing ſhould diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
you on the other part, whereby you
ſhoulde withdrawe your ſelfe from that
vertue that might conuey and bring you
vnto the other citie. And when you haue
<pb facs="tcp:3160:172"/>
ſatudied well here vpon, and can nothinge
finde, I dare well aſſure you, if you keepe
well the precepts and counſailes of this
litle leſſon, you ſhall find the right way,
for the holie ghoſte will inſtruct &amp; teache
you, where you be not ſufficient of your
ſelues, ſo you indeuor and geue diligence
to beare awaye and folowe that here is
taught. Reade it euerie weake once or
twiſe, or oftener if you will. And where
you profite, geue the thankes, laude, and
prayſe vnto our Lorde God, and moſte
ſweete Sauiour Ieſu Chriſte, who ſende
you his mercie and grace, that alwaye
liueth God worlde without ende. Amen.</p>

out God &amp; maiſter. VVherefore as often
as in reſiſtinge any ty<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptacion thou doeſt
withſtande any of thy ſences or wittes,
thinke vnto what part of Chriſtes paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thou mayeſt applie thy ſelfe or make thy
ſelfe like: As reſiſtinge glotonie, whiles
thou doeſt puniſhe thy taſt or appetite:
remembre that Chriſte receyued in his

beaſte, a drinke moſt vnſauerie and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
            <p>VVhan thou withdraweſt thy hand
from vnlawfull takinge or keepinge of
any thinge, which liketh thine appetite,
remembre Chriſtes handes as they were
faſte nayled vnto the tree of the Croſſe.
And reſiſtinge of pride, thinke on hym,
who beinge verie God almightie, for thy
ſake receyued the fourme of a ſubiecte,
and humbled hym ſelfe vnto the moſte
vile and reprochefull death of the Croſſe.
And whan thou arte te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted with wrath:
Remembre that he, whiche was God,
and of all men the moſt iuſt or righteous,
whan he behelde him ſelfe mocked, ſpitte

wiſe, if thou peruſe all thinges one after
an other, thou mayeſt finde, that there
is no paſſion or trouble, that ſhall not
make the in ſome parte conformable or

            <p>Alſo put not thy truſte in mans helpe,
but in the onelie vertue of Chriſte Ieſu,
which ſayed: Truſt well, for I haue vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
the worlde. And in an other place
he ſayth: The prince of this worlde is
caſte out therof. VVherfore lette vs truſt
by his onelie vertue, to vainquiſhe the
worlde, and to ſubdue the diuell. And
therefore ought we to aſke his helpe by

his bleſſed Sainctes.</p>
            <p>Remembre alſo, that as ſone as thou
haſt vainquiſhed one temptacion, alwaye
an other is to be loked for: The diuell
goeth alwaye about and ſeeketh for hym
whom he would deuoure. VVherefore we
ought to ſerue diligentlie and be euer in
feare, and to ſaye with the prophete: I
will ſtande alwaye at my defence.</p>
            <p>Take heede moreouer, that not onely
thou be not vainquiſhed of the diuell,
that te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteth the, but alſo that thou vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhe

onelie whan thou doeſt no ſinne, but alſo
whan of that thinge wherein he tempted
thee, thou takeſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to doe good.
As if he offreth to the ſome good acte to
be done to the intent that thereby thou

thou thinkynge it, not to be thy deede
or worke, but the benefite or rewarde of

            <p>As often as thou doeſt fight, fight as

            <p>In all temptacions reſiſt the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge,
and beate the Children of Babilon
againſt the ſtone, whiche ſtone is Chriſte,
and the children be euill thoughtes and

<pb facs="tcp:3160:175"/>
of ſinne, ſeldome worketh any medicine
or remedie.</p>
            <p>Remembre, that although in the ſaied
conflict of temptacion the bataile ſemeth
to be verie daungerous: yet conſider how
muche ſweter it is to vainquiſhe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion,
than to folowe ſinne, whereto
ſhe inclineth the, whereof the ende is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce.
And herein many be foule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
whiche compare not the ſwetenes
of victorie to the ſwetenes of ſinne, but
onelye compareth bataile to pleaſure.
Notwithſtandinge a man or woman,
whiche hath a thouſande times knowen
what it is to gyue place to temptacion,
ſhoulde ones aſſaie, what it is to vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhe
temptacion.</p>
            <p>If thou be tempted thinke thou not
therefore that God hath forſaken the, or
that he ſetteth but littell by the, or that
thou arte not in the ſight of God, good
or perfecte: but reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, that after Saint
Paule had ſeene God, as he was in his
diuinitie, and ſuche ſecreate miſteries as
be not lawfull for any man to ſpeake or
reherce, he for all that ſuffred temptacion
of the fleſh, wherewith God ſuffred him
to be tempted, leaſt be ſhoulde be aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with pride. VVherein a man ought to
conſider, that Saint Paule, whiche was
the pure veſſell of election, and rapt into
the thirde heauen, was notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge
in perill to be proude of his vertues, as
<pb facs="tcp:3160:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he ſayth of him ſelfe. VVherfore aboue all

of pride, ſince pride is the rote of
all miſchiefe, againſt the which the onelie
remedie is to thinke alwaye that God
humbled him ſelfe for vs vnto the Croſſe.
And moreouer that death hath ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
