            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16443:3"/>
King, and what is the concluſion, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were neuer more froward, neuer more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, neuer more peruerſe, nor the ſtate of that kingdome, neuer more deſperate then it is at this houre, confuſed as well in the true knowledge appertayning vnto God, as in their duetie and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience belonging to their Prince, where the people are daily ſeduced, infected and peruerted by Ieſuites, Seminaries &amp; other runnagate Prieſts the miniſters of Antichriſt, wherwith the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try doth ſwarme, and haue ſo mightily preuailed, that they haue wrought a generall contempt, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well againſt his Maieſtie himſelfe, as againſt his godly proceedings.</p>
            <p>And theſe be they that haue ſo abuſed and blinded the zeale of many good people, which otherwiſe without all queſtion would bee more confirmable in the knowledge and loue or GOD, and in their obedience and duetie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Prince: but ſo many ſeducing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are planted in all the parts of that Realme, that if there be one that wil ſtand for the King, there is twentie for that one to maintaine the Pope.</p>
            <p>But it will bee ſaid, why theſe are no nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, all this is well enough knowne to bee true, and what may I either doe or ſay in a matter that
<pb facs="tcp:16443:3"/>
ſo many learned men haue already dealt withall? that ſo many wiſe men haue had to doe withall, and ſo many politicke men haue ſo often vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and could neuer performe either meane to redreſſe or amend it. I confeſſe my learning is none at all, &amp; therefore I will not meddle with thoſe matters that are aboue my reach: my wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome I acknowledge no more then my lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and yet I hope it ſhall ſuffice to diſcouer a trueth in this matter that I haue vndertaken: with policie I will not meddle, neither is it for mee to deale wihall: but eſpecially with that policie that belongeth to matters of eſtate I will not ſo much as looke after, yet I would bee glad to put in a helping hand: it is little that I can doe, yet hee doth well that doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>The diuell is not idle, and his Apoſtles doe neither ſlippe time, nor omit occaſion: the Pope beſtirres him with his Bulles, with his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, with his Pardons, with his Prieſts, with his Ieſuites, with his Miniſters of all ſorts and of all profeſſions: that are ſtill conſpiring that are ſtill peruerting, that are ſtill ſeducing in euery corner, in the Country, in the Towne, in the Cittie, perhaps in the Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what, ſhall we not encounter them? (or at the leaſt) ſhall wee
<pb facs="tcp:16443:4"/>
not diſcouer them what they be, to whom they belong, and what they indeauour? But they will ſay, I am no diuine, and it is trueth. I am no ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and that is true too: what am I then? I am a Souldier, a profeſſed ſouldier, better practiſed in my pike then in my penne: and may not a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier indeuour himſelfe for the glorie of his God, for the ſeruice of his King, &amp; for the good of his Country? may not a Soldier vphold that religion either by word or writing, that hee muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and defend with the price of his bloode? is there any man to impugne this? if not, I hope my vnlettered diligence ſhall not be miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, knowing the ſtate and condition of that miſerable &amp; wretched Realme of Ireland, where ſo many good people of all ſorts are ſo cortinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeduced and abuſed by the Popes factors, I haue therefore collected and gathered this little treatiſe, wherein (according to the trueth teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the holy Scriptures) I haue not onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked this broode of the generation of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, but I haue likewiſe ſo pluckt the viſard from the Pope himſelfe, that he might ſo appeare in his owne likeneſſe, that neither his fatherly lookes, nor his counterfeit ſhew of grauitie, nor that holie holie holineſſe where with he hath ſo long diſguiſed himſelfe, ſhall be able to deceiue
<pb facs="tcp:16443:4"/>
any man (bee he neuer ſo ſimple) that will but vouchſafe to reade, and to beleeue but that which is teſtified by the word of the liuing God.</p>
            <p>And here againe it will bee ſaid, that all this hath beene already performed by ſeuerall learned and worthy men: but ſhall wee therefore leaue the field to the foe, becauſe wee haue already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him a conflict? ſhall wee not incounter him to day, to morrowe and euery day, that is continu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally bragging &amp; brauing of vs? that is ſtil aſſailing vs with freſh ſupplies? that is ſtill leuying of new forces to ſet vpon vs? that is ſtill incroching, and neuer giues ouer to ſend his Agents, not by one, or by two, or by tenne, but by hundreds, and by thouſands, and ſhall we not incounter him, but ſuffer him thus to draw away the harts of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iects, from the duetie and obedience they owe to their ſoueraignes, as they haue done and are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſing in Ireland? nay ſhall wee ſuffer him, (without contradiction) to leade ſo many poore ſoules to deſtruction? For although all manner of ſinnes did neuer ſo much abound, as they doe at this preſent, yet, of my conſcience, the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth ſend more ſoules to hell, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is more beholding to the Pope alone, then to all the reſt of thoſe vgly monſters, that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of the ſeuen deadly ſinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16443:5"/>
Lo here a matter of chriſtian re morſe, &amp; ſhall we not now put to our helping hands on al ſides to diſcouer this monſter? ſhall we ſay it is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous matter to reiterate any thing that may lay him open to the viewe of the world, that with his counterfeit ſhew of holyneſſe hath deceiued the whole world, and hath ſent ſo many millions of Chriſtian ſoules to the pit of perdition?</p>
            <p>What I haue indeuored herein (I hope) will neither be thought to be vnneceſſary, nor deemed to bee altogether vnprofitable: yet the rather to countenance both it and me, I haue with all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe preſumed to offer them to your honour, to you whom God hath indued with the ſpirit of his trueth: being ſo much the rather incouraged with hope of a fauourable acceptance, knowing your godly diſpoſition to be ſo zealouſly inclined to the true worſhipping of God.</p>
            <p>If my lines be not anſwerable to your exquiſite iudgement, I doe then tender them to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable curteſie, that was yet neuer knowne to deſpiſe any mans indeuour that was honeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; but if they fall out (as I haue ment them) for the aduancement of Gods glorie, why then they belong to your Honour as your owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per right, whom God hath aduanced for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of his glorie, and hath giuen you both
<pb facs="tcp:16443:5"/>
heauenly wiſedome and worldly honour, that you might continue (as hitherto you haue done) a principal inſtrument for the vpholding of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Pleaſeth it your honour to accept of it, as an office and ſeruice of good intent: and although from a ſouldiers pen, yet as the earneſt peny of a faithfull heart, that hath beene (and is) alwaies conſecrated to do your Lordſhip all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dutiful ſeruice, and ſo in the like dutiful maner will reſt.</p>

            <p>For a murtherer, who hath euer heard of a more cruell and mercileſſe butcher, aſwell againſt the Saints and ſeruants of God whom he perſecuteth with ſword, with fire and with all maner of tortures, wherewith hee tormenteth them to a temporall death, but likewiſe ſendeth infinite thouſands of the miſerable ſoules (that doe aſſie and trust in him) with
<pb facs="tcp:16443:7"/>
his Indulgences, Bulles and pardons, to eternall death &amp; da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>Now for felony, what more notable theft then to rob God of that glory that is proper to himſelfe? and yet not contented with that, but he hathrobbed vs of the holy scriptures left vnto vs by the holy Ghoſt to be our comfort &amp; ſauing health, &amp; wherin we are to ſearch the very myſterie of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Our ſauiour ſent the Scribs and Phariſes to ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures though they were but hypocrites, and ſought dayly to erucify Chriſt, but the Pope forbiddeth Chriſtian men once to looke on them, though they be baptized and haue receiued Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Are the ſcriptures medicynable to the bad, and vehemous to the good? and more perylous to him that will belieue in Chriſt, then to him that will crucify Chriſt?</p>
            <p>They vaunted of their father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and their ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> chayre, as the papiſt doth now of his holy father the Pope, and his ſitting in <hi>Peters</hi> chayre: yet Chriſt pronounced woe againſt them for ſhutting vp the key of knowledge, which was by giuing a falſe ſenſe, by wrong interpreting the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but it is not found that they prohibited or forbad any man to read the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the Pope &amp; his ſhauelings are accuſtomed.</p>
            <p>What I haue iudeuoured herein, I haue done it in compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for if there be any commiſeration to be had of thoſe that walke in darkeneſſe, and ſit in the ſhadowe of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the poore people of Ireland are to be pittied; and not onely they alone, but as many other, what, or wherſoeuer, that are thus ſeduced and blinded by the miniſters of the Prince of darkeneſse.</p>

               <p>And as Chriſt commanded his to be lowly, ſo hee commanded them to all obedience: but the Pope will none of that, but as he ſetteth himſelfe at liberty, and will be tyed to no lawe, neither of God nor man, ſo hee that will obey neither father, mother, neither Lord nor maſter, neither King nor Prince, let him but take the marke of the Beaſt, let him but ſhaue himſelfe a <hi>Monke,</hi> a <hi>Fryer,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or ſome any one of thoſe ſects for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly rehearſed, and the matter is diſpatched, he is exempted from all ſeruice and obedience due vnto man: and the more diſobedient he ſheweth himſelfe vnto the ordinances of God, the more apt and meete he is for the ſeruice of the Pope: neither is the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, vowing, and ſwearing obedience vnto their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, any other thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the denying, defying, and foreſwearing obedience to the ordinances of God.</p>

               <p>The matter is holy <hi>Chriſme,</hi> confect and made of oyle-oliue and balme conſecrated by a Biſhop, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent receipt to ſcoure a ruſty corſlet.</p>
               <p>The forme is, when any one is confirmed, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſaying certaine words, muſt make a croſſe on the forehead of the party, with this inchanted ointment, and then (be it man or woman) they are made as holy, as a paire of old bootes w hen they come new trimmed from the currior: here is now to be noted, what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues doe attribute to this ſacrament, and theſe bee their owne words, <hi>The ſacrament of confirmation is ſaid to be greater then the ſacrament of baptiſme, becauſe it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by worthier perſons, &amp; in the more worthier part of the body.</hi>
