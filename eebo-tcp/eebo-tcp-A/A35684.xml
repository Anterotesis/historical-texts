            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And whence the Source of All This, but that they have laid by, as uselesse, the Reason of Men; and cast off, or forgotten the Religion of Christians. For as their Reason may be sufficiently informed by the Many Experiments in This World of the Instability, and Violence of the same, which may render Notions enough to convince the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; Religion likewise might in the Soundness of it's Principles, and by the strength of it's Superstructures so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by Faith the Certainty of Hope, and Assurance of Future Enjoyment of Celestiall Things, that Our Souls (being as it were transanimated by Divine Contemplation) should not onely despise the Calamities of This World, as Trifles; But rather rejoyce in the Blessing to suffer Crosses, and Afflictions Here, especially to be accounted worthy thereof in A Good Cause; These being Nothing in their Greatest Bulk and Number, compared with the Unspeakable Rejoycings of Hereafter.</p>

               <p>How else can it possibly come to pass, that Any Distresse should so overpower Us, to destroy Our own Lives? As if we had proclaim'd war against Our selues? which even Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Instinct, and it's own secret Impulse doth dictate to preserve. <hi>Cor est primum Vivens et ultimum moriens,</hi> The Heart is readiest to welcome Life at First, and most loath to part with it at Last by the Adhaesion of Nature, which is a Lecture of Self-preservation unto All. How much more are we to listen to, and obey The Divine Law, putting so strict an Obligation upon Us, when It commands, <hi>Thou shalt not Kill?</hi> This considered, I cannot, but stand Amazed at the Steam of so much Humane Bloud, running in streams, and the open Veins dayly bleeding of so many Christians, as is continually shed: But mine Eares do tingle, to hear so many sad Relations, as even since March last concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Severall Persons of diverse Rank, and Quality, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting within and about so Eminent a Citty, as late-fam'd London, that have made away, and Murd'red Themselves.</p>
               <p>It is a Greivous Thing to consider; Especially, if we have a Right Apprehension of God; or a Belief, that there is a Hell.</p>
               <p>Hence arose The Occasion of This Poeme; Wherein The Authour's Christian Compassion moved him rather for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Good to put Pen to Paper, than any Overweening O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of himself, intimately Acquainted with his own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, or any Vain Glory to seek The Presse, to write Something upon so Deplorable a Subject; Lest the Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of such Actions might in time arrogate a Kind of
<pb facs="tcp:57958:5"/>
Legitimation by Custom, or plead Authority from some late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publisht Paradoxes, That Self-homicide was Lawfull.</p>
               <p>It is not deni'd but that the Temptations of Satan are subtle, frequent, and, without God's Grace, almost irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But so Great a Sin as This <hi>(From which Good Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Vs)</hi> is a direct Giving Our selves over to The Divell, and a Denying the Power of Godlinesse; Yea, a Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a desperate Madnesse to throw our selves headlong into Perdition.</p>
               <p>Whence These Horrid Actions more, than heretofore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, let us take a Considerate View. Whether the Last Times be come upon us, so long foretold, that Satan is let loose; Or That The Cup of Our Wickednesse is allmost brim-full; Or that Our Apostasie, and Our other heynous Sins, as it were a Violent Multitude, do rage, and make an Uproare in Our Consciences; Or that the Sacriledg, and Blasphemy, (what shall I say of the Perjury of the Time?) shew not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Removall of The Candlestick, and lay us not open to the Immediate wrath of The Lord, I leave it for Second Thoughts, and poizing Understandings.</p>
               <p>But This sure must needs be apprehended, that such Things comming to pass, are A signe of threatned, if not apparent Derelection, and God Forsaking us, when the Heavens in their Wonders, and Men upon Themselves do Thus declare God's Judgments; And it is to be feared, that Our Hypocrisie, Malice, and Uncharitablenesse, as to raise an Audacious Heap to Heaven, Our Rebellion against God's Ordinances are none of the meanest hastners of These Thunderbolts, being, may I say, the Whetstones of Divine Vengance.</p>
               <p>It were therefore much to be desired, That Every Man did lay his Hand upon his Heart, examine himself diligently, and make inspection, and search into Every Corner of the Same, to find out, and remove, what is Uncleane among Us.
<pb facs="tcp:57958:5"/>
Lest, if not warned by the Gentlenesse of the Lord's prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Punishments we be swallow'd up in the Abysse of our Abhominations, and perish utterly under the Intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weight of his Heavy Displeasure, and Irresistible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming Judgments.</p>
               <p>The Author chose rather the Quicknesse of Verse, than more prolixe Prose (with God's Blessing first implored) to disenchaunt the Possessed; following Divinely-inspired <hi>David's</hi> Example to quiet <hi>Saul</hi> with the Melody of the Harp, who was troubled with such a Spirit, that left him Not, untill his Armour-bearer having refused to obey his dire Commands, saw Him First act His Desperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve upon His Own Sword, and, provoked by His Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made the Like concluding Scene to the Same Tragedy. Dereliction rode Before, Self-Execution poasted After<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Saul</hi> the First Homicide, we read of in Holy Writ <hi>(Cain</hi> onely fear'd to dye.) His Armourbearer His Second; And wise, yea crafty <hi>Achitophel</hi> halter'd his Policy to make a Third. <hi>Saul</hi> possest with a Devill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his Heart, <hi>Achitophel</hi> in his Head. How great a Care is to be had to prevent both.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Hand may be welcome to One, that needs it either in the declivity or steep descent from a Rock; or amidst the Labyrinth, and wandring on to Losse in a Wildernesse.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose, Distressed Friend, the Authour proffers His, as a help. Enough peradventure to Keep thee from Falling; Or Preserve thee in the Way. It may serve thee for a Prop, if not for a Guide.</p>
                  <p>And seeing, that the Best Dayes are Evill to Good Men; and Bad Men make All their Dayes Evill, Time gives Life a sad Progression; And the Vitiosity of Manners makes Time seeme to receive Corruption. Least thou should'st grow weary of Either, Thou art here desired to ponder them Both; Lest abused Life should prove thy Rock; or not well considered Time might become thy Willdernesse.</p>
                  <p>Supposing therefore, that thy Desperate Intentions are diverted, thy Fury allayed, and, that a more sober Temper hath reduced thee to Better Inclinations by his former Verse he conceives it not amisse, as a careful Physitian, to prescribe thee a Diet after his operative Drugs; or not Unlike the wary Pilot, to set up some mark to avoid a second danger.</p>
                  <p>Thou hast been out of thy Way, and in hazard of Great Losse, even Losse forever. Take that Crosse for thy direction; yea let That Crosse, that did afflict thee, lead thee home to thy Happinesse! Not by seeking to run from It; But by Submitting to it. Though the way be rugged; It is direct;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57958:28"/>
And being straight, Turne not. Temptation is on either Hand. Presumption may as dangerously overthrow thee, as Desperation was like to ensnare, to undoe thee. There allures a Spotted Panther; And Here lurkes a Seising Tyger. Both Devourers; Though in divers wayes.</p>
                  <p>To avoid the Perill of such Passages, the sutblety, and Fury of such Beasts, it is Best to take Direction, and One along with thee. With such Intention in Charity unto thee The Authour hath under God's Blessing fitted himself with Provisions, &amp; Instructions for such a journey. Not to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd is ery hurtfull for thee. Dost here him call? Away?</p>

                     <head>PERSPECTIVE I.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. ADen is the Place of Theeves, There Idlenesse is lodg'd, as the greatest waster of time, and theif of Things.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is dark by Ignorance. It is foul by Sloth. Vices and Sins, like Monsters, Exuberances of the minde, do Breed therein, that hisse with Impudence, and howl by too Late Repentance. The hag, the Witch layes along, to shew her Security and Carelesnesse, half asleep, her Improvidence, by stretching, Indisposition to Imployment, and by scowling, Scorn, at Reproof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By Nodding Shee discovers the Vanity of her Desires. By Pointing her Unaptnesse, and imperfection to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. She buries Men Alive; Either running them into Undreamt of Dangers, or covering them with neglected Obscurity, that they (at best) passe their silent Dayes Without leaving any impression by their Footsteps left to worthy Notice, or Memory.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Her Gins are temptations, that catch the Imprudent. With False Glosses, Vaine Pretences, as with covering Leaves Idleness hides her contrived Deceits.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Vain Discourses, and wanton Designes are the spring at the Mouth of her Den, which dance to the Notes of the Birds of Pleasure.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But this way leads to the Fort of Irrevocable losse, And to the Prison of Unavoydable Destruction; In which Men intoxicated with Folly sport on to Ruine.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Drones embleamatize, and hold the Glasse unto The slothfull; they rob the Hives, and prey upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Bees, the Honest mans Goods and Labour.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:57958:29"/>
9. It is no safe going on in Her enthralling Fascinations; Or standing still, Unbusi'd. For Delayes not only breed, but Bring forth Dangers,</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Her stream of pleasures, and gliding waters of Vaine Conceptions stand, settle, and corrupt in A lake of filth the Sinke of Vice and Sin, describing by the noisomness of the Waters their Rottenness; by the poyson of Serpents, their Infection; and by the Ugliness of Toads, their Deformity.</p>

                     <p>IT Was A Friendly Wish, with a smile at the end on't; That the English were as Industrious, as they are Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious. it came from Erasmus; An eminent Man of Wit; And no Dwarf in Iudgement. It is a great abatement in the Coat, if the Lyon be not borne in proper Posture, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any thing of Due Arming. <hi>Ingenii Acumen, vel tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditas praemium, vel poenam, in futuro collocat.</hi> Reward crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Diligent; And Danger, in conspiracy with Losse, surprizeth the Drowzie; And they deliver to Punishment the Sleeper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> had no sooner rouzed the Slugard, and sent him on an Arrant to the Ant, to consider her wayes, and be wise, &amp;c. but he describeth his Next Neighbour, his likeliest Familiar, a Naughty person, a Wicked man, that walks with a froward Mouth; that winks with his Eyes; speaks with his Feet; And teacheth with his Fingers. Frowardnesse is in his Heart; He deviseth Mischeife continually, He soweth Discord. Therefore shall his Calamity come suddainly; Suddainly shall he be broken; without Remedy.</p>
                     <p>And not far off from him dwells The Bewitching Whore with Her Allurements. But how? and whither does shee lead her Paramour, her Gallant? He goeth After her straight way, as an Oxe goeth to the slaughter; Or, as a Foole to the Correction of the stocks: Till a dart strike through his Liver, as A Bird hasteth to the Snare, and Knoweth not, that it is For his Life <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Her house is the way to Hell, going downe to the Chambers of Death.</p>

                     <p>Idleness can find No Bellowes to blow the Fire; and will nor so much as use her Own Breath. This is the cover'd Pit, that swallowes the Heedlesse. while time is wasted in the Embraces of Seeming Goods. For want of Diligence, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition Imprudent men do miss of what is reall.</p>
                     <p>While David was in Action, though Persued by Saul for his Life, he slipt not; But, when in the pleasance of the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, coming from the Softness of his Bed, when he takes a Loose turn upon the Roof of his pallace, He is strook in the Eye with the darting Beauty of Bethsheba; And it must seeke for cure the bloud of Uriah. The First Evill begets a Second of a bigger Stature; Illegitimate Voluptuousness brings forth monstrous Cruelty. How dangerous it is to set One Foot upon The First step of Sin! the other is ready to slip, if not to run down the Stairs No sooner in Idlenesse, but in Lust. Lust hurries into Adultery. Adultery sends post to Bloudshed; and sometimes engages in such a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as is past repairing, and beyond returning.</p>
                     <p>Beware, then thou distressed Soul! Least Satan finde thee either void of buisiness, or ill imploy'd. He will beset thee with a multitude of temptations, and give thee a Desperate Onset; And, without Grace help thee by a Prayer, thou lay'st open to the Storm, and 'tis not easy to hold out. Keep therfore thy Watchmen on the Tower! Set a Gaurd upon every Port! Be Allwayes Training, and Mustering thy Forces! When he makes his Subtilest Approches, put good

Actions to work! So maist thou countermine him. Feed The Hungry! So thou diggest a crosse-Vault to his Workes. Cloath the Naked! And it is a Retrenchment. Visit the Sick! And thou hast made good, where the Wall is weakest. Frequent Religious Company! And thou hast doubled thy Guards. Pray! And thou Victuallest the Place. Read the Scriptures! Thou want'st no Ammunition; And thou hast the never-failing Waters of Life.</p>
                     <p>By Such continuall Exercise the Divell will be disheartned, will but weakely attempt thee, Till by every Assault thou shalt grow the Stronger; and by many Combats becom A Conquerer. Vessels, that are full, are not capable of any other Liquor; And the Well-busied minde is not at leisure to undertake a bad Imployment.</p>
                     <p>Besides the Wast of Time, that is so pretious <hi>(momentum est punctum eternitatis)</hi> thy prodigall Idleness spends thee, consumes thee in weariness. The Hours seem asleep, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to thee, like the Hand of the Dial, they move not, as it were, at all; When Labour would refresh thee, and Season thy Rest with Sweetnes.</p>
                     <p>Fly from her therfore, as from a Pest. The Plague is not so infectious. Untilled Land produceth Thorns, and is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with Briars. Evill thoughts are the want of Culture of the Mind; The word imployes Worship; Want of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God produceth as Evill words, the Thorns of the Tongue, So it overruns with wicked Actions, those Briars of the Hands, and Feet.</p>
                     <p>Sow in thy Heart Holy, and devout Meditations! And thy Hands will beare comfortable Fruit. Then art thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Alone, nor Out of Safety. Lye not Lazilie, as bedrid in health! Least thou get a Sicknesse.</p>

                     <head>MORAL. II.</head>
                     <p>DIvine Grace calls us from our wandrings amidst greatest Dangers by Recollection and the Remembrance of Evils committed by us; whereby having the Sight our selves, and seeking by Repentance to the Rock of our Faith, we finde Christ to heal us, who is the Well of Life, and the Fountain of our Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Hugo</hi>'s Interpretation to this Purpose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Poenitentia appellata quasi Punientia, eò quod ipse homo in se poenitendo punit, quod male admisit. Tria enim quae sunt in percussione Pectoris</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Pectus, Sonus, &amp; Manus, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant quod Poenitentia est de his, quae Mente, Voce, Opere pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavimus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Repentance is (not to refuse the word) a Pennance upon, or punishing of our selves in such a manner, that there is a Reluctancie and serious Sorrow in the whole Man, that he is provoked by such Resentment to punish in himself, what Sin soever he hath foolishly admitted, or wickedly committted. Now there are three things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to a stroak on the Breast; the Breast, the Sound of the Blow, and the Hand, all which denote, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is concerning all Offences of Thought, Word, or Deed. So comes Contrition from within, Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of our Mouthes; and Satisfaction from our Hands to make up a real Repentance.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Poenitentia est Medicamentum vulneris, Spes salutis, per quam Deus ad Misericordiam provocatur, quae non tempor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Repentance is the Balsam for a Wound, the Hope of Health, whereby God is provoked to Mercie; which is not regarded for the length of Time, but the Depth of Sorrow, and the Seriousnesse of Tears spent in it. Therefore it is not the Moneths, or Seasons of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that prevail so much with Him, as that infliction upon our selves, that mortifies the Flesh, and that Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction within our selves, that cruciates the Spirit.</p>

                     <p>O Repentance! How shall I finde tearms, or Language enough to commend thee! Thou dost set free all things that are bound; Thou openest all things that are shut, and revealest all things that are hid; Thou allayest all things that come crosse; Thou bindest up and healest all things that are broken; Thou lettest in Light to all things out of Order; And thou givest New Life, and as it were another Soul, to All things gasping in Death, and Desperate.</p>

But, art thou asham'd to repent? The shame lies in the Commission of the Sin; Not in the Acknowledgement. <hi>Seneca</hi> Controverting the matter, brings in such a Criminall Modestie. <hi>Gravius punior nunc, cum peccasse pudet, quam cum peccavi:</hi> Ti's more Irksome to unload, than to bear my Burthen.

How canst thou come near Pardon, when thou block'st up Confession? When that is the way to It. As Christ, and the Sanctified Intellectuall nature of Man, His Church, are Relative, as Bridegroom and Spouse, Sin likewise makes a Contract with the Wicked man's Soul: But ti's A Dower with a Mischief. The wages of Sin is Death.</p>
                     <p>Thou Distressed Christian! since it hath been so with thee, that such an unlawfull Marriage hath lept into the Saddle; Let Repentance ride upon the Crouper! Better is a Cramp in thy Jawes, than a Convulsion in thy Bowels; than a Stich at the heart. Repent!</p>
                     <p>Thou Know'st the nature of thy Sin best. It is thy Dear Acquaintance; thy Familiar; thy bosome-Friend. But trust it not! It has betray'd thee; And will undo thee.

One word makes good thy Battel; Repentance. If the word be not given; Or not Rightly; And in time too; Thou maist, nay thou wilt lose the day by't. Custome hath taught Nations, Reason Men; and Nature Beasts, that self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence is more, than Lawfull; It is Necessary. Stand to thine Armes then! Betake thee to thy Tears!

                     <p>When Homer that blind Seer among the Auncients. (For Poets were their Prophets then) discourses of a Certain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom he names <hi>Ate,</hi> he sets forth her Character, as a Dittie to this tune; That shee was Hurtfull, and Pernicious to All the Race of men. He might mean <hi>Eve</hi> by it, as well as cover another truth under a like Fable in that of Jupiter, whom he feigns to have been the wisest of all men living. Yet was Once deceiv'd by <hi>Iuno,</hi> by his wife. Thereby He might in the dark point at <hi>Adam;</hi> And in A Heathen Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage speak good Hebrew sense.</p>
                     <p>Thou maist not rightly understand his story; And maist mistake the text also. <hi>Adam</hi> left thee much in debt; in such a condition, as to part with All, that thou hadst; and to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son too was the sentence; thou wert subiect to everlasting condemnation (had not one stood in the Gap) thou wert within the Penall statute of eternall Losse, and never-dying torment. It was in vain for the man to put it upon the woman. It was no proper excuse. It was his own sin. It was his own Fault; And he and his must pay the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture.</p>
                     <p>This Debt thy Saviour undertook, as Sponsor, when He should be Incarnate; performed it Actually in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, what <hi>Adam</hi> should have performed in Paradise; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered, and vanquisht, as his Active obedience; and satisfied on the Crosse for the Guilt, that <hi>Adam</hi> contracted by Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance, satisfying the Justice of the Father by his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,

                     <p>This Score was by Him washed out in thy Baptisme. But thine Actuall transgressions, though they be cast from that Serpent, are Egges of thine own hatching. Thou woud'st lay these Bastards to thy First Parents now too. Thou woud'st have thy Excuse the Son of theirs. No. As <hi>Nathan</hi> said to <hi>David</hi> (with reverence) may I say to thee, to my self, to any grievous Sinner, thou art the man. Thou art the <hi>Reus laesae Majestatis.</hi> Thou the Traitor against God, &amp; thine own Soul. <hi>Perditio tua ex te,</hi> O Israel! Out of thine own Bed the weeds come. Thou art the unprofitable Servant; the idle Gardiner, the Garden also of wickednesse. Thou art thine owne <hi>Ate.</hi> None more malitious, than thou to thy self. Thou, that reall <hi>Pandora,</hi> that open'st the Forbidden Box; That scatt'rest within thy self, and poudrest thine own head with all Evills. Christ upon thy Resentment and desires is ready to make Intercession for these also, for these thine Enormous Sins; but, as <hi>Elisha</hi> did the Cure to <hi>Naaman</hi> in such another Leprosie, He must wash at his appointed waters, at Jordan, where thy Saviour bath'd for thy sin, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise shall be Cleansed, but his way, and upon such Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Repent; and Believe!</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was sent upon that Embassage mainly, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the Doctrine of Repentance. No Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> no Christ. No Repentance, no Salvation. If thou beest not baptized in water with the Baptisme, of Repentance, of the Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins, thou hast no part in the Baptisme of Fire, the purification, and purgation of Sins with the Holy Ghost. No Regeneration, no Resurrection, no Glorification.</p>
                     <p>Take then S. <hi>Iohn's</hi> Advice! He preaches to thee. Now the Ax is laid to the root of the Trees. Every tree therefore, that bringeth not forth good Fruit shall be hewed down,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57958:38"/>
and cast into the Fire. To Day, sings the Psalmist, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as in the day of temptation in the wildernesse. It is an Invitatory Song; Repent.</p>
                     <p>What else can'st thou, ought'st thou do, Fellow Christian? whither else woud'st thou turn thee? Turn thee! Look upon thy self, as <hi>Ieremie</hi> on the Jewes! <hi>How doth the City sit so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, that was full of People!</hi> (full of Graces, which thy Sins have sent into Exile) <hi>How is shee become like a widdow! How is shee become Tributary! shee weepeth sore in the Night, and her teares are on her Cheeks; Among All Her Lovers shee hath none to comfort Her; All Her Friends have dealt treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously with her, they have become her Enemies &amp;c. Her Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries are the chief, her Enemies prosper. For the Lord hath afflicted her; for the multitude of her transgressions her children are gone into Captivity before the Enemy. And from the Daughter of Zion all her Beauty is departed; Her Princes are become like Harts, that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer, &amp;c. Her filthiness is in her Skirts; Shee remembreth not her last end. Therefore shee came down wonderfully; She had no comforter, &amp;c. The Adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things. For she hath seen, that the Heathen entred into her Sanctuary, whom thou didst command, that they should not enter into thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi>

For these things let thine Eye run down with water: Because the comforter, that should relieve thy Soul is far from thee.

                     <p>TRibulations surprise the Improvident, as Armed Men starting out of an Ambuscado. They are overcome, before they think on't. The Foolish scorn, and The Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate throw away their Arms. So will not an experienc't Souldier hazard. He will not move, before his Scouts come in. He will not go unprovided. He is acquainted with Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. He Knows their Subtleties as well, as their Malice. Thé wise Travailer will not cast off his Cloak for Every Sunshine. He expecteth foul weather. A calm Sea cozens not the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Eye. He stands prepared for, though unseen, yet not unlookt for, Storms. Expect Tribulation!</p>
                     <p>Life; and Death appear to Men masked; and have false Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (So goes the Story) Life, which is so ill-favoured, hath the Fair, hath the Beautiful Mask, which makes her of Most to be so Beloved. Sometimes Passion pulls it off; and Then men are frighted with the Uglinesse of her Look. Death, which is Fair, hath the gastly Vizard, which makes her by Most to be so Feared, and hated. But when That Mask doth slip, her Beauty appearing, She is much Affected, Sweetly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57958:44"/>
Welcomed, and Joyfully Entertained. Life indeed has many Spots, and Warts in her Face, and no few wrinckles in her Forehead; Her Eyes look much asquint; And her Cheeks are all furrowed. She is Fair in Prosperitie's Eye only; In Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie's; whose Brain is intoxicated. She seems to have a sharp Tongue; to speak too much, to talk too long to Those that are in Misery. But Her Counsel is wholsomest, when it is in the tritest, and plainest Language; And wise men do well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it. She has ever Sweat on her Brow, brawny Hands, and often a Thorn in her Foot. A Coach gives her the Gout; And a Feast puts her into a Feaver. She is healthfullest at Lowest Pension. Nature is content with a Little. Desire is Satisfied with Nothing. Affliction seems to rob, or take from Death, what's her Due; Paying some of her Hours to Death for A Quit-Rent; And stands Out to maintain Death's Title. <hi>Mille modis morimur</hi> is One of Her Cases; And She has Books enough for't; And wants not many an Experienc't Lawyer to become her Pleader; Though Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sues <hi>In forma Pauperis.</hi> Death seemeth therefore to be Her Friend; But yet is somewhat Lordly. For Death will hardly be intreated to visit Affliction; though much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited.</p>

Read This, as An Epitaph upon the Living, who are dayly buried in a world of Sorrows! But dig not thine Own Grave with Anxietie; Nor do a Certain Mischief to avoid a Seeming Inconvenience! Heap not Affliction upon Affliction! lest the Burthen become too heavie. Tye not more knots upon the Scourge! <hi>Quid misero miserius non miserante Seipso?</hi> who shall have pitty upon Thee, if Thou beest Cruel to Thy Self? It is not thy Case Alone. For Every Man has his Pressure as well, as Thou; And Some far Greater. What art Thou, that hast not deserv'd a Punishment? Hast chang'd Thy Voice to Groans? Be Patient! Thine owne Unquietnesse rather, than The Weight, thou carri'st wrings thy Shoulders.</p>
                     <p>Examine the True Nature of what it is, afflicts thee! Thou maist think That a Monster, which is but a Shadow. Is it a Devil? Or a Bugbear? Bring it to the Test of thine Understanding! Use All good means to quiet and still The Hubub in thy Bosom!</p>
                     <p>If thou canst carry Thy Burthen no further; Go to thy Friend! thy Priest! thy Pastor! thy Physitian! Open it to Him! He will carry Part of it for Thee; Or direct thee, that thou maist find Ease.</p>
                     <p>But by All means avoid All Occasions of aggravating Thy Misery. For Thy Present Grief will goe out of It Self if Thou add'st not Fuell to it.</p>
                     <p>If thou wilt needs see thy Afflictions in a Glasse, let it not be a Multiplying, or a Magnifying Glasse, that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present Them More, or More Horrid!</p>
                     <p>Give as little Freedom to Thy Passions, as thou can'st! For Those Wild Horses will run Suddenly away with The Whole Man.</p>

If Thy Friend give Counsel, listen to it! It is as precious as Balsam. Comfort to One despairing is, as Cordials to The Dying. Refuse it not! Nor The Means to have it. A wise word in Time may Save Thy Goods; Thy Body; Yea thy Soul from Eternal Losse. The Sick have need of the Physitian.</p>
                     <p>Be not Obstinate against kind persuasion! For That is, as if thou didst sow up thy Mouth, when thou hast an empty stomack. Repentance, and that oft too late too, payes home the Denyal of good Offers.</p>
                     <p>In any Case have a Care, that thou rely'st not too much upon Thine Own Judgment!</p>
                     <p>Have a Care of Solitude, if thy Thoughts be not good enough to keep thee Company!</p>
                     <p>Keep not That Secret, that will, like Joab stab thee with An Embrace in the Dark. Why should'st Thou be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Second against Thy Self?</p>

Therefore hath it pleased the Almighty Maker of All to place near the Eyes two Christal Streams in the Head to allay the Flames of a Martyr'd Heart; which doth often evaporate it self at the Diamond Casements of the Sight.

Does He command thee crosse to thy will? Thou answer'st him by thy Obedience, or Perversenes. Does He open the Door of thy Knowledge, by Revealing Some things, and Shutting it up Close in Others? Thou answear'st Him by thy Humility, or Curiosity. All, that He does, is for Thy Good: But He will Not doe it Thy way. Thou art His Creature. Thou must be guided by Him. Heaven is the Place of Joy; And Thine in Designe: But Thou must not goe Laughing Thither.</p>

                     <p>The Bearing of Afflictions are the means, the Examples, that like Trumpets proclaim and manifest the Faith, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which God hath bestowed upon His Children; that strengthen, that enliven, that give courage to those, which have not received so great a measure of Faith.</p>
                     <p>By Afflictions He makes thee conformable to the Image of Christ. He being the Captain of our Salvation was made perfect through Sufferings. So fight! So overcome! So re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive A Crown!</p>

                     <p>What is it then, that so much troubles thee, that thou art weary of thy Life? Mark! How God hath blessed thee; How He hath protected thee; And that should put a Hymn into thy mouth; and fetch Bloud in thy Cheeks. Thy Fear made thee seem more wretched, than thou art. Thou didst not know the Honey, that is within the Carkasse of the Lyon. Bath in the brinish Sea! It will heal thy Soares. It will cure thine Itch. Though It smarts; It is wholsome. <hi>Through many Tribulations you shall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi>

                     <head>CONSOLATORY ESSAY. V.</head>
                     <p>WHoso wu'd raise A strong, or stately Fabrick, having first chosen fit and Firme Ground, with proper and good Materials, let him lay a deep, a broad, a square, and tis a sure foundation. The loftiest Trees have the most spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have the lowest Roots. Riches inhabite in the humble Vallies, when Barrenness overspreads the highest Mountains. On their ambitious Tops stormes run their furious Courses, While Quiet sits below and spends her Sands in Safety. Envy still neighbours Greatness; and busies her self in contriving for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ambition Dangers; and with displeasure looking Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mindes not Inferiour Being. She casts her Eye asquint, not downward. And Pride does swell to bursting. Sin is it's own Punisher. The inconsiderate Boateswain, that doth rigge the Vessel with too bigge Sail, does prompt the Winds to burry her beneath the Waters; And want of Ballase makes the Ship a Prey to every wave. No man can arrive at True Honour, but by its proper steps, whose first, the Lowest, is Humility; For want whereof many making too Imprudent Leapes, or too hasty Progress, have either tumbled, or faln backward.</p>
                     <p>So vaine is humane Folly, to build in the Aire Imaginary Castles, and to neglect the Lower, and securer way to the Real, and more Substantial Foundation. What Griefs have they occasioned to Themselves! What Sorrows have they fashioned for their own wearing! What Miseries have they compil'd for their Own Habitations! Winds do stretch the Belly, and Dropsie makes the Body swell; when emptier Girdles, when leaner, and looser skins neither want Health, nor need the Physitian.</p>
                     <p>Men that do not know the Value of so Rich a Jewel, are
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57958:61"/>
very Ignorant of their unhappy, and so bad condition by their being strangers to so excellent a Vertue. Humility prevents or tempers the greatest Mischiefs. <hi>Abigals</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sal ve sav'd the Churle, her Husband. Her meek Address to <hi>David</hi> was not only a putting by the Intended, and resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Destruction of what belong'd to <hi>Nabal,</hi> but was the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of her Promotion to a High Degree of Honour, even to <hi>David's</hi> Royal, and his Lawful Bed.</p>
                     <p>The saying of <hi>Agathocles</hi> deserves the memory; who though the son of a Potter, being raised as high as the Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Crown, and sitting among his Friends at Table, where, by his own Order, Earthen vessels were usually placed among his Cups of Gold, of Himself gave them an humble Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, not without Incouragement to the like Vertue by this Expression: Behold, what it is to persevere in travel, and in taking pains to become Vertuous, and couragious! Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore we made these Pots of Earth; These now do we make of Gold.</p>
                     <p>Sit thee down then Thou, that art so much perplexed! Calme thy disturbed Heart, thou living Earthquake! Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it is, that hath put thy mind in a Feaver! And thee into the greatest of All Dangers; To that of Casting away thy wretched Self! Or to the thought of so abominable a Mischief! Thou didst not rightly apprehend, what thou wert. Thou wert besides thy self. So was <hi>Lucifer</hi> (though in another Nature) as in the Opinion of some, admiring in his own Glass the Excellency of his perfection, and falling wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly inamour'd of Himself, as a Deitie, was puft up with that Pride, that lost him Heaven, and cost him Hell for it.</p>
                     <p>It is the Idolatry of thine own Heart, that raises thy storme. Thou worship'st thine own Imaginations; Those are thine Images; of thine own carving. Thine own Desires are thy Dagons. Thy pride must have it's Will; though it cost thee Dear; though it cost thee a Fall for't. Thy Heart is too big
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57958:61"/>
to buckle; to high too Submit to the Almighty. Thou wu't have a Husband. Thou wu't keep Friends. Thou wu't not part with Children. Thou must enjoy thy Paramour. Thou wu't lose Nothing; Nor Limbe, nor Liberty. And all this thou wou't do, whether God will or no. Art thou humble? Art thou under God? No, Far otherwise. Thou seem'st to be Above Him. Humility submits to Gods Blessed Will; to the fit-seeing, and wonderful Wisdome of His Dispose; And is not without a Blessing; <hi>Blessed are the Poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> They have made entry; They have taken possestion of Heaven already.</p>
                     <p>Art thou poor (Humility makes thee to be accepted. Art thou Rich? It sets thee off with the greater Lustre. Art thou among thine enemies? It dulles the Edge of their Malice. When if thou beest too arrogant, thou raisest a Cloud in the Brow of thy neerest Friends. Humility takes delight in good offices. For a good word, for a good Deed she seeketh op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. O how gracious is Humility in friendship! How backward in reproaches to Enmity! She is not clothed with Prosperity, nor dejected in Adversity. She expects not Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's service, nor desires that aflatterer should send his tongue to travel about her business. She alwaies makes the worst of her own performances. Yet when she seemeth most to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press her own worth, it riseth out of the meek Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her own Unworthiness; Read then her Lesson! Though the Book be small, and the Letter little; There is much wisdom contained in it. Practice it!</p>
                     <p>Digg the Foundation of humility deep in thy Heart, and thou shalt find the staires of Charity! Yet if thy Ambition must Climbe to the height, where God is, to Heaven, take Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by Christ, thy Saviour. He descended, he came down first, he humbled himself to the Womb, to the World, to the the Cross, to the Grave, before He rose, before he ascended, and went up unto His Father, to sit at His Right Hand. He
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57958:62"/>
was humble, He was Meek. Thou must walke in His Path, thou must tread in his steps, if thou intendest to go His Journey.</p>
                     <p>Hast thou many Crosses? Art thou environed with troubles? Is thy Cup full of Bitterness? Can'st thou look no where, but the Devourer is at hand? Be not discouraged! God is then neerest thee. All this is for thy Humiliation. And humiliation is thy Directer to humility. Mark that hand of God, that is upon thee! It has a Finger, that points out to thee the way to himself. Be humble! If thou desirest to be Great in Gods Eyes, be little in thine own. As therefore thou lov'st thine own Advancement, be Humble.</p>

When the Israelites came out of Egypt, it was not a House, but a Tabernacle which <hi>Moses</hi> was commanded to build for the Place of such publick Adoration. But in Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Times, when they were setled in the promised Land, <hi>Solomon</hi> was commanded to build a Temple. And these two shadowed the Difference between the Jewes Synagogue, and the Christian Church. The Tabernacle was moveable, and but for a Time; The Temple fixed and permanent. The State of the Jewes vanishing, to continue in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: The State of the Christians durable, to last unto the End of the World. But more principally it shadoweth forth the State of the Church Militant here upon Earth, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in Heaven. Unto both the Prophet <hi>David</hi> alludeth: <hi>Lord! Who shall sojourn in thy Holy Tabernacle? Who shall rest in Thine Holy Mountain:</hi> Psal. 15. 1.</p>
                     <p>The Temple at Jerusalem was thrice built. First by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> after a glorious manner: when the Riches of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels were of Gold. The Second Structure was by <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> But came far short of That, even causing Tears from those, that considered the Statelinesse of the First. And very Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour it was to that, In respect of the Building: It was low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57958:63"/>
and meaner, Of the Vessels; Those were of Gold, These of Brasse. Five things were lost, and wanting in The Second Temple; All which were in the First. 1. The Ark of God. 2. Urim, and Thummim; God gave no Answer by These, as in Former Times. 3. Fire; which in The Second Temple never descended from Heaven to consume their burnt Sacrifices, as it did in the First, 4. The Glory of God appearing between the Cherubims, which they termed <hi>Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>china,</hi> The Habitation, or Dwelling of God 5. The Holy Ghost, to inable Them for The Gift of Prophefie. <hi>Henod</hi> built the Third, the Last, And that same was of a Statelier Kind of Building, than that of <hi>Solomon.</hi> And of greater Glory. For Christ Preached therein. Though the Jewes had many Oratories, or Places for Prayer, caled <hi>Proseuchae;</hi> which, how they differed from their Schools or Synagogues is not here materiall, yet Our Blessed Saviour fixeth only, on and appropriates to the Temple above any other Place, the Use of Prayer. So did he manifest, when he threw out The Merchants, and Money changers from the same with this Expression: <hi>My House is called The House of Prayer: But ye have made it a Den of Theeves.</hi> A very Sad, and uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Change.</p>
                     <p>But, though the Guide pointeth at all these before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; yet here he aymeth more especially at a Description of the Worship it Self, the Operation, and Efficacy of Prayer.</p>
                     <p>As a House is a place for constant Residence and usuall Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; Prayer likewise is the Christians Best Receptacle; In which he may converse with God continually. Not that he should do nothing else: But that he should do nothing of moment without it. Not that much babling is of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with the Wisdom of God, but that we should often renew our Selves by frequent Seeking His Favour in such Manner, Form, and Language, as He hath directed, and in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57958:64"/>
such Brevity, as is Suitable to the Weakenesse of Our frail Natures. <hi>Non quam multum, Sed quam bene.</hi> It is not the How Much, but the How Well, that is pleasing unto Him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firme Resolution's Camp to gain &amp;c.]</hi> If we think to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Christian Resolution, we must put away Hypocrisie out of our Hearts, and Falshood out of our Understandings. We must entertain Truth, and keep Close to Devotion; And then the Lord graciously will be pleased both to inable us with A will to resolve, and with a Power to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prayers blest Chappel visit]</hi> Accustom thy self to thy hours of Devotion, as well as be mindeful to pray at all Times convenient. <hi>Pray in Season, and out of Season. Deus in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutorium meum intende! Domine ad adjuvandum, &amp;c.</hi> as it is Psal. 70. <hi>O God haste Thee to deliver me! Make haste to Help me, O Lord!</hi> Whereupon <hi>Cassiodore</hi> expoundeth the usefull and very comfortable meaning. <hi>Hujus versiculi oratio in adversis, ut eruamur, in prosperis ut servemur, ne extolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, incessabili iugitate fundenda est.</hi> The Prayer that is narrowly contained in this short Verse is continually to be powred forth, without ceasing or wearinesse, as well in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, least we be Swallowed up with Sorrowes, or overthrown with difficulty, as in prosperity, that we may be preserved from being puffed up therewith, and too much exalted. <hi>Huius ergo versiculi meditatio in tuo pectore indirupta volva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Hunc in opere quolibet ministerio, sive in intinere constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus decantare non desinas. Hunc et dormiens, et reficiens, et in ultimis naturae necessitatibus meditare.</hi> Let therefore the meditation of this Versicle lay undisturbed in thy Brest, and be ready at every Call of thy Heart. Cease not the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Musick hereof in thy Lips, when thou goest about any businesse, undertakest any thing, Use it to refresh thee when thou doest travell, or takest a Journey. Even when thou Sleepest, when thou eatest, at bed, at board, wheresoever thou art, whatsoever thou doest, in the lowest necessity of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57958:64"/>
nature, in the greatest extremities and difficulties of this Life meditate Hereon continually!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So Thy Passe obtain]</hi> Is our proceeding in holy exercises by Gods Grace and Assistance, without which we have no strength to resolve any thing that is good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>But at Faiths Mount it must be sign'd]</hi> Gods Grace worketh effectually in us, when by Faith in Christ we are sealed to the Day of Redemption.</p>
                     <p>It is called Faiths Mount, Because it is placed on High, upon the Rock Christ, who is the sure and blessed Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Salvation. <hi>Fides Electorum aut nunquam deficit, aut statim reparatur.</hi> The Passe to Resolution for Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Christian Duties is ascertain'd to Gods Children by Faith in Christ; For that Faith it self either never fails them, or is ever repaired in them. What Beauty, what Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue does not alwayes appear in the Blossom of the Tree, doth lye hidden in the Root. <hi>Quid est Fides? nisi credere quod non vides?</hi> What is Faith, but the Belief of that, which thou doest not see?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Where Hope, where Charity, &amp;c.]</hi> These do alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a true and sincere Faith. There can be no steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Faith, without an Assurance by Hope; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can subsist without Charity, which is the Perfection of All. Faith is the Sap in the Root. Hope is the Life of the Tree in the Blossom. And Charitie the Strength of its Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the Fruit. <hi>Fides credit, Spes &amp; Charitas orant; Sed sine Fide esse non possunt; Et per haec Fides orat:</hi> It is S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines,</hi> Faith Believes; Hope and Charitie Pray. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith, Hope and Charity cannot be. And by Hope and Charity, Faith does also pray.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That is so kind,</hi> &amp;c.] Charitie is an Excellent Mother, and a most tender Nurse. How does she foster the Poor, and cherish the Infirm! How does she feed the Hungry, and Cloath the Naked! How does she Refresh the weary, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57958:65"/>
Cure the Wounded! How does she Exercise those that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance unto her! How does she sweetly vanquish unquiet Spirits! What several Gifts she bestows of divers Kindes! She maketh much of every one, as if he were her own Child, her next Heir. Dost thou dispute with her? She is all Mildeness. Dost thou contend with her? She is a close Embrace. Dost thou flatter her? Her Innocence doth not understand thee. If she be in passion, 'tis in Love. Shee stroaks the Sore, but pains it not; Patience is her Anger; and she shews he greatest indignation in Humility. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas hominum mater est &amp; Angelorum,</hi> Charity is the Mother of Men and Angels, if we may believe S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> And he gives this Reason. <hi>Non solum quae in terris, sed etiam, quae in coelo sunt pacificavit. Ipsa est, que Deum homini placavit, &amp; hominem Deo reconciliavit.</hi> She is not onely a Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker among those on Earth, but the means of Atonement with those in Heaven. Yea, she that hath appeased Gods wrath to Man, hath not left unfinish't so happy a work, till she hath reconciled Man unto God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Her Lovely Sisters]</hi> For the Beauty and graciousnesse of their Vertues. If then the Beauty of Body amongst Men be so much sought unto, and so much admired; how much more is the Beauty of the Soul to be looked after, praised, loved, and highly to be desired?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>By Fastings many hollow Pits]</hi> signifying emptying of the Body of superfluous Humor, and the taming of the Flesh. The Pits are the Vessels of the Body, as the Stomack and the Rest, which are the Sinks of Riot, and the Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Exorbitancies; wherein the Mind lyeth bemired, and is in a maner oftentimes drownd. These are emptied by fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Soul returnes to her self again by Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou goest]</hi> Fasting is an excellent Preparation to Prayer. Thou must go by Fasting if thou intendst to come alone, or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57958:65"/>
in that proper Dress thou shouldst. Thou shalt else have too many Sins that lay in the Beds of thy Flesh to bear thee company: and thou wilt be so puff't up, as Prayer will scarce know thee. Thou wilt be infected with the drowzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy Sins, that thou wilt talk in thy sleep, rather then Pray, at least not as thou oughtest. The great, best, general, and onely Fasting, is the abstinence from all iniquities, and unlawfull pleasures of this world. This indeed is Fasting in her Beauty. <hi>Si gula peccavit sola jejunet</hi> (saith S. <hi>Bernard) &amp; sufficit.</hi> If thy throat hath onely offended, put the Fast upon thy throat in a moderate manner, it is a remedy. <hi>Si verò peccaverunt &amp; membra caetera, cur non jejunent &amp; ipsa?</hi> But if the rest of thy Members be <hi>participes criminis,</hi> joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenders, Why should they go Scot-free. <hi>Iejunet igitur oculos à curiosis aspectibus, &amp; omni petulantia, ut benè hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliatus coërceatur in poenitentiâ, qui malè liber, vagaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in culpâ.</hi> Let thine eye therefore Fast from curious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, from Lascivious looks, from loose Wantonness, that when it is so restrained, so humbled as it should be, and it may be employed in Repentance as becometh it. Take the Forfeiture of Liberty, that made use of it to no better purpose, than to play the Runnagate, <hi>Iejunet Auris, nequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pruriens, à Fabulis, &amp; Rumoribus, &amp; quaecunque otiosa sunt, &amp; ad salutem minimè pertinentia.</hi> Let thine Ear keep a Fast. It is troubled with an Itching. Let it therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from listning after Tales; New and Vain Reports, and whatsoever arises from Unreasonable desire, and idle appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and all those things as neither bring quiet, nor yield comfort to the minde. <hi>Iejunet lingua in detractione &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muratione ab inutilibus, &amp; variis, atque scurrilibus verbis; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdum quoque, ob gravitatem silentii, ab ipsis quae videri po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terant necessaria.</hi> Let the Tongue Fast also from Detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and murmuring; from Unprofitable Discourse, from many Words, from a Scurril and Scoffing kind of speaking.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57958:66"/>
Let it abstain sometimes for the comeliness, and gravity of silence, even from the mention of those things, that may plead a priviledge, and seem to argue that to speak is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. <hi>Iejunent manus ab otiosis signis, &amp; ab operibus omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, quaec unque non sunt imperata, sed &amp; multò magis anima ipsa jejunet a vitiis, &amp; propriâ voluntate suà.</hi> Let thy Hands keep a Fast from inadvised Actions, that like Seals leave the Prints of their Folly behind them; from all such Works, for which thou hast not Commission, and from all such Deeds, as are against Command. But above all have a care that thy soul break not the Fast from Sin, and those Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are nearest a kin to thine own will, and are most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to thine own inclination.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>With Studie Lean she smiling sits]</hi> Her Meditation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes her grosser Humours. There is a Rejoycing as well as a Reviving in the Spirits, when the Flesh is brought low. The smelling of Religious Fasting, is not without pleasure and Loveliness. For shee has a very honest look, a sweet Pale, though not a Painted Cheek, a gentle Eye, and a sober Pace; a serious Face, and a thoughtful Countenance, not to be tempted to Luxurient, Uncomely Laughter, lest it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the Modesty of her speech, or Adulterate the Purity of her Heart. Fasting sitteth in respect of her Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that she seeketh not after others, as accounting it the least part of her businesse, nor standeth up to show her self.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eats not, but feeds]</hi> Doth not nourish her self, but feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth others that are in Want. <hi>Bene jejunat, qui alimenta corporis, quae sunt communia dona conditoris, cum indigenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus percipit, &amp; qui ea, quae sibi ad tempus subtrabit, neque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ventri offerenda custodit, sed pauperibus tribuit.</hi> He Fasteth to the purpose, that letteth the Poor partake with him of those things that are necessary for the Body, and which were the Common Gifts disposed by the Creator;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57958:66"/>
and he Fasts indeed that not onely with-holds for a Time some things from his own appetite, and not keeping those things that he hath restrained from himself, bestoweth them upon the Bellie of the Hungry, and the Bowels of the Needy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>From emptying Lap restores lost Wits]</hi> Alluding to the Story in <hi>Areosto's Orlando Furioso,</hi> of <hi>Hyppogrypho's</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying <hi>Astolpho</hi> up to Heaven, where being arrived, and welcomed by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> he shews <hi>Astolpho</hi> for his Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment many Rarities, and Curiosities, and amongst the rest, a Jar of Wit, which was a Cure for Madmen. <hi>Astolpho</hi> begs it for <hi>Orlando;</hi> It was not onely granted to him, but the Use or way of Application of it was likewise taught him after this manner, That when <hi>Orlando</hi> was found asleep, the Jar should be placed right under his Nose, and upon the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Cork, or Stopper being pulled out, his Wits would flie up at his Nostrils into his Brain.</p>

                        <l>The Jar was void, and emptied every whit,</l>
                        <l>And he restor'd unto his perfect Wit.</l>

                     <p>Let the Mirth of the Story pass according to the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so eminent a Poet, and yet not without sober ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, the Moral speaks Graver matter. Here the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that was pointed at, was to signifie, that Fasting is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storer
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57958:67"/>
of our mindes to their former brightness, when the thick Vapours of too much Repletion, are by Lady Jejunia wasted away, and the fulness of Vices by studious care are corrected. Her emptying Lap is not so much lankness, and Falling away of her Body, as her Bounty in Charitable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>What Vertue Truth's clear Water has,]</hi> Here is an admiration of the Excellency and Efficacy of Truth, with a Supposition, that the Pilgrim has tasted of her Spring; which enclines to this Sence. Water is a clearer of the Eyes, and a cleanser of the Skin. Divine Illumination of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Truth in Holy Gospel, openeth the Understanding, washeth away the penitents former Foulness, and Beautifieth the Life and Conversation of a Reconciled Christian. There are three Degrees or States of Truth. To the first we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend by the Labour of our Humility. To the Second by the Affection of our Compassion. To the Third, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of our Contemplation. In the First Truth is found Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. In the Second she appears Pious: And in the Third Pure. To the First Reason leads us, whereby we examin our selves. To the Second our Affection guides us, and thereby we commiserate others. To the Third Purity car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us, by which we are lifted up to invisible things. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirimus veritatem in nobis, in proximis, in sui naturâ</hi> (as S. <hi>Bernard.) In nobis, nosmet ipsos dijudicando; In proximis, eorum malis compatiendo; in sui naturâ, Mundo corde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templando.</hi> If we seek for Truth, we shall finde her in our selves, in our Neighbours, in her own Nature. In our selves, by judgeing our selves rightly: In our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by Commiserating them tenderly; In her own Nature by our contemplating of her with a cleansed Heart purely. And in all these Senses is the Virtue of Truth represented here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scales from thine Eyes did pass]</hi> alludes to <hi>Sauls</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                        <hi>Skin doth seem as smooth as any Glass]</hi> Alludes to the Cure of <hi>Naamans</hi> Leprosie by the Prophet <hi>Eliseus,</hi> when that General of the <hi>Aramites</hi> washed seven times in the Water of Jordan, so as his Flesh came fresh, and new a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to him, and so became perfectly cleansed. Truth thus Cures ignorance, Error, and Obstinacy, which is a Leprosie of the Mind.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Before the Doors behold the Treble Stair]</hi> Before the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lips to Prayer, there must be Humiliation Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Intention. In Humiliation there are 3 Stones joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Consideration of our own Wickedness, and Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to present our Prayers before God: An acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Justice of God to punish Sin: And an Apprehension of the Majesty of the Almighty Creator of the Heaven and Earth, and all things therein contained. In the Preparation are cemented together a serious Sorrow, and Penitencie for our sins: A Hatred of our iniquities: And a Promise of Amendment of Life. In intention, a Sedation, or quieting of our Mindes by casting off all other thoughts or business; an earnest Bending of them to the Matter we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: an inward Groaning of desire for the assistance of the Holy Spirit. <hi>Zophar,</hi> that unkind Friend, spake excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, though unjustly to <hi>Iob: If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands towards him; If iniquity be in thine hand; put it away, and let no wickedness dwell in thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles: then truely shalt thou lift up thy face without spot, and shalt be stable, and shalt not fear.</hi>

                        <hi>Of Polisht Stone]</hi> The Matter of our prayer which we pray, must not be rough stuff of inconsideration, as rude Stone newly taken out of a Quarrie; but such as hath been well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, and best ordered by that Holy Art of Carving, and Pollishing by the Master of the work, by Christ himself, Order of the Church, or Orthodox Divines: Or we must so with great care frame our Prayer for our particular necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties according unto our Saviours direction in his Sermon on the Mount, with submission to his blessed Will and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, who knows what is best for us; who knows better what to give, then we to ask; who knows what we stand in need of better then we our selves.</p>

                        <hi>In silence walks a Matron, grave, alone;</hi> &amp;c.] Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Comliness and Fitness, as well as the Necessity and Custom of Reading of, and Meditating upon some part of Holy Scripture to Sanctifie our hearts before Prayer. There are three kindes of Meditation. One upon the Creatures; another upon the Scriptures; and a Third upon our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The First ariseth from Admiration; the Second from Reading; and the Third from Circumspection. Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on begets a Question; that Question a diligent search; and that search a finding out. Reading doth minister matter to the finding out of Truth; Meditation fits us to pray; Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er helps us to work; Working composes us to contemplate; and Contemplation rejoyceth in her high Speculation. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection of Manners regardeth within, and without; Without she casts her eye upon our Fame; Within she pries into the Conscience, examining what is expedient, and what
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57958:68"/>
is decent: What is decent, as to Example; what is expedient, as to our Merit; Concerning our selves a Vice; Concerning our Neighbours as to Example. Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is of an incertain station, moving this way or that way, as the Tide or Winde, the representation of the Idaea's of Things, comes, or goes, or blows. But it is the Office of Meditation in her sober and steady steps, alwaies to promote to our view Things that are past and behind us. Contemplation is a free perceivance of Things with quicknesse of sight in the glasse of Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with a wary consult. Meditation searcheth out things that lay hidden.

in Life and Doctrine; who not onely taught us to pray, but left us the Forms wherewith himself prayed. His Prayers were perfect patterns; They were short, and Full; very decent, because in Order. His Prayers were pure and meek, chast and comely, clear and lovely, grave and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Oratio si pura, si casta fuerit, coelos penetrare vacua non redibit.</hi> If prayer be clean and undefiled, without spot and uncorrupted, it returns not back from through-pierced Heaven without a Blessing. Hearken to what our Saviour sayes in the sixth of S. <hi>Matthew: And when thou prayest, be not as the Hypocrites, for they love to stand, and pray in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, because they would be seen of men. Verily I say unto you they have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But when thou prayest, enter into thy Chamber; and when thou hast shut thy Dore, pray unto the Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. Also when you pray use no vain Repetitions, as the Heathen: For they think to be heard for their much bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Be ye not like unto them therefore; for your Father knoweth whereof ye have need before ye ask him.</hi> Pray after this manner, <hi>Our Father: Oratio paucis verbis res mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplices comprehendit, ut sit citò simplicitas fidei, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientia suae saluti addisceret, &amp; prudentia ingeniosorum profunditate Mysteriorum stupesceret.</hi> This prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains many things in few Words, that in short there may be preserved simplicity of Faith, that we may perfectly learn what is sufficient for our own health, and the knowledge of the nicest Wits may be astonished at the Depth of the Mysteries contained therein. But mark the Eleventh of Saint <hi>Luke, And so it was, That as He was praying in a certain place, when when he ceased, one of his Disciples said unto Him, Master teach us to pray, as Iohn also taught his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57958:70"/>
where Flesh and blood cannot come. Therefore pray alwaies with all manner of Prayer, Supplication in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and watch thereunto with all perseverance, and Supplication for all Saints. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Continue in Prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los. 4. 2. <hi>Pray continually.</hi> 1 Thessal. 5. 17. <hi>And then in respect of our prayers there is a progression that God would make us holy more and more until the comming of Christ, at which time and not before we shall be perfectly holy.</hi> As S. <hi>Paul</hi> desireth, 1 Thessal. 5. 23. I <hi>pray God that your whole spirit, and Soul, and Body may be kept blamelesss unto the comming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Devotion is said to conduct thy pace, because prayer must be considered, and not hasty.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Unto the Chancel of that holy place]</hi> Still the Ascent of our prayer is resembled; as the going up from the Body of the Church to a Chancel; or as in Cathedral Churches from the Nave to the Quire.</p>
                     <p>Pious Christians by direction of the Apostolical power] The Bishops and Pastors in the Church, after the Gospel had in the Primitive times passed through the storms of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, and begun to shine forth in more peaceable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, did build Churches which they Dedicated to God, as most fit places for publick Worship, which in memory of their former troubles, and their great and wonderful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances out of them, they fashioned in the form of a Ship, which is subject to be tossed to and fro with impetuous Waves, and uncertainly forced up and down in the Sea of this World by the Tempestuous Windes of Persecution. Being very well acquainted with that Text in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> speaking of Christ standing by the Lake of <hi>Gennesaret,</hi> Chap. 5. v. 2. <hi>He saw two ships stand by the Lakes side, and the Fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their Nets. And he entred into one of the ships,</hi>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:57958:71"/>
which was <hi>Simons,</hi> and required him, that he would thrust off a little from the Land; And He sate down, and taught the People out of the Ship. The Ship is the Church, Christ the Priest and Bishop of our Souls; the Prease of people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the shore are Christians, the Followers of his Doctrine. Nor were such Churches unlike a Ship in many kinds, if sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be transverst or turn'd with the Bottome or Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upward. The Roofe is the keele, the Walls, the sides, the Foundation the upper Deck, or Shroud, the East End, the Prow, or Forcastle, The Pinacle in the midst, the Mast, and the West End the Poop, or Steerage.</p>
                     <p>These Churches in their scituation stand transposed to the Temple of the Jews at Jerusalem; These face the East, as That the West. The Christians worship toward the rising of the Sun, so acknowledging the Resurrection of that <hi>Messias,</hi> who is come, and ascended to the Father; The Jew looked West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and in the shadow worshipped him that was to come. But here the Guides aime is by a Reflection upon both; and by the Comparison of each with other to make a Discovery of the way, gradation and operation of Prayer.</p>
                     <p>In the outward part of the Temple of the Jews, were the Atria divided by a low Wall of three Cubits high, which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the Temple. The one was <hi>Atrium Populi;</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Atrium Sacerdotis.</hi> Such places are those Churchyards, and Common places heretofore; dedicated to holy Use and consecrated for publike praise, prayer, and Preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Christian Cathedrals. The people belonging to Prayer are Christian circumcised Hearts, which have communion in <hi>Atrio Populi</hi> in the Congregation of the Saints. Devotion is the Levite which prepareth the Sacrifice, the Priest is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Ordinances, be it prayer for the People, or Preaching of the Sacred Word, who joyning with them in Thanksgiving sacrificeth the Calves of their Lips, with a <hi>Quid retribuam Domine?</hi> Thus is obedience the best oblation in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57958:71"/>
                        <hi>Atrio Sacerdotis</hi> the places of the Ordinances. The <hi>Sanctum</hi> the Sanctuary as the Body or Nave of the Cathedrals, is a Holy Life, and Conversation, thus the Soul becomes A Temple of the Holy Ghost. This as the Cathedral hath two Isles, or <hi>Alae</hi> wings to the Body, in position North, and South. As they belong to Prayer Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> describes them, <hi>Hae sunt duae alae Orationis, quibus volatur ad Deum; Si ignoscis delinquenti,</hi> that's the North Isle or left Wing, Coldness to Wrath, that is to pardon and forgive our offending brother; <hi>Et donas egen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> that's the South Isle, or Right wing; to sustain the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to give to the Poor, who are Members, of our Elder Brother Christ.</p>
                     <p>Through this Sanctuary of a Holy Life, prayer is carried by Ejaculation of the Spirit into that Quire of the Church, the Holy of Holies, into Heaven, where Jesus the ever-blessed High Priest, our Mediator and Intercessor is, sitteth at the right Hand of the Father, and receiveth and delivereth our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before the Mercy Seat, the Throne of God.</p>
                     <p>This resemblance looketh up to that of Exhortation of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. Concerning Prayer in general. <hi>I exhort therefore that first of all Supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for All men.</hi> That is the <hi>Atrium Populi. For Kings, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all Godliness and Honesty.</hi> That is the <hi>Sanctum,</hi> the Sanctuary. For this is good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the sight of God, Our Saviour. That is <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> the Holy of Holies; From which place of Bliss comes the Bounty of Blessedness.</p>

                     <p>NO such means of relief to a Christian in distress as prayer; No such supplier of wants; No such obtainer of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. A voice out of time is as the Crying of Swine, and a prayer without Devotion, as the Braying of Asses. Ask not counsel of Religion of him that is without Religion, nor of Justice of him that hath no Justice, nor of a woman touching her of whom she is jealous, nor of a coward in matters of war, nor of a Merchant concerning Exchange, nor of a Buyer for the sale, nor of an envious man touching thankefulness, nor of the unmerciful touching kindness, nor of an unhonest man of honesty, nor of the slothful for any labour, nor of an hireling for the Finishing of a work; nor of an idle servant for much business; Christ's example is the only Needle to direct thy Compass. As he did, as he bade, so pray. For the power of prayer is above conception, and its effects beyond understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     <head>CONSOLATORY ESSAY. VI.</head>
                     <p>THe Subject is Divine. It is of Prayer. Why not Our Essay also? But this might raise the Question, why <hi>plus ultra?</hi> Tis the Task of A Divine. Too many indeed are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders, and Defilers of sacred Things. What though? Is it not the work of a Christian to understand the Excellency of so Holy, and Necessary a Duty, not for his own Practice onely, but upon occasion for the Benefit of Others. But is there not somewhat, that may adde more strength to such a Scruple? the <hi>Supra sphaeram</hi> of the penman? All this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; and his Veneration of the Holy Scriptures, with Reverence to the Sacred Function rightly derived in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Church; and sit Honour rendred to The Learned, at whose Feet he hath been educated; herein owning his own Imbecillity; and not ashamed to publish His own Infirmities, that God may any way by his unworthiness be glorified. In all humility He conceiveth, that his chief Intention in This Undertaking being pious, and not assuming, it will stand in stead of an Apology to the Judicious, and be accepted with a smooth Brow by the Best Devoted. Yea, since his prime aime was as well to comfort the Afflicted, to whom his Experience and Compassion is as well akin as his Nature, as to strengthen
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57958:74"/>
himself, with Gods Grace implored, by such a Meditation, He apprehendeth none can count him opinionate, seeing he view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own Face in the same Glass. If the Lord out of his own Infinite Goodness, and Mercy hath pleased to call so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and undeserving a Creature home to himself, and hath brought that neglected Talent into the light, which he so graciously hath bestowed upon him, he doubteth not, but the most Religious and most learned Understandings will, if not encourage, yet cover his not willful, though peradventure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Errors, when such shall appear, under the Wisedome as well as the Charity of their Venerable Robes. Yet this he may, he hopeth safely, because truly; and not immodestly affirme, that were his Imbecillity much more then it is, what he hath received is infinitely above his merit, and his way of Thankfulness exceedingly surpasseth his Understanding. What he hath, he hath received from the most Excellent, and most gracious Hand of Divine Bounty; and therefore accounteth himself highly obliged in Nature and Conscience according to his bounden Duty to endeavour to his utmost power to set forth His Praise, and to communicate, what Blessing soever is bestowed upon him, to the benefit of his Neighbour. He that is the giver of All Good Things many times raiseth what is contemptible in it self, the vile, the abject things of this World for the greater Publication of his Power, and Mainfestation of His Glory. He can make Waters flow from the Tooth of a Iaw-bone. The Fear of the Lord is the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of knowledge, of Wisdom.</p>
                     <p>When Our Saviour came down from the Mount, from Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, where he was transfigured; when he came to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, saith Saint <hi>Mark, He saw a great Multitude about them, and the Scribes disputing with them. And straightway all the people, when they beheld him were amazed, and ran to him, and saeluted him,</hi> &amp;c. And Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> renders it, <hi>And when they were come to the Multitude, there came unto him a certain</hi>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:57958:74"/>
                        <hi>man, and kneeled down to him,</hi> &amp;c. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> thus: <hi>And it came to pass the next day, as they came down from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, much people met him. And behold a Man of the Company cryed out, saying, Master,</hi> &amp;c. Sure there's matter of no small weight, business of much importance, something of great moment, where there is disputing, and running, and kneeling, and crying. The variety of posture and motion speaks it a Multitude, a heap of Waves, rouling and tumbling in many sorts of Surges. But what was the Matter? What dispute ye among your selves? Sayes Jesus to the Scribes. And one of the company gives the Answer, as if he had been the spokesman for the Multitude, and the Multitude had been much concern'd in the Question to The Scribes. But there might be some excuse for his impatience, there was' an Allay for his incivility, he came out of a Multitude, and he had a Child there, a Son there, an onely Child there, and he was possest with a Spirit. And that Spirit was a Desperate Spirit, it was a Dumb one too. For so the father sadly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the matter. It was a subtle spirit, it surprised him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it took him. A raging Spirit; it tore him; It brought him into a very sad condition; even to foame at the mouth, to gnash with his teeth, to pine away. It seems, it was past The Disciples Help. They came as short in Faith, (for which they were sharply rebuked) as they were of cure. And to make it appear, that it was a very Desperate Spirit, it cast the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into the fire, it cast him into the waters, to destroy him. So they brought him unto our Saviour; And as soon as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit saw him, he fell to work, he conceived, that his time was short, he tore him; and the possessed must have a fit of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if a fit of the Falling Sickness, he fell down on the ground, wallowing, and foaming. Jesus askes the man, How long it had been thus with his Son. He answers. Of a Child. The Devil had taken early possession, and kept a long time, and was loath to leave it. But what sayes his Father? But if
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57958:75"/>
thou canst do any thing help us, and have compassion upon us. But if thou canst discovered a strange diffidence of his power, knew him not. He prayed help for his Son, but with distrust. He wanted Faith too. For us, It seems there is a Compassion without Devotion. His son was possessed, and he was troubled, Jesus will help, if he can believe, He will help the Son, if the Father can believe, for all things are possible to him that believeth. But must the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Faith stand for Godfather to the sons cure? And straightway the Father of the Child, crying with tears, sayes, <hi>Lord! I believe, help mine unbeliefe!</hi> Much matter is packt in a little room, in a narrow content. He has a suddaine Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as quick a Repentance, he sees himself in a manner in as bad a case, as his Son; He that commiserateth another calls for compassion for himself, the Parent straightway cryes. How soon he was taught to speak right! He cryes amidst the waters. He cryes with tears. He cryes as to save from drowning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem out of the Fire. It was time to cry, Fire! and with tears to quench the same. Lord I believe! help thou mine unbelief! A short prayer; and a weighty. What could he have said more in a Volume? He had but seven words in his prayer; But six had the importunate Widow in the Parable in hers to the unjust Judge: Do me justice against mine Enemies! No more had the humble Publican in the Parable likewise, that stood a far off, and would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote his breast, saying, O God be merciful to me a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; In the Original they are rendred fewer, yet all were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, and most effectual. What though the unjust Judge slight the importunate suiter. Though he would not hear her for a time. It seems she repeated the same short prayer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed her request in the same words at several times; Though he would not grant her request for a Season, notwithstanding that he heard her; heard her, as though he heard her not <hi>ad probationem, et magis provocationem ad rogandum,</hi> whereby
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57958:75"/>
Christ teaches that it is to try our Faith, to inflame our zeal. So he proves us, and make us the hotter in, the more earnest for the obtaining a gracious grant to our requests, that what we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine may be worth the valuing, when we perceive it is so hard to come by, so difficult to attain. And he would not for a time: But afterward he said with himself, though I fear nor God, nor reverence man, Yet because this woman troubleth me, I will do her right, lest at the last she come, and make me weary. And the Lord said: Hear what the unrighteous Judge saith: Now shall not God avenge his Elect, which cry day and night unto him. There's incessant prayer indeed, prayer with out ceasing; yea, though he suffer long for them; The injury is done unto himself. So he takes it. I tell you, he will avenge them quickly. But when the Son of Man cometh shall he finde Faith on the Earth? <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 8. How appeareth it that the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can receiv'd any grant to his short petition. I shall tell you, says <hi>Ego Sum Veritas,</hi> our Saviour that is the Truth; that this man departed to his house justified, rather then the other, then that Pharisee, that was all outside and self justification, with his Prayer nine times as long, that was gotten up into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that stood, and prayed with himself. And Iesus gives his reason for it, a sound, a solid reason for humilities preferment, before pride. For every man that exalteth himself shall be brought low, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. And mark here, how soon the Lord is moved. No sooner Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve! Help mine unbelief! But Iesus hears presently. The people come running, and Christ hastens his help. When Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus saw, that the people came running together he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying; Thou deaf and dumbe Spirit I charge thee, come out of him. It was not only a dumbe Spirit, that could not pray; a deaf spirit, that either could not, or would not hear. For there is such an ungracious Deafness, a deafness to the comfortable Tidings of the Gospel, a deafness to holy, to wholesome Admonition, to sound Advice, to good Counsel
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57958:76"/>
To such wisdom cryeth without, she uttereth her voice in the streets; She calleth in the high streets among the prease in the entrings of the Gates; and uttereth her words in the City, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: O ye foolish! how long will ye love foolishness! and the scornful take their pleasure in scorning! and the Fools hate knowledge! Turn you at my correction! Lo I will poure out my mind unto you, and make you understand my words. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out mine hand, and none would regard, but ye have despised all my counsel, and would none of my correction; I will also laugh at your destruction, and mock, when your fear cometh like sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain desolation, and your destruction shall come like a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde; When Affliction and Anguish shall come upon you, <hi>&amp;c. Prov.</hi> 1. 20. It was not only a deaf, and a dumbe Spirit, but an unclean spirit. An unclean spirit in the eyes of unlawful concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence; an unclean Spirit in the Ears, that had the Itch of wantonnes; An unclean spirit in the Mouth, of foul obscoenity, of lying, of false, of foolish speaking, of Oaths, of Blasphemy, of Perjury and the like abominations. An unclean spirit in the stomack, of exorbitant Excess, of boundless Appetite, of surfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Luxury, of sensual Gluttony, and beastly Drunkenness, that wallows in the Mire; An unclean Spirit in the hand, of wicked deeds, of polluted Actions; An unclean spirit in the feet; a spirit of committing all kind of evil with greediness; a spirit of Cruelty, and Oppression whose Feet are swift to shed blood; An unclean spirit in the Head, of wicked Imaginations; An unclean spirit in the heart, of ungodly Thoughts, and impious Machinations. An unclean spirit in the Conscience, of delusion and depravation; and that is a crooked devil, hard to be thrown out. I charge thee come out of him. There he manifesteth his Command, and power, And that he enter not into him any more, publisheth his protection and Providence, whereby the Divel is either chained-up, or turned out of the line. Then the spirit cryed, and rent him sore, and came out, and he was as one
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57958:76"/>
dead, in so much that many said, He is dead. The Father cryed, the Spirit cry'd, both cry'd, but with different voices. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cryes for help, the spirit with horror. The Father's was a clear voice, a voice of Faith; the Spirit's a hoarse voice, a voice of Infidelity; The Father cryes, that the Spirit might be cast out; the spirit cryes, because he must out; the Father cryes with tears; The spirit cryes with tearing. For he rent him sore at his coming out. Out he comes, but leaves him as dead. If he must away, he will act his utmost mischief. Before he goes, he rends him. Before he leaves him, he endeavors to carry away life and all, he leaves him as dead, dead to the world, dead to Opinion, in disconsolation dead to himself. So does the Devil, So does sin use to take leave of her Favourites. But Jesus took took him by the hand. There was his assisting Grace. O the Infinite Mercy! the readiness! the certainty of such a Helper! He lifted him up, that could not else rise. There was his restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace; And he arose; There was his full Recovery. But why could not the Disciples do this, when they were so intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were to be supposed Schollars of a higher Form in the School of Faith, but they were at the Transfiguration, they were not among them at that time. The Disciples themselves were very much dissatisfied about their non-performance, and disability to the work. We do not find them though confess, that they wanted Faith, whereof they were reproved. Yet their silence imploys a consent to the truth of it. Fain they would know, But they were ashamed to inquire of their master in publick. They watch't therfore their next private opportunity. For so saith the 'Text; And when he was come into the House, His Disciples asked Him Secretly, Why could not we cast him out? He that checked them in the way of his Justice, then informeth them, to set-forth his Mercy. He checked them, to stir up, to rouze up their Faith; He informeth them, he teacheth them, to satisfie their Question, to appease their Doubt. And he said unto them: This kind can by no other
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57958:77"/>
means come forth, but by Prayer, and Fasting. And what is Prayer? <hi>Oratis est piae mentis, &amp; humilis ad Deum conversio, fide spe, et charitate suhnixa.</hi> Prayer is the turning of a devout, and humble mind to God, which is underpropped with Faith, and Hope, and Charity. In the 11. Chapter of the same Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list Christ speaking of the Power of Faith induceth the Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of prayer, in his answer to <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Disciples concerning the wither'd Figg-tree. Have Faith in God. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto This mountain, Take thy self away, and cast thy self into the Sea, and shall not waver in his heart, but shall believe that those things, which he saith, shall come to pass, whatsoever he saith, shall be done to him. Here we may see, that Faith calls down the power of God from Heaven, and that which made All, can or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Act, and perform any thing. Therefore I say unto you, whatsoever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye shall have it, and it shall be done unto you. And what is fasting? If we will take Saint <hi>Chrysostom's</hi> opinion, who was able to judge. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junium non ciborum, sed peccatorum abstinentiam efficit.</hi> Though Fasting for a time, and according unto the occasion from meats be a very necessary thing, to make it a Fast indeed, we must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from sin. <hi>Iejunio passiones corporis, oratione pestes sanandae sunt mentis,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Hierom.</hi> Fasting tempers the passions, tames the Fury, and cures the Pestilence of the Mind. Fasting cools the Feaver of the Flesh, prayer assawgeth the Tumour of the Spirit. As Fasting starves the pride of the flesh, so prayer takes away all Sustenance from an evil Spirit. Prayer is the speaking fasting of the flesh, and fasting is the silent prayer of the Spirit.</p>

                     <p>Thou wert such a Father's Son. In sin wert thou conceived, and corruption gave thee suck; His only Son, the Darling of Pleasure, that hast been dandled in wantonness. Thou art a Child still. Thou art not grown up to the strength of Reason. Thou hast not conn'd the primier of Religion; Or else thy Age has double childed thee, that thou hast forgot thy Lesson. Thou conversest with a large number of wicked Men, and comest with a great Multitude of wickedness. The multitude are the Wicked. For few shall be saved. Legion is thy Companion. How canst thou then be without a Spirit?</p>
                     <p>In the multitude were the Scribes disputing. The Scribes subtle Textmen. The Doctors and Expounders of the Law. They and the Pharises shak't hands, Both were joynt-conspirators against, both joynt-accusers of Christ. The Scribes accused Him of Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy; The Pharisees of eating with Publicanes and sinners. The Scribes Accusation for the breach of the Law; The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees for the Breach of Traditions. The people came to see wonders; The Seribes with them to question the Miracles. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that thou hast not such a Scribe! Such a Pharisaean friend! Such a Textman too neer thee! He is possest with a spirit also, a Question; with a spirit of Contradiction. He cannot helpe thee. He has need of cure himself. Have a care of an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> a false Light! That seems a spirit too. That Vapour may lead thee to thy great hazard into Ditches, and Waters; Into dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Opinions; into a multitude of Errors; into a boundless Flood of sorrows, into the bottomless pit of Despaire.</p>
                     <p>Hast thou, as thou thinkest, an intollerable burthen upon thy Soul! Hast thou a grievous load upon thy Conscience! Some sin that makes it all darkness within thee!

He will pray for thee; He will teach thee to pray; He will pray with thee. And if through his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections (as who lives without them?) he cannot cure thee, he will shew thee the way, he will bring thee to the Master, to blessed Iesus who both can relieve thee, and will help thee.</p>
                     <p>Go to thy Saviour! Distrust not! Go to him by prayer! He will ask thee for that, which he gives thee, Faith. And he will give it in full measure for thy Asking. Call then to Him in thy Heart! And he will open thy Mouth. Cry to him! He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to hear thee loud. But have thine eyes a Drought! Hath Lust dri'd up thy Springs? Look towards him, that is the Rock! and He will cause those Rocks to flow with waters. Who looks upon the Sun, does melt his Eyes. He will hear thee, that sees thy miserie, and will shew it thee, that he may recover thee. Till thou know'st, thou beest sick, thou art not fit for cure. If thou canst not come of thy self; take good counsel to bring thee to Christ? Read the Scriptures! Hear his Ministers! And he will dispossess thee.</p>
                     <p>Thy Body should be the Temple of the Holy Ghost; The House of God, The House of Prayer; How comes it Then, that it is made A Den of Theeves? yet be of good comfort! They shall be cast out. What though the Evil spirit tear thee at parting, with pain, with loss; with sorrow; with fear; And leaves thee as dead in Despaire? What though the World for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake thee? And leave thee? And leave thee Dead in it's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? What though thou beest scorned?

Thou art nearest thy Remedy, when thou thinkest not of it. Pray! and the evil Spirit is commanded from thee. He must Out, though he cry, though he Roar at parting, he shal be banish'd from thee, that endanger'd thee to the fire, to Hell fire, to damnation; that tempted thee to self-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by poysons to flame in thy bloud, by a Halter to give thee a Desperate Convulsion; by offering thee Death in the Waters, in Rivers, in Ponds, in Wells; upon the edge of Knives, upon the Points of Poniards: he thought and sought to surprize thee, when thou wert alone. When thou thoughtst that God had forsaken thee, and all thy friends had left thee.</p>
                     <p>Be of good comfort! Christ that begins the Cure wil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it.

He takes thee by the Hand, by thy promise of amendment of Life, by thy new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.

Wud'st thou have accesse to God? Pray! Wud'st thou have comfort in Afflictions? Wud'st thou have joy in Tribulations? Pray! Wud'st thou possess thy soul in patience? Pray! Wud'st thou have thy patience teach thee Experience? Pray! Wud'st thou have Experience bring forth Hope? Pray! Then shalt thou finde that hope, which is grounded upon Gods love, which he shewed in sending his Son to dye for thee, who wer't unable to raise thy self, that wer't dead in sin, and unworthy of his Love in being his Enemy. Then he openeth the Charter to thee, whereby thou holdest all these Graces, which is a Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with God, procured and purchased for thee by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Jesus Christ. Then art not thou amazed when thou beholdest thy Misery by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> who transgressed the Law of Nature before the Promulgation of the Law of <hi>Moses:</hi> Nor is thy Faith cast down without hope at the sight of thy former committed offences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> never so E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous Transgressions.

The Son directs thee to the Father, and puts words into thy mouth to that purpose. If thou wilt be reckoned amongst the wise, neglect them not. If thou wilt not be numbred amongst the Froward, and the Despisers, refuse them not. Seem not wiser then Wisdom it self, lest the Wisdom that thou admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest so much in thine own eyes, prove altogether foolishness. A short prayer is too long for a wandring mind: a short prayer is best for a weak Devotion. Thy Devotion at the best is apt to tyre for a little way. The Publicans <hi>Lord have mercy upon me A sinner,</hi> may save thee sooner then a long Tautologie of Words; then many a Lord! Lord! made use on to fill up disorderly vacuities, immethodical matter, and non-sence haesitations.</p>
                     <p>If thou wouldst have Prayers for thy particular wants, for several occasions, Go to holy <hi>David</hi>'s box of precious Balsam. Use this or the like: <hi>Turn thee unto me, and have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon me, for I am desolate and afflicted: The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring me out of my distresses! Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mine afflictions and my pain, and forgive all my sins! Consider mine enemies for they are many, and they hate me with cruel ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred! O keep my soul, and deliver me! Let me not be ashamed! For I put my trust in thee.</hi> Then let thy mouth sing forth his praise, and God, even thy God shal give thee his blessing.</p>

                  <p>NAture is so apt to tire, especially in so great a journey, as it was but reason to give her some repose. And there could not be a fitter place, wherein to rest her afflicted Head, and wearied Feet, then in the House of Prayer: A place of no less safety, then Refreshment; where there are Viands of all sorts, as well to entertain the strongest Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, as to settle, please, and nourish the more crasie sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks. Through a Wilderness is an uncomfortable Passage; no better is this World, stuff't with Thorns and Bryars! stor'd with Thicks, and Woods; fill'd with Rocks and stones; inhabited by wilde Beasts, and savage Creatures; replenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with dangers and difficulties of all sorts: But chear up! The worst is behinde the; and having so well Refreshed, thou canst not faint. Thou art a Pilgrim, and art used to Travel. Thou canst not now but with delight move on. Get but up upon Faiths Mount, and thou shalt discover the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land. Such a sight will ravish thee; such a Hope will sharpen thy Desires, and keep thee from ever growing weary. Thou wilt then on lively, and rejoyce that thou art in the way to so excellent a Countrey, that thou art so near thy journeys end. A better End then thou couldest expect, or hope for. To this end mayst thou safely hasten. It is thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. Thus mayst thou with a holy kind of Impatience long to be loosed, but it must be that thou mayst be with Christ. I need not call away; I find thee, me thinks, so reudy to go: Then on in Gods name.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>THe Mount of Faith]</hi> It is so called for the Lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Position of the Place above the neighb'ring inferiour Earth. To go to the Etymologie of the word. A Mount, which is the diminutive expression of a Mountain is derived <hi>a Monte,</hi> which is the Latine word for it. Whence it doth come, there is no little Contest among the Grammarians. <hi>Quidam a movendo per antiphrasin.</hi> Some would have it, as from Not moving, because Mountains are steady in their places; Such Vast Bodies stand fixed; as ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removeable by Art, as they are by Nature. A little nearer the matter, though much differing from the Sound of the word, is their opinion, for <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>s ab <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>minendo, quasi eminens,</hi> as hath been first mentioned. <hi>Scaliger</hi> backs the Sence of a <hi>non movendo,</hi> but gives a nearer Terme and Speaks it <hi>a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendo,</hi> from tarrying, and not moving from it's place. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclines to <hi>Mons a moveo, quod a terra in altum movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi> because it is cast up high overtopping the rest. Some other a <hi>minis,</hi> as if it's height did threaten the Skye.</p>
                        <p>But as every mans Fancy works, more especially in Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme, under favour it may be conceived <hi>Mons quasi monens;</hi> a Mountain a Mark, an Advertisement; and it carries a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible construction with it to advertise us of the Greatnesse of the Creator, in the narrower object more suitable to the Eye, which cannot receive at once the vastnesse of the whole Earth; only thus it is represented in Abstract, as a Map of the whole Fabrick. Every Creature having an Impresse of the Excellence of the Most Mighty, and Most Wise Maker thereof, this hath it's place, and order by his Dispose in an extraordinary manner; as intimating the vastnesse, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vablenesse, immutability, and eminency, of the Creator
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57958:84"/>
above the perception of the inferiour Creatures of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. So Hills and Mountains seem the stairs to Heaven. If we did conceive, that the Heathen had not altogether lost the memory of Noah's Floud, but preserved it by the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Tradition, and Antiquity of History, as <hi>Ovid,</hi> a Roman, to whom the Latine Tongue was genuine, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in that of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> it is not likely to prove a mistake that <hi>Mons</hi> should be derived from <hi>manens,</hi> because the Ark rested upon Mount Ararat, a Mountain in Armenia; yet the former Contract of <hi>Monens</hi> hath solid reason to underprop it; if we look either into Holy writ, or cast an eye upon the Superstition of the Heathen.</p>
                        <p>Most of all the Great works that it pleased God to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest unto men were upon the Turrets of the Earth. That great Triall of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Faith in offering up of <hi>Isaac,</hi> who was a Figure of Christ, was by especiall command to be done upon a mountaine. As it is in the 22. of Genesis; <hi>And He said, Take now thine only Son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the Land of Moria, and offer Him there for A burnt Offering upon one of the mountaines, which</hi> I <hi>will shew thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Canaan, that Land of Promise, was a high Countrey. For <hi>Jacob</hi> sent his Sons down into Egypt for Corn? And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their return it is Said Gen: 45. 25. Then they went up from Egypt, and came into the Land of Canaan.</p>
                        <p>When the Israelites murmured in Rephidim for water, Gods answer to <hi>Moses</hi> was Exod. 17: 5. 6.

                        <p>From Mount Sinai the Lord declared <hi>Israel</hi> to be his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People: <hi>Moses</hi> went up unto God: for the Lord had called him out of the Mount, unto Him, Saying: Thus shalt thou say unto the House of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and tell the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel</hi> &amp;c. If you will heare my Voice indeed, and Keepe my Covenant, then ye shall be my chiefe treasure above All people, though All the Earth be mine. Ye shall be also A Kingdome of Priests, and an Holy Nation. When <hi>Moses</hi> brought the People out of the Tents to meet with God, and they stood in the nether part of the Mount, Mount Sinai was all on Smoak because the Lord came down upon it in fire, and the Smoak thereof ascended, as the Smoak of a Furnace, and all the Mount trembled exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, And when the Sound of the Trumpet blew long and waxed louder and louder, <hi>Moses</hi> spake, and God answered him by Voice. For the Lord came downe upon Mount Sinai, on the Top of the Mount, and when The Lord called <hi>Moses</hi> up into the Top of the Mount, <hi>Moses</hi> went up. &amp;c. Exod. 19. And in the 20. chapt. God spake all these words &amp;c. Viz. the Ten Commandements. After the delivery whereof All the People saw the Thunder, and Lightnings, and the sound of the Trumpet and the Mountain Smoaking; and when the People saw it, they fled, and stood afar off. There were Temporall, and Civill Ordinances and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Tabernacle appointed by God. There the Lord said unto <hi>Moses,</hi> Thus shalt thou say unto the Children of Israel; Ye have seene, that I have talked with you from Heaven.

Israel; And they saw the God of Israel; And under His Feet was, as it were a worke of a Saphire stone, and as the very Heaven, when it is Cleare. And upon the Nobles of Israel He laid not his Hand; Also they saw God, and did eat, and drink. &amp;c. And the Glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai; and the Cloud covered it Six dayes; And the Seventh day he called unto <hi>Moses</hi> out of the midst of the Cloud. And the Sight of the Glory of the Lord was, like consuming Fire on the Top of the Mountain to the Eyes of the Children of Israel. And <hi>Moses</hi> entred into the Middes of the Cloud, and went up to the Mountain. And <hi>Moses</hi> was in the Mount Fourty dayes and Fourty nights. <hi>Moses</hi> also came down from God in Mount Horeb. With the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tables went <hi>Moses</hi> up to God in Mount Sinai, and the Lord descended in a Cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the Name of the Lord. So the Lord passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, and cried; The Lord, The Lord, Strong, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and Gracious, Slow to Anger, and Abundant in Goodnesse, and Truth; Reserving Mercy for thousands, Forgiving Iniquity and Transgression, and Sin, and not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the wicked inocent, visiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, and upon Childrens Children unto the third and fourth generation.</p>
                        <p>And when the Children of Israel with all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion departed from <hi>Kadesh,</hi> they came unto the Mount <hi>Hor;</hi> And the Lord spake unto <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in the Mount <hi>Hor</hi> neere the coast of the Children of <hi>Edom. Numb.</hi> 20. when <hi>Balack</hi> the King of the <hi>Moabites</hi> had sent for <hi>Balaam</hi> to curse the Children of Israel who were advanced to the Plain of <hi>Moab</hi> he carries him first up into the High Places of <hi>Baal,</hi> that thence he might see the utmost part of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and God met <hi>Balaam</hi> there as Numb. 23. But blessed Israel, as the Lord had spoken. Then <hi>Balak</hi> brought him inro <hi>Sadesophim,</hi> the field of the Spies, or of those that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57958:85"/>
watched for them the motion of Israel, to the Top of <hi>Pisgah;</hi> And the Lord met <hi>Balaam</hi> there, and putt an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in his Mouth. There did he blesse them also. Then <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak</hi> removes him to the Top of Peor; where the Spirit of the Lord Came upon him. But there he blessed them also. The Lord commands <hi>Moses</hi> to goe up into the Mount <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arim,</hi> that thence he might behold the Land before his death, which he had given unto the Children of Israel; as it is in the 27. of Numbers; And in the 34. of Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. <hi>Moses</hi> went from the Plain of <hi>Moab</hi> up into Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> unto the Top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho, and the Lord shewed him all the Land of Gilead unto Dan. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Hieru alem was placed upon the Hills too. When they went to keep their Feasts there; It is said that they went up to Hierusalem to worship, where was Mount Sion.</p>
                        <p>Many other Examples might be shewed out of the Holy writ to demonstrate Gods appearance upon the Mountains; In Holy Gospell, there is frequent mention of the Selection of Mountains for Prayer, and Preaching by our Blessed Saviour, who likewise Suffered death upon Mount Calvarie. The Heathen thought to find their false Gods in Groves on High Places, as <hi>Moloch, Adram-melech, Baal, &amp;c.</hi> These Idols had distinctive names from the Mountains where in they were worshiped, as <hi>Baul-Peor, Baal-Zebub, Baal-The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, Baal-Berith &amp;c.</hi> So was <hi>Iupiter</hi> call'd <hi>Olympius, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitolinus &amp;c.</hi> But all this discourse does aim at the setting forth of the fittnesse of the Terme of Mount for the place of Residence for Faith; Since it is not onely the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heaven, where the Throne of God is mentioned to be, but the certainty of finding him by Faith that appeared frequently upon the Mountains, and, Suffered upon a Mount. It may therefore be called the Mount of Faith in regard of it's Elevation above the things of this World, and in respect

of the Eminency of the Obiect of our Faith.</p>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57958:87"/>
that the hearer may believe, the believer may understand, and who so understands may persevere in the exercise of welldoing: For neither works without Faith, nor Faith without Woeks justifie those that have a kind of ability given them to use the freedom of their Will.

Covetousness terms Liberality a Spend-thrift, and Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity calls her a Churle. She seems by turns the contrary to either, as they are to her Extreams both. It is even so with Opinions to Truth, and Sects to the True Religion. Truth is accus'd, Religion is Despis'd by all sides, condemned by all Factions. The Conclave of Rome, &amp; the Consistory of <hi>Geneva,</hi> agree <hi>Eodem tertio,</hi> though there be a hot and seeming quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel betwixt them.

The excesse of Fortitude is Rashnesse and too much Boldnesse; The defect thereof, is Timiditie, and too much Softnesse.

Or Fiduciary, whereby a man assists, or rescues ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Or Mercenary, whereby a man acteth stoutly for a Reward; Or Feminine, by which a man is as couragious, as A Lion in defending his Own, and as hardy as a Cock in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Anothers. The most of these are Imperfect. That onely is perfect Fortitude, which expresseth Valour in a good Cause; The witnesse in that Cause is the Conscience; The Law is Reason, whose maxime and Principles are from Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

                        <p>FAith to take Saint <hi>Augustine's</hi> pious conceit in the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of the Latine word, hath it's Nature in it's name. <hi>Fides â facto, &amp; a Deo,</hi> from a Deed, and from God, <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogo te ergo, Utrum credas? Dicis, Credo. Fac, quod dicis, &amp; Fides est,</hi> I ask thee therefore (sayes he) whither thou believest? Thou answear'st. I. Do then, what thou say'st, and that is faith!</p>
                        <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives the Hebrews a clear Definition, and a full Description of it. Faith is the Substance of things, hoped for, the Evidence of Things, not seen, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. There shalt thou find the Danger in the want of it; the various, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Effects of it; the knowledge by it of the Authour, and Manner of the Creation; the Acceptance of Our persons and our Actions in <hi>Abel;</hi> Freedom from Death in <hi>Enoch;</hi> Watchfulness, and Providence in <hi>Noah;</hi> strong Trust, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and self-denyal in <hi>Ahraham;</hi> temporal Blessings in <hi>Sarah;</hi> A firm Relying, a Resting upon Gods providence for all good things, be it towards a man's self, or his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who bequeathed, what was not then in their possession; Courage to do, though even to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of life, in the Parents of <hi>Meses;</hi> contempt of the World, the Riches, the pleasures of it, in <hi>Moses</hi> himself; God's protection of them, that undertake dangerous iourneyes in the Israelites; Victory by weak means in that of <hi>Iericho;</hi> Preservation in the midst of Dangers in <hi>Daniel,</hi> The three Children; Deliverance from dangers in <hi>Rahab;</hi> Victories over dangers in <hi>Gideon, Barak, Sampson, Iepthah, Daniel, Samuel,</hi> The Prophets; Miraculous Recovery of Life in the Woman of <hi>Sarepta's</hi> Child; A stoutness, and valour in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57958:94"/>
the offers of Life to forsake their Religion in the seven Brethren in the <hi>Maccabees;</hi> By enduring Afflictions, in Name, by mockings, in body by Scourgings, Imprisonment, disconsolate wandring up and down in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins; In suffering Martyrdome of several kindes, as stoning, sawing asunder, &amp;c. Was it not A strong Motive then to stir up the Faith of the Hebrews by the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them of Old? putting the Blush upon them, if they should not believe in Christ, already come, when those so long ago, who received not the Promises, did assuredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ before his coming.</p>
                        <p>How voluntary a certainty of Things above Opinion is Faith, which yet is placed below Knowledge! O how rich is the treasure of Faith! More to be desired, and sought, then the most Orient Pearls, then the most resplendent precious Stones! More to be trusted, to be relyed upon, than All the strength of Man, than the Armes of Princes! More to be travailed for, then all the most effectual Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, than the most Soveraign Balsames! No Guard like it; No Physick of such Vertue. What doth not Faith find out? Against what doth it not prevaile? It seiseth upon what is inaccessible. It deprehends, it reaches down to Us Things, that were unknown; It comprehends, it bindes, what is most furious, what most strong; It apprehends, and make subject to our capacity, what is beyond the stretch of Time. In the vast Embraces of her Bosome, she sits down, and, as it were besieges, yea takes even Eternity It Self.</p>
                        <p>Make hither then, thou tottering Christian! Thou shaken Reed! Thou, that art in so great Distress by foule Weather! Here is an open Port! Wave it not! Believe! Believe in thy Saviour! Let not thy Curiosity search so much for Faith in thine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing! Seeke not to understand, that thou
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57958:95"/>
maist believe! Believe rather, that thou maist understand. Understanding is a Reward of Faith. Believe in thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our! He is the way; He is the Light; He is the Bread of Eternal Life; He is the Spring of Never failing Waters; He is the Well of Life Everlasting; He is the Truth, to direct thee; He is All in all to those, that believe in Him.</p>
                        <p>Either thou didst never believe; not believe, as thou shouldest: Or thy Faith is out of Breath; very pursie for want of Exercise. 'Tis in a Lethargy with Idleness. <hi>Crebris otiosa tentatur incommodis:</hi> A thousand Temptations are ready to lay hold on thee! Nay, peradventure have seised upon thee, as the Philistines did upon <hi>Sampson,</hi> bound thee, and put out thine Eyes too. No marvaile, thou art in so bad a condition; so sick, so crazie, so full of Quames, and swoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. Betake thee to a Prayer! Waken that sleepy Heart of thine! Will it, nill it! Lift up thy Hands! And, though but a good Thought with it! Christ will hear thy Faith, when it cryeth in thy Bosome. Cry out with failing <hi>Peter</hi> on, yea sinking in the troubled Waters. Lord, help! or I perish! Christ then takes thee by the Hand presently. Let thy Heart, Thy fainting heart, claspe Faith! Faith will lay hold on Christ, and Christ becomes, thy strength, thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, thy Redeemer. <hi>Quod oportet, Lex minando imperat; Quod fidei, Lex credendo impetrat.</hi> What belongs to Duty the Law commands under a Penalty; what belongs to Faith, the Law demands, mercy desires by believing.</p>
                        <p>Say! Complaine! Confess then as the Church in the Canticles to thy Saviour! Look not upon me, because I am black, because the Sun hath looked upon me! My Mother's Children were angry with me: They made me keeper of the Vineyards, but mine own Vineyard have I not kept. Tell me, O thou, whom my Soul loveth! where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon! For, why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy Companions? Is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57958:95"/>
he the Rose of Sharon? and the Lillie of the Vallies? Cry'thou then! The Fig-tree putteth forth her green leaves, and the Vines with the tender Grape give a good smell; Arise, My Love! My Fair One! and come away! O my Dove, that art in the Clefts of the Rock! In the secret places of the staires! Let me see thy Countenance! Let me hear thy Voice! For sweet is thy Voice, and thy countenance is comely. Take us the Foxes! The little Foxes! that spoile the Vines! For our Vines have tender Grapes. Thy Neck is like the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> builded for an Armory, whereon there hang a Thousand Bucklers; All shields of mighty men.</p>
                        <p>What though thou beest at a loss? thy Faith grows stronger; more earnest. What, if thou canst not find him? What though thou call'st Him, and He gives thee no Answer? What though the Watchmen; that go about the City find thee? smite thee? wound thee? and the Keepers of the Wall take away the Vaile from thee? On still! Thou shalt find him in an humble walk; When thou goest down into the Garden of Nets, whither he is gone to see the Fruits of the Valley, and to see whether the Vine flourished, and the Pomegranates budded, Or ever thou art aware, thy Soul makes thee, as the Chariots of Amminadab, thy faith wil run swiftly unto him, and call after him: Return! Return, O Shulamite? Return! Return, that we may look upon thee! What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the Company of two Armies. Thou art then thy Beloved's; and His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is towards Thee.</p>
                        <p>Now, beloved Christian, hold fast thy Faith! Part not with it! Part with thy Life first! Which Thou must pay; But not with thine own Hand. Believe, and Live!</p>

                        <p>A Camp is an Artificiall place of strength: a Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for an Enemy, against an Army, anciently used by great Commanders and Generals, to secure their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and the Train belonging to them. It is not <hi>Ager,</hi> a field for the Plough-share, but <hi>Campus,</hi> a field of War, from whence this Word is derived. And a Camp is not a place of Defence, but of Offence, from whence Forces may annoy an Enemy. So sometimes it is used by Militarie Power to sit down before a Fort, Castle, Town, or City, to begirt, besiege, distress, and take such places by Assault, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, or Stratagem.</p>
                        <p>Resolution is the fixing of Courage, and the vigor of Fortitude; Here more especially it is the Spirit, and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive strength of Faith, a Christian earnestness of Mind set to perform Gods Commands, with a valiant Courage, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all resistance, peril, or Temptation, as also to suffer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and undergo upon all occasions with an undanted mind, what Peril soever, Cross, Calamity, or what Evill can betide, as also a determinate purpose to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and overcome the Passions, the treacherous Rebels of the Mind.</p>

                           <hi>Fortitudo est Virtus pugnans proaequitate, saies</hi> Cicero. Thus Resolution is an Excellent Commander to Order the unruly Affections, to keep them to Duty. Such a Caesar S. <hi>Gregory</hi> means in 8. Book of Morals, saying, <hi>Fortitudo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storum est carnem vincere, propriis voluntatibus contraire, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>m vitae praesentis extinguere, hujus mundi aspera pro aeternis praemiis amare, prosperitatis blandimenta contemnere, adversitatis malum in corde superare.</hi> The Gallantry of a

Christians Resolution, is to Conquer the Flesh, to withstand Inbred Appetite, to oppose natural desires, to combate, and overthrow our own Inclinations, to delight in hardship, for Heavens sake, and to make nothing of the Thorns and Rubs of this World for the Reward of hereafter; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the blandishments, and smoothings of Prosperity, and with a noble heart to tread upon, and scorn the fear of Adversity.

                           <hi>Ingratitude Friends wu'd not Know)</hi> This is an Enemy to the whole man. This wu'd cut off the Hands of resolution, and kill the Heart of Charity; A declar'd Foe to Grace; This is as forgetful of giving Thanks, as craving handed to receive Cureesies, as evill minded to return Injuries.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And Curiosity did stay)</hi> Here is the Description of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Curiosity, as of the rest of the Vices; <hi>quarit in rem abs onditam,</hi> No going without prying into some secret. But while this is so busie in others Quarters, no notice is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the weaknesse on's own Guard. Curiosity Seldom parts with him that will entertain him.</p>
                        <p>

Upon those things that God has turn'd the Key, man should not temper with the Lock. Some things are placed in their straight Limits upon purpose, that they should not be common. And others are placed in the dark that they should not tempt an Eye; And some have a Clowd as a Curtain drawn before them, lest their Glory should strike blind, if not destroy. Satisfied Curiosity is a subtle Enemy to a Christian Resolution.</p>

A curse that attends it; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Covetous properly plac't next him, that useth Execrations.

                           <hi>From Vertue's ports did bounding Troops abound]</hi> The Ports are places here from whence Assistance is sent. So prayers by obtaining from above do send fresh strengths to second and supply the weakness of our spirits. Whereupon they are stil'd bounding Troops. For as a bounding Horse doth rise from Ground and charge, doth jump upon the Earth; Prayers mounting up to heaven come swiftly down with obtained Blessings. Mounting Troops signifie also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in Spirit, which always accompany holy Resolution.</p>

The Colours are the Cross, the Drum and Trumpet is the Preaching of the Word that directs to Armes and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to the fight. The Campe is the whole man. Ten Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are obedience to the Ten Commandments, which is accepted as performed by a working Faith through Christ.

Innocence prevents the sent of Pleasures, and Integrity keeps the hands from touching Foul things. These suffer none to pass without The Word. The Draw-bridge is the Tongue, which is drawn by silence, and let down by Reason. The Ordnance planted by its Severity.</p>

This Line has Tenails at fit distance to strengthen the Line; also Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts, both which have Curtains to scowre their Faces. Tenails are Triangular Fortifications; Redoubts are square Forts for Courts of Guard. This Line is that of Circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Tenails are prevention of occasions of Evil, and the Redoubts are Consultation not to admit any thing rash, on the opposition of evil. Thus you see how much work is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Christian Resolution.</p>

                        <head>CONSOLATORY ESSAY. VIII.</head>
                        <p>VIrtue is the refining of Nature to an Eminence; a leading her up to the Top, to perfection; and not onely an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of her to a Quintessence, but a Direction likewise, and impulsion of the mind to the obtaining of what is most excellent. She was, if not the Philosophers Goddess, as it were their Good Angel, their <hi>Bonus genius,</hi> to find the True God out by. Those Athenians in the Acts of the Apostles had set a pretty step to Heaven-ward, when but so far as an Altar to an unknown God. There was a blind acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that; and we find it soon followed, and had so far obtained Grace, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> came to them with the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the true one, Jesus Christ. For whom they ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worshipt, Him did he shew unto them.</p>
                        <p>Make a stand then! And view so fair a Ladie! She is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a look. For she is very beautiful. There is a Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Fascination: Look upon her! Eye her well in her Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomy! her Symmetrie! Form! Mein! and Stature! She is not Fair onely, but very comely. Thou losest not by it, if thou fallest in Love. She is the best Mistress. The most ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable sweet-heart.</p>
                        <p>Look upon her Head! So consider her in her Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als! Hast thou seen a plaited or ribbed Picture, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self at some distance in divers forms, and several Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, as thy Station hath changed from one side to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Room as then placed? Such does she thus appear unto thee. In a Notional, Contemplative, and Theorical manner, thou beholdest her to be Wis<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>m. In the Practical, Prudence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="190" facs="tcp:57958:107"/>
Observe her body! So thou look'st upon in her Morals. So maist thou read Justice in her Will, whose best and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est parts decline from Evil, are forward and ready to do Good. Whose subjective Parts (which are her Species) are General, or Particular. So appears she distributive in her Reward; In her Punishments. Commutative too, in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Sale, and the rest. Whose potential parts are Religion, Piety, Observance, Obedience, Truth, Gratitude, Liberality, Affability, Friendship.</p>
                        <p>As she is Moral you may consider her in her concupiscible appetite. Then call her Temperance, adorn'd with blushing shamefastness, and innocent honesty; with the Neck-lace of Abstinence, stomacher of Sobriety, Girdle of Chastity, and Garment of Modesty.</p>
                        <p>Her Companions at times are lovely Virgins. Continencie handeth Courtesie; Clemency Meekness; Humility studious Regard; Moderation Eutrapelia; Ornament Simplicity.</p>
                        <p>As thou look'st still upon her Morals, mind her likewise in her Irascible Appetite! And thou must call her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, whose sinewie, musculous, and curious Limbs are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, or Magnanimity; Magnificence; Patience, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering; Perseverance, and constancy.</p>
                        <p>So you see how all the rest branch from, or depend upon these four Cardinals, as upon hinges, but they are Virtues. They are so call'd Cardinal <hi>à Cardine,</hi> a Hinge. Thou hast seen Resolutions Pedigree. He's Highborn, Grand-child to the Queen-Regent of the Mind, to virtue.</p>
                        <p>Wud'st thou know what he is? He is a Captain, he is a General, and fit to be so. He is both valiant, and active. He is not too hasty in the Order of his Designs; nor too slow in their Execution. But is steady in their settlement, as the Laws of the Medes, and Persians, that were not to be revoked, not to be removed. He will through with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: No let must stop him: No Enemy gainsay him.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57958:107"/>
His aim is Noble; his end is Honourable: For that he strives. Thither he must. He slights a Treaty with the Vices. He is accustomed to their specious pretences; he understands their Rhetorick, and is acquainted with their Enticements. He knows the Golden Balls thrown in <hi>Atalanta's</hi> way. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists or diverts their purposes. He walks upright; and on still.</p>
                        <p>Come hither then, Weak Brother! and take example! Hast a <hi>Uertigo</hi> in thy Head? Like enough, It may be blown in by some New Doctrine. Hast no certain Pulse? nor Pace? Doest stagger up and down? Doest reel, like a Drunken Man? It may be so. There is a Drunkennesse in the Fancy. There is an Intoxication of the Understanding. Disorderly Passions are the Ebriety of the mind. Is it so with thee? Take Resolution to avoid Evill! Take Resolution to do good! Thou shalt find a cure. Thou shalt become sober. He, that is desperate is a Coward. He, that is Resolute, is Valiant.</p>
                        <p>Take Courage, Man! Put on Resolution! Be a <hi>Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> in the better Sense! And let not a <hi>Scipio,</hi> in the worst, overcome thee! Lose not thy Liberty, for the glory of a Christian! O happy <hi>Numantia</hi> (Sayes that defeated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour) which the Gods had decreed should <hi>Once</hi> end, but Nere be vanquished! Make good the Liberty, that God hath given thee! Be not led captive by Passion! though never so great. Let no torment debase thee! Let no Grief bring thee so low, as to committ any thing unbeseeming a Noble Heart! Nor wish death! Nor fear it, when it comes! T'is terrible onely to Him, that thinks not of it, before it comes. Tis horrible to him that forceth and hasteneth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's Time.</p>
                        <p>Doest thou fear God? O bey Him! Forget him Not! Nor thy Self! Hasten not an End to Those Dayes, that of themselves do poast unto it! Let no Occasion prompt A Lye to thee, to frame a base Excuse, to blind, to tempt thee to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57958:108"/>
committ, which in it self is not onely most Unlawful, but most abhominable! <hi>Socrates</hi> (that wise man) by the Light of Nature can tell thee so much, like a Divine: Thou must not suffer thy Soul to depart from the Sentery wherein she is placed in this Body without the Leave of her Captain. So weighty a matter as Death (sayes, the Divine among the Heathen, <hi>Plato)</hi> ought not to be in mans Power.</p>
                        <p>If thou find'st thy weaknesse, fortifie thy Self by Degrees! Become Master but of One Resolution! Thou maist become Master of thy Self by't. One step is the means to move fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upward; to raise thee to a lofty Room. Resolve, thou wilt avoid One Oath! but One Hour! It may produce A Day. Resolve, thou wilt not goe into that bad Company! But this Time! It may take thee off from Another. Resolve, to deny thy Heart, but One unjust Request! Mark, how it will cool from offering thee Another! If thou didst not give the Devill encouragement, thou shouldst not peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have his Custom. Resolve to say but One Prayer! Take that, which thy Lord hath taught thee! It is but a short one, lest it might seem irksom to thee. Resolve to say it humblie! In thy Heart! Resolve to do it humblie! On thy Knees too! All Reverence of Soul, and Body is too little for so Great a Majestie. Whoso wu'd chill thy Reverence, wu'd Kill thy Devotion; murder thy Prayer; and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence thy Soul. Have the Angels no Knees? thou hast. Let thy Heart suit their Reverence! Let thine Intellectuall Nature do a like worship! Let thy Body perform it's own. O come let us fall down, and worship, and Kneel before the Lord Our Maker. For he is the Lord our God, and we are the People of his Pasture, and the Sheep of his Hands (this can not be remembred too often) Prostrate then! The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of thy Body will humble thy Soul! It will abate the strength of thy proud Flesh.</p>
                        <p>Resolve, as much as possibly thou canst, to think of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57958:108"/>
then, but God, and thy Prayer! and thy self in it to Him! Conceive, it is the Sacrifice of thy Soul! And that thou then discoursest with the Deitie! Think of thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our more, than thy Sin! Doest see Another Law in thy members, warring against the Law of thy mind, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in thy Members? And thereupon groanest out Saint Paul's words? O wretched Man, that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this Death! Seek to make his Application! I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord, by whom we have now received the Atonement.</p>
                        <p>Resolve One good Deed of Charitie! That will warme thy Heart, That may kindle a holy flame in thy Soul. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to pray, as soon as thou awakest! So thou prevent'st Sin from taking Possession. With the Psalmist seek him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the morning! Run to thy knees at Noon Day! Or when any Temptation assaulteth thee! Resolve, not to couch thy Head on thy Pillow, before thy Peace-Offering! And that thou beest to God and Man reconciled! Thy Bed may prove thy Grave. And there is a Resurrection.</p>
                        <p>Resolve against any Notorious Sin, whereof thine Own Conscience shall arraign thee Guilty! Make A Covenant with thine Eyes! thine Eares! thy Lips! thy Hands! thy Feet! and thy Thoughts too! For these are the Tinder of Iniquity. Leave not God, till thou hast obtained A Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing! Wrastle for it, as <hi>Iacob!</hi> He loves to be sought. He delighteth to hear thee call upon Him; And is pleased to see a stout Champion; what thou see'kst, is not worth his Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, if not worth Thy Contending for.</p>
                        <p>Strike thy Breast! That thy rockie Heart may be mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; That it may have the comfortable Metamorphosis from Stone to Flesh! So shalt thou be reconciled to thy displeased Father; So Christ will own thee; will send the Comforter unto thee; And thy Body shall become the Temple of the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57958:109"/>
Holy Ghost. Thou shalt grow from grace to grace, even to Eternall Glorie.</p>
                        <p>Take up thine Arms then! With Them the Ingemination, that the Lord deliver'd to <hi>Ioshua!</hi> Be strong! and of a good courage &amp;c. Be strong, and very courageous! that thou maist obserue to doe according to All the Law &amp;c. Turn not from it to the Right hand, or to the Left! that thou maist prosper, whither soever thou goest.</p>

                        <p>A Lodg is the lonelie Dwelling of A Keeper in a Park; Of a Ranger in a Chace; or of a Forrester in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest. A Forrest is a desert Place full of Woods, and Copses. It is chiefly frequented by wild Beasts, being their proper ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. And many of those Beasts are not more wild, than cruel, a savage Kind of Creature. Though this Forrest within a Wildernesse in the passe along the same the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Traveller indeavours to direct the Pilgrim in this Discourse.</p>
                        <p>The Wildernesse is the World. The Forrests therein are Cities and most inhabited Places, The Woods and Copses are the Houses, not onely because they are built with timber, but for their Thicknesse, and nearnesse of Position. The Streets are the Walks. The wild Beasts are the Men. <hi>Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitum Vulgus.</hi> The People, that are not easily tamed; Who are more savage, than those wild Beasts, devouring not only one another, but their own Kind. So as t'is not <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus hominem Vorat,</hi> the Wolf devoureth the man, but <hi>homo homini Lupus,</hi> Man is the Wolf to Man; nay more, <hi>Homo homini Daemon;</hi> Man is a Divell to Man. And that exceeds the Barbarisme, and abhomination of Those <hi>Anthropophagi</hi> Spoken of by <hi>Plinie.</hi> lib. 6. c. 30. or those Indian Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57958:112"/>

                        <p>In such a Place, among such Inhabitants layes the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Patience. No where also to raise her Portion. And yet even to a miracle, there lives she happy, happy in a hope not onely, but in a Joincture by Assurance of Happinesse hereafter. Hence is her Habitation properly stil'd the Lodg of Patience.</p>

Pleasure is a deep ditch that swallows many; there is no staying with Delight; It will endanger thee: tis best to leap from that thou wouldest avoid: do it with all speed and agility: Covetousness is a Ditch that has no bottom. Have a care of that too, and the like.</p>

thou must Suffer. Do it then patiently; Go gently! For he that struggles upon those stones, doth gaul his Feet the more, doth make his Wounds the Deeper.

Thou must not think after so great pains, that when thou hast escaped some miseries, thou art freed from all. They are but to forewarn thee, and to teach thee to endure more. Change is very pleasing in delights: it is no less in sanctified Sorrows. Thou com'st, does shew that thou art coming home, coming to heaven-ward. It is not, Thou goest, as if thou wert going abroad, abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World. Thou passest from Post to Pillar, from Mire
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57958:113"/>
to Furs, from Furs to Sand, a Dry, a Barren, a Hungry place. To Poverty, to Scarcity, to necessities, where there is none upon the earth to relieve thee. Sand will sooner put out thine eyes, then afford any thing to fill thy belly, or cloath thy back. Sand is a loose earth; it is deceitfull to thy steps. So are worldly friends very unsteady. The best use of Sand is, it is the measure of time; such benefit may thy Consideration reap by the comparison of the barrenness and vanity of this world, with the Solidity, Fertility, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that to come.</p>

Pleasure dwells in the Countrey, but a Curse upon the Land. By the open Country thou mayst expect hospitality, but barren Land hath shut up doors. Here comfort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd at first sight, but sorrow came along with it. In the way of Patience, Comfort will not be from sorrow neither. There is some ease in changing place or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>

                           <hi>Tis there the Lodge of Patience does on Crutches stand]</hi> In such a place of Barrenness of Comforts, in such a Desart of Disertion of Forsakenness, is the being of Enduring the Cross: It is a Lodge, not a constant dwelling; and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly it stands upon Crutches; it seems ever falling in the Worlds eye, and very contemptible.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>It stands upon a hilly plain]</hi> Does it stand? There is some comfort in that yet. Upon a Hill too, and upon a Plain. It is not very high, though it is but hilly, as it were a hill, yet high enough for the fury of storms, and the Plain shews it low enough, and even enough for subjection to every Foot. It is open, and made fit for Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

This expression of the Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler alludes to the Camels that pass the Desarts of Arabia for Merchant-Trade from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by Caravans, by Companies of Camels, that gain their maintainance by their travel, and get their food by their labour.

                        <head>CONSOLATORY ESSAY. 9.</head>
                        <p>OPinion deceives us more than things. So comes our Sense to be more certain, than our Reason. Men differ more about Circumstances, than matter. The Corruption of our Affections misguides the Result of our Reason. We put a Fallacy by a false Argument upon our Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                        <p>If the Vitiosity of Humor doth oft put a Cozenage upon the radiancy of sight, so that it sees through deceiving Eyes, the false Colours of things: Not as they are, but as they seem. (Peradventure Choler hath given a Percolation to the Chrystalline humor of the Eye; or Phlegme hath made an uneven commixture or thickness in the Optick Organ, or the like, by which means all is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented yellow, or all seems black, or of the darker Dye, that the Sight returns to the common Sense) why may not mens understandings be likewise so deceived? As sure they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused. For most men, yea many of the higher Form of Brain, being in love with their own Parts, or their Credit, commit first the Error, then undertake, make it a part of their Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution (rather, then to recede from misapprehended, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Untruths) to account it as a concernment of honour, and maintenace of affected reputation either to proceed to further Obliquity, or at least to take up the stand with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="223" facs="tcp:57958:123"/>
By this Means have we not only lost much of our Peace, but even the clear Evidence of Truth. How comes else such a Gladiatory in the Schools (to omit the Pulpits) such Challenges of the Pen, such Animosities in Discourse, as if our Natures were lesse inclinable to Conversation, than a Combat.</p>
                        <p>Nor have Things, Indifferent, been hereby made the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occasion of the Quarrel, of such Division; But overrun with Misprision, and overcome by Pertinacy, they sett sail to the Anticyrae, goe besides themselves; not onely in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from, but by putting the Question upon the principles of Reason, and the very Fundamentalls of Religion. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by some unwisely thinking to add to their stature, to become Gyants among Men, have fallen lesse, then the least of Beasts, not retayning so much, as the Prudence of the Bee; yea coming short of the providence of the Pismire; Not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at the Knowledg of the Oxe: For he knowes his Master's Crib.</p>
                        <p>And from whence proceeds the Corruption of such our Affections, but from the Evill of our own Hearts? No marvail then, though we see so double; as if our Brains were intoxicated; Or as looking through artificiall Glasses, multiply our mistakes, or magnify our Errours; and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, yea undervalue matters of the greatest moment. We sett a Price upon Things by our own Clark of the Market. Holy Things must goe cheap; And Wordly Trash, and Trifles at the onely Estimate. Covetousnesse puts us first into a petty Treason, minting much Falss Coine, and then runing us into a Praemunire by assuming Authority without lawful Warrant, we will have it goe for Currant: Our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires too like their mettall are not Touch, are not Standart; Yet passe they must for the Impresse, though <hi>Vulcan</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> be on the One Side, and <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Proserpina</hi> on the Other.</p>

But what comes on't; The vanity of our Desires makes them punish themselves; putting <hi>Sisyphus</hi> to an unprofitable, and perpetual Labour, and <hi>Tityus</hi> to the Torture. We desire without, and coutrary to a right understanding; Like silly, like froward Children we must have, what we have a mind to; Neither considering what is suitable to us, what is fittest for us; Nor taking notice of, or setting a true Value upon, the Noblenesse of our created Natures. The Soul is not to be filled, with what is finite, nor commixed with what is impure.</p>
                        <p>Away then with the Dirt, and Rubbage of the world! What has Mans sublime Nature, little inferiour to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to do with the Trash of the Earth? or the Bubbles of the Waters? Much lesse to be so affected to them, as to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for them?</p>
                        <p>Sit thee down then neer me awhile, Distressed Man, or Woman, that wearest Discontent on thy wrinckled Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, like a plaited Vestment, and shewest Grief, as it were sown, in the furrows of thy Cheeks. Suspend thy Passion for a time! Let us discourse a little! Between our selves let us argue the Matter! Whether thou art not mistaken in the Thing? Or thy Desire? Peradventure in Both. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and not without some Reason; Thou art sick either from the Retarding, or from the Losse of thy Longing; Or thou complainest under some insupportable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Burthen. Some Crosse hath put thee into a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; or some Calamity into a Consumption. Thou ragest, Thou languishest, Thou fallest away. What's the Matter? Hast suffered any Losse? Why didst not expect it? Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou, My Beloved is Dead? Didst not know, he was mortal? Sayest Thou, My Friend hath dealt unkindely? He lov'd Thee for Himself; Or Thou Him so. Thou expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst more of Him, than came to thy share. There will rise a Quarrel at the Division of Interest. Interest it self is a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57958:124"/>
Divider. Art thou Poor? Who is born Rich? Or who shall die so? Doest cry, I have lost my Goods, I have lost my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes! They were thy Evils, they tempted thee; Or Evils thou madest them, by abusing them. Knew'st not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thy Fortunes? Didst not understand their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage? They told thee, they were unconstant. Doest que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, Where is my Honour? In other mens Mouths. In the Air. Or doest enquire, Where is my Office in anothers Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose; not thine own. Didst place thy Self there? Saist, Where's my Good Name? In thy Vertue; Not in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Where are the Hopes of my Labour? In the Vanity of thy Expectation. Dost think any thing is fastned to the Earth? Or that it is not changable. The Earth it self is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and in this Sense moveable. Thou alterest from thy Self. The World from Thee. And thou from the World. Thou doest foot the Hay. Thou must Sometimes hedge in, sometimes winde out. Why understandest not the Dance? O! but my Husband is furious! A Blow! O! but my Wife is ever froward! A Noise! Why givest occasion? Or allayest not the Distemper? Is a Fire quencht with Oyl? Thy Patience may cool her Heat, and allay his Violence. Multiply not Words! And stand not in the way of a Sword. Alasse for thy Conscience! Doth that trouble Thee? Thou art mistaken. It is Satan: not It. Vomit up the Filth in thy Stomack! Disgorge thy Sins! Lest there be Death in the Pot. Canst thou Buckle, or art thou too opinionate. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Pride is a Torture. Think not to have Ease, while thou hast It. Art thou afraid of Envie? Humility putteth out that Eye, which is left her. Art thou charged by Detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Mildnesse keeps thee Shotfree. Hast thou any Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, afflicts thee? Be quiet, There is, or will be an end of all Sorrowes. No Night without a Morning. Hast thou any Trouble, that Shoulders thee? Thou wert asleep in thine Enemie's Arms; Thank it for wakening Thee. Is all the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57958:125"/>
World thine Enemy? Thou art the honester Man. Be not so to thy Self. Hast thou any Discontent that wu'd gnaw thee? Feed it not. If so many lay for thee, be not Alone. Hast murdered like <hi>Cain?</hi> Or hast thou betray'd, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered too, like <hi>Iudas?</hi> Have thy Imprecations hung Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance ore thy Head, as the Sword over that of <hi>Damocles,</hi> that it holds but by a Thread, a Hair to thy thinking? Thou ever expectest, when it shou'd drop. Do thy Perjuries thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der within thee? Has thy Sacriledge brought Fire to thy Nest? Art a Rebell all over against God? Hold thy Hand! Rebell not agaist Nature too! Why think'st, that thou art beyond a Pardon?</p>
                        <p>Tell me! O tell me! Is thy Sin, or God greater? Art a Christian? Or a Turk? Or an Infidel? Or a Devil? Darest give the Almighty thy Lie? Could he create all the World out of Nothing? And can He not save Thee? At what time soever a Sinner doth repent him of his Sin from the Bottom of his Heart, I will put all his Wickednesse out of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, saith the Lord. Did he send his Son to die for the Sins of the whole World? to be the Salvation of his People? and the Redemption of all them that believe in Him? And sayes Satan, Thou art one of them, Do what thou list. Thou art none of them, Do what thou canst. He is the Deceiver. It is his Name. Believe him not. Give ear to distressed <hi>Davids</hi> question, again and again to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in the midst of his conflict for his grievous Sins! Why art thou so full of Heavinesse, O my Soul? And why art thou so disquieted within me? Put thy trust in God! For I will give him Thanks for the Help of his Countenance. Why art thou so vexed, O my Soul? And why art thou so disquieted within me? O put thy trust in God. For I will yet thank him which is the help of my Countenance, and my God.</p>
                        <p>Away then with thy Discontents! Bear thy Crosses!
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57958:125"/>
Run not mad at thy miseries! Hang not thy head low with thy cares! And be not out of countenance at thy Calamities! Be patient.</p>
                        <p>Thy Tears do not become thee. Thou art a Man. What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine Ears? And the lowing of the Oxen which I hear saith <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> in the case of <hi>Agag?</hi> What ayleth this sighing? this groaning? the crying out? and roaring of thine afflictions? Be patient! thou art a Christian.</p>
                        <p>Chear up! Thou hast heaven before thee. Thy journey is not long. Blessed are they which mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsly for my sake. So preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christ in the Mount. Rejoyce! and be exceeding glad! For great is your reward in Heaven. For so persecuted they the Prophets, that were before you. In patience therefore possesse your souls, saith this Apostle S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Be patient!</p>
                        <p>Many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers them out of all.</p>

                        <head>PERSPECTIVE X.</head>
                        <p>THe Sense and meaning of the Title of this Canto, is Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious enough to learned Understandings: But Feminine mindes are of a weaker Apprehension; for whom since there hath been already so much pains taken as to translate all the Latine Sentences, and Verses related out of several Authors upon necessary occasion, by the writer hereof. He thinketh it very convenient to set down his intention likewise herein.</p>
                        <p>Ruins are the Monuments of a former building; the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass of some goodly body; the Yesterday of strength and beauty: The Reliques and deformity of Rage, and sad spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of sins disorder. Ruins nest is made by War in ashes; Ruins Bed is made by peace in Dust. Wrath throws down, and demolishes; Age brings to decay, and discomposes what former Art, with many a laborious hand had made for use, and fashion'd comely. Ruins are the fall of a late stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing building.</p>
                        <p>Mortification is a making dead, a Consumption of life. Ruin is a destruction to a building; Mortification the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine to a Body. But this is not the sense of Mortification here. Here it is derived <hi>à morte,</hi> from death too, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to a greater purpose. <hi>Totam hominis miseriam Deus complectitur mortis vocabulo.</hi> The breach of one word of Command introduc't it. Disobedience against one Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, was the Ruine of All. For so we find it in the 17. of the Second of <hi>Genesis: But of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil, thou shalt not eat of it; For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt dye the death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="232" facs="tcp:57958:128"/>
To know Mortification the better, let us enquire into the divers sorts or degrees of death: and those are four: The first is, <hi>Mors spiritualis,</hi> a Spiritual death, which is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Spiritual life, whereby the whole man is Ruin'd and destroy'd; <hi>Vivit tantùm peccato,</hi> He lives to sinne onely. And that kinde of Life is the worst of Death.</p>
                        <p>Then there is <hi>Mors affectionum,</hi> a death of Affections, <hi>Quae est privatio primaevae foelicitatis,</hi> The privation of former Happinesse: And that is <hi>immissio omnis generis calamitatum,</hi> The sad inlet of that raging Tide of all sorts of Calamities, and all kindes of evil.</p>
                        <p>The third is <hi>Mors spiritualis, vel corporalis,</hi> a death of the soul and body, (mistake me not I pray) this we call a Natural death, which is a privation of this Animal life.</p>
                        <p>The last is, <hi>Mors Aeterna,</hi> Everlasting death, which in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures is called a <hi>Second death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mortification here claims the nearest kindred to the death of Affections. <hi>Propter te mortificamur totâ die.</hi> We are killed for thee all the day long, singeth the Psalmist, <hi>Quasi Cycnus in cantu,</hi> as the related Swan chaunteth his Epice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium. <hi>Foelicem illam animam, cui vivere est Christus, et cum Christo mori lucrum.</hi> Thrice happy is that soul, to whom Christ is the life; He needs not fear to dye with him, since he's the onely Gain. If Christ be in you, the body is dead, because of sin. But the Spirit is life for righteousness sake. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the Dead, dwell in you; He that raised up Christ from the Dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies, because that his Spirit dwelleth in you. Therefore, Brethren, we are Debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh; For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall dye: but if ye mortifie the deeds of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by the Spirit, ye shall live, writes S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12, 13. And to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> cap. 3. 7. The
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57958:128"/>
Things that were Vantage unto me, the same I counted Losse for Christs Sake. Yea, doubtlesse I think all Things but Losse for the excellent Knowledge Sake of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have counted all things Losse, and do judge them to be Dung, that I might win Christ. And might be found in Him, that is not having mine own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is of the Law, but that which is is through the Faith of Christ, even the righteousnesse which is of God through Faith. That I may know him, and the Vertue of his Resurrerection, and the Fellowship of his afflictions, and be made conformable unto his Death. If by any means I might attain to the Resurrection of the dead, &amp;c. But our Conversation is in Heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, even the Lord Jesus Christ; Who shall change our vile Bodie, that it may be fashioned like unto his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto Himself. And this is the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in our Consideration.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Between two Hills, as those of Faith, and Hope]</hi> Between two Hills is the Introduction to Mortification, and the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of her Strength, and Firmenesse. This <hi>Simile</hi> pointeth at the Mount of Faith, and Tenariffe of Hope, shewing that the Reason or Ground of true Mortification is the enjoyment of Christ, who is incomparably beyond all things, in the possession of which inestimable Riches Christians despise the World, and trample upon their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections thereunto, knowing that in the Enjoyment of Him, they possesse all things.</p>

Gloomy intimates composed, and retired in thoughts. Glades are places that indent between hills, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Fowlers sett their Gins and Nets to take, and Kill Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, woodcocks and the like in the mornings and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57958:129"/>
when they accustom to fly those wayes. The Glade here shews the taking notice of the Vanities and Follies of the world, and despising of them, which is introductive to Mortification.</p>

                           <hi>Where Groves of Yew do cast their Shade)</hi> A sad, and mournful condition in this world does cloud, the vertuous in the Eye of opinion, and estimations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The godly are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as swallowed up by their Afflictions, are reckoned no better than lost men by Children of this world, who scarce number any among the Living, that appear not in their Sunshine.</p>
                        <p>The Yew Tree, as <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth, is of a venemous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and against man's nature; These Yewes are Afflictions, that are over shadowers of the vertuous and are poisoners of delight in vain pleasures; being also very harsh to flesh, and bloud, and contrary to Nature. <hi>Diascorides,</hi> and most of those, that have heretofore dealt in Herbarisme set forth, though upon no very experimentall ground, that the Yew Tree is very venemous to be taken inwardly, and that if any do sleep under the shadow thereof, it causeth many times death. Too much sorrow taken inwardly, taken too much to heart, Killeth. There is no sleeping in a storme; no setting down still in Trouble. We must bestir us the right way, and use the means that they may be sanctifi'd unto us, that the Yewes of our Miseries may be seated in our mortified hearts, as they are used to be set in Churchyards, hallowed Places by their dedication, and customary imployment for Burialls. The Yew growes so planted near the Church: Affliction flowrisheth when it is placed near Devotion. It is further said of the Fruit of the Yew, that the Eating of the same is not onely dangerous and deadly unto Man, but if Birds do eat thereof, it causeth them to cast their feathers, and many times to dye. Inordinate sorrow for the things of this life bring rather <hi>mortem, quam mortificationem,</hi> lead us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57958:129"/>
to the gates of death more than to mortification. The Birds are the Preferments of this world, False Friends cast their feathers, their favours; the world forsakes us, when trial coms, and leaves oftentimes men dead without help or comfort. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> Sayes, that labouring Beasts do die, if they eat of the Leaves; but such Cattle, as Chew the Cud receive no hurt at al thereby. The Leaves are the hiding the covering of Afflictions, which is very dangerous. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is death to unclean Beasts. It makes the wicked mad. It is not hurtful to those, that are Clean, that ruminate, that chew the Cud. To those that meditate upon the Lawes, and Statutes of the Lord, and seek unto him continually by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Leaves of the Yew are senselesnesse, negligence, and unprofitablenesse of Afflictions, when they are not made the right use of. Whereupon it may well be said that Affliction leaves a man either much the wiser man, or a greater Fool, than before it found him.</p>

They drive him over the lofty places of height of pleasure and ambition. They over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw him in the spoyled Grove of his Idolatry and false Worship. It is such a spoyl'd Grove, despoyl'd of the Jdols as <hi>Iosiah caused to be cut down</hi> in his Reformation of the Jews. Sin brings him here into the state of death, which is his heavy case. The falling of the Stagge upon his knees, and weeping, is man's humiliation and repentance: To his wounds he weepeth; at the sight of his sins he is very much dejected. While he lies in this sad condition, and Satan thinks him in despair, and his vices and enemies seem to vaunt over his destruction; by Faith he is regenerate, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, metamorphos'd, or rather turnd into a Hart, the Lord's, his Redeemer's, his Saviour's beloved, and hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a vivification, and newness of Life, and escapeth from his spiritual and worldly enemies that are his violent pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

                        <p>FOr want of a right Apprehension of Things, as they are in themselves, as in their own Natures, we are led too often, and carried too far out of the Way. We are many times cozen'd with Mock-shewes for real Things. Hence our Affections taking all at the <hi>Voleé,</hi> wanting likewise Direction by true Knowledge to their proper Marks, do not so much misse their Aim, as altogether miscarry. This is a visible Discovery of want of Judgement too; Or, that it is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as it is become the Childe of a Harlot, and not of a lawful Mother, the Natural-born of Sense, and not the Son of Reason.</p>
                        <p>How else can it come to passe that the Noble Soul of Man should so basely please it self with as foul, as general a habit, and custome of brutish hunting for the Back, and Belly; And to ro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>How else comes it about that no pains is thought enough to fetch a little glittering Earth from the remotest parts of the World from the <hi>Indies.</hi> It is no more. Nor of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of that which lies upon the Surface. Gold hath the lower place by Nature. No storm must withstand us. No length of Journey tire us. Nor Hazard discourage us. No, we must ha't; Though it brings <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Plagues with it; Covetousnesse, Contention, and a thousand Evils. Yet is it neither Food, nor Raiment. <hi>Midas</hi> found in the Fable,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57958:136"/>
that it was not edible. And <hi>Licurgus</hi> in the Constitution of his Laconian Common-wealth, and in the Institution of his Lawes condemned it, as not necessary. He therefore shut it out of their Gates for a Wrangler; or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for the prevention of a Quarrel. It was against his Communitie, and Commutative Justice.</p>
                        <p>How else ariseth it, that we are so hurried about with our Passions, as if we rode upon theSphears with a rapid motion, for the obtaining of those things, that are so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing necessary, as they are not convenient; as for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, in regard of Health, and rest; for Honours, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Contentment, and safe enjoyment.</p>
                        <p>Were any of these things either of Value or Certainty, there were some excuse for Appetite. Let us go to <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wisest of men, to him that had the Treasury of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all from the Cedar to the Shrub, that abounded with the means, and judgment in the variety of his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments. What sayes he after his large Progresse? <hi>Vanitie of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanitie of vanities, all is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie! What profit hath a man of all his labour which he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth under the Sun?</hi> That's his Beginning. And what sayes he in the midst of his Inquisition? <hi>Lo, this onely have I found, that God made man upright, but they have many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</hi> And what's his winding up in the close of All? Take his own Words, and Gods Holy Spirit in them. <hi>Let us hear the End of all. Fear God and keep his Commandments: For this is the whole dutie of Man. For God shall bring every work into judgement, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> How Follie and Death are in a Conspiracie together! The Vanities of the World are Sin, and the Wages of Sin is Death. It is time to look about us; since our enemies are at hand. But which way shall we escape them? Let us contemn the World! and we avoid its Folly. Let us mortifie our selves, and we have the better of Death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="250" facs="tcp:57958:137"/>
Draw then near, thou sad-fac't Soul! that hast been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the one, and art in Danger of the other! Me thinks I see Death in thy Face. Thou look'st as though he were in thy Head, if not in thy Heart. Thou art Miserie all over, and die thou must. Thou must not lose thy longing. Thou hidest from the Day; and the Night is a Burden. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie is grievous; and Solitude dangerous, yet thou lov'st it.</p>
                        <p>How strangely thine Imaginations work! and as vainly. How thy Breast is upon the Rack! and thy thoughts upon the Tenters! How thy Wishes flie into the Winde! and thy Groans do answer one another by Ecchoes! What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances thou hast in thy secret Paths! and how cunning thou art to seek out a Mischief! Thou art now rich enough. For thou art resolv'd, thy Poverty shall not starve thee, thou may'st do that thy self. Thou art now great enough; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall not give thee a Fall. Wilt thou undo thy self, that another may not undo thee? 'Tis not to be altered. Die thou wilt. Only the manner of Death is the question.</p>
                        <p>Come hither, Backsliding Man! Here is thy nearest way; and thy best Death. And since nothing would down with thee, but Death, thou shalt have enough of self-killing. Here is a Death that is at hand, and full of safety. Thou may'st do it by good Authority. This Death is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Thou shalt not need to travel among opinions; to search among the learned for Arguments; to strain the sence of Mutilation; or to put the Fallacie upon <hi>eadem est ratio to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, &amp; partium;</hi> Thou shalt not need to trie thy Wit to gather poyson. Here is a Death to purpose; Thou must kill thy self all over. The Dagger, or the like strikes but at a Part; This strikes at all. Mortifie the Flesh! and the sinful Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof! and thou offerest a Sacrifice; and committest not a Murder. But Sacrifice not as those to <hi>Moloch:</hi> For that is such a Sacrifice as has Murder, and Abomination
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57958:137"/>
joyn'd to it. Draw thine Affections off from the World! And thou hast drawn a Dagger against Temptations. Fast! and thou starvest thy worser self. Fast! <hi>ad mortificationem carnis, non usque ad mortem corporis,</hi> to the mortification of thy sinful Flesh, not to the destruction of thy human Body. Pray! and thy wicked purposes fall by a holy Sword. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify thy Lusts! and in that instant th'art a dead man. And thou shalt not need to fear thy dying; For thou risest to a new life, and hast given thee a better Being. Since thou wert so bloudy minded thou shalt have enough of Self-kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, even to wearinesse. Thou must Kill by mortifying thy Self dayly; and thou shalt have Joy, and Life by it. Since thou wert so bloudy minded, take thy Saviour's Bloud, and may I say with reverence, <hi>Sanguinem sitisti, sanguinem bibe;</hi> Did'st thou thirst for Bloud? Drink that! not as there it was spoken a punishment or contempt to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but as a Mystery of Reconciliation of Christ to thy Soul; and as <hi>Sanguis est rivus vitae,</hi> Bloud is the River of life, so shalt thou tast <hi>vitam in sanguine</hi> the fountain of everlasting life by the streame of that Bloud. <hi>Ego sum fons, ego sum vita,</hi> sayes our Saviour. I am the Well, and I am the life. When <hi>Sara</hi> was old, and dead to worldly Affections, she bare <hi>Isaac</hi> the Child of Promise. If thou hast not mortified in thee worldly Affections, thou shalt never arrive at the Joy of the Spirit. Therefore we faint not, saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed dayly. 2. Cor. 4. 16. Therefore if any man be in Christ, let him be a new creature. Old things are passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Behold all things are become new. verse. 17.</p>
                        <p>Does thine Eye offend thee? Pluck it out. Prevent occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that's the sence of the Letter, according to the most Learned Expositors; and hath coherence with the other parts of holy Scripture. Art thou libidinous? Fasting is the best Castration. Throw thy Pride in the Fire! Drown
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57958:138"/>
thy lust in thy Tears! Make away thy self from the World to God-ward! Not by killing of thy self in Body, but by Mortifying thy Concupiscences, and Appetite in thy Members to evil. <hi>Sic nec alter;</hi> so not otherwise is Self-killing lawful.</p>

                        <p>A Farme signifies with us House, or Land, or Both, taken by Indenture of Lease, or Lease parol, which is a Lease by word of mouth, as it is vulgarly said; <hi>Firma</hi> from the Latine word <hi>Firmus,</hi> for <hi>locare ad firmum,</hi> is as much as to set, or let to farm.

And so we take it here, but more largely, as a benefit bestowed by the Lord of All, who is the free Giver of all good Gifts, reserving all pure right, and property to himself, that all his Creatures may have their due, and fit dependency upon him, being to him tenants at Will.</p>

And Resignation had wont to be made into the hands of the King, as well as of the Diocesan, because he had <hi>Supremam authoritatem Ecclesiasticam,</hi> as the Pope had in times past.</p>

Hearts strive to outvie one another in actions of love, the more to manifest their clear affections to the same. Alms are not onely charitable deeds unto the Poore, which is a necessary and excellent Christian duty, but an obedience to that commandment of Christ, Love one another; with a strong reason to back it. For if thou lovest not thy Brother, whom thou hast seen, how canst thou love God, whom thou hast not seen. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> gives his sence of dealing of Alms very apposite to this purpose: <hi>Qui vult ordinate dare elcemosynam, à seipso debet incipere, et eam fibi primò dare.</hi> He that would well order the Dispose of his Alms, must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at himself.

                        <p n="6">6. <hi>That river which in poast does go,</hi> &amp;c.] Here under the Allegory of a River, the Rain, and the Sea, is described the nature and manner of a Christian Self-Resignation. As the River pays its tribute unto the Ocean for what it hath received from its bounty, conveyed up through the earth to the head, and rising fountain of the River. The Sea likewise that is in position above the earth, from its immense abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance returneth a continual supply for such thankfulness, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, return, and resignation; and as the waters send up their vapours in clouds to heaven, Heaven poureth down his Blessings in showres to refresh the waters, and supply the Rivers, that in Love resign themselves unto the Sea again. God is resembled by that bottomlesse sea, that unsearchable Abysse, whose inscrutable paths are past finding out. The sea is a glass of the Deity, in which man may by the weakness of expression to sense in a manner behold, and have some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in his mind, of the otherwise incomprehensible Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. The River is man, that as it were flows from his Creation: His soul, as the River is the Representation of the floud of the sea, is in likenesse according to the image of God his Creator, from whom it hath its spirituality, and immortality; for the very damned shall live for ever, though tis an everlasting death in such a Life, by torment, and the privation of such blisse as the blessed shall enjoy. The Clouds denote contentedness of resignation in parting with its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Place, the element of Waters, the World. The people therein are a heap of Waters that Tide it to and fro in their several generations. The fury of a multitude is compared in Scriptures to the raging of waters.</p>
                        <p>The River and the Sea even in obedience to the sun, send up their waters in vapours, as his beams id a manner please
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57958:149"/>
to summon. For which resignation are poured down again from the Firmament sweet waters, like blessings, in showres and rain, that raise the streams of the River, fattening the neighbouring grounds with the abundance of heavens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed bounty; and as it were dancing over their before confining banks for joy in the after smiling meadows, and poast it floud away unto the Sea, in earnestness of desire to carry news of what it's more than Channel could contain hath yet received, and to communicate with the waves of the Sea, their swelling felicity; yet in the Rivers Semicircling and Meandring courses, it appeareth to embrace the earth with seeming expression of Love and kindness, by its fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent windings, as in charity with the world; but leaves it yet with a carelesse farewel, being earnestly bent forward in its course without so much as looking back upon the Hills, or making the least shew of any returning. Which still more and more sets forth that free Resignation of the Christian of himself, and whatsoever he hath received, unto the Lord that gave it, which procures from him blessings still more and more to distill upon him, and obtains the pouring down upon him the sweetness of spiritual rejoycings, and graces, which make fruitful in good works, and put into his heart such a contempt of the Hills, of the greatness of the world, that with chearfulness he passeth away without any regret at parting, and hasteth onward to his home, to Heaven the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of his happinesse.</p>

Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, with reverence presented unto God, is an humble argument of a Christian repentance. Resignation of the Will, a ready discovery of the Souls devotion; the first a fair preparer for pardon, the last a great prevailer for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection at the Throne of mercy. Submission attracts Gods eye of mercy towards us. Resignation opens the hand of his blessings upon us. Suhmission makes the Will an Altar for the soul; Self-resignation offers the whole man upon that Altar. Without Submission there can be no Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Without self-Resignation, no perfection of Faith in a Christian.</p>

                        <p>THere is no action, but tendeth to its end. By that we judge whether it be Virtuous, or dishonest; Worthy or base. Of Causes the finall is the Noble. For as the Efficient gives Motion, and the Formal gives Essence to the matter, So the Final gives the Judgement, and Appellation of all things: And this doth <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that <hi>Princeps Philosopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> among the Philosophers, in his first Book of his Ethicks make good: <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>That therefore seems to please men most, that may yield them joy and safety. Without joy, safety is no more than a still misery; without safety, joy is but a laughing danger. Joy without safety, has too great a Spirit for a weak Body; Safety without joy, has too strong a Body for a distemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind. But this is rather Supposititious than Real; A Chimaera in fancie, more than a thing in Nature. It is but the Picture of joy, that has not safety; And it is but an Apparition of safety, wherein there is no Joy.</p>

                        <p>Such a Glass of Deception is the world to humane eyes, cozening with false resemblances the weak imaginations of erring men.</p>
                        <p>Why else seek we for joy in riches? or safety in strength? Why do we lullaby our Fancies in the lap of Pleasures? and think there is Security in Ambition? When Joy dwells in Heaven, and Peace is flown from off the Earth. Regret at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends Delight; And Check of Conscience treads upon the hels of sinful Desire. No Comfort; No Repose but in Piety: No Safety, but in Divine Protection. Why then plant we so many sorts of a New-found Paradise? Why labour we so incessantly? and inconsiderately hope for a full Harvest in vain? Why rage we, when we misse our Purposes, as though we might be Masters of our own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Why cry we out of Sicknesse, as though it were a Phrensie? Why hate we our brethren's Infirmitie? And increase our own by shunning another's weaknesse, as if it were the Plague? Why are our Burthens intollerable, when we laid them upon our own shoulders? Why account we so irreverently? and are so ignorant of the Deitie, when
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57958:156"/>
we professe our selves Christians? Why war we against Heaven with our perverse Wills, and so add to the heap of our Sins, by our frowardnesse still more to provoke the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty? when there is no Rest to be found upon Earth, but in God? Nor any Safety but under the shadow of His Wings. What conceive we of His wonderful Wisdom that prefer our own imaginations before It? Why raise we our Vain Desire against His most Holy Pleasure? and make the Rebellion of our Hearts to be as the Sin of Witchcraft? Why fondly hast we to every Bush for shelter? Or think we to avoid the storme by the nimblenesse of our failing Feet?</p>
                        <p>Come then my sad Companion in distresse! My other Self in Misery! Sit thee down by me! Sit thee down, and rest thee! Many say, who will shew us any good. But Lord, lift up thy countenance upon us. Thou hast given me more joy of Heart, than they have had when their wheat, and their Wine did abound. I will lay me down; and also sleep in peace. For Thou, Lord, onely makest me to dwell in Safety.</p>
                        <p>Hath the Lord humbled thee? and set thee down in the shadow? Hath he besieged thee with many Troubles? Hath he beset thee with a multitude of Afflictions? Is there no way to escape? Doe His Arrowes fly about thee. O consider, what thou hast deserved! Remember, that His Patience is wonderfull! and His loving Kindnesse above measure! His Corrections are gentle; and His Mercies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail those that trust in him. His Straightnings are Life; and His Goodnesse surpasseth understanding. Why holdest out? And giv'st not up the Place? Resigne!</p>
                        <p>Hath <hi>Abraham</hi> but one Son? His Joy? His onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? And must <hi>Isaac</hi> be a Sacrifice? Were there not Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel enough among all the Herds for one Offering? Nor a nearer place, than a strange Countrey for an Altar? Must
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57958:156"/>
he travaile to his Losse? the Losse of his onely Son? his beloved? And must that come by his own hand too? And was his obedience without grutching? with cheerfulnesse? Without question? O how great was his Faith! But what followed? The stroak was restrained, <hi>Isaac</hi> saved; a Ram presented, and in his stead offered; <hi>Abraham</hi> proved, and approved. For so calls the Angel of the Lord from heaven, <hi>Abraham! Abraham!</hi> Lay not thine hand upon the Child! Neither do any thing unto him! For now I know, that thou fearest God; Seing for My sake thou hast not spared thine onely Son. O the infinite mercy of the Lord! He is tender, and full of compassion. Is He the onely stay, and Refuge? Withstand him not! Submit! Resigne!</p>
                        <p>Whither is <hi>Ionas</hi> run? from his Message? from the Lord, that sent him to Ninive? Can a ship hide him? Or the Sea promise him Safety? He runs from a Calm to a Storm; From the God of peace and power to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie of the Creature. Is a Lot better, than a Portion? Or a Whal's Belly a more pleasing Entertainment, than a City? Is the Deep more comfortable, than the brightnesse of the Heavens? Or a dying habitation in the Living more to be esteemed, than a lively Publication of God's warning to those, that were otherwise appointed to dy? Let every <hi>Ionas,</hi> that is out of the way, turn againe! For the Lord is gracious; and His Mercy endureth for ever. Alas for thee! Murmur not! Keep not thy Will! Let it not be thine own! Resigne!</p>

                        <p>DOwns are an open Place of intermixed Hills and Dals, commonly upon the Coast and many times in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; Where somtimes they are a rising Ridg of Hills and Valleys, whose free and pleasant scope overtop and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the neighbouring inferiour Countrey. And from the declining and ascending position of the Earth as the high and more swelling Waves in the deeper Seas are not unlikely to have derived their name from their seeming to carry their Passengers over them up and down. These for their healthful Ayr, by their Loftinesse, pleasant prospect, by their open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and smooth Turf for their Evenesse, do often invite in the delightfull seasons of the Year Persons of quality and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57958:164"/>
leisure to take the Ayr upon them, and to spend some time in recreation. Horsmen choose such places thereupon to make and run races with their swiftest Coursers to try their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, wind, and swiftnesse of their Heels; Such are New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market Heath, or Bainstead Downs. They are called the Downs of Cogitation. Because Thoughts are full of motion and uncertainty, that have their erection and dejection upon the Mind; as the first Stanza mentions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>From hill to hill we goe &amp;c.]</hi> Here is a Comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Downs and the Waves of the Sea; Both much agreeing in their resemblances with one another; And both expressing the manner of Cogitation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>All ore this flowry place &amp;c.]</hi> The pleasure of Thoughts is compared in this Stanza to Flowers; their subtility and quicknesse to the nimble flight of Swallowes. And here Swallowes seeme to be matched as Coursers to expresse in a poeticall manner both the pleasure and swiftnesse of Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation together.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Out from Thelema's Cave &amp;c.]</hi> Here is first described the origination and purification of Cogitation. <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> is <hi>Voluntas,</hi> the Will and Affection, from whence Thoughts as Waters out of the head of a Spring do take their rise, and have their flux. As the Heart is, such are the Thoughts, And that is <hi>Thelema's</hi> Cave in the side of the Downs, the Man; This being taken from that vulgar, though not true opinion according to Anatomists, that the Heart is placed in the left side of the Body. A Generous Heart dresseth or setteth forth the Thoughts in Gallantry, and Noblenesse. So ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>Dianoia,</hi> Cogitation, fair and beautifull, when Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the Heart, and Charity in the Hand, which is an unbound Book, the obedience unto Holy Writ, ready to be dispensed according to active piety. Thoughts seem awaked, when drawn out of the sleep of Sin, and darknesse of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Sitting is a Posture of steadinesse and Recollection. Thoughts dwell in a Waggon as the old Scythians, that never
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57958:164"/>
used Houses, but such Receptacles, as might more properly be call'd their Moveables than their Habitations. Silent wheels is the imperceptibility of Thought. Drawn with Dromeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is their velocity, as also the tenacity by Cogitation of things first apprehended. For though a Dromedary be a kind of Cammell, it differs in <hi>dorso;</hi> The Cammel has a Bunch on his Back, the Dromedary two Fins as I may call them, the one near his Wallis, the other more backward to the Chine, both upon the Ridg of his back, which fall down loose upon his sides without weight, and rise and claspe in an imposed Burden. With an unperceived Pace Dromedaries move with great strength and swiftnesse. Whereupon <hi>Livie</hi> reciteth them, as very usefull in Warlike expeditions. <hi>His utebantur praecipuè in bellicis expeditionibus.</hi> And <hi>Curtius</hi> in his 7. booke mentions that <hi>Polydamus</hi> was sent by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> for the more speed upon Dromedaries by the unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented passages of <hi>media per occulta, et squalida tesqua</hi> to dispatch <hi>Parmenio.

The Causes of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication are; first the Efficient, which is the principall: and that is the Grace of God, which instrumentally is conveyed unto us by the means of Faith obtained by the hearing of Gods revealed Will, and understanding the same from the Preaching and reading of this written word.

The Forme is the renewing of our minds, our wills, and Affections; The End is the Glory of God, the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Election, conversion of others, and the rejoycing of Saints, Angels, and Men. The Effects of Sanctification are good works. The proper purpose therefore is Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the best directer of the Thoughts. For from evill Thoughts proceed bad words, and worse Actions. Powring of Oyle is a hallowing of the Mind.

The Tongue seemeth the more desperate, but the Hand appeareth the more dangerous. What is spoken may be helped by Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Mistaking, or Disagreement in the Reporters, or Death. For then Breath and Life vanish together; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that of the Hand appeareth to Posterity, surviveth the Writer, and Reader, and remaineth as a Thousand Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.

indiscreet that leaveth a loose Action under his own Hand; which a man ought with special care to avoid, lest it become a snare to take his want of foresight. Wherefore as no Vice layes a more foul aspersion upon Man, then that of Ingratitude; So no evidence is so strong to taint him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or convict him thereof, as his own Hand-writing in Detestation of that Vice, and his Actual Approbation of the Contrary.</p>
                        <p>How comes it then, that Christians, that have so often set their Hands to so many Obligations to God, as have been so often iterated in, and since Baptisme, should fall away in such a manner, as by the Wickednesse of their Hands, and the ungodlinesse of their impudent Actions to testifie against themselves their own Impiety, and to divulge abroad the Characters of their not lesse great, than Abominable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude; To unman themselves by ingratitude to their Maker; to unchristian themselves by unthankfulnesse to their Redeemer; when the least that can be done in such a Case is, to render Obedience for Creation, Dutie for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and to return Praise for Blessings.</p>
                        <p>Do the Dumb Beasts give Thanks in their Looks, and cast their Eyes unto the Hands that feed them? Shall condemn'd <hi>Androgeo</hi> finde Gratitude in a Den of Lions? And can any Christian be at a Losse, when he Looks for it in his Bosom?</p>
                        <p>My Friend! and Brother Christian! <hi>Ubi animus, ibi ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> The Watch of thine Eye goeth, as the Spring of thine Affection directeth. Let's mark our Blessed Saviours advice: He preacht it in the Mount. Lay not up Treasures for your selves upon the Earth, where the Moth and Canker corrupt, and where the Theeves dig through and steal: But lay up Treasures for your Selves in Heaven, where neither the Moth, nor Canker corrupteth, and where the Theeves nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57958:170"/>
dig through, nor steal. For, where your Treasure is, there will your Heart be also.</p>
                        <p>Hast thou had a dejected Look from a heavie Heart? as if th' adst lost thy Comfort, and couldst not finde thy Happinesse? Didst seek it in the Earth? that Treasure is not in Mines; nor in the Darknesse of so dull an Element. Look upward, Soul! Look upward! and be thankful! Look upward! and be mindful! Be mindful of all, that the Lord so wonderfully hath done for Thee, so mercifully hath done unto Thee, so bountifully hath bestowed upon Thee. Strive to turn thine Eyes towards him from Vanitie; And intreat His help to quicken thee in his Way.</p>
                        <p>Canst thou tell the number of his Mercies? Canst thou tell how many be the Rays of the Sun? And canst thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider all his Blessings? Look up! and rejoyce at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Goodnesse of the Lord! Look up with the Eyes of Faith through the Heavens! and behold the Brightnesse of His Glory that he hath prepared for the Saints! Meditate! and Look all about Thee! Contemplate! and cast up thine Eyes above Thee! Here is Comfort. There is Joy. Here Christ easeth thy Burden. There he gives Thee a reward.</p>
                        <p>Observe then his Testimonies! and obey his Statutes! Let thy Soul then magnifie his Name! Let thy Lips sing Praises to his Holinesse! Let thy Breast become a smoaking Altar! And let thy Soul be all a flame of holy Love! Let all thy Breath be as sweet smelling Incense up to Heaven! Fix there thy Faith! thy Hope! thy Heart! thy Soul! That's thy Place, thy dwelling. Hasten as directed thither! Only remember thou art Mortal! Deal thine Alms! Give thy Dole before thou goest!</p>
                        <p>Praise ye the Lord! For it is good to sing unto our God. For it is a pleasant Thing; and Praise is comely. The Lord doth build up Jerusalem, and gather together the disper<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

bindeth up their Sores. He counteth the number of the Stars, and calleth them all by their Names. Great is our Lord, and great is his Power, his Wisdom is infinite. The Lord relieiveth the meek, and abaseth the wicked to the Ground. Sing unto the Lord with Praise! Sing upon the Harp unto our God!</p>
