            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Translators PREFACE TO THE READER, Shewing what Credit may be given to the Matter of Fact related in the ensuing Narrative.</head>
            <p>THat we are to believe nothing, but what we have seen, is a rule so false, that we dare not call our selves rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and avouch it; yet as irrational as the Maxim is, 'tis become modish with some Men, and those no very mean Wits neither, to make use of it; and though they will hardly own it in its full Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, yet when it comes to Particulars, let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the contrary be never so pregnant or convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, they'll hugg it as their sacred Anchor, and laugh at all those credulous Wretches, that without


<pb facs="tcp:33084:3"/>
seeing, are so easily chous'd into an imprudent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. And this pitiful Stratagem we find practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in no affair so much, as that of Spirits and Witches, and Apparitions, which must all be Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Hypocondriack Dreams, and the effects of distempered Brains, because their own are so dull as not to be able to pierce into those Mysteries. I do not deny but the Imagination may be, and is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time deluded; and melancholy People may fancy they hear Voices, and see very strange things, which have no other foundation but their own weakness, and like Bubbles break into Air, and nothing, by their own vanity.</p>
            <p>Yet as no man doth therefore take unpolisht Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds to be Pebbles, because they do look like them, so neither must all passages of this nature, we hear or read of, be traduced as self-conceit, or derided as Old Wives Fables, because some smell strong of Imposture and Sophistication. We believe men of Reason and Experience, and free from Fumes, when a person of ordinary Intellectuals finds no great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with us; and if we think our selves wise for so doing, why should any Man so much forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as to be an Infidel in point of such Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's, when even the most judicious men have had experience of such passages? It seems to me no less than madness to contradict what both wise and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Men do unanimously agree in; and how Jews, Heathens, Mahometans, and Christians, both learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unlearned, should come to conspire into this Cheat, as yet seems to me unaccountable. If some


<pb facs="tcp:33084:3"/>
few melancholy Monks, or old Women had seen such Ghosts and Apparitions, we might then suspect, that what they pretend to have seen might be nothing, but the effect of a disordered Imagination; but when the whole World, as it were, and Men of all Religions, Men of all Ages too, have been forced by strong evidences, to acknowledge the truth of such occurrences, I know not what strength there can be in the Argument, drawn from the consent of Nations in things of a sublimer nature, if here it be of no efficacy. Men that have attempted to evade the places of Scripture, which speak of Ghosts and Witches; we see, how they are forced to turn and wind the Texts, and make in a manner Noses of Wax of them, and rather squeeze than gather the sence, as if the holy Writers had spoke like Sophisters, and not like Men, who made it their business to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to the capacity of the Common people. Let a man put no force at all on those passages of holy Writ, and then try what sence they are like to yield. It's strange to see, how some Men have endeavoured to elude the Story of the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi>; and as far as I can judge, play more Hocus-pocus tricks in the explication of that passage, than the Witch herself did in raising the deceased <hi>Samuel.</hi> To those Straits is Falshood driven, while Truth loves Plain, and undisguised Expressions; and Errour will seek out Holes and Labyrinths to hide it self, while Truth plays above-board, and scorns the subterfuges of the Sceptick Interpreter. Men and Brethren, why should it seem a thing incredible with you, that God should permit Spirits to appear,


<pb facs="tcp:33084:4"/>
and the Devil to exert his Power among Men on Earth? Hath God ever engaged his Word to the contrary? Or is it against the nature of Spirits to form themselves new Vehicles and visible shapes, or to animate grosser substances to shew themselves to Mortals upon certain occasions?</p>
            <p>I am so much a Prophet, as to foresee what will be the fate of the ensuing story, nor can I suppose that upon the reading of it, Mens verdicts will be much changed from what they were, if they have set up this resolution, to believe nothing that looks like the shadow of an Apparition, though the things mentioned here, cannot be unknown to any that have been conversant with foreign Affairs of late years. And though there cannot be a greater evidence, than the testimony of a whole Kingdom, yet your nicer Men will think it a disparagement to them to believe it; nor will it ever extort As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from any, that build the reputation of their wit upon contradicting what hath been received by the vulgar.</p>
            <p>The passages here related wrought so great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation, not onely on the Natives, but Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers too, that the Heer <hi>Christian Rumpf,</hi> then Resident for the <hi>States General</hi> at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> thought himself obliged to send away his little Son for <hi>Holland,</hi> lest he should be endangered by those villanous practices, which seem'd to threaten all the Inhabitants of the Kingdom. And be that doubts of it, may be satisfied at Dr. <hi>Harrel</hi>'s in St. <hi>James's Park,</hi> to whom the Letter was written. And a friend of mine in Town, being then in <hi>Holstein,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members


<pb facs="tcp:33084:4"/>
very well that the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> sent an Express to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to know the truth of this famous Witchcraft: To whom the <hi>King</hi> modestly replied, That his <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi> had caused divers Men, Women, and Children to be Burnt and Executed upon such preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Evidences, as were brought before them; but whether the Actions they confessed, and which were proved against them, were real, or onely effects of strong Imagination, he was not as yet able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>Add to all this, that the Circumstances mentioned in the ensuing Narrative, as I am informed, are at this day to be seen in the Royal Chancery at <hi>Stockholm</hi>; and a person of my acquaintance offered me to procure Copy of them under the hands of publick Registers, if I desired it: Not to mention that in the year 72. Baron <hi>Sparr,</hi> who was sent Embassador from the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> did upon his word aver the matter of Fact recorded here, to be undoubtedly true, to several persons of Note and Eminency, with other particulars, stranger than those set down in these Papers. And to this purpose divers Letters were sent from <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh</hi> to several persons here in <hi>London</hi>; insomuch, that should a Man born in, or acquainted with those parts, hear any person dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the truth of it, he would wonder where people have lived, or what sullen humour doth possess them, to disbelieve that, which so many thousands in that Kingdom have felt the sad effect of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:33084:5"/>Since the first Edition, it hath been my fortune to be acquainted with the Lord <hi>Leyonberg,</hi> Envoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary from the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> living in <hi>York</hi> Buildings, with whom discoursing about these Affairs, I found that the Account he gave, agreed for the most part with what is mentioned in the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; and because his Testimony, being a publick Person, may be of some moment in a thing relating to that Kingdom, I have here set it down in his own words.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:33084:5"/>I do not take upon me to justifie the Truth of what the Witches said, for dealing with the Father of Lies, it's probable, Veracity is not a Vertue, that they greatly study, yet that the Devil speaks truth sometimes, is a thing so far from being impossible, that if we give credit to the Sacred History, we must grant that all, he saith, is not False, or Erroneous. All, I design at this time, is only to suggest, that it is not altogether irrational to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that he or his Emissaries are capable of such Actions and Pranks, as are related in these Papers.</p>
            <p>That a Spirit can lift up Men and Women, and grosser Substances, and convey them through the Air, I question no more, than I doubt that the Wind can overthrow Houses, or drive Stones, and other heavy Bodies upward from their Centre. And were I to make a person of a dull understanding, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the nature of a Spirit, I would represent it to him under the Notion of an <hi>Intelligent Wind,</hi> or a strong Wind, informed by a highly Rational Soul; as a Man may be called an intelligent piece of Earth. And this Notion <hi>David</hi> seemed to favour, when speaking of these Creatures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.4. he tells us, that God makes his Angels <hi>Wind,</hi> for in the original it's <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and most certainly, if they be so, they must be reasonable windy substances; nor doth the expression, which immediately follows in that Verse, cross this exposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That he makes his Ministers a flaming Fire; for it's no new opinion, that some of those invisible Substances are of a Fiery, and others of an Airy Nature; and as we see, God gives Rational Creatures here on Earth, Bodies com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>posed of grosser Matter, why should it seem incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous


<pb facs="tcp:33084:6"/>
for him to give Rational Creatures above us, Bodies of a subtiler and thinner Matter, or such Matter, as those higher Regions do afford? and if Wind breaking forth from the Cavernes of Hills, and Mountains have such force, as makes us very often stand amazed at the effects, what <hi>Energy</hi> might we suppose to be in Wind, were it inform'd by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or a Reasonable Being?</p>
            <p>And though I cannot comprehend the Philosophy of the Devils committing <hi>Venereal Acts,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Children, and those Children upon their Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation bringing forth Toads and Serpents, yet I can very rationally conceive, that having more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power over Matter, he can either animate dead Bodies, and by the help of them commit those Villanies, which modesty bids us to conceal; or some other way compound, and thicken Atomes into what shape he pleases, especially if he meet with no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance from a higher power. And he that was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as we see in the Gospel, to possess and actuate living Men, and do with them almost what he pleased, why may not he commit wickedness by such Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and cast Mists before the Witches eyes, that they may not know who they are? And he that could in <hi>Aegypt</hi> produce Frogs, either real or counterfeit ones, Why may not he be supposed to be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such Toads and Serpents out of any mishapen Creatures, and lumps of Matter, of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, at least represent the shapes of them to the deluded Witches, that they shall imagine them to be really such things, as they seem to be. Nor is this to be admired in the Devil more than Tricks are in Juglers, who by slight of Art


<pb facs="tcp:33084:6"/>
can represent things to the ignorant Spectator, which he shall be ready to swear to be real, though they are nothing less, and I suppose we may allow the the Devill a greater degree of cunning, than an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Jugler.</p>
            <p>However, Spirits that know the nature of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial things better than the deepest Philosophers, and understand better, how things are joyned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and what the Ingredients of terrestrial Productions are, and see things (grosser things at least) in their first principles, and have power over the Air, and other Elements, and have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand ways of shaping things and representing them to the external Senses of vicious Men, what may not they be supposed to be able to do, (if they have but Gods permission to exert their power) and that God doth sometimes permit such things, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe, who read what signs and wonders <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi> wrought by the power of darkness, and how not a few men sin to that degree, that God suffers them to be led Captive by the Devil, and dooms them to that slavery we read of in the <hi>Revelation, He that is filthy, let him be filthy still.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Spirits by being Devils do not lose their nature; and let any man in sober sadness consider, what Spirits are said to be able to do in Scripture, and what they have done, and compare those passages with what is said in the following Relation, and he will not think those things, the Witches confessed, altogether impossible.</p>
            <p>Yet still, as I said before, I do not pretend to be their Advocate, but shall leave it to the Reader to judge of the truth, or untruth of their Confessions, as


<pb facs="tcp:33084:7"/>
he sees occasion, only beg of him not to condemn eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing as a falshood, before due consideration of what Spirits are capable of doing.</p>
            <p>That in so great a multitude as were Accused, Condemned, and Executed for Witches, there might be some who suffered unjustly, and owed their death more to the Malice of their Neighbours, than to their skill in the Black Art, I will readily grant; nor will I deny, that when the News of these Transactions, and how the Children bewitched, fell into Fits, and strange unusual Postures, spread abroad in the Kingdom, some fearful and credulous people, if they saw their Children any way disordered, might think they were bewitched, or ready to be carried away by Imps; This happens in all consternations, and our fears make us see that, which unbyassed Eyes cannot perceive; and of this a Gentleman who was an Ear-witness, gave me this instance, of a Ministers Child of his acquaintance not far from <hi>Stockholm,</hi> who being told, and assured by his Wife, that the Child was carried to <hi>Blockula</hi> every night, and convey'd back into his bed again, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to sit up with the Boy, and see whether any Devil durst be so bold as to snatch him out of his arms. The Child went to Bed, and between twelve and one of the Clock at night, began to groan in his sleep, and seemed to shiver a little, at the sight whereof the Mother began to weep and mourn, thinking that the Child was just going to be snatcht away, but her Husband smiling at the Conceit, and pleading with her, that the Childs laying his arms out of Bed might be the cause of these symptomes, took the Child in his arms, and there kept him till towards two or three of the Clock, but no Spirit came or medled with him,


<pb facs="tcp:33084:7"/>
yet was his Wife so possessed with the conceit, or fear of transportation, that his strongest Arguments could scarce make her believe the contrary; and the same person, (a near Relation of the aforesaid Envoy) added, how much malice and ill nature was able to effect, whereof he gave this example, which himself saw, and could testifie the truth of, <hi>viz.</hi> how in the year, 1676. at <hi>Stockholme,</hi> a young Woman accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her own Mother of being a Witch, and swore positively, that she had carried her away at night; whereupon both the Judges and Ministers of the Town exhorted her to Confession and Repentance; But she stifly denied the Allegations, pleaded Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and though they burnt another Witch before her face, and lighted the fire, she her self was to burn in, before her, yet she still justified her self, and continued to do so to the last, and continuing so, was burnt. She had indeed been a very bad Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but it seems this crime she was free from, for within a fortnight, or three weeks after, her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which had accused her, came to the Judges in open Court (weeping and howling) and confessed that she had wronged her Mother, and unjustly out of a spleen, she had against her for not gratifying her in a thing, she desired, had charged her with that Crime which she was as innocent of, as the Child unborn; whereupon the Judges gave order for her execution too.</p>
            <p>There is no publick Calamity, but some ill people will serve themselves of the sad Providence, and make use of it for their own ends, as Thieves, when a House or Town is on fire, will steal and filch what they can; yet as there is no Fable, but hath some


<pb facs="tcp:33084:8"/>
Foundation in History, so when wicked people make use of such Arguments against the persons they hate, it's a sign there was such a thing, that gave them occasion to fix the calumny; and had not such things been done before, they could not have any colour for their Villany.</p>
            <p>I could add a known passage, that happen'd in the year 1659. at <hi>Crossen</hi> in <hi>Silesia,</hi> of an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's Servant. The chief Magistrate of that Town at that time was the Princess <hi>Elizabeth Charlotta,</hi> a person famous in her generation. In the Spring of the year one <hi>Christopher Monigk,</hi> a Native of <hi>Serbest,</hi> a Town belonging to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> Servant to an Apothecary, died and was buried with the usual Ceremonies of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church. A few days after his decease, a Shape exactly like him in face, clothes, stature, meen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> appeared in the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Shop, where he would set himself down, and walk sometimes, and take the Boxes, Pots, Glasses off of the Shelves, and set them again in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and sometimes try, and examine the goodness of the Medicines, weigh them in a pair of Scales, pound the Drugs with a mighty noise in a Mortar, nay, serve the people, that came with their Bills to the Shop, take their Money, and lay it up safe in the Counter; in a word, do all things that a Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in such cases uses to do. He looked very ghastly upon those, that had been his fellow Servants, who were afraid to say any thing to him; and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster being sick at that time of the Gout, he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten very troublesome to him, would take the Bills that were brought him, out of his hand, snatch away the Candle sometimes, and put it behind the Stove; At


<pb facs="tcp:33084:8"/>
last, he took a Cloak that hung in the Shop, put it on and walked abroad, but minding no body in the Streets, went along, entred into some of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens Houses, and thrust himself into company, especially of such as he had formerly known, yet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted no body, nor spoke to any one but to a Maid servant, whom he met hard by the Church-yard, and desired to go home to his Masters house, and dig in a Ground-chamber, where she would find an inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treasure; but the Maid amazed at the sight of him, sounded; whereupon he lift her up, but left such a mark upon her Flesh with lifting her, that it was to be seen for some time after. The Maid ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recovered her self, went home, but fell despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately sick upon't, and in her sickness discovered what <hi>Monigk</hi> had said to her; and accordingly they digged in the place, she had named, but found nothing but an old decayed Pot, with a <hi>Haematites</hi> or Blood-Stone in it. The Princess hereupon caused the young Mans body to be digged up, which they found putrified with purulent Matter, flowing from it; and the Master being advised to remove the young Mans Goods, Linnen, Clothes, and things, he left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him when he died, out of the House, the Spirit thereupon left the House, and was heard of no more. And this some people now living will take their Oath upon, who very well remember they saw him after his decease, and the thing being so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius, there was instituted a publick Disputation about it in the Academy of <hi>Leipsig</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">By reason of my absence from the Press, there was a mistake in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Edition where it is <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg.</hi>
               </note> by one <hi>Henry Conrad,</hi> who disputed for his Doctors De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the University. And this


<pb facs="tcp:33084:9"/>
puts me in mind of an Apothecary at <hi>Reichenbach</hi> in <hi>Silesia,</hi> about fifteen years ago (I had it from a very credible Witness) who after his death appeared to divers of his acquaintance, and cryed out, that in his life time he had poisoned several Men with his Drugs. Whereupon the Magistrates of the Town after consultation, took up his Body, and burnt it; which being done, the Spirit disappeared, and was seen no more. But if the Stories related in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Book are not sufficient to convince Men, I am sure an example from beyond Sea, will gain no credit. It's enough that I have shewn Reasons which may induce my Reader to believe that he is not imposed upon by the following Narrative; and that it is not in the nature of those Pamphlets, they cry about the Streets, containing very dreadful News from the Country, of Armies fighting in the Air.</p>

            <head>A RELATION OF THE Strange VVitchcraft Discovered in the Village <hi>Mohra</hi> in <hi>Swedeland,</hi> Taken out of the publick Register of the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners appointed by his Majesty the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to examine the whole business, in the Years of our Lord 1669. and 1670.</head>
            <p>THE News of this Witchcraft coming to the King's Ear, his Majesty was pleased to appoint Commissioners, some of the Clergy, and some of the Laity, to make a Journey to the Town aforesaid, and to examine the whole busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and accordingly the Examination was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be on the 13th of <hi>August</hi>; and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners met on the 12th instant, in the said Village, at the Parsons House, to whom both the Minister and several people of fashion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained with tears in their Eyes, of the miserable


<pb facs="tcp:33084:10"/>
condition they were in, and therefore begg'd of them to think of some way, whereby they might be delivered from that Calamity. They gave the Commissioners very strange Instances of the Devils Tyranny among them; how by the help of Witches, he had drawn some Hundreds of Children to him, and made them subject to his power; how he hath been seen to go in a visible shape through the Country, and appeared daily to the people; how he had wrought upon the poorer sort, by presenting them with Meat and Drink, and this way allured them to himself, with other circumstances to be mentioned hereafter. The Inhabitants of the Village added, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great lamentations, that though their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had told all, and themselves sought God ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earnestly by Prayer, yet they were carried away by him; and therefore begg'd of the Lords Commissioners to root out this hellish Crew, that they might regain their former rest and quietness; and the rather, because the Children which used to be carried away in the County or District of <hi>Elfdale,</hi> since some Witches had been burnt there, remained unmolested.</p>
            <p>That day, <hi>i. e.</hi> the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> being the last Humiliation-day Instituted by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for removing of this Judgment, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners went to Church, where there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a considerable Assembly both of young and old: the Children could read most of them, and sing Psalms, and so could the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, though not with any great zeal or fervor. There were preached two Sermons that day, in


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33084:10"/>
which the miserable case of those people, that suffered themselves to be deluded by the Devil, was laid open; and these Sermons were at last concluded with very fervent prayer.</p>
            <p>The Publick Worship being over, all the people of the Town were called together to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons House, near Three thousand of them. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence being commanded, the Kings Commission was read publickly in the hearing of them all, and they were charged under very great Penalties to conceal nothing of what they knew, and to say nothing but the truth; those especially, who were guilty, that the Children might be delivered from the Clutches of the Devil. They all promised obedience; the guilty feignedly, but the guiltless weeping and crying bitterly.</p>
            <p>On the 14th of <hi>August</hi> the Commissioners met again, consulting how they might withstand this dangerous flood; after long deliberation, an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der also coming from his Majesty, they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to execute such, as the matter of fact could be proved upon; Examination being made, there were discovered no less than Threescore and ten in the Village aforesaid, Three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which freely confessing their Crimes, were condemned to dye; the rest, one pretending she was with Child, and the other denying and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not guilty, were sent to <hi>Fahluna,</hi> where most of them were aftewards Executed.</p>
            <p>Fifteen Children which likewise confessed that they were engaged in this Witchery, died as the rest; Six and thirty of them between nine and sixteen years of age, who had been less guilty,


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33084:11"/>
were forced to run the gantlet; Twenty more, who had no great inclination, yet had been sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to those hellish Enterprizes, because they were very young, were condemned to be lash'd with Rods upon their hands, for three Sundays together at the Church-door; and the aforesaid Six and thirty were also doom'd to be lashed this way once a week for a whole year together. The number of the Seduced Children was about Three hundred.</p>
            <p>On the twenty fifth of <hi>August,</hi> Execution was done upon the notoriously guilty, the day being bright and glorious, and the Sun shining, and some thousands of people being present at the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle. The Order and Method observed in the Examination was thus:</p>
            <p>First, the Commissioners and the Neighbouring Justices went to prayer; this done, the Witches, who had most of them Children with them, which they either had Seduced, or attempted to Seduce, from four years of age to sixteen, were set before them. Some of the Children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained lamentably of the misery and mischief they were forced sometime to suffer of the Witches.</p>
            <p>The Children being asked whether they were sure, that they were at any time carried away by the Devil; they all declared they were, begging of the Commissioners that they might be freed from that intolerable slavery.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Witches themselves were asked, whether the Confessions of these Children were true, and admonished to confess the truth, that


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33084:11"/>
they might turn away from the Devil unto the living God. At first, most of them did very stifly, and without shedding the least tear deny it, though much against their will and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>After this, the Children were Examined, every one by themselves, to see whether their Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions did agree or no; and the Commissioners found that all of them, except some very little ones, who could not tell all the Circumstances, did punctually agree in the confession of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Commissioners that were of the Clergy examined the Witches, but could not bring them to any Confession, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing stedfast in their denials, till at last some of them burst out into tears, and their Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agreed with what the Children had said. And these expressed their abhorrency of the fact, and begg'd pardon; adding, that the Devil, whom they call'd <hi>Loeyta,</hi> had stopt the Mouths of some of them, and stopt the Ears of others; and being now gone from them, they could no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it, for they now perceived his Treachery.</p>
            <p>The Confession which the Witches made in <hi>Elfdale,</hi> to the Judges there, agreed with the Confession they made at <hi>Mohra</hi>: and the chief things they confessed, consisted in these three points.</p>

                           <p>WE of the Province of <hi>Elfdale,</hi> do confess that we used to go to a Gravel-pit which lay hard by a cross-way, and there we put on a Vest over our heads, and then danced round, and after this ran to the cross-way, and called the Devil thrice, first with a still voice, the second time somewhat louder, and the third time very loud, with these words, <hi>Antecessor come and carry us to</hi> Blockula. Whereupon, immediately he used to appear, but in different Habits; but for the most part we saw him in a gray Coat, and red and blew Stockings: he had a red Beard, a high-crown'd Hat, with Linnen of divers colours wrapt about it, and long Garters upon his Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                           <p>Then he asked us, whether we would serve him with Soul and Body. If we were content to do so, he set us on a Beast which he had there ready, and carried us over Churches and high Walls; and after all, we came to a green Meadow, where <hi>Blockula</hi> lies. We must procure some scrapings of Altars, and filings of Church-Clocks; and then he gives us a horn with a Salve in it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we do anoint our selves; and a Saddle, with a Hammer and a wooden Nail, thereby to fix the Saddle; whereupon we call upon the Devil, and away we go.</p>

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:33084:12"/>Those that were of the Town of <hi>Mohra,</hi> made in a manner the same Declaration: Being asked whether they were sure of a real personal Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, and whether they were awake when it was done; they all answered in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, and that the Devil sometimes laid some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing down in the place that was very like them. But one of them confessed, that he did onely take away her strength, and her body lay still upon the ground; yet sometimes he took even her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with him.</p>
               <p>Being asked, how they could go with their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies through Chimneys and broken Panes of Glass, they said, that the Devil did first remove all that might hinder them in their flight, and so they had room enough to go.</p>
               <p>Others were asked, how they were able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so many Children with them; and they answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that when the Children were asleep they came into the Chamber, laid hold of the Children, which straightway did awake, and asked them whether they would go to a Feast with them? to which some answered, Yes, others, No; yet they were all forced to go. They only gave the Children a Shirt, a Coat and a Doublet, which was either red or blew, and so they did set them upon a Beast of the Devils providing, and then they rid away.</p>
               <p>The Children confessed the same thing; and some added, that because they had very fine clothes put upon them, they were very willing to go.</p>
               <p>Some of the Children concealed it from their


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33084:13"/>
Parents, but others discover'd it to them present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>The Witches declared moreover, that till of late they never had that power to carry away Children, but onely this year and the last, and the Devil did at this time force them to it; that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore it was sufficient to carry but one of their Children, or a strangers Child with them, which yet hapned seldom, but now he did plague them and whip them if they did not procure him Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, insomuch that they had no peace nor quiet for him; and whereas formerly one journey a week would serve turn, from their own Town to the place aforesaid, now they were forced to run to other Towns and Places for Children, and that they brought with them, some fifteen, some sixteen Children every night.</p>
               <p>For their Journey, they said they made use of all sorts of Instruments, of Beasts, of Men, of Spits and Posts, according as they had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: if they do ride upon Goats, and have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children with them, that all may have room, they stick a spit into the back-side of the Goat, and then are anointed with the aforesaid Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What the manner of their Journey is, God alone knows: Thus much was made out, That if the Children did at any time name the Names of those that had carried them away, they were again carried by force either to <hi>Blockula,</hi> or to the Cross-way, and there miserably beaten, insomuch that some of them died of it: and this some of the Witches confessed; and added, That now they


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33084:13"/>
were exceedingly troubled and tortured in their minds for it.</p>
               <p>The Children thus used lookt mighty bleak, wan, and beaten. The marks of the Lashes, the Judges could not perceive in them, except in one Boy, who had some Wounds and holes in his Back, that were given him with Thorns; but the Witches said, they would quickly vanish.</p>
               <p>After this usage the Children are exceeding weak; and if any be carried over-night, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not recover themselves the next day; and they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fall into fits, the coming of which they know by an extraordinary paleness that seizes on the Children; and if a fit comes upon them, they lean on their Mothers Arms, who sit up with them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all night; and when they observe the Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness coming, shake the Children, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>They observe further, That their Childrens Breasts grow cold at such times; and they take sometimes a burning Candle and stick it in their Hair, which yet is not burnt by it. They swoun upon this paleness, which Swoun lasteth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times half an hour, sometimes an hour, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two hours, and when the Children come to themselves again, they mourn and lament, and groan most miserably, and beg exceedingly to be eased: This two old men declared upon Oath before the Judges, and called all the Inhabitants of the Town to witness, as persons that had most of them experience of this strange Symptome of their Children.</p>
               <p>A little Girl of <hi>Elfdale</hi> confessed, That naming


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33084:14"/>
the name of <hi>IESUS</hi> as she was carried away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she fell suddenly upon the Ground, and got a great hole in her Side, which the Devil presently healed up again, and away he carried her; and to this day the Girl confessed, she had exceeding great pain in her Side.</p>
               <p>Another Boy confessed too, That one day he was carried away by his Mistress, and to perform the Journey he took his own Fathers Horse out of the Meadow where it was, and upon his return, she let the Horse go in her own ground.</p>
               <p>The next morning the Boys Father sought for his Horse, and not finding it, gave it over for lost; but the Boy told him the whole story, and so his Father fetcht the Horse back again; and this one of the Witches confessed.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>2. Of the place where they used to assemble, called <hi>Blockula,</hi> and what they did there.</head>
               <p>THey unanimously confessed, that <hi>Blockula</hi> is situated in a delicate large Meadow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you can see no end. The place or house they met at, had before it a Gate painted with divers colours; through this Gate they went into a little Meadow distinct from the other, where the Beasts went, that they used to ride on: But the Men whom they made use of in their Journey, stood in the House by the Gate in a slumbering posture, sleeping against the Wall.</p>
               <p>In a huge large Room of this House, they said, there stood a very long Table, at which the Witches did sit down: And that hard by this Room was another Chamber, where there were very lovely and delicate Beds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:33084:14"/>The first thing they said, they must do at <hi>Blockula</hi> was, That they must deny all, and devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Body and Soul to the Devil, and promise to serve him faithfully, and confirm all this with an Oath. Hereupon they cut their Fingers, and with their Bloud writ their Name in his Book. They added, that he caused them to be Baptized too by such Priests as he had there, and made them confirm their Baptism with dreadful Oaths and Imprecations.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Devil gave them a Purse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there were filings of Clocks with a Stone tied to it, which they threw into the Water, and then were forced to speak these words; <hi>As these filings of the Clock do never return to the Clock from which they are taken, so may my Soul never return to Heaven.</hi> To which they add Blasphemy and other Oaths and Curses.</p>
               <p>The mark of their cut Fingers is not found in all of them: But a Girl who had been slashed over her Finger, declared, that because she would not stretch out her Finger, the Devil in anger had so cruelly wounded it.</p>
               <p>After this they sate down to Table; and those that the Devil esteemed most, were placed near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to him; but the Children must stand at the door, where he himself gives them Meat and Drink.</p>
               <p>The Diet they did use to have there, was, they said, Broth with Colworts and Bacon in it, Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, Bread spread with Butter, Milk, and Cheese. And they added, that sometimes it tasted very well, and sometimes very ill. After Meals they


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33084:15"/>
went to Dancing, and in the mean while Swore and Cursed most dreadfully, and afterward went to fighting one with another.</p>
               <p>Those of <hi>Elfdale</hi> confessed, That the Devil used to play upon an Harp before them, and afterwards to go with them that he liked best, into a Chamber, where he committed venereous Acts with them; and this indeed all confessed, That he had carnal knowledge of them, and that the Devil had Sons and Daughters by them, which he did Marry together, and they did couple, and brought forth Toads and Serpents.</p>
               <p>One day the Devil seemed to be dead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there were great lamentations at <hi>Blockula</hi>; but he soon awaked again. If he hath a mind to be merry with them, he lets them all ride upon Spits before him; takes afterwards the Spits and beats them black and blue, and then laughs at them. And he bids them believe, that the day of Judgment will come speedily, and therefore sets them on work to build a great House of Stone, promising, that in that House he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them from God's fury, and cause them to enjoy the greatest delights and pleasures: but while they work exceeding hard at it, there falls a great part of the Wall down again, whereby some of the Witches are commonly hurt, which makes him laugh, but presently he cures them again.</p>
               <p>They said, they had seen sometimes a very great Devil like a Dragon, with fire round about him, and bound with an Iron Chain; and the Devil, that converses with them tells them, that if they


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33084:15"/>
confess any thing, he will let that Great Devil loose upon them, whereby all <hi>Swedeland</hi> shall come into great danger.</p>
               <p>They added, That the Devil had a Church there, such another as in the Town of <hi>Mohra.</hi> When the Commissioners were coming, He told the Witches, they should not fear them; for he would certainly kill them all. And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that some of them had attempted to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Commissioners, but had not been able to effect it.</p>
               <p>Some of the Children talked much of a white Angel, which used to forbid them what the Devil had bid them do, and told them that those doings should not last long; what had been done, had been permitted because of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of the People, and the carrying away of the Children should be made manifest. And they added, that this white Angel would place him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sometimes at the Door betwixt the Witches and the Children; and when they came to <hi>Blockula,</hi> he pulled the Children back, but the Witches, they went in.</p>

               <head>3. Of the Mischief or Evil which the Witches promised to do to Men and Beasts.</head>
               <p>THey confessed, that they were to promise the Devil, that they would do all that's Ill; and that the Devil taught them to Milk, which was in this wise: They used to stick a Knife in the Wall, and hang a kind of a Label on it, which they drew and stroaked; and as long as


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33084:16"/>
this lasted, the persons that they had power over, were miserably plagued, and the Beasts were milked that way, till sometimes they died of it.</p>
               <p>A Woman confessed, that the Devil gave her a wooden Knife, wherewith, going into Houses; she had power to kill any thing, she touched with it; yet there were few, that would confess, that they had hurt any man or woman.</p>
               <p>Being asked whether they had murthered any Children, they confessed, that they had indeed tormented many, but did not know, whether any of them died of those plagues. And added, That the Devil had shewed them several places, where he had power to do mischief.</p>
               <p>The Minister of <hi>Elfdale</hi> declared, That one Night these VVitches, were to his thinking, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the crown of his Head, and that from thence he had had a long continued pain of the Head.</p>
               <p>One of the Witches confessed too, that the Devil had sent her to torment that Minister: and that she was ordered to use a Nail and strike it into his Head, but it would not enter very deep; and hence came that Head-ach.</p>
               <p>The aforesaid Minister said also, That one Night he felt a pain, as if he were torn with an Instrument, that they cleanse Flax with, or a Flax-comb; and when he waked, he heard some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body scratching and scraping at the Window, but could see no-body. And one of the Witches confessed, that she was the person that did it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent by the Devil.</p>
               <p>The Minister of <hi>Mohra</hi> declared also, that one Night one of these Witches came into his House,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33084:16"/>
and did so violently take him by the Throat, that he thought, he should have been choaked; and waking, he saw the person that did it, but could not know her; and that for some Weeks he was not able to speak, or perform Divine Service.</p>
               <p>An Old woman of <hi>Elfdale</hi> confessed, that the Devil had holpen her to make a Nail, which she struck into a Boys Knee, of which stroke the Boy remained same a long time. And she added, that before she burnt, or was Executed by the hand of Justice, the Boy would recover.</p>
               <p>They confessed also, that the Devil gives them a Beast about the bigness and shape of a young Cat, which they call a <hi>Carrier</hi>; and that he gives them a Bird too as big as a Raven, but white. And these two Creatures they can send any where; and where-ever they come, they take away all sorts of Victuals they can get, Butter, Cheese, Milk, Bacon, and all sorts of Seeds whatever they find, and carry it to the Witch. What the Bird brings they may keep for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but what the <hi>Carrier</hi> brings, they must reserve for the Devil, and that's brought to <hi>Blockula,</hi> where he doth give them of it so much, as he thinks fit.</p>
               <p>They added likewise, that these <hi>Carriers</hi> fill themselves so full sometimes, that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to spew by the way, which spewing is found in several Gardens, where Colworts grow, and not far from the houses of those Witches. It is of a yellow colour like Gold, and is called <hi>Butter of Witches.</hi>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:33084:17"/>The Lords Commissioners were indeed very earnest, and took great pains to perswade them to shew some of their Tricks, but to no purpose; for they did all unanimously confess, that since they had confessed all, they found that all their Witchcraft was gone, and that the Devil at this time appeared to them very terrible, with Claws on his Hands and Feet, and with Horns on his Head, and a long Tail behind, and shewed to them a Pit burning, with a Hand put out; but the Devil did thrust the person down again with an Iron-fork; and suggested to the Witches, that if they continued in their Confession, he would deal with them in the same manner.</p>

            <head>An Account of what happen'd to a Boy at <hi>Malmoe</hi> in <hi>Schonen</hi> in the year 1678. supposed to be done by Witchcraft, and attested by the ablest, and most Judicious Men of that Town.</head>
            <div type="translators_introduction">
               <p>HAving in the Preface to the foregoing Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative taken notice of the <hi>Swedish Envoy Extraordinary,</hi> it may not be unsuitable to the Subject, these Papers treat of, to give the World an Account of a very strange Passage, which the said Envoy hath taken very great pains to satisfie himself in; and of which he hath the publick Testimony of the Town, where it was done, by him. No longer ago than in the year 1678. an Alderman or Senator's Son of <hi>Malmoe</hi> in <hi>Schonen,</hi> a City belonging to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the Boy being then about Thirteen years of age, his Name <hi>Abraham Mechelburg,</hi> going to School one Morning, as the custom is in that place about Six of the Clock, stay'd there till Eight, and then went home for his Breakfast, which when he had eaten, he was going back to School again, when just before the Door close by the lowermost Step, there lay a little Bundle of Linen Rags, which the Lad out of curiosity took up and open'd, but found nothing in it, but partly Pins, some crooked, some laid across, some without points, partly broken Horse-nails, and Nails without heads, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Horse-hair, and such trash, which when it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered not his expectation, he rent asunder, and threw away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:33084:18"/>Some few days after, the Boy fell ill, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued so for some time, no Physician being able to guess what ailed him. At last he began to void little Stones, at the Orifice of the <hi>Penis,</hi> which by degrees came forth bigger and bigger, some were perfect Pebles of all sorts of colours, and in process of time, there came forth great uneven Stones like pieces of Rocks, as if they were broken off of a greater Stone, whereof the Envoy hath two by him, One given him by the Father of the Boy; and the other by the Kings Chirurgeon, both which I have thought fit to give the Reader the dimensions of.</p>
               <p>Before the Stones came forth, there was a strange motion in his Belly, as if something were alive in it, the Stones seemed to crack within, and something they heard, as if a great Stone were violently broken, and at this time he felt the greatest pain. When the Stones were ready to come forth, the <hi>Penis</hi> was drawn in so deep, that the Standers by could not perceive any thing of it; and after that, it dropt those prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Stones, which seem rather to be fetch'd from Quarries, than produced by any <hi>Saline</hi> or <hi>Nitrous</hi> Matter in the Body. The Stone I have given the Figure of, is of a reddish colour, with some grains of white in it, heavy, and such as lie in common Roads and Highways. When the Stones came forth, the Boy felt no pain, the pain being most upon him, when the Stones within seem'd to crack, and a little before; and the Fit was then so violent, that four or five Men were forced to hold him. The Boy in the mean while


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33084:18"/>
slept well at Night, eat, and drank as heartily as ever, discomposed at no time, but when the Fit of voiding these Stones was coming upon him. This lasted two years: The Parents had the Boy pray'd for at Church, and instantly besought God at home, whenever any of those Fits came upon him, to turn the Stream and to stop the Devils Power. The Boy is now as well as ever, rides abroad, and doth all things as he used to do before this accident befel him. The <hi>Envoy</hi> spoke both with the Father and the Boy, and tells me, they are no indigent People, but well to pass, and Persons of very good Reputation in the Town of <hi>Malmoe.</hi> While this misfortune lasted, the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> being then but a little way off, sent some of his Chirurgeons to the place, to know the truth thereof, who were by, when the Lad voided very strange Stones at the <hi>Orifice</hi> of the <hi>Penis,</hi> and gave the King an account of it: One of them to be throughly satisfied, held his hand under the <hi>Penis</hi> after it was drawn in, and there dropt a very odd Stone, broad and angular into his hand. The Envoy being upon the place last year, enquired of all People, whom he thought might not be very credulous, who unanimously bore witness of the thing; and upon his request gave him the following Account, which I have translated out of the Original.</p>

               <p>BE it known, that during the Years, <hi>1678.</hi> and <hi>1679.</hi> a very wonderful thing happened in this City of <hi>Malmoe,</hi> to one of the Aldermen of the Town, his name <hi>John Mechelburg,</hi> and his Wife's <hi>Abla Kruthmeyer</hi>; for God having blessed them with three Sons, one of them <hi>Abraham</hi> by name, a Boy at this time aged about sixteen years, hath been very strangely afflicted with a praeternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral voiding of Stones, insomuch that during the space of those two years, he hath through the <hi>Virga</hi> of the <hi>Penis</hi> voided several hundreds of Stones great and small, which being weighed together, weighed no less than One and twenty pound, <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du-poise</hi> some weighing <hi>6,</hi> some <hi>7.</hi> some <hi>8.</hi> some <hi>9</hi> ounces, full of Angles, and much like pieces of a Rock that's broken by force, or instruments fit for that purpose. These broken Stones sometimes came forth at the Boys mouth, sometimes he voided them by siege, and the Parents of the Child have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently assured, us that before this misfortune, the Boy had been sick several weeks together, and kept his Bed; during which sickness something was seen moving in his Body, as if it had been some live thing. After this Sickness there appeared the Stones aforesaid; The first that came forth, exceeded not the bigness of half a Pea, but in a short time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they increased to a greater bulk; when they were ready to come away, the Boy complained much of the Spine of his Back, where, as he


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33084:19"/>
said, he found incredible pain. While this lasted, he neither made Water, nor went to Stool sometimes in two Months, sometimes not in a quarter of a year; sometimes the Stones, when they were past through the <hi>Virga</hi> appeared bloudy, and upon one of them there appeared a kind of <hi>Talch.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this misery, the Boy continued to eat his Meat very heartily, nor was he troubled with this pain at all in the night, but slept quietly, as he used to do. About the latter end of this unexampled passion and misery, a matter of <hi>64</hi> Stones, for the most part small, came forth very fast one upon the neck of another, and since the 20th of <hi>September 1679.</hi> this misfortune hath totally left him, and he is as well as ever; nor is there after all those Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments any defect to be found, or perceived either in his body, or the aforesaid Member of the Boy, but he continues safe and sound unto this day.</p>
               <p>And whereas in all probability, abundance of Men, because they have not been Eye-witnesses, will deride these passages, as fabulous, we whose names are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, upon the request and desire of the Lord <hi>John Leyonberg,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary of <hi>Sueden,</hi> have once more spoken and conferred with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the Boy, who have shewed us the abovesaid Stones, and given us one of the biggest, as a Present, and do hereby testifie that the passages related in the premises, are undoubtedly true, which Testimony we have also signed with our own hands, that in case the aforesaid Envoy coming into foreign parts, shall have occasion to speak of these things, Men may give
