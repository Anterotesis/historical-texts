            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A BRIEF EXPOSITION OF THE Evangel of JESUS CHRIST According to MATTHEW.</p>
            <p>

            <bibl>PHIL. 2. VER. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</bibl>
            <q>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Iesus: Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the form of God, though it not robbery to be equal with God, But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the crosse. Wherfore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Iesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth. And that every tongue should confesse, that Iesus Christ is the Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</q>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a sweet and remarkable Providence, that within these not many yeers, such a multitude of Impressions of the holy Scriptures are vented among these three united Kingdoms, and so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands are of Scots and English, who delight not only to have the holy Bible in their possession and houses; but also to carry it in their pockets, for reading of it upon all occasions: This, as it speaketh much of the desire after divine Knowledge, raised up by God in peoples hearts; and as it promiseth much of the spreading of the light of the Gospel in these Dominions, (especially the Lord having now seconded his own Work, by drawing, from the fountain of his own free grace, the
<pb facs="tcp:59775:3"/>
body of these Kingdoms into a solemn Covenant, for purging of all his holy Ordinances, and promoving of sound Religion) so doth it call aloud to all the Pastors of his Flock, and to all the godly learned, by all means to lead the Lords people in upon the right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, left the plain and marvellously consonant word of God be mistaken and wrested, by the instability and unskilfulnesse of such as have not their senses exercised to discern the single meaning of the Lords Voyce, and the admirable harmony of his heavenly Speeches. Many worthy men of God (it is true) have profitably taken pains to this purpose, and some have written large Commentaries upon sundry Books, and parcels of Scripture; others have transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of Latine the Commentaries of others: But of those worthy mens Labours, only such as have much leasure, and patience to read, can make use: Others have written short Paraphrases of harder places; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Expositions of hard words; others have mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herewith some sweet notes and observations, all of them contributing one with another to the common good, so much as each sort of Writing could carry: Yet besides all these laudable wayes of explication of Scripture, it seemeth that these dangerous Times, (wherein so many diverse errours are privily crept in, and begun openly also to avow themselves) do call for such an Explanation of the whole Bible, as might not only shew the scope of each Book and Chapter, with the cohesion of the Verses, and the meaning of the Words; but also propone the speciall heads of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in each place, whereby people might see the whole grounds of Religion in the Text, and be guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against all damnable errours (in which those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are easily ensnared, who know not the Scriptures,
<pb facs="tcp:59775:3"/>
nor the power of God) and all this to be in such brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and cleerness, That men in their daily set-reading of the Lords word, might in the space of half an hour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use a competent portion of Scripture, thus explained.</p>
                  <p>I say, <hi>Set-time for their private reading,</hi> because, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit every man is not set apart for the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but most part have, by Gods appointment, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil callings and necessary imployments about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this life, each calling and imployment having its own work, and each work requiring his own time, so that there remaineth little time beside unto many; yet that man is too much busied in temporall affairs, and more involved in the World then he can answer for, who doth not daily redeem so much time, as the necessary exercise of Religion in the Word and Prayer doth require; beside secret ejaculations of Prayer unto God, mixed with his affairs, and the Mason-like-looks of his Conscience, levelling its eye to each action, to see if it be conform to the Rule: for presuppose a man were imployed as much as a King, and had so many Realms to govern as were under David K. of Israel, yet could he not be excused for this, to neglect <hi>Gods</hi> word &amp; prayer; for <hi>Dav.</hi> oftner then once a day, yea, &amp; in the night al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so found time to call on <hi>God,</hi> &amp; praise his name, &amp; verse himself in his Word, <hi>Ps.</hi> 119.55, 62, 164. Let the men of this world, who have their portion in this life, &amp; have set up in their hearts the filthy idols of worldly profit, pleasure &amp; preferment, for gaining &amp; keeping wherof, they make use not only of all men, but also of <hi>God</hi> and Religion, so far only as they may be suitable &amp; service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their base ends; Let such men (I say) neglect reading the Scriptures, and all serious following of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exercises: But let not the children of <hi>God</hi> do so, who hold their standing here, and the hopes of eternal
<pb facs="tcp:59775:4"/>
life hereafter by faith in Christ, for promoving of whose cause and Kingdom, they are resolved to bear his Crosse, were it even to the doors of Heaven, if so GOD please, and to lay it down on the threshold with thanks and praise, that ever they were counted worthy to suffer for his Name; let not these blessed Soules walk in the way of the ungodly, but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light themselves in the Law of GOD, and meditate therein night and day, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.2, 3. For the service of such saints, and facilitating of their reading of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, I come forth (as before in the brief Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the Epistle to the Hebrews, so now in the brief explanation of the Evangel according to Matthew) to call yet again unto the Godly Learned, to stir up themselves for contributing one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unto some such brief explanation of the whole Bible, as their Godly wisdome shall agr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As for this Piece, such a one as it is, There is great reason why it should bear your Honourable Name in the title of it, it being a part of the fruit of your Lordships labour, who as One eminently carefull of the purity of Gods ordinances, hath with others of our Renowned Nobility, faithfull Gentrie and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, run the hazard of all things in this life, and of life it self, to purge the land from superstition, and Heresie, and to give freedome, not only to the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Truth of the Gospel, but also unto Pens and Presses for propagation of it. What singular Proofes of Integrity, and inflexible Constancy your Honour hath given in this great work of uniting
<pb facs="tcp:59775:4"/>
these three kingdomes more nearly unto God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves in the matters of Religion, it is so well known, that I need say nothing, but bless God for the raising up of so many precious Sons of Sion to take their Mother by the Hand, in the day of her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and give thanks to his Majesty for your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships in particular.</p>
                  <p>ANd as for <hi>Your Honour,</hi> My Lord <hi>Mauchlin,</hi> I could not but joyn your Lordships Name with <hi>Your Noble Father</hi> in this Dedication; partly, because you follow up so hard after his foot-steps, that your gracious and prudent Behaviour, observed by all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, hath drawn from your Condesciples in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy a more ample elogy, then either your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Modesty, or my measure of Commendation of men will suffer me to repeat; partly, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship may be thus yet more ingaged to drink in, and maintain that Doctrine of Salvation by Christ, which giveth the text of his Testament for a Pawn and Pledg of its verity; The love and fruitfull Profession where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that it may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

immediatly with the Text of Scripture. Then which Work, I conceive there can be no one mean, after powerful Preaching, more forcible for rooting out of Errours, and manifesting unto all men the true Religion which wee profess in <hi>Brittain,</hi> and by Covenant are obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and propagate according to our power.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Explanation of the Gospel according to Matthew,</hi> I have laboured to fit the mould so, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Doctrines from the Text, may be more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the Readers up-taking, then it is in the <hi>Short Explanation of the Epistle to the Hebrews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have contented my self with some few observations upon each Text, which might serve most for the cleering of the place; leaving to every Reader, as he hath time for Meditation, and ability of Gifts, to observe what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Text may afford, it being sufficient for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, that thou find so much clearnesse and sweetnesse in the Lords Word by what I offer to thy taste, as may make thee more in love with the daily reading of the Scripture, and the Learned and Able may be stirred up to help thee with more Stuffe of this kinde.</p>
            <p>I point ordinarily at some words in the Text, for a Ground of the Doctrine proponed: from which words, if the Doctrines do not immediately arise, and formally follow; yet from these words such Doctrines may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, after some little larger Explication of them, as these illate Particles, <hi>FOR</hi> and <hi>THEREFORE,</hi> do at least import.</p>
            <p>The History being all along most part plain, I have forborn to trouble thee with large Contents or Analysis, or Exposition of words, and have insisted onely where some difficulty is, and that so long onely as was necessary to give some light; hasting in all other places unto the
<pb facs="tcp:59775:6"/>
Doctrine, and couching in them frequently so much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the words as I could with clearnesse and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, of which I have had a speciall care, resolving with my self, that as larger Commentaries serve onely for them who have Leasure and love to read much, so this sort of Writing must be for those onely, who (for one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or other) must either have something in short, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.

                  <p>This Catalogue of the posterity of David being so notourly known from the publick Registers and records of the families of David, that no doubt nor question was made of Christs descent from David, no not by his enemies, Therefore the Evangelist doth not scrupulously name here every one of his Ancestors, but only draweth the line along so far, as it might suffice for the churches edification: and by so much as is here set down he doth teach us these things: 1. Jesus Christ is the very true Messias promised to the fathers, who now in the fulness of time, hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed humane nature of the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> whose <hi>Son he is called,</hi> according to the flesh: and this he pointeth at, when he saith, <hi>Abraham begat Isaac, &amp;c.</hi> 2. For our confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the faith of Jesus Christ, we should acquaint our selves with the prophesies which went before of him, and with the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of his Ancestors, <hi>here recorded from the Scripture of the Old Testament,</hi> and in speciall from Abraham to the captivity of Babylon. 3. Seeing it is a hard matter to beleeve, that God should so empty himselfe for us, and become a man like unto us, we should receive so many impressions of the verity of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, as there are severall names of his Ancestors accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the flesh, named in this Catalogue: for to this end we are led from one to another, by <hi>he begat,</hi> and <hi>he begat.</hi> 4. No man should be astrayed to offer himselfe to be ingrafted as a branch in Christ, because Christ hath been pleased to be a branch of poor Ruth, a Gentile, as well as of rich Booz: of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned persons as well as learned, of ignoble and mean persons as wel as Kings: yea and of persons blotted with notorious faults, as Rachab and Tamar, no lesse then of holy Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, such as Abraham and Isaac. 5. As he hath separated our nature in his own person, from all the pollution of his Ancestors here recorded, so he can sanctifie our persons and nature, how polluted soever our persons have been. 6. By summing up the generations from Abraham unto Christ in thrice fourteen, he teacheth us, that notwithstanding so many notable changes were made in that people, especially about the period of each fourteen Generations; yet was the promise of the Messias coming, and the lineall descent of the blessed seed still keeped on foot, till our Lord was born, and by this same means, he giveth us to understand, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59775:9"/>
in the greatest commotions of kingdomes or commonwealths, no promise made to the Church shall be shaken.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Verse 18.</hi> Now the birth of Iesus Christ was on this wise: when as his Mother Mary was espoused to Ioseph (before they came together) she was found with child of the holy Ghost.</q>
                  <p>In the second part of the chapter we have five evidences of Christs wonderfull incarnation. The first is, the Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is <hi>found with child of the HOLY GHOST</hi>; wherein these truths offer themselves. 1. Albeit Christ as God be eternall, and hath no mother, yet as he is a man he hath Mary his Mother in her virginity, For <hi>before they came together she was found with child of the HOLY GHOST.</hi> 2. This wonderfull conception was no lesse true and reall then any ordinary concep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion could be: for by ordinary evidence <hi>She is found with childe,</hi> which was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by those that did not know that it was of <hi>the holy Ghost,</hi> till afterward. 3. We should neither speak nor think of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conception, without the remembrance of the wonderfull ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Spirit: for to preveen all unworthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming, thoughts of this transcendent mystery, no sooner doth the Evangelist make mention of the Virgins being <hi>with Child,</hi> but immediately he subjoyneth, <hi>of the Holy Ghost,</hi> To teach us, to beware to think any thoughts of this great mystery of Godlinesse, the incarnation of the Son of God, except by the conduct <hi>of the Holy Ghost,</hi> who must form right thoughts of Christ in our hearts, and lead us along through this following history in all saving truth. 4. The LORD hath a care of the same and estimation of those in whom he mindes to honour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for it is provided by God so, that the Virgin Mary, being with child of the promised Messia, shal be espoused to her husband Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph, that no exception could be taken against her, by such as did not beleeve the mystery.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Then Ioseph her husband being a just man, and not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</q>
                  <p>The second evidence, is Josephs perplexity, who being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the reall conception of the Virgin, and uncertain of the holy Manner of it, either because he was not informed by the Virgin how the matter was, or because, if he was informed, he did not fully beleeve; he is put to a perplexed deliberation what to do; There was on the one hand such evidence of purity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse in the carriage of the blessed Virgin, that Joseph could not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59775:9"/>
find a reason in Justice to make her a publick Example, and for this part of his resolution he is commended as a <hi>just Man:</hi> On the other hand there was such certainty of her being with child, and that the child was not his, that he minded to <hi>put her away privily. Doct.</hi> 1. GOD by perplexities can prepare the hearts of his own for a clearer satisfaction in matters of highest concernment; for this exercise of Joseph is made a Harbinger to the revelation, and satisfaction which afterward he received: 2. Our LORDS sufferings began very early, even ere he was born, when the Virgin Mother cometh under suspicion for his incarnation, and cometh under this hazard, to be put away privily for his cause. 3. No wonder CHRIST have hard entertainment in the world before he be known, when even his own, according to election, do refuse him, till he manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to them; For Joseph is about to reject the Mother and the child, before he knew the mystery.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 20.</hi> But while he thought on these things, behold, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Ioseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her, is of the holy Ghost.</q>
                  <p>The third evidence, is the Testimony of the Angel, revealing the truth to Joseph. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. No lesse then divine revelation can satisfie a soul in matters concerning Christ: Joseph must be taught from Heaven, before he be clear about the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son of GOD: 2. The Lord can turn the doubts, and fears and perplexities of his own, into an advantage unto themselves and others also, and into a clearer manifestation of his own glory: for now the incarnation of the Son of God is more clear to Joseph, and to the church, that the Lord did reserve the revelation thereof to himselfe, then if Joseph had never made question about it: 3. The Lord useth to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in a necessary nick of time, while the Virgin is in hazard to suffer, and Joseph about to put her away, mean while the Lord interposeth himself<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; for while he <hi>thought of these things, the Angel</hi> appeared: The Angel calling Joseph, <hi>Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> doth oblige Joseph to serve the chiefe of all the sons of David, the <hi>renowned branch,</hi> and <hi>true root</hi> also of the house of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, for whose cause the posterity of David was kept undestroyed, when other families were confounded. Then he dischargeth Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs suspicion which he had of Mary, assuring him, that that which is conceived of her, is of the holy Ghost, and this he sayeth not to seclude the operation of the Father and the son, whose work
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59775:10"/>
is alwayes one with the work of the Holy-Spirit, by whom the Father and the Son do work, whatsoever they work among the creatures, being all three one God, as undivided in essence, so inseparable in operation: But this work is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the holy Ghost, to seclude the ordinary way of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, and to assure us of the sanctification of the substance of the Virgin, assumed by Christ, and of the freedom of Christ; humane n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As Christ is the Son of David by lineall descent, through Mary his Mother, so also by law, through Joseph his supposed father, and father in law, who was descended from David; for the Angel calleth Joseph, Thou <hi>Son of David.</hi> 5.

Natural and civil relations of men and women unto Christ, did not take away their obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and necessity to beleeve in him, and to confess him unto salvation, as other sinners must do, but rather augmented the same; for to Joseph it is said, <hi>Thou shalt call his name Iesus,</hi> to wit, not only as Foster-father, giving this name to him, but as a Beleever in him, and confessor of him, avowing him to be the true Saviour, because <hi>He shall save his people from their sins.</hi> 4.

The Redeemed are no lesse sinners, and lost in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves then others are, for it is said, <hi>He shall save his own people</hi> from their sins. 7. These things are spoken to Joseph to move him to consecrate himselfe to the service of Jesus, whereby we learne, that except Christ be known as the Saviour, a man cannot heartily do him service, nor indure trouble for him? Therefore is Joseph instructed to expect salvation from him, in saying, <hi>Thou shalt call his name Iesus, for he shall save his people.</hi>

                  <p>WE hear no more of these wise men but what we collect from Matthew, That they were of the Gentiles, men of learning and wisdome, men of wealth and reputation; the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of their coming are set down here, They <hi>came from the east to Ierusalem, when Christ is born</hi> in the daies of Herod the king, wherein we have these things observable. 1. The place of the nativity of Christ well agreeth to the prophesie of <hi>Micah</hi> 5.2. Jesus is born in Beth-lehem the city of David, which is in Judea, so called to distinguish it from Beth-lehem in Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee: 2. The time when he should be born agreeth also to the Prophets, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. to wit, before or about the time of the Scepters taking altogether from Juda: That is, before the tribe of Juda did cease to be a tribe, before this tribe was dissipate, and so destitute of all sort of government, which came not to passe till after our Lords death: For now Herod is king in Judea, who had slain the Elders of the house of David, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the kingdome in his own hand; yet the tribe remained, and had the own order within it self, for the regulating of the common things pertaining unto the severall families thereof, as appeareth in the taxing of the family of David in Beth-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem: But after Christs coming, and ending of the worke of redemption, for which he came, the tribe of Juda was so cut off and confounded, that it never had a face of a tribe again unto this day, therefore the Messia is now come. 3. When such as should glorifie God do it not, but do misken Christ, He can raise up others in their room, by whom he will honour himselfe; for though the wise men of the Jewish Church do not observe the time of Christs coming, yet God prepareth witnesses for himselfe from among the Gentiles, <hi>Behold a number of wise men come from the east</hi> to honour him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Chaldea, or Persia, or how many they were, or what were their names, it is not materiall to us, It is sufficient that Christ is honoured by them, and that they are the first fruits of the Gentiles their conversion unto Christ. 4. The Lord faileth not to make the best of all means for his own glory; to make these mens testimony famous, and most fit to check the security of the Jews, they are led in a providence to Jerusalem to ask for Christ.</p>

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59775:12"/>When these men are come to Jerusalem, they ask where Christ is, and posesse their faith in him, and their purpose to worship him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

Saving faith looketh through all clouds of humane infirmities in Christ, and pitcheth upon some point of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in him; For these men by faith in a babe new born, behold the promised Messiah, and the King of Israel: <hi>They ask for the King of the Iews,</hi> giving to him the ordinary stile of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. The least spunk of saving knowledg doth set a man on work to seek after Christ, for <hi>where is he?</hi> say they. 4. Faith, ere it want Christ, will hazard all to come by him; for these men confess him with the danger of their life, to <hi>be the born King of the Iews,</hi> and do ask for him in Jerusalem, even when, and where Herod a stranger is reigning as King. 5. Though Christ came in the shape of a servant, and humbled himself to be born of a mean Damsel, yet is his honour to be seen in heaven and earth, for a star is created to give warning to the world, that the bright morning Star is arisen: and from the east, wise men do come to confesse him. 6. Though God give signes and evidences of Christs coming, yet every man doth not see or observe them, but such only as God doth reveal them unto; for only these wise men are they who get a right sight of this star, <hi>we</hi> (say they) <hi>have seen his star in the cast.</hi> 7.

Matthew and Micah do agree in substance, That albeit Beth-lehem was a small city, of no great wealth nor estimation among the cities of Israel, yet it was not little in effect, but a city of renown; Because in it was born the Governor of Israel, the King and Captain of the Lords people, Christ Jesus. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59775:13"/>
not in letters, or syllables, but in sense and meaning for in citations of Scripture here and else-where, the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists stand not for words, but rest upon the sense. 2. The meanness and baseness of any thing whereof Christ maketh use, should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend no man; for <hi>He can make a little Beth-lehem</hi> the place of his nativity. 3. His presence dignifieth the place, wheresoever he is, for Beth-lehem, how small soever, is not the least city, because Christ is born in it. 4. Christs speciall subjects are the Israel of God, and Christs office is to be a Governour, a Chieftain, and a Guide to the Elect, governing and feeding them; for he shall rule my people Israel, for <hi>he shall rule them as a pastor,</hi> or shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, doth the word import. 5. God can make use of his foes for the furtherance of his own purpose, whatsoever be their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; for by the means of Herod, and the Scribes, who were small friends to Christ, Gods purpose for clearing of the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the prophesie, about the place of Christs nativity is brought about. 6. The Lord can so dispose of means for the benefit of such as are seeking Christ, that if one mean be withholden, another more profitable shall be furnished; For the wise men, though they want the sight of a star for a while, which they saw in the East, <hi>verse</hi> 2. yet first they are led to <hi>Ierusalem, verse</hi> 1. and then to the light of the Scripture, in the answer of the Priests, <hi>verse</hi> 5, 6. that their faith might be builded on Christ, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and surest way: In particular, God doth offer unto them a notable point of light, in the answer of the Priests and Scribes concerning Christs God-head and Eternity. For in the text ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here by the assembly, <hi>Micah</hi> 5.2. it is written, that Christ <hi>his going forth is from of old, from everlasting,</hi> which served to teach them, that the Eternalll generation of the Son must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be remembred, when his being born as a child is spoken of; which could not but be usefull, and comfortable unto them at that time.</p>

the wayes of the Enemies of Christ. 1. He carryeth on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign closely, lest any man should smell his intention, so do they. He calleth the wise men privily, so do they. 2. Though he hath learned more of Christ then before, yet because his knowledg is not sanctified, his malice is not abated; therefore the love of earthly things setteth him on to follow his design against Christ so much the more eagerly, and so is it with the crafty politicians of this world. 3. When he hath gained one point about the place of Christs birth, he goeth about to gain another concerning the time of his birth also, that he may draw so much nearer, for the surprizing of Christ: so do they, haling in the cords of their net by parts. 4. He covereth his purpose of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under pretence of a purpose to worship Christ; he professeth to have faith in Christ, and to be of the same mind that the wise men are of, and that his resolution is out of the same affection with them to worship him; so do they, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near in profession of Religion, that they may more easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray. 5. To make all fast, he abuseth the simplicity of Christs friends, and thinketh to make them ignorantly to betray Christ into his hands; So do they, <hi>Go search for the child,</hi> saith he, <hi>and bring me word.</hi> 6. Mean time as God blind-folded him in his deepest policy, and suffered not his wicked wit to direct some of his servants, under pretence of convoying the wise men, to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, to murther Christ, so doth God disappoint Christs enemies in their deep plots; for it is easie to God to make fools of his foes, when he pleaseth.

for the Scripture had told them of Beth-lehem, but had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended so low as the particular house; but God supplieth the rest by the direction of the star, which now goes before them in the way, and stands above the house where our Lord lay. That this star was none of the ordinary, but made of purpose for this particular service, appeareth by the motion of it. 4. These means which do lead a man most certainly unto Christ, should be the matter of his speciall joy: The joy which ariseth from finding of Christ cannot be expressed, for it is said, <hi>They rejoyced with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great joy.</hi>

                  <p>The wise men at length do find Christ, and do not stumble at his outward infirmities, base lodging, or any other thing; but do worship him as their God and Saviour, consecrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and all they have to his service. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such as seek Christ in truth, shall find him at length. 2.

Riches, and wisdom, and honour, and all that we have, ought to be laid down at Christs feet, and offered to the service of Christ, as the fountain and owner thereof; for <hi>They opened their treasures, and presented unto him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and mirrhe.</hi>

                  <p>The wise men are gone, now Christ is sent away also. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

When Christ is known, he will be more dear then any thing else, for as the child is first in Josephs commission, <hi>verse</hi> 12. to take care for him, so in his obedience here the child is before the Mother; for it is said, <hi>He took the child,</hi> and <hi>his mother.</hi> 3.

                  <p>That we may see how the prophesie is fulfilled, the meaning of the words of <hi>Hosea,</hi> is in effect, as if it had been said, O church of Israel, when thou was in thy infancy, I so loved thee, that I brought thee out of Egypt, as my adopted Son, and in thee I called out of Egypt my only begotten Son, who as the promised seed of Abraham, was in thy loynes; and as in thy bondage in Egypt, I intended to fore-shadow and signifie the sufferings of my Son, and his fleeing out of Canaan into
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59775:15"/>
Egypt, so also in the calling of thee, my adopted Son out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, I intended to fore-shadow and signifie the calling of my only begotten Son out of Egypt, that he should perfect the work of redemption in the midst of the land promised unto thee; yet notwithstanding of all this, thou hast been unthankfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. Thus Christs going down to Egypt, and bringing back out of it, is a fulfilling of the Prophesie; and withall, this sheweth unto us, that in all the Lords work about Israel, be had a speciall eye upon the promised seed, upon the Messiah, who was to come out of that people, fore-shadowing somthing of him, or accomplishing somthing foresignified of him: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it should not seem strange unto us, that the Evangelists do apply sundry such speeches of the old Prophets unto Christ, who was mainly aimed at, and born witnesse unto in the Law and Prophets.</p>

                     <hi>Ver. 16.</hi> Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wrath, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Beth-lehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</q>

                  <p>In Christs abode at Nazareth, The Evangelist observeth Gods providence, intending therby that he should be called a Nazarite, that is, one separate from sinners. Sundry types of Christ did foresignifie and promise that he should be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Nazarite, or one separate, for Joseph is called the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarite of his brethren, or one separate from his brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.26. first in regard of the measure of love which his Father bare unto him; next, he is <hi>separate</hi> from his brethren, in regard they sold him unto the Gentiles; and thirdly, he is separate in Gods providence from his brethren, that he might prepare a place for them, and preserve the life of his owne people: in Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph was Christ sore-shadowed, and promised to be such a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarite,</hi> separate in all these respects. Again in the typicall law of the <hi>Nazarite, Numb.</hi> 6. it is foresignified that Christ should be separate from sinners, and dedicate unto holinesse, dead unto the pomp and pleasure of this world: that he should be the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and flower of Religion, and the true pattern of piety to all the Israel of God. Moreover in the type of Samson it is foresignified, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 13.15. That Christ should from his birth be a <hi>Nazarite</hi> unto God; who by his power and sufferings, should overcome his enemies, and bring delivery to Israel: Now Christ his dwelling at Nazareth, and his being called a <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene</hi> from his dwelling, was a fit mean to call to mens minde the perfections of the <hi>Nazarite</hi> in him, and to make them see the accomplishment of the foresaid prophesies in him: And therefore doth the Evangelist mark the providence of God, in directing his dwelling to be in this little town Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, whereby occasion might be given to all men, to observe and perceive in Christ, the fulfilling of the prophecies, which foretold, that he should be really a Nazarite. <hi>Doct.</hi> Whensoever we hear him called <hi>Iesus of Nazareth,</hi> let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he is that true Nazarite, that promised pleasant Plant, that Holy One of Israel, separate from sinners; the true Deliverer of Israel from their enemies, who hath broken the

How basely soever the world count of preaching, yet is it the onely ordinary way to prepare souls for receiving of Christ; Therefore it is said, <hi>Iohn came preaching.</hi> 3. It is in Gods choice to send the preachers of the Gospel, to what place he will, for John is sent to preach in the wildernesse of Judea, and not in Jerusalem.</p>

                  <p>The summe of Johns preaching was to move men to repent, because the kingdome of Gods grace offered in the Gospel, was now ready to receive the penitent. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Gospel finds men mad, and out of their wits, in an evill way; when it is sent
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59775:17"/>
unto them, they are men who must return to their wits, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of the word <hi>repent</hi> importeth. 2. The end of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the gospel is to perswade men unto repentance, for <hi>repent</hi> is Johns main scope. 3. The grace of God offered in the gospel is in effect <hi>the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> for it opens the way unto it, and entreth the man not only in the right, but also in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun possession of the <hi>Kingdome of heaven.</hi> 4. There can be no greater allurement to move a man to change his evill course, and turn unto God, then the offer made unto the penitent, of the Kingdome of grace and glory through Christ: for this is the motive which John useth, saying, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is near.</hi> 5. Both ability and exercise of repenting, is brought about by the preaching and power of the gospel; for to beget both, John is sent to preach this doctrine, saying, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.</hi>

                  <p>Johns calling and authority to preach, is described to be from heaven, according to the prophesie past of him, <hi>Isay</hi> 40.3. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The calling and authority of a preacher is chiefly to be looked unto, that he take not this honour to himselfe, but be called ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to warrantably, for Matthew here sheweth the warrant of John his calling out of <hi>Isaiah.</hi> 2. A called preacher should labour that the heart of the hearers be prepared for more and more lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Christ; for this is Johns scope, to <hi>prepare the way of the Lord.</hi> 3. He should not keep silence, but in open audience dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his commission plainly, not in obscure or high termes: <hi>fully,</hi> keeping back nothing of the Lords revealed counsell, and <hi>boldly,</hi> not fearing what flesh can do unto him; for this much is imported in Johns <hi>crying voyce.</hi> 4. He should labour to bring down the pride of impenitent hearers, and to lift up the dejected soul of such as in the sense of their sin and unworthines dare not beleeve; for this is to make the Lord his <hi>pathes straight,</hi> injoyned by John.</p>

                  <p>He sheweth the austerity of Johns way and manner of living, fitted for his extraordinary commission. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such as the Lord doth call to the Ministry, he fitteth them unto the work, and unto the times wherein he doth imploy them: such austerity was

fit, in a Nazarite, sent forth to waken a world besotted in secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 2.

                  <p>As for the successe of Johns Ministry, there is no small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the people unto him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

It is not unusuall to the Scripture, to take <hi>All,</hi> for <hi>all sorts and ranks</hi> of people, <hi>all Iudea, and all the Region,</hi> for all sorts of people, out of Judea and the Region about Jordan. 3. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in receiving in of members of the church, must be content with the profession of repentance and faith, joyned with submission to the ordinances, and not pry in narrowly on their hearts and consciences, for John did not take auricular or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confession of sins, it was impossible, the multitudes coming to baptism being so great, but such as confessed their sins in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and desired Baptism, were admitted by him, and baptized in the river, whether by sprinkling water on them, or dipping them, the word doth not determine, for it is so large as to give room to either; but that it was sprinkling, is most likely, for thus most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently so great multitudes could be baptized of John <hi>confessing their sins.</hi>

                  <p>This is a speciall Sermon in the peoples audience, directed by John to the Pharisees, (the most precise sect among the Jews, who sought to be justified by their works) and to the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (the most licencious sect of the whole, who beleeved nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther resurrection of the body, nor immortality of the soul) wherein John exhorteth them to uprightness, and bringing forth of good fruits by five reasons: The first is, Ye have been hitherto wicked vipers, and it is a wonder that ye are fled from wrath, therefore now bring forth good fruits, <hi>verse</hi> 7, 8. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. How powerfull is the preaching of truth, when the Lord is pleased to blesse the same, for here many even of the Pharisees
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59775:18"/>
and Sadduces came to Johns Baptism. 2. Such as professe to beleeve the word, and to repent of their sins, to submit to Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, cannot be excluded from entring into the society of the church, for John doth not exclude these Pharisees and Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the worst of men, from entring into the christian church by Baptisme, of whom he could have no more but <hi>profession</hi> of faith and repentance. 3. Notorious sinners may and should, in their receiving into the church, after any pollution by scandal, be put in mind of their former evill life, that they may be humbled the more, and be more holy for time to come: for John doth not stand to call these Pharisees <hi>Generation of Vipers,</hi> which is the name of the worst sort of serpents. 4. It is a rare thing to see sectaries converted; for John wondereth at their coming, and saith, <hi>Who hath forewarned you to flee?</hi> 5. Wrath doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on all the wicked, who either live Belly-gods and Epicures, as the Sadduces; or do seek to be justified by their own works, as the Pharisees; for <hi>who hath forewarned you,</hi> saith he, <hi>to flee from the wrath to come</hi>; 6. Coming to Christ and subjection to his ordinances is the way to eschew wrath: for that here is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Flying from wrath.</hi> 7. When Gods glory, peoples edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and salvation do require that publick faults should be publickly rebuked, then the credit of the party to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is not to be stood upon; for John doth not stand in this case, to brand these too much esteemed sectaries, with the stile of <hi>Generation of Vipers,</hi> to the end they may be humbled, and the people drawn off the following of their former erroneous courses.</p>

                  <p>John having admitted these Pharisees and Sadduces into the church by Baptism, now he instructeth them as disciples. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The severity of the faithfull pastor should be mixed with love and care, to have men saved; for John so reproveth what is by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past, as he giveth them direction for time to come, saying, <hi>Bring forth fruits.</hi> 2. Men must not be secluded or suspended too long from the society of the visible church, but upon their profession of repentance, and faith in Christ, and subjection unto his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, must be admitted, and then commanded to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sincere, by such fruits as may evidence the truth of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: for so doth John, saying, <hi>Bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Verse. 9.</hi> And think not to say within your selves; We have Abraham to our father, for I say unto you,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59775:18"/>
that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</q>
                  <p>The second reason: I assure you, least you deceive your selfe, that the prerogative of being Abrahams children, will not avail you, except you be sincere children, carefull to do good works, therefore <hi>Bring forth fruits. Doct.</hi> 1. Carnall confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are great impediments unto true repentance, and must be renounced by such as would be found sincere: Therefore saith John, <hi>Thinke not to say within your selves, we have A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham to our Father.</hi> 2. Gods promises unto the children of Abraham may be fulfilled, and yet all such of the children of his flesh, as are profane, may be cut off: for John saith, <hi>Think not to say, Abraham is our father.</hi> 3. Rather then God should not perform his promise, he will work miracles, he will convert such as there is no more hope of, then of stones; for John saith, <hi>God is able of these stones to raise up children unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>

                  <p>A third reason: If you be barren, or bear ill fruits, you shall be cut down and perish; Therefore bring forth good fruits. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Gospel is preached, as mercy is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, so destruction should be most severely threatned, if use be not made of the Gospel; this is Johns way, saying, <hi>Now also is the ax laid to the root of the trees.</hi> 2. The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel of Gods mercy, requireth, of such as imbrace the faith, necessarily a holy life and good fruits. 3. Such as professe to receive the Gospel, and do not study to bring forth good fruits, shall perish; for it is written, <hi>Every tree that bringetth not forth good fruit, is hewen down and cast into the fire.</hi>

                     <hi>Verse 11.</hi> I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me, is mightier then I, whose shoes I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bear: he shall baptize you with the holy-Ghost, and with fire.</q>
                  <p>A fourth reason: Beside this outward Baptisme of water by me, you must have another Baptism of the Spirit by Christ: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seek after it, that you may bring forth good fruits; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in John abaseth himself, and cryeth up Christ. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptism is indeed Gods ordinance, yet it is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted on, but a further baptism is to be sought after; therefore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59775:19"/>
saith John, <hi>I baptize indeed with water, but, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The more a man be in estimation for his office or gifts, the more need had he to keep him within his own bounds, in a due distance from Christ, and not to incroach upon his Masters glory: for so doth John here, understanding that some of the people had too high estimation of him, <hi>I baptize you with water,</hi> saith he, <hi>but he that cometh after me is mightier then I.</hi> 3. The proper ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptisme, is not oyl, salt, or spittle, but onely water, and no other thing, therefore John saith, <hi>I baptize with water.</hi> 4. One of the ends of baptism, is to seal up the covenant of <hi>repentance</hi>; whereby the party baptized may be obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the course of repentance, and may also have the promise of God, for furnishing grace to repent, sealed unto them also, therefore saith John, <hi>I baptize</hi> you UNTO REPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANCE. 5. The more knowledge a man hath of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> the lower will he abase himself before him, and exalt Christ the higher, this moveth John to say, <hi>He that cometh after me, is mightier then I,</hi> &amp;c. 6. The most excellent of men are not worthy of the meanest imployment of service to Christ, that is it which John saith, <hi>Whose shooes I am not worthy to bear.</hi> 7. There is a two fold baptism, one of water poured upon the body by the Minister, another of the Spirit, poured forth upon a mans soul by Christ, and these two may be in time distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; for John saith, <hi>I baptize with water,</hi> but he <hi>shall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with the holy Ghost.</hi> 8. Whosoever are baptized inwardly by the Holy Spirit, are also baptized <hi>with fire,</hi> that is, by a more penetrative power and vertue, then what water at first doth show; which vertue must go through the whole man, unto through mortification of sin; that is it which by way of explanation is imported, when he saith, <hi>with the holy Ghost and with fire,</hi> taking baptism by fire here, not for any extraordinary gift of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but for that which is common to the Regenerate.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner: but he wil burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</q>
                  <p>A fifth reason: Though now the fruitfull, and unfruitfull be joyned one with another in the visible church, as chaff and corn are mixed on the floor, yet Christ will sever the one from the other, and will take the Fruitfull to Heaven, and will cast the unfruitfull in hell. Therefore <hi>Bring forth good fruits. Doct.</hi> 1. The visible church is like a corn floor, wherein good and bad, as chaff and corn are mixed together, for so doth the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59775:19"/>
import. 2. Christ as the perfect Husband man will so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the one from the other, that not one of the wicked shall be in company of the Godly; for, <hi>He will throughly purge his floor.</hi> 3. Christ hath means at hand to make the separation: he hath his word, and church-censures, and afflictions, and trials, by persecution, and death, and the day of judgment, when he shall fully perfect the separation; for <hi>his Fan in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor.</hi> 4. The upright and Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full shall be gathered unto heaven, the unfruitfull as chaff e cast in hell, not one of the Godly shall <hi>perish,</hi> not one of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shall <hi>escape</hi> perdition, for he will <hi>gather his wheat,</hi> and <hi>burn the chaff.</hi>

                     <hi>Ver. 13.</hi> Then cometh Iesus from Galilee to Iordan unto Iohn to be baptized of him.</q>
                  <p>The second part of the chapter concerning Christs baptisme, wherein first we mark a providence of Christs education, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part of the country then John Baptist lived in; where Johns commission to baptize in the name of Jesus appeareth to be divine so much the more, that our Lord and he had never seen one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the face before now, not till now Christ cometh from Galilee to Jordan. 2. Our Lord was pleased to be baptized for his own reasons; namely, that he might countenance and blesse his ordinance unto us, as he did circumcision unto the Jews, and that he might present himself among sinners as our surety, and offer himself to the father to be baptized with the baptism of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for our ransome.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 14.</hi> But Iohn forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</q>
                  <p>This offer of Christ to be baptized astonied John so far, as he forbade Christ to be baptized, in regard he knew Christ needed not baptisme. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The clearest sighted of Gods Servants do not see the deep of the Lords work, till he reveal it; therefore was it that at first John refused to baptize Christ. 2. Albeit it be sufficient to be once baptized out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, yet baptism of the spirit must be renewed frequently: for John already indued with the holy spirit in an eminent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, saith; <hi>I have need to be baptized,</hi> that is, yet again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a larger measure of this baptism: yea the more of this grace is bestowed upon any man, the more is he sensible of his need, and desirous of a further measure of it, for none more holy then John, and none more desirous to be more holy then John, <hi>I have need to be baptized,</hi> saith he. 3. Christ is the despenser of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59775:20"/>
Inward baptism of the spirit, <hi>I have need,</hi> (saith John) <hi>to be baptized of thee.</hi> 4. When Christs excellency, and his low dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of himselfe are compared, it is a wonderfull thing to the beholder; therefore saieth John by way of wondring, <hi>Comest thou to me?</hi>

                  <p>Christ will have John to consider the time of his Lords humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and what belonged to them both in regard of their office. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Some things were necessary to be done by <hi>Christ</hi> in the time of his humiliation, which otherwise was unbeseeming the dignity of his person; <hi>Therefore,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>suffer it be so now.</hi> 2. It is a thing both right and comely for each man to do what his calling requireth; for, <hi>It becometh us to fulfill all righteousness,</hi> saith Christ. 3. When the Lord maketh his will clear unto us, we should renounce our wil, and follow his, <hi>whatsoever</hi> blind zeal, or carnal humility shall speak to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for when John was informed of Christs mind, <hi>then he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him.</hi>

                  <p>As Baptism was the figure of death unto Christ, so his speedy coming upon dry land, did fitly foreshadow, that he could not be holden long of death, Therefore it is marked, <hi>That straight way he went up out of the water.</hi> Now after his Baptism, three wonders do appear: The first, a vision of the opening of the Heavens towards Christ, and to him, to shew, that as he came down from Heaven, so he should return unto it, and that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven closed against us is made open through him unto these for whom he presented himself upon Baptism: The next wonder is, The Spirit of God descended like a dove, and lighted unto him, by this visible sign of his presence, shewing, that Christ is that meek and gentle One, that innocent and harmlesse One, that most loving and lovely dove, in whom the Holy Spirit hath his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant residence; in and through whom alone, we are to receive of the gifts of the Spirit, and out of his fulness grace for grace: of this wonder it is said, that he, meaning John Baptist, <hi>saw this,</hi> to wit, in a more speciall manner, then the rest of the multitude: for this was the sign promised unto John, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1, 31, 32, 33.

                  <p>Now followeth the third wonder, unto the observation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are stirred up by a new <hi>Lo,</hi> or <hi>Behold</hi>; for we are dull to conceive heavenly things. 2. Beause we cannot conceive what the Lord doth, except he declare his mind by his word, <hi>A voyce speaketh from Heaven.</hi> 3. Of this man, now bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and demonstrated by the glory of the opened Heaven shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on him, and by the residence of the holy Ghost upon him, in the similitude of a dove, the Father saith, <hi>This is my Son,</hi> to wit, my Son, properly so called, my native and <hi>only begotten Son</hi> by eternall Generation: This is he who from all eternity was with God the Father, and <hi>was God,</hi> John. 1. 1. and who, Heb. 1, 2, 3. is called, <hi>The brightness of the Fathers glory, and the expresse image of his person.</hi> 4. The Father testifieth of this person, that he is his beloved Son, beloved in a singular way, as his <hi>Native Son</hi>; Beloved for himselfe and for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per worth, being God and Man in one person. 5. God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Christ, and is well pleased with him, as he standeth in our room; for as he stood now in his office of the Mediator and surety for us, offering himself for us unto death in Baptism, the Father was well pleased and satisfied with him, as with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ransome for our redemption; beside or above which he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no more, but rested so fully contented with the Son, and with all these in whose name he did offer himself, that he made open proclamation of it from Heaven, saying, <hi>This is my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son in whom I am well pleased</hi>: The demonstrative particle in the originall twice repeated, importeth as much, as he is <hi>that</hi> Son, <hi>that</hi> beloved One by way of Excellency, to wit, <hi>that</hi> Son <hi>spoken</hi> of in Paradise, <hi>shadowed</hi> forth in the sacrifices and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther figures of the Law, <hi>prophesied</hi> of by the Prophets, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi> by them to be <hi>Iehovah</hi> our righteousness, and <hi>waited</hi> for by all the Faithfull before his coming, as the consolation of Israel, namely the consolation of such as were baptized by John for salvation in him: and thus we have the glorious mystery of the Trinity most clearly revealed: for the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father,</hi> the first Person, by a voyce from heaven speaketh of his <hi>eternall Son now incarnate,</hi> the second Person; and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God the third Person, proceeding from the Father and the, Son, descendeth in the similitude of a <hi>Dove,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59775:21"/>
all three thus distinguished, remaining One infinite and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, God blessed for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi> By this also we have the covenant of Redemption laid open to us, for <hi>The Son incarnate</hi> offereth here himself Redeemer, and suerty for the Elect, to be baptized unto death, <hi>The Father</hi> accepteth the offer, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himself well pleased in him; and so it resteth, that wee (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to pay our debts by our selves, or to do any thing of ourselves, which may please God, or profit our souls) betake our selves unto Christ, who is surety for all those who come unto him.</p>

                  <p>The temptations and assaults of Satan are three; The first to provide for his bodily wants by an unlawfull mean, for to work a miracle at Satans direction, was not a lawfull mean of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding food to himself. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. No wonder men find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves daily solicited by Satan unto sin; For Satans <hi>stile,</hi> from his continuall practice, is the Tempter, and it is his trade to tempt. 2. It is possible that such as God doth love dearly may be troubled with bodily apparitions of Satan; for the Tempter is permitted to appear to Christ himself, and to speak to him. 3. It is no wonder to find Satan calling in question the Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Regeneration of any of Gods children, for he dare call in question the Son-ship of the Son of God, notwithstanding that within few dayes before this, the Father and the Holy Spirit from heaven had born witnesse in open sight and audience unto it, <hi>If thou be the Son of GOD,</hi> saith he. 4. Satan sits his temptations unto mens present case and condition; for, <hi>Christ being hungry is tempted to provide bread,</hi> in a way which the tempter doth prescribe. 5. In tempting, Satan pretends to be careful of helping the tempted party to a better condition; for here
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59775:22"/>
he will seem desirous both to have bread provided for Christ in his need, and also to see him made manifest to be the Son of God by such a miracle; for he saith, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand these stones to be made bread.</hi> 6. Satans temptations are moe then once, a number linked together, for here he tempts first to misbeleeve the word of God lately spoken of him: then to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and doubt of his Fathers provident care over him; Thirdly to provide for himself by indirect means; Fourthly, to abuse his, power of working miracles, in taking directions from Satan, and committing such like other sins.</p>

                  <p>Our Lord answereth this temptation by Scripture. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Satans temptations must not be neglected, but carefully answered, and that by Scripture, as the only mean to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him; for, <hi>It is written,</hi> saith Christ. 2. Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God hath appointed means of entertaining mens life, yet the power of sustaining life is not in the means, but in Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull word, or commanded blessing, conveyed by means, or without means, as he pleaseth; for, <hi>Man lives not by bread only, but by every word that cometh out of his mouth.</hi> 3. Seeing means of life, albeit we had them, cannot avail us, except God give his blessing, we should attempt nothing about them without Gods warrant; for else we do offend God, and provoke him to withdraw his blessing; this is the reason why Christ rejecteth the temptation, by this Scripture, saying, <hi>Man liveth not by bread,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>The first temptation being rejected by Scripture, Satan ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a new assault, and pretendeth Scripture in his second temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

God may give Satan so far power over the body of one whom he loveth dearly, as to carry it out of one place to another, for Satan is permitted to transport Christs body from the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness to the city, <hi>and to lift it up, upon a pinacle of the Temple.</hi> 3. Satans power in this kind is limited, so as he cannot hurt,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59775:22"/>
nor molest further, then he is limited: He may lift up Christs body on a pinacle of the Temple, but he hath no power to cast him down. 4. Where the ordinances of God are, and where he promiseth his Presence, that Place and that Society, is to be accounted holy, albeit many of the People in that Place and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety be defiled. Jerusalem, though defiled now exceedingly, yet retaineth the name of the holy city. 5. Satan will readily presse the same point by sundry means, and crave unreasonable proofs of a mans adoption one after another: for the second time he saith, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> 6. As Satan tempteth at one time to use unlawfull means to preserve life, so at another time he will tempt a man to neglect means of preserving life: at one time he will tempt us to distrust Gods care of our preservation, at another time to presume upon Gods care, without a warrant; yea sometime he will tempt a man to put hand in his own life, and will colour it with some pretence; for, <hi>Cast thy selfe down,</hi> &amp;c saith he. 7. Satan can transforme himselfe into an Angel of light, and pretend Scripture for his temptation, <hi>It is written,</hi> saith he. 8. When Satan citeth Scriptures, he wrests the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or hides the word which might shew the meaning; for <hi>Psalm</hi> 92.11, 12. It is said, The Lord shall keep <hi>thee in all thy wayes,</hi> that is, in thy warrantable walking: Satan keeps <hi>up these words.</hi>

                     <hi>Ver. 7.</hi> Iesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</q>
                  <p>Christ answereth the second temptation by Scripture also. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. We must not esteem the lesse of Scripture, albeit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and his instruments do abuse it; but with the same wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons must we fight against Satan still, and oppose a clear place of Scripture unto such places as the Tempter blowes mist upon; for, <hi>It is written again,</hi> saith our Lord. 2. We should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire God to give any extraordinary proofs of his care towards us, when he hath after an ordinary manner provided means for our safety; neither should we limit the Lord in any thing: for this is the meaning of <hi>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> 3. What the Scripture speaks indifferently to all, it is to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as spoken to every singular person, and the singular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are to be accounted as written in the writing of the generall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> for upon this ground, Christ saith, <hi>It is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</hi> Because <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.16. it is written, <hi>Ye shall not tempt your God.</hi> 4. Christ as our surety did subject himselfe unto the law, and therefore he doth apply the prcepts
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59775:23"/>
to himself no less then to us; for he saith of himself, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord.</p>

                        <hi>Ver. 8.</hi> Again, the Divel taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the Kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, If thou wilt fall down and worship me.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This is the third temptation whereunto Satan doth make way, by shewing the glory of the Kingdomes of the World, from a high mountain, whence many Towns, Castles, and fruitfull Fields might be seen, as the compend and example of all the kingdomes of the world, which have nothing in them, but a greater quantity of what may be seen in one place of one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Satan will not give over the conflict, till he have made triall of all sorts of temptations; after the former essayes, Satan wil now tempt Christ with the offer of gain and glory, <hi>All these,</hi> saith he, <hi>will I give thee.</hi> 2. Satan labours to have a man in love with the bait of Riches and Honour, ere he utter a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and to have the bait speaking ere the temptation speak: for before he speaks to Christ, <hi>He sheweth him all the Kingdomes of the world.</hi> 3. Satan will make fair offers of what he cannot perform; for the saith, <hi>All these things will I give to thee.</hi> 4. The children of God may be tempted with the vilest and most blasphemous suggestions that Satan can devise: for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane Spirit dare tempt the Son of God to the vilest idolatry, and dare say to Christ, fall down and worship me. 5. When Satan mindes to make a man a slave to sin, and to ruine him for ever, he will crave but one act of sin as a very small thing, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hope of great advantage: therefore he saith, <hi>All these things will I give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me,</hi> or kneel to me.</p>
                  <p>Verse 10. <hi>Then saith Iesus unto him, Get thee hence Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord abhorring the blasphemy of the proud and unclean Spirit, rebuketh him, and answereth the temptation by Scripture. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A bold temptation should have a peremptory answer, and that confirmed by Scripture, as here, <hi>Get thee hence,</hi> &amp;c. saith Christ. 2. As well religious service, as religious <hi>worship</hi> is due to God only: God will not permit either of them to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Saint or Angel, or any creature; for <hi>him only shalt thou serve</hi> 3. Whatsoever is the true sense and intent of any passage of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59775:23"/>
Scripture, it is to be accounted of, as if it were expressly written; for, because <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. it is said, <hi>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him:</hi> Christ saith, it is written, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and serve him only.</hi>

                  <p>Thus our Lord hath overcome Satan in our name, and shown to us the way how to fight against, and overcome the Adversary. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

                  <p>Upon the hearing of John Baptists imprisonment, Christ go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto Galilee. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

All Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Gospel are not imprisoned at once; for when John is in prison, Christ is free. 3.

in that part of the countrey where the desolation began, that is, in the <hi>land of Zabulon and Nephthali,</hi> there Christ should begin the consolation of the church, in preaching of the gospel; and now our Lord performeth this. 3. The people that lie in their sins, without the saving knowledg of the gospel, are indeed in <hi>great darkness,</hi> and under the power of <hi>death.</hi> 4. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sin or misery people be under, the preaching of the gospel is able to relieve them; therefore it is called, <hi>A great light,</hi> A light <hi>sprung up</hi> to them, when Christ preacheth the gospel among them.</p>

call, he doth furnish them with all furniture for the calling and promiseth unto them good successe; for, <hi>I will make you fishers of men,</hi> saith he. 4. Such as are called to the Ministry, must neither refuse pains nor perill to save souls, but must go about their work with as great desire to convert men, and as great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to bring them in, as fishers go about their work; for, <hi>I will make you fishers of men.</hi> 5. When Christ doth call his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen instruments, he calls them with power of perswasion, and overpowers all opposition and impediments; for, <hi>Straightway they leave their nets, and follow him.</hi> 6. His calling of them by <hi>Couples,</hi> and those also <hi>Bretheren,</hi> giveth us to understand, that the worke of the Ministry requireth the concurrence of more hands, and no lesse affection among them, then among <hi>Brethren.</hi> 7. His calling of so mean men as fishers, sheweth the freedome of his grace in choosing of instruments; manifesteth the power of his kingdom, who by such weak means can subdue the world; and declareth the depth of his wisdom, who provides so for his own honour, that the instrument shall not carry away the glory of the work.</p>

The means of conversion of souls is the preaching of the Gospel, however men esteem of it; for, <hi>He went about teaching and preaching.</hi> 3. The speciall opportunity of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, when people are conveened in the ordinary place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for religious exercises; for, Christ preached <hi>in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,</hi> 4. The Gospel is a matter of highest concernment, <hi>It is the Gospel of the kingdome,</hi> of that incomparable kingdom of

heaven, which by the gospel is revealed to men, and offered unto men, by which gospel men get right and title unto the kingdome, yea heirs of the Kingdome, and whereby men are governed and led on unto the full possession of the Kingdome. 5. Albeit our LORDS doctrine needed no confirmation, because it is the Truth of the everliving GOD, yet our weak faith needeth confirmation, therfore Christ strengtheneth the weak faith of such, as at first did not perceive Christ to be the Son of GOD, he was graciously pleased to let forth the evidence of his God-head, soveraign power and goodnesse, in working miracles, and those all profitable miracles; such as might lead men to seek the reliefe of the maladies of the soul, from him, who was healing <hi>all manner of sicknesse, and all manner of diseases among the people.</hi> 6.

Such as find need of Christs help, and do beleeve to be relieved by him, will spare no pains, but seek him where they may find him; for, there followed him great multitudes. 8.

Every man who in the sense of his own wants and poverty, is made to begge at the throne of Grace, verily is blessed, whatsoever be the sense he hath of his own unworthiness and misery; for Christ of such doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, <hi>Blessed are the poor in Spirit.</hi> 2. Whosoever are poor in spirit, seeking after Christ in the sense of their own indigence, have right and title unto the riches of grace and glory; albeit they be poor and beggerly in their own feeling, yet are they rich in Christs estimatoin; for of such Christ saith, <hi>Theirs is the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> that is, unto them belongeth eternall life.</p>

Christians must beware to give just ground for troubling of themselves, for that is not persecution, when ill is spoken against men truly &amp; justly, but when ill is spoken against them fasly, and <hi>for Christs cause</hi>; Therefore Christ saith, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are ye, when they speak</hi> ill <hi>of you falsly for my sake.</hi> 3.

As Salt seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, maketh savoury, and doth preserve from putrifaction that which otherwise would be unsavoury and ready to rot, except it were salted; so Ministers should not onely be filled with Grace and Wisedome for their own preservation, but also labour by the word preached, by admonition, by discipline, by a holy manner of conversing among the people, and by all other means to season earthly men, and make them become savoury to God, and one to another; therefore it is said, <hi>Ye are the salt of the earth.</hi> 3.

                  <p>He sheweth the Ministers duty in another similitude of light. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is true the originall light and fountain of all Light, who illuminateth every one that cometh into the world, is <hi>Christ our Lord</hi> himself, yet the Ministers are called, <hi>The light of the world</hi> also, as instruments to hold out the light,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59775:28"/>
because their office is to preach Jesus Christ, who is the <hi>true light,</hi> through whom alone delivery from the dark condition of sin and misery, that is, true righteousnesse and salvation is to be gotten: and because their manner of preaching, and holy conversation should direct men how to exercise their faith on Jesus Christ, and how to draw vertue from him, for their consolation, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; therefore it is said, <hi>Ye are the light of the world.</hi> 2. Except God erect a ministry among men, and indue his servants with gifts and graces, and make them faithfull to doe their duty, the world shall lie in the darknesse of ignorance and error of sin and misery, going on to perdition; and except Ministers endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to have the World illuminate, by holding forth the true knowledg of Christ, they cannot be free of the worlds perishing, nor answerable to this their duty, for to them it is said, <hi>Ye are the light of the world.</hi> 3. He tels them of the dignity of their calling, and duty therein, by another similitude, teaching us, that as a city set on a hill cannot be hid, being set there, to the intent it might be seen afar off; so Ministers of the Gospel, for the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of their calling, and the necessity of their duty cannot be, nor may be hid, but must shew forth that light to the world; and they cannot choose, but have their doctrine and diligence in their calling, their manner of life and conversation, and whole carriage better and worse, laid open to the view and observation of all men, for they are compared here <hi>to a city set on a hill, which cannot be hid.</hi>

                  <p>From the former Doctrine of the duties of the Apostles, our LORD draweth an exhortation to them, and all Ministers of the Gospel (according to the rule, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.37. <hi>What I say unto you, I say unto all,</hi> whom you represent,) teaching that what light of Knowledge, or Faith in God, or Love to God, or to men they have, they should bring it forth for the benefit of men, in their Doctrine and life, by the faithfull discharge of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and holy conversation; therefore, saith he, <hi>Let your light shine,</hi> &amp;c. 2. They should so wisely and sincerely behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in all things, that they may be approven to the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all men: for it is said, <hi>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works</hi>; that is, may perceive, may be convinced, and forced to acknowledge that ye so teach, and so do, as the Lords faithfull servants and children should do. 3.

No wonder the sincere Preachers of the gospel be slandered, as if they were adversaries to the Law, for even Christ himself was traduced in his time, as guilty of this fault, as he sheweth in his Apologie, saying, <hi>Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets:</hi> The ground of the mistake was, because our Lord set at nought the glosses which the corrupt Doctors of the time did put upon the Scripture, and taught men the way of justification by grace, without the works of the Law, therefore men traduced him as an enemy to the Law, and to the Prophets: for clearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59775:29"/>
he bringeth five reasons: The first is, I am so far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to destroy the Law and Prophets, that by the contrary, I intend to fulfill them, saith he; therefore the calumny uttered or conceived of me, as if I intended the contrary, is false. <hi>Doct.</hi> 2 Christ is a true friend to the Law; his doctrine, and the course prescribed by him to his Church, by all means doth procure the obedience of the Law, and the fulfilling of the prophesies; for he saith, <hi>I am not come to destroy them, but to fulfill them.</hi> Now Christ is said to be come to fulfill the Law and Prophets, because what they prophesied of him, he doth accomplish; what they ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at, he hath brought, and is in bringing to passe; what way of righteousness and salvation they set down, he doth make good; for what is in the Law and Prophets to be fulfilled, by <hi>predictions</hi> of what Christ should do, and suffer, (set down partly in plain, partly in figurative types and ceremonies,) or <hi>commands</hi> of holy <hi>Duties,</hi> backed by <hi>Promises</hi> to the Obedient, and <hi>Threatnings</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the disobedient, with their examples? all these Christ came to fulfill most exactly; first by accomplishing in his own person, all predictions of his perfect obedience, even unto the death, whether set down in plain termes, or foresignified of him under types and figures of the ceremonial Law; next, by using all means that men should give obedience to the morall Law, and by blessing effectually these means, and making men really to give obedience to the Law: And thirdly, by making good all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to his subjects, and executing all his threatnings against his enemies, and so he saith justly, <hi>I came not to destroy, but to fulfil the Law and Prophets.</hi>

                  <p>The second reason of Christs intention not to destroy the Law and the Prophets, or the truth of the Old Testament, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the truth of the Doctrine of the Law and the Prophets is more firm and stable then the frame of Heaven and Earth is. <hi>Doct.</hi> Heaven and Earth shall be dissolved, rather then the least point of truth (compared here to the least letter in the Alphabet, to the smallest point, serving to the reading of the letters) should not be fulfilled: for Heaven and earth do continue, only till the time that all that which is prophesied in the Scripture, to be done before the worlds ending, shall be fulfilled; therefore saith our Lord, <hi>Verily I say unto you, till Heaven passe, one jot of the Law shall in no wise passe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>A third reason proving that Christs intention is not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish the directing and commanding power of the Law, or to suffer the morall Law to be laid aside, as not obligatory unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience under the gospel, is this, because his minde is, That whosoever he be, that shall in his practice reject the yoake of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of these commandments of the morall Law, which men account least of, and shall defend his practice, teaching that men may without guiltinesse break the same, <hi>shall be called and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of by God as the least</hi> (that is, a man of no place or room) in the Kingdome of grace and glory; or he shall in no case en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven, as it is said, <hi>verse</hi> 20. And on the contrary, whosoever shall maintain in their practice and doctrine, the authority of all the precepts of the morall Law, as the rule of mans conversation, shall be found true members of the Kingdom of grace and glory; and shall be had in estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God and his saints. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A fore sentence stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against them who make transgressions to light and veniall, as not worthy to be taken notice of; or who either give dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations or take dispensations to transgresse any morall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: and no lesse wrath is denounced against them, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ hath abolished the covenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of works, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatory power of the Law, in favours of his justified and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ones, do teach that Christ hath also abolished in favours of them, the directive, the commanding, and obligatory power of the Law: for of such, and all such Christ hath said, <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall teach men to break the least of these Commandments, shall be called the least in the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> 2. These men may have great comfort, who in their doctrine and example of life do so teach justification by grace, or by faith in Jesus, without the works of the Law, as they do also urge all them who do beleeve and are justified, to make conscience of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of every precept in the morall Law, even as they love to be saved; for of such Christ saith, <hi>Whosoever shall teach, and observe the same, shall be called greatest in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>

shall in no case enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</q>
                  <p>A fourth reason of Christs purpose not to abolish the Law, is, that he doth exclude from the Kingdom of grace and glory, all those whose righteousnesse shall not exceed the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees. These Pharisees and Scribes were indeed very painfull, and outwardly made great profession of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of life; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christ and grace they cared not for, therefore their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse was short. But a true christian first studieth to be clad with the righteousnesse of Christ, and to have his sins pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Christ, and after that hee is justified freely by his grace, without the works of the Law, he laboureth to give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence of the soundnesse of his Faith, by making conscience of obedience as well inwardly as outwardly, not unto any one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or some, but to all the commandements of the Law, study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make progresse in sanctification all the dayes of his life: and so both in regard of imputed righteousness, which is of God by faith in Jesus Christ; and likewise in regard of inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, manifesting itselfe in the sincere study of a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation before God and man; the believers righteousnesse doth far exceed the superficiall righteousnesse of the Pharisees. <hi>Doct.</hi> Except a man study to outstrip the Pharisees and Scribes, both in respect of imputed righteousnesse, and inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse also, he shall not be saved; for Christ here saith, <hi>Except your righteousnesse exceed the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi>

                  <p>A fifth Reason of Christs coming not to destroy, but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law, is by his shewing the true meaning of the Law, and crying down both the false glosses put upon the Law by men, and also all vain traditions put in place of the Law: and this Christ doth most exactly, to the intent he may show how all men by the Law are made guilty, and are found worthy of condemnation, and had need of a Saviour to ransome them; and also by shewing how men being pardoned, ought to study unto an upright obedience of the Law in all things, and this is indeed to fulfill the Law. To this end Christ exponeth sundry commands in the second and first Table, and correcteth five or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59775:31"/>
six corrupt glosses put upon the Law, by the Jewish Doctors: and first in these verses he exponeth the sixth command, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the common-glosse of the Pharisees received by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who esteemed that the command, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> was not broken, except by actuall grosse slaughter, or murther: and if any man should commit man-slaughter, then they put him in one of three ranks: The first was to be brought <hi>before the</hi> inferiour <hi>Iudges</hi> of capitall crimes, and to be in danger of their sentence, because the murther was not of the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser sort. The second rank, was to be brought <hi>before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi> consisting of a greater number, appointed as a superiour Judicatory of capitall crimes, to fit in greater cities, and there to be in danger of their sentence; which was to denounce more shamefull and painfall death, then the inferiour Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory did appoint, in case the murther was more hainous. The third rank was, in case the murther should be of the vilest, and most abominable sort; then by the great Councell which sate at Jerusalem, the guilty were to be adjudged without mercy, or more ado, to be executed most shamefully, and burnt in the most abominable place, in the valley <hi>of Hinnom,</hi> or <hi>Gehenns,</hi> whereby was represented <hi>Hell fire.</hi> The first of the three ranks is mentioned, <hi>vers.</hi> 21. The rest are to be collected by CHRISTS alluding thereunto, <hi>vers.</hi> 22. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men are but slight interpreters of the Lords Law, it is not killing in their sense, if a man be not actually <hi>slain</hi>: for, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall kill</hi> in the grossnesse of the letter, he only is guilty in their judgment. 2. Antiquity seemeth enough to carnall men, for a reason, in defence of whatsoever errour or corrupt custome for which they can pretend antiquity; for Christ sheweth us, that these Jewish Doctors did think it sufficient, that, <hi>It was said of old.</hi> 3. Truth must never be prejudged by antiquity, nor error strengthened thereby; for unto their pretended anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, <hi>It was said of old,</hi> Christ doth oppose this, <hi>But I say unto you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Racha, shall be in danger of the councel; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</q>
                  <p>While Christ doth expone the sixth command more exactly then the Pharisees did, and doth shew the meaning of it, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion unto the manner of their judgement of capitall crimes,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59775:31"/>
our Lords mind is not, that those Judiciall courts, with their different degrees of punishment should be the rule for censuring the breach of the sixth command; but his mind is, that albeit, there be degrees of sin, in breaking of the sixth command, yet the command reacheth to the condemning of every degree of the sin forbidden, so far, that even <hi>rash anger</hi> is capitall, and doth bring a man under the severe sentence of Gods judgment; for, <hi>Whosoever is angry,</hi> saith he, <hi>without a cause,</hi> shall <hi>be in danger of the judgment</hi>; that is, he is culpable of death; and if our neighbour be wronged by us, in a disrespectfull speech, the sin is yet more capitall, and yet more deserveth the punishment of death and condemnation; for, <hi>Whosoever,</hi> saith hee, <hi>shall say to his brother, Racha,</hi> or any word of disdain, shall <hi>be in danger of the councell,</hi> that is, shall be found guilty of a capitall or deadly transgression, in a higher degree; But if anger and disdain proceed so far, as to reproach our Brother, yet more despitefully, and to call him <hi>Fool,</hi> then we shall be in <hi>danger of hell fire,</hi> that is, of a yet higher degree of judgment in hell. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The meanest and mainest outbreakings of our corruption in any sort are forbidden in one and the same command: for our Lords exposition of, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> forbiddeth rash anger, and every evill motion of the heart against our neighbours person, no lesse then it forbiddeth <hi>murther.</hi> 2. The wages of the least degree of sin is death, for not onely <hi>murther,</hi> but also <hi>rash an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and disdainfull speech, are made capitall or deadly sins, (by our Lords interpretation) worthy of death <hi>and hels fire</hi>; So that no relief is to be looked for in Gods justice from the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our sins, but all standeth in the rich ransome of Christs Blood, and largeness of his Grace, unto which refuge the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere exaction of the Law, and strict reckoning of Justice doth drive us.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This exhortation is set down as the use of the former doctrin, wherein the words are not to be taken captiously, as if one might hurt his own body under pretence to preveen sin: for this is both forbidden in the sixth command, and cannot be a solid cure or remedy of sin, though it were permitted; but the matter is proponed in allusion to a presupposed like case of the hazard of a mans life, by a fester or gangrene in a mans eye or hand, (wherein as it were) better that the Chirugion should pluck out the festered eye, and cut off the festered hand, then that the whole body should be lost: so in the case of a darling sin or lust, whereby a man is made to stumble and fall in sin, it were better that he should be mortified and quat, (how necessary soever, how dear soever, though esteemed of as the <hi>right eye,</hi> or the <hi>right hand,</hi>) rather then by sparing of that sinfull lust, soul and body bothshould be cast in hell: now there is no mortifying of the lusts of the flesh but by the Spirit of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. And, as for pardon of sin we are led unto Christ in the exposition of the sixth command, so are we here driven to Christ for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of sin, in the exposition of the seventh command; for he is the onely Chirurgion, who can cut off those fretting lusts which fight against the soul.</p>

That by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is discharged all idle, or unnecessary swearing; for he saith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> to wit, when God doth not cal us to take an oath; for otherwise to swear by God, when he calleth us unto it in weighty matters, for deciding controversies, and ending strife, it is a part of his worship, then religiously to take an oath: but except in the foresaid case, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> 2. Hereby also is discharged all swearing by the creatures; for, <hi>Swear not by heaven,</hi> saith he, <hi>or by earth,</hi> &amp;c. or by any part of mans selfe, as Head or Heart, or any other oath; the reason is, first, because these are creatures; <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> are not <hi>God,</hi> and ought not therefore to be sworn by; and next, because God indirectly is imported in such oaths, by reason of the relation which the creatures have to him, as Gods <hi>Footstool,</hi> or <hi>City,</hi> or <hi>Work</hi>; and thirdly, because as none of the creatures are our Judge, to take order with us, if we swear falsly; so none of all the creatures, (no not our own Head or the least hair thereof,) are so our own, as we may ingage the same by an oath, for the least change to be made thereon, were it but of the colour of our hair to be put in pawn in case our oath be not true: and so we may not swear upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretence at all, by any of them, for, <hi>Thou canst not make one hair white nor black,</hi> saith he.</p>

                     <hi>Ver. 46.</hi> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the Publicans the same?</q>
                  <p>The second motive is, because except your love shall extend it selfe unto your enemies, in the obedience of God, ye can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no reward from him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Love refused to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, proveth our love bestowed on friends to be no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table service to God; for, <hi>If ye love them only which love you, what reward have ye to expect?</hi> for if we love only for love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, we do serve our self only, and not God; and where no service is, no reward is. A third motive is this, the vilest and most odious sinners in the world shall equal you, if you do love only such as love you, and do not also love your enemies; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore love your enemies. <hi>Doct.</hi> To stand at that measure of love, which a wicked man may attain unto, is nothing esteemed of by God; for, <hi>If you,</hi> saith he, <hi>love only your friends, do not even the Publicans the same?</hi>

There must be more in a christian then can be in these that are not renewed: for, <hi>What do you more then others,</hi> importeth, that we should do more; seeing we are born of God, better furnished with his spirit, &amp; more ingaged by special obligation to God then others, and therefore must not carry our

                     <hi>Ver. 48.</hi> Be ye therfore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</q>
                  <p>A fifth motive is, Gods children must aime at the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all vertues, and therefore at the perfection of Love, extended to their enemies. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Christians are called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perfection; and albeit they cannot fully attain unto it in this life, yet must they aime at it, to come more and more near unto it; for it is said, <hi>Be you therefore perfect.</hi> 2. God only is the pattern of perfection to be set before our eyes, as he holdeth forth himselfe unto us in his word, and in his Son Jesus Christ, the expresse image of his Person, to be imitate by us; therefore it is said, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</hi>

                  <p>COncerning the right manner of giving Almes, these Truths are holden forth unto us. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Almes, or shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to the Poor, is a duty carefully to be gone about: for it is said, <hi>Take heed to your almes.</hi> 2. The sin of vain glory may easily slide in it self in any work, specially in alms giving; therefore saith he, <hi>Take heed you do not your almes to be seen
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59775:36"/>
of men.</hi> 3. If almes be done, for obtaining praise of men, and not for conscience of a commanded duty, God will not take it for service, for it is said, <hi>Otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 2.</hi> Therefore, when thou dost thine almes, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may have glory of men: Verily, I say unto you, they have their reward.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But when thou dost almes, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth:</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That thine almes may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee openly.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This is the remedy of this ill. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. We must marke and beware of such faults as we see in others; namely such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation as the Pharisees used, who when they were to give almes, proclaimed by sound of Trumpet, that the poor should conveen at such a time and place, to receive such a mans alms; therefore Christ saith, <hi>Do not sound a Trumpet,</hi> &amp;c. that is, Beware of all vain of oftentation. 2. When men in doing good, look more to mens praise, then how to please God, the vain praise of men, whether they obtain it, or misse of it, is all the fruit which they shall have of their work; for, <hi>Verily they have their reward</hi>; they need look for no more. 3. Each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinner do seek darknesse, and lurking holes to hide their sin; but Church, and Market, and the most open conventions are the choise places for acting of the sin of hypocrisie, as here, <hi>in the Synagogues and in the streets.</hi> 4. All Hypocrites are vainly glorious; Hypocrisie and vain glory go together; for. Hypocrites, saith he, <hi>Do that they may have glory of men.</hi> 5. We should not suffer our selves to take notice what we give in almes, nor should we esteem much of it, as if there were any worth in our alms, let be to seek praise of men, for this is the way, <hi>Not to let the left hand know what the right hand doth</hi>; otherwise no man can be ignorant of what he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberatly, no man can give almes but the poor who receive the almes must know of it, and in publick collecting of almes the world must needs be open. 6. Alms given in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that is, in obedience to God, and in love of the poor, is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret work; for the main substance of it is only seen of God; therefore it is said, <hi>That thy almes may be in secret.</hi> 7. What good work wee take least notice of, what wee make least <hi>esteem of,</hi> and do carry most quietly between God and us, of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59775:36"/>
that doth God take special notice; for of such a work it is said, <hi>the Father seeth in secret.</hi> 8. Whatsoever good work is done of secret intention to obey <hi>and glorifie</hi> God, shall be made open by him in due time to our praise, and shall be rewarded in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to our profit; for beside the sweet testimony of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence following it, it is promised, <hi>Thy Father himself shall reward thee openly.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 5.</hi> And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily, I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, they have their reward.</q>
                  <p>The next Doctrine concerns the right manner of prayer, <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. In prayer, all hypocriticall oftentation must be eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, such as the Pharisees used, who in the congregation, and in the Street carried themselves, so as they might be taken notice of, and accounted to be devout men: for it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved here, <hi>They love to pray standing, that they may be seen of men.</hi> 2. Persons who are vain glorious in their prayers, have no profit of their prayers, save the wind of some witlesse mens approbations; for, <hi>They have their reward.</hi> 3. Howsoever men may think it hard, that prayers for this fault should be lost, yet so it shall be found; for Christ saith, <hi>Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy close<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; and when thou hast thus thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly.</q>
                  <p>Christ doth not forbid publick praying before others in the Congregation, nor in a Familie; for this is a part of Gods due worship, and of our confessing of his name: neither doth he retrinch all our secret prayers to a chamber; but the meaning is, that we should in all our prayers be far from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. In prayer we should regard only Gods eye, and seek only his approbation: and beside all our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with or before others, we should pray also when no man knoweth of it; and whensoever we pray, whether in private or publick, we should be as far from vain oftentation as if we were in a private chamber alone with doors shut; for this is it that he saith, <hi>When thou prayest, shut thy door, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Our prayer must be from the inward of our spirit, directed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to the invisible God; for, <hi>Pray,</hi> saith he, <hi>to thy Father.</hi> 3. In prayer God doth take notice specially of the uprightnesse
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59775:37"/>
of the heart, and of that which is hid from men, for he saith, <hi>Thy Father seeth in secret.</hi> 4. The sincere and secret prayer is followed with an evident blessing in the answer; for, <hi>He shall reward thee openly,</hi> saith Christ. 5. The rewards of God must needs be full of Grace, when he promiseth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward praying and begging, both in this world and at the day of judgment, saying of secret prayer, <hi>Thy Father shall reward thee openly.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Verse 7.</hi> But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Be ye not therfore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what thing ye have need of, before ye ask him.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The second fault in prayer is idle multiplying of words, which is discharged for three reasons, which are so many do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines: 1. Idle multiplying of words, is the sin of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who are destitute of the saving knowledge of God: for Christ saith, Use not <hi>vain repetitions as the heathen do</hi>: Idle repititions of words presupposeth and proceedeth from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> base misconception of God, as if he could be moved by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of words, as men are moved; for, <hi>They think,</hi> saith he, to be <hi>heard by their much speaking,</hi> but <hi>do ye not so</hi>: The third reason is, Because Christs Disciples, when, in obedience of Gods command, they come to worship God, and to edifie themselves in prayer, need neither to inform God what they would have; for, <hi>He knoweth,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>what things you have need of before you ask:</hi> nor need they to move or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade God; for, <hi>He is your Father,</hi> saith he, and therefore we should not, nor need not use vain repetitions: mean time let us remember, that when the Saints insist in prayer, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately avowing the truth and mercy of God, and striving to strengthen their own faith in prayer, that is not a vain repetition, or that much speaking which is here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 9.</hi> After this manner therfore pray ye: Our Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</q>
                  <p>For helping of this, and other faults about prayer, our Lord giveth us the example of a formed Prayer, which is ready and fit to be made use of expresly as a <hi>Prayer,</hi> whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we should joyn in one body with all true Christians mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant in the World, in all common and necessary desires; which also is to be made use of, as a <hi>Pattern</hi> and <hi>Platform</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:59775:37"/>
for imitation, when we are to pray for any one or more things, more particularly concerning our self, or any part of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church. Now as this Prayer is a <hi>Pattern</hi> for any desires more special then these which are here exprest, we are taught hereby, 1. To pray <hi>only for things allowed</hi> and promised in Gods word: for such are all things in the Pattern. 2. To pray to <hi>God only,</hi> who only hears at all times; for, <hi>We must pray to our heavenly Father</hi> only. 3. To pray in <hi>a known lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> according as Christ did deliver this form of prayer to his Disciples. 4. To pray without vain repetition, or idle multiplying of words; for this prayer is given for example of such a prayer, as hath no vain repetition. 5. To pray with more respect to Gods glory, then to our own particular good; for the order of prayer teacheth so much. 6. To pray with a hearty and spirituall disposition, in fear and reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, as <hi>being above us in Heaven,</hi> there to receive, hear, and answer our prayers from the holy sanctuary of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, through which vail we get accesse unto the fulnesse of the God-head, which dwelleth in Christ, who is in Heaven, and without whom we cannot find God reconciled. 7. To pray with love toward God, and confidence in him, as in our Father in Christ: for Christ giveth warrant to call God <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 8. To pray with affection and love to all Saints mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant on earth, as children of the same heavenly Father, theirs and ours: Father to the weak, no lesse then to the stronger; for Christ will have us calling him, <hi>Our Father,</hi> in behalf of all the children on earth; for whom and with whom we do pray.</p>
                  <p>From the first Petition we are taught that every true Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Christ, must have the glorifying of God for his chiefest desire; for first and above all must he seek that Gods <hi>Name may be hallowed.</hi> 2. That God must be hallowed as he maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self known by his word; for it is his Name or Himself, as he is named and manifested by his word and ordinances, and works and providence, <hi>which is to be hallowed.</hi> 3. That he himself must be the procurer of his own glory among men, for therfore pray we, <hi>Hallowed be thy name.</hi>

                  <p>From the second petition we are taught, that beside the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Kingdome, and government of all things, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fully in vigour, there is a speciall Kingdome of grace,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59775:38"/>
wherein God is revealed, and acknowledged to be King and Lord over his Saints: this Christ cals, <hi>Thy Kingdom,</hi> as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar wherein he specially delights. 2. That this Kingdom of grace is so <hi>come</hi> already, as it shall be still coming more and more, so long as Christs Disciples shall have need to pray, that is, till the fulness of glory in the second coming of Christ shall be revealed, <hi>Then shall the Kingdom</hi> prayed for, <hi>fully come.</hi> 3. That God is he, who doth promove, bring on, and perfect this kingdome: Therefore must we say, <hi>Thy Kingdome come.</hi> 4. That od will have all his Disciples draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his royall and triumphing chariot by their prayers; and saying, <hi>Thy kingdom come.</hi> From the third Petition we learn. 1. That albeit God dwelleth in heaven, and doth all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended will, yet men do not obey as they should, his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wil. Therefore there is need in this respect still to pray, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> 2. That the Saints must renounce obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their own will, and to Satans will, and to the will of men, and must submit themselves absolutely to Gods will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by word or work; saying, <hi>Not mine, but thy will be done.</hi> 3. That it must be divine power which shall change mens hearts, and frame them to the obedience of his will, and to this end do we request him, to subdue mens wils to his own, saying, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> 4. That God hath no work of sanctification to work upon any man, but upon these only who are <hi>on the earth,</hi> for they that are in heaven are perfected, and else-where there is none, whose will the Lord doth sanctifie: Therefore do we pray only, <hi>Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.</hi> 5. Albeit we do not attain unto perfection of Holiness in this life, yet we must aim at it, long, and pray for it: for our Lord teacheth us to pray, That the will of God may <hi>be done i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From the fourth petition we learn. 1.

That we live not mainly by bread, but by Gods word, and his powerfull blessing, imported in <hi>Giving of bread.</hi> 3. That how lawfully soever; and deservedly at mens hands we get our bread, yet in regard Gof od, we deserve nothing, but must have all of free bounty, &amp; must beg of him <hi>daily,</hi> to give us our

                     <hi>daily bread.</hi> 4. That we should not be anxious for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor for great allowance in the world: sufficient for the day is the care of it self; and we must be content to crave and to receive <hi>This day our daily bread.</hi> 5. That as we pray not for the dead, but onely with, and for such as have need of <hi>Daily bread,</hi> and are living on earth with us; so should we be sensible of their necessities, and pray for them as for ourselves, saying, <hi>Give us our bread.</hi>

That every day in many things we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> offend all, and must confesse not only <hi>sin,</hi> but <hi>sins.</hi> 3. That howsoever we have right unto remission of sins in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, yet we must seek to apply that our right unto our daily faults, and beg the use of our right, for applying of forgiveness. 4. That our sins deserve due punishment, even death, which is a naturall merit of sin, which doth oblige us unto the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty; for, therefore <hi>sins</hi> here are called <hi>Debts.</hi> 5. That the sin being forgiven, the vindictive punishment is forgiven also; for to the same sense are we directed to say, <hi>Forgive us our debt, and forgive us our sins</hi>: Where-through it cometh to passe, that there is no remission of sin, and retaining of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive punishment, but both the guilt, and this sort of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment are forgiven, and taken away together: 6. Wrongs done by others unto us, do oblige the doers of injury to repair the wrong, and so do make them not only debters unto God, but also unto us; therefore doth our Lord call such as have done wrong unto us, <hi>Our debters:</hi> 7. Though publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects may move us to seek reparations of wrongs, in the way of justice; yet not only must we renounce private revenge of wrong done unto us, but also forgive the same, especially when the offender calleth for it at our hand; for Christ presupposeth, that he who seeks forgiveness of God, <hi>doth also give forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to men</hi>; 8. It is an argument to perswade us of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse from God of our wrongs, when we forgive men their wrongs done against us; for Christ will have him who saith, <hi>forgive us our trespasses,</hi> to say also, <hi>As we forgave these that tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe</hi> against us,</p>

Because we have so oft yeelded unto Satans temptation, and of our self we are so prone to be tempted, and to be overcome of our own concupiscence, that God justly may give us over unto Satans temptation; Therefore it is necessary that we should request God, not <hi>To lead us</hi> in his justice <hi>into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 3.

                     <hi>God will deliver us from that evill one,</hi> and from all ill; that is, from Satan, sin, and perdition; for we say, <hi>Thine is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, and glory</hi>: that is, Unto thee our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belongeth the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and soveraign government of all things, with right and <hi>strength</hi> to dispose thereof, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to passe all that wee request for: and to thee doth belong the <hi>glory</hi> of all things for ever: Whence learn, 1.

Again, such as call God their Father, and yet will not forgive men their trespasses, may be assured that God will not forgive them their trespasses, or that God will not speak peace to their conscience, nor intimate remission of sins unto their souls: for albeit Gods granting a remission of sin, in his counsell, goes before our giving remission of mens sins, yet Gods granting unto us remission of sins in the court of our conscience, follows after our giving remission to men of their sin; for so long as we keep malice against our neighbour, and will not forgive them, our conscience shall never be solidly assured of the forgivnesse of our sins, for so importeth the text.</p>

                  <p>The fourth head of doctrine, is, to beware of covetousnesse and cares of this world, as of a speciall enemie to all true God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse; which because it is a rise evill, and hard to be cured, he insisteth upon the beating down of it so much the more: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to this purpose seven motives or reasons, which in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance are so many doctrines. In the first part of this verse our Lord insinuates, 1. That every man is given to have some Treasure and Store of that which he most esteemeth of, loveth most to have, keepeth best, and is most loath to want; for this is imported in, <hi>Lay not up treasures for your self.</hi> 2. That we are given by nature to chuse some earthly and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thing for our Treasure, and to have the earth the place of it; and so have need to be warned to lay up our <hi>treasure not upon earth.</hi> The first reason to disswade us from covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of earthly things, is, because all earthly things are peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, and may in our time, either rot or be taken from us! for what is on earth, <hi>moth and rust may corrupt, or theeves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59775:40"/>The second reason: Heavenly things only are worthy to be our treasure, and Heaven only is worthy to be the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, therefore covet not things earthly, but heavenly, such as are faith and love, and grace to abound in the good fruits of faith, <hi>Lay up,</hi> saith he, <hi>Treasures for your selves in heaven.</hi> The third reason is: Things heavenly and spirituall, are to be keeped and injoyed in heaven, where all things are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and permanent, and such as cannot be taken from us by fraud or violence, <hi>where neither moth nor rust doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,</hi> therefore seek not these things that are earthly, but these things that are heavenly. The fourth reason is, a mans treasure takes his heart after it; therefore covet not earthly things but heavenly, that your hearts might be set on Heaven, and not on earth; for, <hi>Where your treasure is, there will your hearts be also.</hi>

                        <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> The light of the bodie is the eye: If therfore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if therefore the light that is in thee be darknesse, how great is that darknesse?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The fifth reason, In generall termes tending to this much; If your mind intend to treasure up heavenly things, the whole course of your life will be lightsome, holy and heavenly: but if ye intend to treasure up earthly things, then the whole course of your life will be earthly, <hi>darke,</hi> and unspeakably sinfull. Therefore set not your selves to treasure up earthly things, but heavenly rather: This is imported in a similitude thus, As the eye by its light, is the directer of the whole body, so the intention of a mans minde or heart, by its light, is the directer of the whole course and actions of a mans life. In the similitude are holden forth to us these truths; 1. That no lesse care should be had to have our judgement and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sanctified, then to have the eye of our body clear; <hi>for, as the eye is the light of the body,</hi> so is the minde, the heart and intention the light of a mans life. 2. As <hi>when the eye of the body is clear, the whole body</hi> is illuminate, and well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected what to do; So when the intention of the mind and heart, (which is the eye of the soul,) is single, and set upon the heavenly treasure, then the whole body of a mans conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation shall be well ordered, and full of light, to direct him in the way how to get the heavenly Treasure. 3. <hi>As when the eye of the body is corrupt,</hi> and ill disposed, the whole body walketh
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59775:41"/>
in darknesse without direction; So when the intention of a mans heart is not singly set on the heavenly Treasure, but is evill, and set on the things of the earth, then the whole body of a mans course and actions is ful of darknesse, that is, of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and miscarriage, of sin and misery. When the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of a man (which he setteth up as a mark to shoot at, and useth as a light to direct him what means hee shall use) is darknesse, that is, erroneous and sinful; then unspeakable great is the darknesse, errour and sinfulnesse of that mans course; for, <hi>If the light that is in thee be darknesse,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>how great is that darknesse?</hi> 5. This general sentence may serve to loose a doubt, about the lawfulnesse of making provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a mans family, and laying up for his children: Thus, if a mans intention be <hi>spirituall, and singly set on God</hi> for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a spirituall Treasure, then shall his <hi>course be full of light,</hi> and well directed how to do duty to his family and children; but if under pretence of this lawfull care, he shall make an idol of riches, intending onely to abound in wealth, to seek and lay up his treasure on earth, then shall all that he doth in a lawfull calling, be sinfull unto him, <hi>his course shall be darknesse.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.</q>
                  <p>A sixth reason, under similitude of serving two masters. No man can serve God and Mammon or worldly riches, more then a man can serve two opposite masters; Therefore beware to set your selves to lay up <hi>treasures in the earth,</hi> but rather seek God, and lay up your treasure in him. <hi>To serve God,</hi> is to give up a mans minde, heart, and whole man, to know, and do what God requires, without care what shall be the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: To <hi>serve Mammon,</hi> is to give up a mans minde, heart, and indeavour to sinde out and follow all the wayes he can, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease riches, whatsoever may come of it. Hence learn, 1. That the man who takes God to be his Master, must do nothing but as God allows him, neither in the matter of pleasure, nor of profit, nor of preferment, nor in any other thing; for, <hi>This is to serve God</hi> as his Master. 2. If the care or love of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or any other thing draw away the minde or heart of a man from the love of God, or from his obedience, a man <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the servant of Mammon,</hi> or of that lust whereunto hee so gives obedience. 3. Albeit men conceive they can well
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59775:41"/>
serve God and their lusts also, yet it is impossible so to do; for, <hi>No man can serve two masters</hi> opposite, such as is GOD, and whatsoever thing doth come in competition with him, for, <hi>Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.</hi> 4. That thing is a mans Master, which, the man being put to the tryall, loveth most, holdeth most unto, and preferreth in competition: If a man will rather offend God then lose riches, pleasures, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he must do the one, then is the man not the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, but the servant of the other thing beside God; for, <hi>He loveth that other, and holdeth unto it,</hi> and preferreth it to God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Verse 25.</hi> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what ye shall put on: is not the life more then meat, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then rayment?</q>
                  <p>A seventh reason disswading from coverousnesse, drawn forth by consequence from the sixth reason: It is not lawful to be anxious about things necessary, as food or rayment; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore far lesse is it lawfull to be covetous of earthly treasure, or of needlesse riches. Hence learn, 1. That albeit using of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full callings and ordinary means for food and rayment may stand with Gods service, and his approbation; yet taking <hi>thought</hi> for them, or being anxious about the successe, is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and here forbidden as a mark of covetousness, and too much affecting of the creature, and of distrust in God; for, <hi>Take no thought for your life,</hi> saith he. This distrustful anxiety for food and rayment in time to come (which is a branch of covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, covered with the appearance of necessity) our Lord refutes by eight reasons: The first is, God who hath given life, which is more then food, will take care to provide food for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of life, so long as he hath appointed life to continue: and God who hath framed the body, which is more worth then the rayment, will also provide for a garment; therefore anxious care for food and rayment is unlawfull: which teacheth us, That the most specious excuses which can be made for cloaking of covetousnesse, are rejected by God as naughty; <hi>Is not the life more then meat,</hi> saith Christ?</p>

                  <p>The second reason: God who provide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> food for birds and fowls, will certainly provide for his own children; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59775:42"/>
anxious and distrustfull cares for food and raiment, in Christ Disciples is unlawfull; for, <hi>Behold the fowles of the air,</hi> &amp;c. This reason is strengthened, 1. By insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that men have the ordinary meanes of some lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (comprehended under sowing and reaping,) which sow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s have not; and therefore anxious and distrustfull care for food and raiment is so much more unlawfull in them, as is impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in these words, <hi>neither do they reap:</hi> again, this reason is strengthened, by comparison of us with birds, and preferring of us in Gods estimation, <hi>are ye not much better then they?</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>The third reason: Anxious care about the successe of means connot produce any good effect, therefore it should not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained; for even when a man hath eaten, he cannot make himselfe stronger, or more tall then it shall please God to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose: To what purpose then doth it serve to take thought or anxiety, as if the use of means should not yeeld food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? for, <hi>which of you by taking thought can eke a cubit to his stature?</hi>

                     <hi>Verse 32.</hi> (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</q>
                  <p>The fifth reason: Anxious seeking of the things of this earth, is the fault of the Gentiles, who are destiture of the knowledg of God, and are ignorant of these heavenly things, prepared for Gods children; Therfore Christians who are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instructed, should eschew this godlesse anxiety; for, <hi>After these things,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Gentiles do seek.</hi> The sixth reason: Christians are not fatherless; nor is their father ignorant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or careless to do for them; God in Heaven is their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and knoweth all things whereof they stand in need; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore godlesse anxiety for food and raiment is utterly unlawful; for, <hi>Your Heavenly Father</hi> knoweth that ye have need of these <hi>things.</hi>

                     <hi>Verse 33.</hi> But seek ye first the Kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse, and all these things shall be added unto you.</q>
                  <p>The seventh reason by way of precept: You have the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and his righteousnesse, whereupon to bestow your first and chiefest cares; which if you seek after earnestly, ye shall not need to be anxious for food or raiment, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needfull thing on earth; for, <hi>All these shall be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added</hi> unto the grant of your chiefe desires, and shall be brought unto your hand; Therefore anxious caring for these meaner things, is unlawfull. Hence learn, 1. That to be partaker of the kingdom of Gods grace here, and of his glory in heaven, is worthy of our chiefest affections, and most intent indevours; for, <hi>Seek first the Kingdome of God,</hi> importeth this. 2. That we cannot be sure to be Subjects of Gods gracious kingdome here, nor of his glorious Kingdome in Heaven hereafter, except we also study to be sure of the righteousness of God, which is by faith in Jesus Christ, and of holinesse and uprightnesse of life flowing therefrom; for, <hi>Seek the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of God,</hi> and <hi>Seek the Kingdome</hi> are joyned. 3. That whosoever do earnestly seek after the Kingdome of God, and his righteousness, shall not only be sure to have what they seek, but also to have whatsoever is necessary for them in this life: for these things, to wit, which concern food and raiment, <hi>shall be superadded unto you,</hi>

                  <p>He repeateth the discharge of anxious care for time to come, and addeth the eighth reason; The morrow shall bring with it troublesome cares of its own; and the day or the time present hath sufficient trouble by it self: Therefore neither time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, nor time to come should be rendred more miserably by anxious anticipating of troublesome cares before they come: Hence learn, 1. That we are ready to make our present time miserable, by anxious and distrustfull care; for so importeth, <hi>Take no thought for to morrow.</hi> 2. That relying on Gods ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for us, not only saveth us from sin, but also cutteth off much misery; for so imports, <hi>Take no thought for the morrow.</hi> 3.

                     <q>
                        <hi>Ver. 1.</hi> Judge not, that ye be not judged.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THe first doctrine is a forbidding of rash judging of mens persons and actions, or passing wrong sentence censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and uncharitably against others, whether in our mind, or in our speeches; either for no fault, or for lesser then we our selves are subject unto, for otherwise he forbids neither private
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59775:43"/>
nor publick righteous judgement, but only rash, uncharitable, and unrighteous censuring of others, whereunto naturally we are inclined; for, <hi>Iudg not,</hi> saith he, to wit, unrighteously: the reasons are five; The first reason is, if ye rashly judge of others, you have to fear lest God judge you justly; for, <hi>Iudge not, that ye be not judged,</hi> saith he.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</q>
                  <p>A second reason: As you are charitable and sober in your judging of others, or uncharitable and rash in judging of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so may ye expect God shall in his wise providence give you a meting; for, <hi>With what judgement</hi> (charitable or uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable) <hi>you judg, you shall be judged</hi>; that is, have like measure given to you, to wit, a just meting in mercy, or in justice.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but considerest not the beame that is in thine owne eye?</q>
                  <p>A third reason: It is unreasonable, that having grosser faults your self then these which are in others, ye should passe by your own faults, grosse like beams, without observation, and go pry in upon other mens infirmities, small like motes in comparison: Therfore ye should not judge rashly. Hence learn, that Self-love so blindeth us, that of our own great faults we are not sensible, but the smallest infirmities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we narrowly pry in upon, and observe them; therefore saith he, <hi>Why beholdest thou the mote,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 4.</hi> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye: and behold, a beam is in thine owne eye?</q>
                  <p>A fourth reason: By rash and uncharitable censuring thy neighbour, thou shalt never be able to benefit him, so long as this grosse beame of rash judgement, or any such ill is found in thy self, Therefore judg not rashly. <hi>Doct.</hi> He that would benefit others by reproving their faults; must be blamelesse himself, or else both his counsell and reproof shall be turned back upon him; for how and with what countenance, or hope of profiting his brother, will he say, <hi>Let me pull out the mote out of thy eye</hi>? &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 5.</hi> Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye.</q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:59775:44"/>A fifth reason: Censorious and rash judging of others, is the mark of a hypocrite, therefore judge not; for, <hi>thou hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite</hi> he calleth him, because the censorious judger of other mens faults, would make himselfe and others beleeve, he were no wayes tainted with any such faults himselfe: Our Lord by this speech doth not hinder brotherly admonition, but rather doth direct the way and order of it; for, <hi>First cast out,</hi> &amp;c. saith he. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. He that would inform others, should begin in earnest to reform himself; for it is said, <hi>First cast out the beame out of thine own eye,</hi> that is, go about the reformation of thy own sins. 2. The man who is about the removing of his own sins, shall have spirituall light and wisdome to deal with others, in the matter of their repentance and reformation, for It is said, <hi>Then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote.</hi>

The truth of the Gospel and the holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Religion are precious pearls, belonging only to Christs Disciples; therefore Christ calleth them, <hi>Your pearls.</hi> 2. Some men are so profane and sensuall, as they have no reverence nor estimation of holinesse, or holy things; and therefore are justly here called <hi>Dogs and Swine.</hi> 3. Whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we perceive that there is no appearance of doing good, by offering holy admonitions to men, but by the contrary, that holy things shall be abused, and we also suffer reproach for offering the same, our Lord gives us warrant to forbear, <hi>Lest they trample your pearles,</hi> saith he, <hi>under their feet, and turn again, and rent you:</hi> But lest under the pretence of this warrant to keep off contempt from holy things, we be too much feared for contempt of our selves, and for this cause may prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable censurers of others, as if they were Dogs and Swine, who are not so to be accounted of, we must take along with us the former doctrine of, <hi>Iudg not rashly</hi>; praying the Lord withall to give us wisdome in all things.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The third head of doctrine serveth to stir us up to instancie in prayer. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Great is our need, who like beggers want all things, and must seek all of God; Therefore, <hi>Ask,</hi> saith he. 2. Albeit we obtain not at first what we lack, yet must we not fall off from prayer, but continue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly <hi>to seek and knock.</hi> 3. We shall not be refused of any needfull suit that we make, nor shall we be excluded from fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with God, if we knock to have entry: for, <hi>Every one</hi> who in saith <hi>do seek</hi> (what God alloweth to be sought) <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> &amp;c. 4. We may assure our selves that the returne of our prayers shall not be unprofitable, far lesse hurtfull; for God will not deal worse with his children, then Men do with theirs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for, <hi>What man,</hi> saith he, <hi>will give a stone for bread, or a serpent for fish to his childe?</hi> 5. Whatsoever good could be expected by our children from us, their naturall sinfull Parents, whose affections are corrupt, that and much more, yea every thing that is good, may be expected in prayer from God; for, <hi>If ye being evill, can give,</hi> &amp;c. 6. Such Disciples of Christ as depend on God by prayer, are accounted Gods Children: for instead of <hi>children,</hi> he putteth <hi>them that ask him.</hi> 7. Such as would have their prayers granted, must not live as they list, but do to others so as in reason they would be done unto by others; Therefore, <hi>As you would,</hi> &amp;c. saith he, <hi>daye unto them.</hi> 8.

Because of the easiness of the way to hell many go in thereat, nothing fearing the issue; but for the difficulty of the way to heaven, few <hi>do find it,</hi> few <hi>do walk in it.</hi> 4. Christs Disciples having this straight-way revealed to them in the word, should chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go along to life, then go with the multitude unto destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for, <hi>Enter in at the straight gate,</hi> saith our Lord, <hi>for wide is the other.</hi>

                  <p>He cleareth and confirmeth this third reason, by a similitude
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59775:45"/>
from trees, teaching us, that as men gather not good fruits from Thorn and Thistles, but good trees bear good fruit, and cannot bear ill fruit, as their kindly and ordinary birth; and ill trees bear ill fruit, and cannot bear good fruit as their kindly birth: so true and false Teachers are to be known by their fruits. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord sealeth the honesty of faithful Teachers with a holy life, and doth plague false Teachers with the out-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their rottennesse. 2 As destruction abideth the tree that beareth not good fruit, and much more that which beareth ill fruit, so destruction abideth the false Teacher; for, <hi>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen down.</hi>

                  <p>The sixth and last head of Christs Sermon, concerning the necessity of beleeving, and obeying of his doctrine, and putting it uprightly in practise, which our Lord doth presse by three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: The first is, Not every one that esteemeth himself to be Christs servant, and doth confesse him to be his Lord, shall be saved; but the man onely who putteth in practice Gods will: Therefore it is necessary that faith and obedience of Christs doctrine be carefully practised. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A man may professe himself a Christian, and seem to be zealous in avowing Christ to be his Lord, and yet be disobedient to the doctrine; For Christs word doth import this, that <hi>some may call him Lord, Lord, who do not his Fathers will.</hi> 2. Professors of christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without the practice of sound faith and repentance, shall be excluded out of heaven; for the sentence is cleer, <hi>Not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven.</hi> 3. Such as study to obey Gods will reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Gospel, that is, to beleeve in the Son of God, and to testifie their faith by a holy conversation shal be surely saved; for, <hi>He that doth the will of my Father which is in heaven, shall enter into the Kingdome of heaven:</hi> now the will of God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the word, is, that he whom the law condemneth, should flee to Christ Jesus by faith, and study to bring forth the fruits of newnesse of life.</p>

                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59775:46"/>The second reason to this meaning: Many conceive now, that this plea of being Prophets, and workers of miracles in my Name, will be sufficient for their salvation in the day of judgment, who then at that day will finde themselves disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of their hopes, because they have not been workers of righteousnesse; therefore reall obedience of my Doctrine is necessary. <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1.

                  <p>THe first evidence of Christs divine power and grace, is, the miraculous healing of the leper. In whose example these things are to be learned, 1. That Christs God-head and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power must be laid, as a ground by every one who come, unto him, else nothing can be expected; according as this le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gives him the glory of curing a miraculous disease, saying, <hi>Thou canst make me clean.</hi> 2.

                  <p>In our Lords hearkning to the Leper: Learn, 1. That Christ abhorreth not the vilest of those who come unto him, how loathsome soever, and that he can touch the unclean, and not be infected by pollution, but is able to cleanse filthiness by the touch of his power; for, <hi>He put forth his hand, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him.</hi> 2. That Christ did profess openly his own divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for absolutely he commanded in his own name and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as God the departing of the sicknesse, saying, <hi>I will, be thou clean,</hi> and this he proved in effect, immediately by cleansing the leper in a moment; for, <hi>Immediately the leprosie was clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>

                  <p>In this direction given to the leper, to shew himselfe to the Priest, who according to the law was judge in the case of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie, Learn, 1. That Christs benefits will abide the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and be found to be solid, even his soes being Judges: therefore he will have the <hi>Man healed, to go to the Priest,</hi> who was appointed Judge of the cleansing of leprosie. 2. That Christ will not allow any man to speak of him, but as he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, therefore he would have the work found to be divine by the Priest, before it should be known that it was <hi>his</hi> work, for his own greater glory; therfore saith he, <hi>See thou tell no man.</hi> 3. That Christ would have the ceremoniall law kept, so long as the time thereof indured, saying, <hi>Offer the gift that Moses commanded.</hi> 4. That if our Lord suspend the manifesting of his glory, it is for manifesting of it in a fitter time, to the convincing of his adversaries, and confirmation of the faith of his own: Therefore he will have a <hi>Sacrifice offered unto God</hi> for the cleansing, that the God-head of the cleanser may be seen, and a testimony given against them, who would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg his power to be divine.</p>

                  <p>Upon this occasion, our Lord prophesieth of the calling of the Gentiles, verse 11. and rejection of the Jews, verse 12. Whence we learn, 1.

If a man have no more but the externall honour of a Covenanter for the Kingdom, and do want faith in Christ, he shall be stripped na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of that externall honour also: for, here it is said of such, <hi>The children of the Kingdom shall be cast out.</hi> 5.

                  <p>The Evangelist maketh observation of the intent of these works: Hence learn, 1. That all the miraculous cures which Christ used upon mens bodies, was to make it evident, that he was the promised Saviour of soules spoken of by the Prophets; for, <hi>These things did he, that it might be fulfilled,</hi> or be known to be fulfilled, <hi>which was spoken by Esaias.</hi> 2.

of the sick; this welcoming of them, how untimous so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came, proveth that Christ not only took on him our infirmities, common to mankind, but also by compassion <hi>did bear our sicknesses</hi> so affectionately, that he healed such as came unto him, so readily and shortly, as if the disease had been in his own body.</p>

                  <p>The report of his miracles being spread abroad, multitudes of the people did flock about him, to gaze and wonder at him. Therefore Christ no wayes loving idle gazing, nor confused confluence of curious people, doth give commandement to his Disciples by ship to go over the lake of Genesaret, unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Many do flock after Christ and his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rather out of curiosity, and by-respects, then out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to profit, as is here evident. 2. Christ is not the author, nor allower of confusion, be it under never so specious pretences, as here appeareth. 3. Christ wil rather depart then foster folly; he loveth not to feed any mans curiosity, but to be profitable; he loveth not worldly pomp, but to be beleeved into, and to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for salvation; Therefore, <hi>He gave commandement to depart unto the other side.</hi>

                  <p>Here is another man called to follow Christ, who desires a delay, and putteth off the matter with an excuse, till his old father were dead and buried: Hence learn, 1. That such as Christ hath a mind to call to the Ministry, he wil find them out: for here is a Disciple, who hath no mind to follow Christ unto the constant attendance of the Ministry, and yet Christ intends to have him. 2. A true calling may be met possibly at first, with an unwilling minde, either altogether refusing the Ministry, or shifting off the calling for a time, for this man desires to be let alone till his aged father should die, that he might discharge the last duty unto him, ere he followed Christs call; <hi>Suffer me first to bury my father,</hi> saith he. 3. Christ will not take a refusall of the man, whom he intends to imploy; and that no pretence of doing duty to mens bodies shall be taken for an excuse for the not taking charge of souls, when Christ doth call; for Christ urgeth him stil, saying, <hi>Follow me.</hi> 4. Common civil duties may be done by any men, but the work of the Ministry only by men chosen, and called, and sent, <hi>Therefore follow thou me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>and let the dead bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their dead:</hi> that is, men dead in their sins are sufficient for such a work, as burying the dead, <hi>but follow thou</hi> this higher im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>

                     <p n="25">25. And his disciples came unto him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us, we perish.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearfull, O ye of little faith? Then he arose and rebuked the winds, and the sea, and there was a great calm.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. But the men marvelled, saying, what manner of man is this, that even the winde amd the sea obey him?</p>

                  <p>In this miracle observe, 1. That our Lord of set purpose, will lead his Disciples into dangers, for the stirring up, and triall of their faith, and for evidencing of his own glory; for, <hi>He enters into a ship</hi> for this end, and maketh his <hi>Disciples fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him,</hi> wherein they might safely hazard indeed when he went before and did give warrant to them to follow. 2. His presence exeemeth not his Disciples from trouble, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for, <hi>Now there arose a great tempest in the sea.</hi> 3. Our Lord as he took on him our nature, so also he subjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to our naturall and sinlesse infirmities, for being weary on the land, he fals <hi>asleep in the ship.</hi> 4. The church may be like to be drowned, and Christ may seem to neglect the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the Church now in the ship, <hi>was covered with the waves, but he was asleep in the ship.</hi> 5. The church must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve Christ to be God, and able to deliver them, albeit he seem as it were sleeping among them, because he can carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as one a sleep, and that of purpose in his wisdom, to the end he may be awaked by their prayers, as by the Disciples here, <hi>They came and awoke him, and cried, Lord, save us, we perish.</hi> 6. As sense of danger and need is a choise argument, when we deal with Christ for help (for, <hi>We perish</hi> speaketh much) so is it an ordinary fore-runner of deliverance and help; for, <hi>Save us, we perish,</hi> went before the rebuking of the wind. 7. It is a sinful misbelief to be too much feared to perish in Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and service: therfore he rebuked them, saying, <hi>why are ye fearfull?</hi> 8. He can put difference between small faith, and no faith, and as he will reprove unbelief, so wil he not despise the smallest measure of belief; therefore saith he, <hi>O ye of little faith.</hi> 9. Whether he seem to sleep, or to be awake, he is Lord of heaven and earth, ruler and commander of wind, sea and land, whom all the creatures must obey; <hi>for he arose and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the wind and there, was a calm.</hi> 10. The glory of the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59775:51"/>
which Christ doth give to his people in their greatest straight, is marvellous, and far above all that they can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ere it come: for when the Disciples looking as men on the Lords work, saw the great calm, <hi>they marvelled.</hi> 11.

                     <p n="32">32. And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. And they that kept them fled, and went their wayes into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the divels.</p>

                  <p>The last part of the chapter, containeth the delivery of the two men possessed with divels: Wherein learn, 1. That Christ went no whether, but for a speciall errand; pity to these two poor possessed men, moved him to crosse <hi>The sea, or the loch of Tiberius,</hi> and when he came to the other side, his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand appeares, <hi>The two possessed men are presecuted unto him.</hi> Christ can make the divels bring men unto him, nill they, will they, for here there <hi>met him two possessed with divels.</hi> 3. The malice of the divels is exceeding cruel, where they can get liberty to shew it against man: for they drive these men from the society of other men, unto the saddest spectacle of tombes or sepulchers, they imbitter them with rage and fierce
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59775:52"/>
anger, and move them to come against all other men, so, <hi>that no man could passe by that way.</hi> 4. How powerfull soever divels be, yet they can neither stand out against Christs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor flee from him, nor abide his presence: Therefore, <hi>They cry out for fear of him.</hi> 5. The case of possessed souls, in whom the spirit of disobedience doth rule, is to be seen in these whose bodies were possessed with divels, the man is their lodging house; he is no more master of his own actions, but is Satans slave; The mans eyes look for Satan, his hands and feet work and walk for Satan, his throat is made Satans blowing-horn, his mouth speaketh for Satan: and here they cry out by the Poor mans throat, saying, <hi>What have we to do with thee?</hi> 6. Divels did know Christ to be the Son of God, but they knew also that he came not in the world for their good, but to be Saviour of men; therefore, <hi>What have we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>th thee,</hi> say they? 7. Albeit it be not in the divels power not to yeeld to Christ, yet they remain their wicked aversnesse to obey him, being loath to leave the possession they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: they would be let alone by him, if they could, and do wickedly plead for it, saying, <hi>What have we to do with thee?</hi> 8. They know there is a time coming, when they shall be more tormented then they are as yet; even the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and this they tremble at, saying, <hi>Art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us before the time?</hi> 9. They cannot hurt so much as a sow except Christ, Lord of Heaven and Earth, do suffer them; therefore the divels besought Christ, saying, <hi>If thou cast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.</hi> 10. The Lord suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth somtime Satan to have his wil of mens bodies and goods, for their tryal; as here to go into the Gadarens swine, to try the owners mind; therfore Christ said unto them, <hi>Go.</hi> 11. These wicked spirits love alwayes to do evill, and make it a sport to destroy what they are permitted: Therefore, <hi>they drove the swine headlong into the sea, and made them perish in the water.</hi> 12. To the end that the tryal of men might be perfected, Christ will have them to know be Spirituall benefits of the Gospel, as well as the temporall inconveniencies following it. This it the reason that Christ will have the Gadarens to know as well of the delivery of men possessed with divels, as of the drowning of the swine; for, <hi>The swincherds tell them of all,</hi> that so they might be inexcusable. 13. Men left to their own selves, will choose any thing rather then Christ, and will do no better then these <hi>Gadarens did.</hi> 14. Temporall losse of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59775:52"/>
swine is so great in the worldly mens estimation, that spirituall advantage is nothing esteemed of: for the Gadarens are not so moved with the delivery of the souls and bodies of the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed men, as they are with the losse of their swine. 15. If men see nothing of Christs sweet mercies, but only take up his power, they will be loath to have him in their company; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Gadarens do <hi>Beseech him to dapart from them.</hi> Such worldly men will rather quit the Gospel, then hazard their worldly goods. 16. This is the greatest token of Christs leaving a place, or not coming into a place, when the whole incorporation, city, or place doth consist only of Gadarens, and all do consent that he should depart: for there apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he hath no errand to stay him; and wheresoever Christ hath no imployment, thence will he remove.</p>

When Christ cometh to Capernaum, certain men do bring out <hi>One sick of the palsie to him.</hi> 2. It is an act of lively faith as to come to Christ, so also to help others to come unto Christ: for of those that bring the palsie sick to Christ, as well as of the palsie sick himself, it is said, <hi>Iesus saw their faith.</hi> 3.

to the Pharisees; Christ justifieth his own deed by three reasons: The first, The Physician may converse with the sick: Therefore I may converse with such publicans and sinners as find themselves sick of sin; albeit ye who count your selves whole &amp; sound, find no need of such a Physician as I am: Hence learn, 1. That sin is like a sore sickness which needeth the true Physician, who is Jesus Christ alone: for so importeth the comparison. 2. All such as are dead in their sins and trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and namely such as are puffed up with conceit of their own righteousness, are <hi>whole</hi> and found in their own estimation, &amp; do misregard, the Physician Christ, as if they stood in no need of him; such were the Pharisees hereby taxed. 3. Such as are sick and sensibly troubled with sin, Christ will converse, with them, as with persons standing in need of him; for, <hi>They that are sick need the Physician,</hi> saith he.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 13.</hi> But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</q>
                  <p>The second reason: God never commanded a ceremonie of the Leviticall law, to hinder a necessary duty of mercy, or of the Morall law, as <hi>Hosea</hi> 6.6, teacheth; Therefore no cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie Leviticall must hinder me to shew mercy on these pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and sinners: Hence learn, 1. That proud men who are puff'd up with the conceit of their own righteousnesse, and do disdain humbled sinners, are ignorant of the word of God, whatsoever they seem to be in profession of knowledge; Therefore saith Christ to these proud Pharisees, <hi>Goe ye and learn what it meaneth,</hi> &amp;c. 2. God delighteth to shew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to sinners, and will not suffer any man to deny mercy to his neighbour, under pretence of observation of some act of outward ceremonie: Commands about outward ceremonies were not appointed to hinder, but to further the work of mercy; for it is said, <hi>I will have mercy and not sacrifice.</hi> The third reason: My errand unto the world is not to call unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance such as are righteous in their own eyes, as you are; But to call such as these Publicans, who are sinners in their own eyes; therefore it is lawfull for me to converse with them, rather then with you: Hence learn, 1. So many of the hearers of the Gospel, as are righteous in their own eyes, do want a warrant to come unto the comfort of Christs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and mediation, so, long as they remain proud and puff'd up with opinion of their own righteousnesse; for he saith, <hi>I am
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59775:55"/>
not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</hi> All his doctrine unto the conceited: righteous, is, to shew them their unrighteousnesse, and deserved condemnation, and Gods imminent wrath, and to exclude them from the benefit of his Gospel, till they be humbled. 2. such as are sensible of their sins and unrighteousnesse, who see themselves to have sin, and to want repentance, are the very soules whom Christ is seeking, and whom he came to call, that coming unto him, he might give them repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, he saith, <hi>I am come to call sinners to repentance.</hi> 3. The grace of Christs Gospel doth not give liberty to loosnesse, and sinfull living, but calls men to the course of repentance, that walking on in the way of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying sin, Christ may lead them unto salvation; for <hi>I came to call sinners to repentance,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>Thus the Pharisees are refuted: now Johns Disciples do come and quarrell for Christs Disciples non-conformity with them in fasting. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is no wonder to see questions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise in the Kirk for non-conformity in ceremonies; for Johns disciples do quarrel with Christ, that his Diiciples were not conformable to them in the custome of <hi>frequent fasting.</hi> 2. Men are much in love with their own customs, and look more to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies then to substance, and would have their own practice to be the sole rule which others should follow; for, <hi>Why,</hi> say they, <hi>do WE fast, but THY Disciples fast not?</hi> 3. Such as are given to urge needlesse conformity, give advantage to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and wil readily joyn with Christs adversaries in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie to strengthen themselves, and to make their party good; for, <hi>Why do we and the Pharisees fast?</hi> say Johns disciples. They side with the Pharisees, and justifie their course, that they may burden Christ and his disciples, as the fewer number, with a prejudice.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 15.</hi> And Iesus said unto them, can the children of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber mourne, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the dayes will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.</q>
                  <p>Christ justifieth his Disciples by two reasons, in which he dealeth with Johns Disciples as with friends, more mildly then with the Pharisees. The first reason is, so long as I am in my Disciples company, it is the time of joy unto them; Therfore
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59775:56"/>
to injoyn them fasting, were untimeous: Hence learn, 1. That our Lord Jesus is Bridegroom, and the church is his Bride, which he espouseth to himselfe to be partaker of all the riches of his grace; and Christs Ministers are the Bridegrooms men, for this the comparison doth import. 2. The Disciples of Christ so long as Christ was bodily present among them, had days of great joy, as children of the Bride-chamber, daily behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his glory and grace, in which condition they were not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto fasting: Therfore saith he, <hi>The children of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber cannot mourn, as long as the Bridegroom is with them.</hi> 3. When the Lord doth with-draw his wonted presence, and usuall comforts from us, we are called to fasting and mourning; for <hi>The days shall come, wherein the bridegroom shal be taken from them, and then shall they fast,</hi> saith he.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 16.</hi> No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for that which is put in to fil it up, taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish; but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The second reason clothed with two similitudes, is this, The strong exercise of extraordinary fasting is no more fit for the tender and weak condition of my Disciples, then to put a piece of now stiffe cloth upon a tender old coat, which is not able to bear the seam, or then it is fit to put new wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to old and weak bottles (for this exercise of extraordinary and frequent fasting is fit for strong and exercised Disciples only) Therfore my Disciples are not charged to fast in this their tender condition: Hence learn, 1. That the work of Gods grace in young converts is very tender, and easily hurt, and must be discreetly entertained, so doth the scope of the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes import. 2. When christians are grown up so some strength, and have their senses exercised, they must be put to answerable paines and exercise in Religion; for this is <hi>To put new wine in new bottles,</hi> that both might be preserved. 3. If discretion be not used in proportioning the burden of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward exercises of religion, unto the capacity and strength of the Disciples, both the exercise is lost, and the Disciples are hurt: for this is the meaning of, <hi>the hole of the garment is made more, the new wine and the old bottle both are lost.</hi>

                  <p>The dispute is broken off by the coming of a ruler, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his daughter might be raised from death. In the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ruler unto Christ, We learn, 1. That Christ can find out means in his providence to honour himself in the midst of all controversies and disputations; for, <hi>A certain Ruler, a man of place cometh and worshippeth him, while he is speaking,</hi> and so breaketh off the dispute. 2. Christ can find an errand for the man whom he will draw unto him, as here, by a daughters death: so by some like trouble on a man or on his family, he can draw the Parents unto himself. 3. All that come to Christ, are not alike strong in faith. This ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Synagogue requireth both Christs Presence, and the touch of his hand, that his daughter may be raised from dead: <hi>Come,</hi> saith he, <hi>and lay thy hand on her.</hi> 4.

                  <p>In the direction learn, 1. That it was necessary, that the Jewes should have the first offer of the Gospel, being the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kirk for the time, the people first and before all other in covenant with God; therefore in this first commission, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles are commanded to keep <hi>within the Iews bounds,</hi> and not <hi>go to the Gentiles as yet,</hi> nor unto the Samaritans, which were composed of the off-spring of the mixt multitude of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, who after the cativity of the ten tribes, were planted in their room; for, <hi>Go not in the way of the Gentiles,</hi> but rather <hi>to the lost sheep of Israel,</hi> saith Christ. 2. The office of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, is, to bring home unto the true shepherd Christ Jesus lost sheep, going astray from Christ: Therfore saith he, <hi>Go to the lost sheep.</hi> 3.

                  <p>It is worthy observation, that the Lord for confirmation of mens faith hath given power to the first Preachers of his Doctrine, to deliver men from miseries, both of soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, from sicknesse and divels; that in all time coming the power of his Gospel might be beleeved: for, <hi>Heal the sick,</hi> saith he, <hi>Cleanse the Lepers, Cast out divels.</hi> 2. To shew the freedome and rich grace of the Gospel, (whereby, whatsoever belongeth to righteousness and salvation, is bestowed upon the unworthy, without money, and without price) he gave the first Preachers of his grace a command to take no reward for their miraculous cures, saying, <hi>Freely have you received, freely give.</hi>

Therefore saith he, <hi>Provide neither gold, nor silver,</hi> &amp;c. 2.

Christ will have his servants maintained in a seemly way, and not as beggers, basely going from house to house; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith he, <hi>Abide in the house</hi> which is worthy, <hi>till ye go out of that place.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Verse 13.</hi> And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</p>

                  <p>Our Lord sheweth them to make triall of the house fit for their lodging. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Beside the good report that men have of their respect to Religion, Christ will have his servants try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, ere they trust them much; and the mean wherby he will have them tryed, is by their respect to the Gospel, and offer <hi>of Peace</hi> through Christs Grace: for every seeming holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is not a friend to the doctrine of Grace; therefore saith he, <hi>When ye come to a house, salute it</hi>; that is, Offer Peace by the Gospel unto it. 2. No house is worthy in Christs recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but that which receiveth the offer of Gods Peace by the Gospel of Grace through Christ, and unto such only Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth Peace; for he saith, <hi>If the house be worthy,</hi> let <hi>your Peace,</hi> according to your doctrine, <hi>come upon it.</hi> 3. If any receive not the offer of Peace by the Gospel of grace in Christ, they are debarred as unworthy, or unfit to have the fellowship of Christs servants, or any benefit of the Gospel; therfore saith he, <hi>Let your Peace return unto you.</hi> 4. Albeit the offer of Christs Peace do unto the refusers therof no good, yet shall it testifle of the fidelity of the servants of Christ, in offering Peace for their part, and so do good to the Preacher; therfore, <hi>Let your peace,</hi> saith he, <hi>return to you.</hi>

                     <p n="15">15. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, then for that city.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>From this to the end of the chapter, Christ incourageth the Apostles, and all his Disciples to follow the Profession of the Truth of the Gospel, without fear, by sixteen reasons: The first reason or motive, Such as receive you not, shall be severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished; for the shaking off the dust of the feet, served to shew that the Apostles were free of their blood, and that God did despise the refusers of the Gospel, as a man doth the dust of his feet, and that in the last day, the dust of the ground where despisers of the Gospel did dwel, should bear witnesse against them, albeit there were no other witnesse to be found. Hence learn, That such as despise the Gospel, God shall despise them, and cut them off from the society of himself, and all his servants. 2. There is an appointed day, when Justice shall be execute to the full upon all the wicked; and namely, on the despisers of the Gospel; and this is, <hi>At the day of judgment,</hi> saith Christ. 3. There shall be degrees of torment in hell, as there are degrees of offenders; for, The case <hi>of Sodom shall be more tolerable</hi> then of some other. 4. The sin of a city re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing the Gospel, is greater then the <hi>sin of Sodom:</hi> for so doth the comparison of the refusers to hear Christs messengers, and of Sodom import. The reason whereof is, because So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had not the Gospel, and offer of Gods grace made unto them, did not sin against such a convincing light, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise in so high a degree the remedy of sin, as despisers of the Gospel do.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmelesse as doves.</q>
                  <p>The second Reason: Though your danger be great, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ye are in my service; <hi>I send you out,</hi> therefore care for no more, but prudently and holily to carry your selves in my service. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Preachers must prepare themselves not only not to be received by all to whom they do offer the Gospel, but also to be persecuted, and put in hazard of their life: for Christ saith, <hi>I send you forth as sheep among wolves.</hi> 2. Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution must be made for the worst entertainment that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59775:62"/>
Preachers, (that so the lesser crosses may be the better indured) even for what sheep may suffer of wolves; to wit, Beastly cruelty without pitie, because that many Preachers suffer of people; Behold, saith he, <hi>I send you forth as sheep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong wolves.</hi> 3. Christs commission to his servants may incourage them, and comfort them against whatsoever crosse may befall them, <hi>Behold I send you forth.</hi> 4. Except the great Shepherd of soules defend his own servants, they have no more strength to resist their enemies, then <hi>sheep,</hi> in comparison of <hi>Wolves.</hi> 5. Preachers must be wary and circumspect, to keep themselves from harm of their wicked adversaries, that neither their body, nor soul be hurt by them; Therefore it is said, <hi>be wise as serpents.</hi> 6. They must also take heed, that they harm not the flock of their adversaries by any passage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulnesse in their calling; for it is said, <hi>Be harmlesse as doves.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The third reason: Ye are forewarned of witty and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull enemies in Church and State against you; but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is for my sake, and for a testimony against them, and therfore Fear not: Hence we learn. 1. That there is no less danger to Christs servants, from unrenewed men, who seem to be civil, and courteous, and observant of the laws, then there is danger from the most beastly and cruel adversaries; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith he, <hi>Beware of men.</hi> 2. There is great danger for Christs servants in civill courts and judgment seats under pretence of law; yea civill judicatories and Ecclesiasticall both, may turne adversaries to Christs servants, and conspire to persecute them; for it is said, <hi>They will deliver you up to councels, and scourge you in the synagogues.</hi> 3. When in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior judicatories are found unjust against the servants of Christ, remeed in law by superiors is hardly to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; at least, small confidence is to be put in appellations to supreme Judges, but Christs servants must prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the enmitie of chiefe governours, and Kings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; for it is foretold, That they shall be brought <hi>before governours and kings.</hi> 4. Whatsoever be the pretence of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59775:62"/>
against the Preachers of the Gospel, the maine quarrell is for Christs sake; for it is said, <hi>Ye shall be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Governours and Kings for my sake.</hi> 5. A testimony gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the truth of Christs Gospell before persecuters, which may stand against them at the last day, in case it prevail not with them unto conversion, is worthy all the sufferings of these that be persecuted; for you shall be brought for a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny against them. 6. There are a number to whom the word of the Gospel doth come, only for their conviction, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no benefit therby; for so importeth this <hi>Testimony against them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 29.</hi> But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.</q>
                  <p>The fourth reason: Ye shall be furnished by my Spirit, as you have need, in your sufferings and speeches for the defence of the Gospel: Therefore fear not. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is good to be resolved and prepared for the crosse ere it come: Therfore our Lord brings it, as it were, to the time of compearance, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>When they deliver you up.</hi> 2. The main matter which a true Disciple should consider, and will take notice of, is not what he may suffer, or what he shall say; but what way he may glorifie Christ, and maintain the truth best; Therefore it is said, <hi>Take no thought how,</hi> or <hi>what ye shall speak.</hi> 3. Christs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants must not be perplexed what to do or say in his cause, for Christ doth forbid us to be anxious, (ordinary means or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration are not forbidden, but anxiety only) saying; Take <hi>no thought</hi> what or how ye shall speak. 4. The Lord will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake in the day of tryall such servants, as are more feared to offend, then to suffer, but surely will be present with them, to make them give a fair testimony: for he promiseth to such, <hi>It shall be given you in that same hour.</hi> 5. It is not necessary, that God should give before-hand what is needfull for the hour of tryall: it is sufficient that assistance be given when the time of need cometh; for he saith, <hi>It shall be given you in that same hour,</hi> what you shall speak.</p>

                  <p>For confirmation of our faith, he assureth such servants, of the communion of his Spirit. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A testimony or suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Christ, concerneth the Father and the Spirit, no lesse then it doth concern Christ: for in this case the spirit of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59775:63"/>
Father doth <hi>own</hi> Christs cause; for, <hi>It is the spirit which spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</hi> Christs cause is not upholden by learning, or humane wisdome, but by the holy spirit; for, <hi>It is the spirit of your Father which speaketh.</hi> 3. The servants of Christ are but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments whose mouth the Lord borroweth in his own cause; for Christ saith, <hi>It is the spirit which speaketh in you.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The fifth reason: You must resolve to be hated for my sake of all men; but if you go on to the end, ye shall be saved: Therefore <hi>Fear not. Doct.</hi> 1. The worlds hatred against Christ and his Gospel, and grace in his servants, is stronger then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall love, and is able to dissolve all bonds of blood or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship between the ungodly and Christs Disciples; for, <hi>The bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall deliver up the brother</hi> to death, &amp;c. 2. Christs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are obnoxious, not only to be destitute of all mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but also to be hated of all sorts of men for Christs cause; for it is said, <hi>Ye shall be hated OF ALL MEN for my names sake.</hi> 3. There shall be an end of the troubles of all Christs true Disciples, for so importeth, <hi>He that indureth to the end.</hi> 4. There is a certain salvation after the troubles are past; for, <hi>He that endureth shall be saved.</hi> 5. There is need of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and enduring of the trouble unto the end, lest if a man <hi>faint and give over,</hi> he lose his reward; for none, <hi>But he that endureth to the end shall be saved</hi>

                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> But when they persecute you in this City, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, ye shall not have gone over the Cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.</q>
                  <p>The sixth reason: Sometime I will reserve you for further service, and will open a door for your escaping of persecution, and you shall not want some place to welcome you: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Fear not. Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord alloweth Ministers in case of persecution to flee at sometimes; namely when their life shall serve more for Gods glory, and the Kirks good, then their death can; in such a case, he saith, <hi>When they persecute you in one City, flee, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Preachers must still follow their calling, and seek occasion of preaching in another place; Therefore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59775:63"/>
saith he, <hi>Flee to another City.</hi> 3. When one place refuseth to hear Christs servants, God will provide another place, where they may preach; Therefore saith he, <hi>Flee into another City.</hi> 4. He answereth a doubt, what if thy servants be persecuted in each city, and having gone through all, shall finde no city kindly to them, whether they may retire? He answereth, that till the second coming of the Son of Man (which second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now onely rested, he being come the first time already) there should not be wanting some city of Israel, some kindly place to receive his servants: which speech is not fitted for the Apostles in their first out sending, wherein there was no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution; nor yet onely for the Apostles in their second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to all the world; but for all preachers of the Gospel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlds end, who in the Apostles persons are spoken unto. Under the name of the <hi>Cities of Israel,</hi> is understood places where his servants will be welcome to preach the Gospel, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places cast them out. Whence this doctrine is afforded, that However some Ministers may be so persecuted that they cannot flee; or fleeing, shall not escape the sword of the persecuter, but must glorifie God in their martyrdome; yet there shall be other Ministers one after another, till the second coming of Christ, preaching the Gospel from place to place, in despite of all the persecuters in the world; for of this our Lord giveth assurance, saying, Verily I say unto you, <hi>Ye shal not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of Man be come.</hi>

                        <hi>Ver. 24.</hi> The Disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Lord.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. It is enough for the Disciple that he be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord: if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The seventh reason: It may content you, that you shall not be worse used then I your Lord and Master am, and shal be used: Therefore <hi>Fear not. Doct.</hi> 1. There are very neer and sweet bands between Christ and us; for he is our School-master, and we his Disciples; he is our Lord, and we are his servants: he is the Good man of the house, his church, and we his Domesticks and houshhold men, so importeth his words, saying, <hi>The Disciple is not above his Master,</hi> &amp;c 2. Christ is a pattern of sufferings, from the cradle to the crosse, from his birth to his buriall; for here he setteth forth his own suffering, to encourage us to suffer by like example. 3. To
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59775:64"/>
seek or look after freedom from persecution, is to seek that we who are Christs Disciples should be better dealt with then our Master was, which is unreasonable; for, <hi>The Disciple is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Master, nor the servant above his Lord.</hi> 4. Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Christ in suffering, may sufficiently comfort any man who suffereth for Christ; for, <hi>It is enough for the disciple that he be as his Master.</hi> 5. The comparison of Christs excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and our base condition, should make us willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go any sort of humiliation; therfore saith he, <hi>It is enough that the servant be as his Lord.</hi> 6. Beelzebub was the idoll of Ek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and one of the chiefest divels names: There is no blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my so great against Christ, but Satan will find mouths to vent it; for it is written, <hi>They called the Master of the house Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub.</hi> 7. No wonder that Christs servants be called divels, when Christ was called a divel; so reasoneth Christ, saying, <hi>How much more shall they call them of the houshold Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</q>
                  <p>The eight reason: The truth of my doctrine, and your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, must both be brought to light upon all hazards; Therefore, <hi>Fear not,</hi> but avow my Gospel boldly. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Christs servants are in danger to minish their testimony concerning Christs truth, for fear of men; Therefore are they warned not to fear them. 2. Albeit the holinesse and innocency of Christs servants be overclouded, and born down for a time, by scandalous speeches of persecuters; and they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed no better then Beelzebub, yet shall it be brought forth to light in Gods time: for our Lord hath said, <hi>That there is nothing covered that shal not be revealed, nor secret which shall not be known</hi>; Thus may this generall sentence serve the purpose in this place. 3. Because at last the light of the Gospel shall break forth and overcome all obstacles, Therefore Ministers should boldly preach Christs truth: and thus also doth this generall sentence serve Christs intent, as the next verse maketh it plain.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> What I tell you in darknesse, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the eare, that preach ye upon the house tops.</q>
                  <p>Christ commandeth his Apostles to publish, as openly as they could, whatsoever he should reveale unto them, in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59775:64"/>
of way: putting the <hi>house top,</hi> for the most patent places, where a man might be best seen, and heard; for the houses of Judea were covered platform. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The matter of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers sermons should be nothing but truth revealed by Christ; therfore saith he, <hi>What I tell you, that speak.</hi> 2. Christ doth not reveal any thing to his servants, whether ordinarily by ordinary meanes, as by reading or meditation; or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily by his Spirit, but it is able to abide the light, and the tryall of all who shall hear of it; and is worthy to be avowed openly; for he saith, <hi>What I tell you in darknesse, that speak you in light,</hi> and <hi>what you hear in the care,</hi> that <hi>preach on the house tops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 28.</hi> And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</q>
                  <p>The ninth reason: You must fear me, who am able to kill both soul and body; therefore, Fear not man, who cannot harme you so much. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Plain and faithfull preaching of Christs truth, may readily be met with persecution, and hazard of life: and a man must be master of death, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of the fear, not only of smaller losses, but even of the losse of life also, if he would preach all Christs truth as he should; Therefore saith Christ, <hi>Fear not them which kill the body.</hi> 2. All that men can do against a faithfull witnesse of Christs truth, is to take the life of the body; they cannot reach to the soul to destroy it, or to take away from it righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or peace, or joy in the holy Ghost; for, <hi>They are not able to kill the soul,</hi> saith he. 3. The true remedy of all base fear of the creature, and of death, is the true fear of God; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith he, <hi>Fear him rather which is able to destroy soul and body in hell.</hi> 4. If a man suppresse the testimony which he should give to Christ, for fear of being killed by men, he falleth in the danger of being cast in hell, and losing soule and body. This is imported in the saying, <hi>Fear him which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to destroy soul and body in hell.</hi>

                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:59775:65"/>The tenth reason: Gods providence which reacheth unto Sparrowes, and to the haires of your head, to preserve the least of them, may incourage you sufficiently against fear of men; therfore, Fear not to preach my truth. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Gods providence is very particular toward all the creatures, so that the least of them is not taken or slaine, without Gods dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; for, <hi>One Sparrow,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall not fall to the ground without your Father.</hi> 2. The Lords care of his servants doth reach to the preservation not only of their life, but also of the smallest thing that concerneth them; for, <hi>The very haires of your head are numbred,</hi> saith he. 3. God esteemeth much more of his servants then of other creatures: for his children are bought with his Sons blood; Therefore saith he, <hi>Ye are of more value then many Sparrowes.</hi> 4. The consideration of Gods estimation of his servants, and of his particular provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence about them, may give them assurance, that tyrants and persecuters shall do them no further hurt then God pleaseth, and so may deliver them from all fear in the discharge of their message; this Christ inferreth, saying expresly, <hi>Fear ye not therfore.</hi>

                  <p>The eleventh reason: If ye confesse me confidently before men, I will confesse you before God, but if for fear of men, ye deny me, I will deny you; Therefore, fear not to avow the truth of my Gospel. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Christ will not only have Preachers, but also all christians, to avow his name and his truth before all men, and that for Gods glory and mens edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: This is it he saith in the generall, <hi>Whosoever shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse me before men.</hi> 2. Men by confessing Christs truth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not honour him so much as he shall honour them who boldly do avow him; for, <hi>Him will I confesse before my Father,</hi> saith he. 3. If men refuse to stand for Christ, or for his truth, or cause, or for his servants troubled for his service, they deny Christ, and in substance do say, They know him not, and that they will not be for him in danger; for not to confesse Christ, is here to deny him; for, <hi>Whosoever shall deny me,</hi> saith he, instead of saying, whosoever shall <hi>Not confesse me.</hi> 2.

them before God, as men that belong not unto him; for he saith; <hi>Him will I also deny before my Father</hi>: This threatning strikes not against such, as do slide at a time, and do afterward repent; and are ready to confess Christ in no less hazard, as Peter did: for such men do not refuse to avow Christ, but resolve to confes him, and do keep their resolution, albeit in some surprizall they slide.</p>

In the case of persecution for the Gospel, at no unrenewed mens hands is friendship, or favour, or help to be expected, but rather the contrary may be looked for, that the more obligation of friendship be betwixt them and us, we shall have the more opposition by them; for, <hi>A mans foes shall be they of his own houshold,</hi> saith Christ. 4.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59775:67"/>
kindnesse shown <hi>unto</hi> Christs servants, is reckoned by Christ as done to himself, and done to the Father, in whose name the preacher doth come, for he saith, <hi>He that receiveth me, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Beside what we can do in solving the doubts of others, we shall do well to send the weak in faith, to propone their doubts to Christ himself. Therfore John commandeth his two disciples to propone their questions to Christ, saying, <hi>Art thou he?</hi> &amp;c. knowing that he was most able to satisfie them.</p>

                     </gap> doubting disciples, both with words, and deeds, saying, <hi>Go shew what you hear and see.</hi> 2. Our Lord deals prudently with weak ones; for as John covers the Disciples doubting
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59775:68"/>
with a question, proponed as it were in his own name; So Christ covers their doubting also, by giving the answer, as it were unto John, rather then to them; <hi>Go shew Iohn again,</hi> saith he, albeit it is sure John had no doubt about Christ, for at Christs Baptisme, he was confirmed abundantly that Christ was the very Messiah. 3. That which disciples may hear, and see, and observe, in the reall and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall putting forth of Christs power among men, is sufficient to prove that hee is the true Messiah: Therefore saith hee, <hi>Tell Iohn again these things which ye do hear and see</hi>; Like as even the ordinary and daily working of Christ still unto this day, upon such as are converted from time to time, may prove that he is the true Messiah. 4. He in whom all these things which are prophesied to be done by the Messias are accomplished, is the onely true Messias: But Christ Jesus is hee in whom all prophesies are accomplished; for, <hi>He maketh the blinde to see, the lame to walk,</hi> and the poor to take the Gospel: Therefore Christ is the onely true Messiah; for this is the proof whereby Christ doth confirm Johns Disciples, that there was no other Messiah to be looked for. 5. The remedy of all sin and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is to be found in Christ, both for body and soul; for it is he by whom <hi>the blinde receive their sight,</hi> and <hi>the poor receive the Gospel,</hi> &amp;c. 6.

The Gospel doth affect the poor and needy soul, so as it doth put as it were a stamp of the good news of Gods grace upon it: for so importeth the passive word in the Original, which saith, that the poor are <hi>Evangelized,</hi> or stamped with the preaching of the Gospel.</p>

                  <p>Now followeth Christs testimony of John Baptist, wherein John is commended for eight respects. The first is, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie: Hence learn, 1. That Christ gives his servants a good meeting, he bears witnesse of their faithfulnesse, as well as they do bear witness that he is the true Messiah; as here for instance, when Johns Disciples are departed, Christ <hi>speaketh to Iohns praise before the multitude.</hi> 2. The reasons which moveth us to go hear the Sermons of any preacher should be well examined; for we must answer unto Christs questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>What went ye out to see?</hi> 3. It is the commendation of a Preacher of the truth that he be constant in the truth, and not wavering hither and thither; for this is the ground of Johns commendation, <hi>That he was not a reed shaken with the winde,</hi> as the interrogation having the force of a negation, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Verse 8.</hi> But what went ye out for to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing, are in kings houses.</q>
                  <p>The second point of the commendation of John, is, for his Holinesse and high Measure of Mortification: Hence learn, 1. That it is the commendation of a Preacher, to be mortified to the glory, ease, pleasure, and riches of this world; for on this ground Christ commendeth John, by way of interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, denying him to be <hi>A man given to soft raimens.</hi> 2. A true Preacher must be so mortified to this World, as all the Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of court be not able to corrupt him; for such as love to wear soft raiment, will affect to be in respect at court, for that very end; therfore saith he, <hi>They that wear soft raiment, are in kings houses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 9.</hi> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more then a prophet.</q>
                  <p>The third point of Johns commendation is the clear revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Christ, and of the shortest course to come unto Him, wherein John was above any Prophet. Hence learn, 1. That the right reason of going to hear Sermons, is, because the man that speaketh, hath warrand to speak, and to reveal Gods will: this is it which he saith, <hi>Went ye out to see a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59775:69"/>
Prophet?</hi> 2. John is called more then a Prophet, specially because he did point out Christ more clearly and fully, then any before him, as Christ doth shew hereafter; teaching us, that these are the greatest men in the Ministry, who do most point out Christ to the world, and do most sincerely lead men unto him.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Verse 10.</hi> For this is be of whom it is written, behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</q>
                  <p>The fourth point of Johns commendation, is from his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall imployment to be Christs Harbinger, to make way for Christ; for albeit every Minister of the Gospel be Christs messengers, to carry amba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>age to the world, yet John Baptist was such in a special manner: for of him it was prophesied by Malachi, <hi>Behold, I send my messenger.</hi> 2. Albeit it be the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of every Minister, by the preaching of Christs doctrine, to make way for Christs entrie into the soul, to dwell in it by his Spirit, yet John Baptist was Harbinger in an odd way, assisted by the doctrine of repentance, in humbling proud sinners, and fitting them for mercy in Christ: And, 3. He was in a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner imployed for pointing out of Christ to be the Lamb of God, not only in doctrine, but also with the finger of ocular demonstration.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 11.</hi> Verily I say unto you, among them that are bor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of women, there hath not risen a greater then Iohn the Baptist: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater then be.</q>
                  <p>The fifth point of Johns commendation, is, in comparing him with, and prefering him above all the Prophets which came before him: because, 1. Singular predictions were of him, more then ever of any of the Prophets. 2. His bringing into the world had more extraordinary passages of providene then any of the Prophets. 3. His authority and office to bring in a new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was singular. 4. Beside the baptizing of our Lord, and converting of such multitudes, his Ministry was countenanced with the clearest vision, and revelation of the mystery of the Trinity, that ever was. 5. The sanctification of his Person from the womb to his Martyrdome, was singular. 6. The clearness of his knowledg of the way of righteousnes by Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and of the application of types of the Messiah unto Christ, as that true Lamb of God, was singular. These and such like other excellencies are reasons why our Lord said, <hi>there hath not risen a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59775:69"/>
greater then Iohn the Baptist, among them that are born of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> Mean time lest John should be too much esteemed of, Christ having thus preferred him unto all that were born of women, doth except <hi>Himself,</hi> and justly preferreth <hi>Himself</hi> unto John, saying, <hi>He that is least,</hi> or, no man <hi>in the kingdom of God, is greater then he</hi>; So doth Christ describe himselfe, as he was esteemed of by the rulers of the Church; for who could be lesse in the Kingdome of God, in their estimation, then he whom they did excommunicate? Now the rulers did excommunicate Christ, and for his cause also, did cast out of the synagogue all that confessed him. He was the Stone which the builders refused; whom the chief Priests and Elders did not esteem worthy to be a member of the Church, or to have any place in the building of Gods Temple: So Christ was in their estimation, <hi>The least</hi>; that is, no man, <hi>in the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> as this phrase is taken, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19, 20. And who except Christ can be greater then John, who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led greater then any of all the Prophets, yea of all which were born of women? It is true, that Christians who lived since Christ ascended, have the history of many particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christ, which John did not live to see: But who shall perswade us, that the least member of the Christian Church, or the least Preacher of the Gospel, do see more of Christ in the Word of history, then any of the Prophets; or John, who is greater then any of the prophets, did see in the spirit and word of prophesie? And put the case that in regard of historical knowledge, they did know many particulars which John did not know; yet this sort or measure of knowledg, doth not make them simply <hi>greater</hi> then John. Now the comparison here, of John with the least of the Kingdome of Heaven, is not simply in respect of <hi>knowledg,</hi> but in respect of <hi>greatness,</hi> which <hi>greatnesse</hi> comprehendeth all the forenamed six points of excellency, and also whatsoever other respect may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to excellency: and thus if we take greatness, none can be called <hi>greater</hi> then John, except Christ, who in the estimation of the rulers of the Jewish church at that time, <hi>was the least,</hi> that is, <hi>no man in the Kingdom</hi> of God, and the stone of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which the builders did reject: Hence learn, 1. That whensoever any greatnesse or excellency of man is spoken of, the excellency of our Lord Jesus must not be obscured, but rather lifted up thereby: for where he is, a greater then So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon is; a greater then John Baptist is. 12, Whosoever
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59775:70"/>
shall dishonour Christ, he will not deny himselfe: He will take unto him his own glory, for he declareth himselfe here greater then John, though the rulers of the church and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers esteemed him to be the least, or no man in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 12.</hi> And from the dayes of Iohn the Baptist untill now, the kingdome of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</q>
                  <p>The sixth point of Johns commendation is, the fruitfulness of his doctrine, that by the clearnesse of Johns preaching, the gates of Heaven, and the way of the Church were made so patent, that men did not stand upon the bar and partition of ceremonies, or upon any orderly way of the proselites com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the church; But multitudes did leap over all the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ceremonies: so that publicans, sinners, heathen, legally unclean, and the naturally lothed lepers did thrust themselves all in upon the company of converts, and upon the grace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested by Johns doctrine: and indeed obtained grace to enter in the Kingdome of Christ, by this their ingyring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon him: Hence learn, 1. That the legall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were never appointed to hinder people from Christ, but to lead them to him; and therfore when the observation of these ceremonies might be a hinderance of people coming to Christ, (As for example, so many dayes behoved to passe ere a leper were legally purified, that he might come in the company where the Word of God was preached) in such a case, God was not displeased that men overpast &amp; violently ran over these impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments to come to Gods Grace manifested in Christ: for saith he, <hi>The violent take it by force.</hi> 2. Yea the doctrine of Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clearly revealed, no impediment of bygone sins, or sense of unworthiness present should hinder a humbled soul from entry in the Kingdom of Grace, for this Kingdom <hi>is taken by force.</hi> If we cannot remove impediments, let us set our foot on them, and make stepping stones of them, thrusting our selves so much more on Christs grace, as we find our selves unworthy: laying hold so much more on his offered salvation, as we find our selves otherwayes to be lost.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 13.</hi> For all the prophets, and the law prophesied untill Iohn.</q>
                  <p>The seventh point of commendation, is, that John poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Christ now already come, at Grace already laid open: whereas the Law and the Prophets onely did prophesie and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59775:70"/>
foretell that it was to come; and this is a reason of the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of Johns Ministry; Hence learn, 1. That the pointing forth of the fulfilling of the promises, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in Christ, is a mean to bring men in multitudes unto the Kingdome of Heaven; and this is imported in the particle <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or,</hi> wherein a reason is rendered of what is said in the former verse; for, saith he, all the Prophets and the Law <hi>prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> untill John, but John shews the <hi>accomplishment</hi>: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore multitudes did thrust themselves into the Kingdome of Heaven. 2. The Church of the Old Testament, had a dark time, in comparison of what we have now; for their light was prophesies of things to come, but ours is preaching of what is already come; for, <hi>The Law and the Prophets prophesied untill Iohn.</hi>

                  <p>The eighth and last point of Johns commendation, is, that John was that Elias prophesied of, to come before Christ: <hi>Malachi</hi> 4. John is called by the name of Elias, because of like zeal for God, and successful imployment in the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion; for as Elias in his dayes, so John in his dayes did in the power of the same Spirit, stir up men to seek the true God in Christ. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When truth is told to people never so cleerly, yet wil they hardly beleeve it, no not though Christ himself should speak it; Therfore saith Christ, <hi>If you will receive it.</hi> 2. Whether men beleeve or not, Truth must be told them, to make them inexcusable; <hi>This is Elias,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>If ye will receive it.</hi>

                  <p>If Christs testimony of John had been beleeved, then Johns testimony of Christ had been beleeved also; for John testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Christ was the promised Messiah: therefore Christ did so much the longer insist in this commendation of John; and having said sufficiently, he closeth with this speech, <hi>He that hath ears,</hi> &amp;c. Teaching thereby, first, That every man hath not a hearing ear, but some are deaf misbeleevers of Gods Word, imported in these words, <hi>He that hath ears.</hi> 2. Even these who are elect, of them it is said, <hi>Let them hear.</hi> 3. If the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect shall hear unto beleeving, it sufficeth Gods intention, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the rest remain ignorant misbeleevers; for, <hi>He that hath ears, let him hear,</hi> is as much as, Let the rest go their way, come of them what may.</p>

                        <hi>Verse 16.</hi> But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,</p>
                     <p n="17">17. And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Our Lord perceiving the unbelief of the multitude; doth regrate their obstinacie, who neither by Johns austere Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, nor by his own sweet dealing, could he moved to repent or beleeve; and this he doth, by comparing their disposition toward the Gospel, with the disposition of the rude people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward musick: for as they cared for no melody, and could not be moved either with piping or lighter springs; nor with mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and sader songs, as the Minstrel boyes use to sing; So the Jewes could neither be moved to sorrow, unto repentance, by Johns austere preaching of repentance and judgement; nor to rejoyce at Christs sweet offers of Grace and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made to them in a more gentle and loving way. Hence learn, 1. That the obstinacy and rebellion of the hard hearts of Christs hearers, affected and moved his tender heart with grief; for, <hi>Whereunto shall I liken them,</hi> doth import so much. 2. The more are found in the guiltiness of despising the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the more doth our Lord resent the wrong, and regrate sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners misery: Therfore saith he, <hi>This generation.</hi> 3. Hardly can any comparison express the sin of despising of the Gospel; for, <hi>Whereunto shall I liken them,</hi> importeth this. 4. The most obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by-word shall be made use of to condemn the wickednesse and folly of them who despise the Gospel, in the conceit of their own wisdom; for it is like little children saith he, who when they find no respect had of their musick, do put up their pipes with this regrate,</p>

in some sort, and have given such signes of repentance, at least, as with Ahab, and Niniveh, they might have escaped tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Judgments. This being the scope, we should not stretch the words beyond, and contrary to it: Hence learn, 1. That the miracles of Christ were done by his own power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for here they are called <hi>His</hi> mighty works, in a proper sense, and so they do prove him to be true God. 2. The use which should be made of the miracles of Christ, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty works done by him, is repentance; for that which is found fault with here, is, they repented not. 3.

Such as do hear the Gospel daily, may readily be found more hard hearted, then they who never heard it; Chorazin more impenitently disposed then Tyrus. 4.

                  <p>Sometimes one is said to answer, when he openeth his mouth and speaketh to them, who were expecting some speech from him, albeit none have spoken before, as here in this speech: Christ glorifieth his Father, for the wise and free dispensation of saving Grace, manifested in the good successe which his Disciples had, (whom as it is, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17.21.) he sent forth to preach, and work miracles, verse 25, 26. He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his own power to give light and life to as many as came unto him, vers. 27. And last of all exhorts the needy to come unto him, with sundry motives to induce them, ver. 28, 29, 30. For the first: Learn, 1. That the mystery of salvation is at Gods disposing, to hold it from, or shew it unto whom he pleaseth; for saith he, <hi>Thou hast hid it from the wise,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou hast revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it unto babes,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The worldly wise, and prudent men in this world, are not these for the most part to whom the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is revealed; for thou hast hid it, saith he, <hi>from the wise and prudent.</hi> 3. The people of weaker understanding, and babes in comparison of others are found to be the Lords choice in election, and the persons who get the saving light of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel for the greatest part; for he saith, <hi>Thou revealest them to babes.</hi> 4. Christ will not want followers, despise him who will, for whose conversion, how base soever they seem, God is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59775:73"/>
to be praised; Therefore Christ for those little ones saith, <hi>I thank thee, O Father,</hi> and doth rejoyce in them, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible soever they seem to be, no lesse then if they had all the excellencies of the world in them. 5. Gods suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy over Heaven and earth, maketh him free, to chuse or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse whom he pleaseth; I thank thee, saith he, <hi>Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth.</hi> 6. The cause of election of some, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of other some, of this or that man, rather then of others, is to be found only in Gods good pleasure; Therfore saith Christ, <hi>O Father, for it seemed good in thy eyes.</hi> 7. Christ heartily consents unto, and approveth the Fathers decree of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and reprobation, as it standeth; Therfore saith he, <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Father,</hi> and <hi>I thank thee</hi>; for God and Christ are glorified in both.</p>

                  <p>Here Christ proclaimeth his riches and authority, that he may make way for the offer following. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Beside the right and power which Christ as God hath unto, and over all things, he hath received of the Father as God-man, or God incarnate, right unto and oyer all things, in, and for the church, nothing being excepted, except him who hath delivered all things unto him; for, <hi>All things are delivered to me of my Father</hi>; and Christ hath taken the gift of all things, for our behove, as power to gather his Church, appoint Ministers, bestow the spirit as he will, open and close Heaven and hell, as he pleaseth, and to dispose of all his enemies, and of all creatures as they may best serve for the well of his people. 2. The excellency of the Son of God is a mystery, which neither man nor Angel can know compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensively, as he is indeed, but the Father only; for, <hi>No man knoweth the Son, but the Father</hi>; and so, except a man he taught of the Father, and learn of the Father, he can never attain the right knowledg of the Son. 3. The distinction of the <hi>Father</hi> from the <hi>Son,</hi> and the glory of the Fathers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is a mystery which neither man nor Angel can know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; <hi>No man knoweth the Father, but only the Son.</hi> 4. Any measure of right knowledg of the Father which we can attain unto, must come by revelation from the Son, who is the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven character of his person, who by his word and spirit doth

                     </gap>ve you rest.</q>
                  <p>From the former doctrine Christ draweth forth two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations: the first unto faith in himselfe; the next, unto new obedience. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The right use of the doctrine of election, and reprobation, verse 28. and of the riches which is in Christ, and of the mystery of the Father, and of the Son, is this, to draw neer to Christ, and to seek communion with him: for having spoken of those, he calleth upon us, saying, <hi>Come unto me.</hi> 2. All things being delivered unto Christ, he cannot be quiet till he have needy soules made partakers of the riches which is in him; Therfore doth he call unto us, saying, <hi>Come unto me.</hi> 3. Such as have wearied themselves in seeking in themselves, or in any of the creatures, something to quiet their soules, and cannot find rest, have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to come to him; for he saith, <hi>Come unto me ye that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> 4. Albeit a soul find nothing whereby to commend it selfe to Christ, but a fruitlesse life, and loathfom burthen of sin, nothing but that which yeeldeth restlesse unquietnesse; yet without exception of any person, all such may come unto him for relief; none of those who acknowledg their inability to help themselves, are secluded. There is no Bar to put back a soule from Christ, which desires to come unto him, which desires to beleeve in him, and to have communion with him; for he saith, <hi>Come unto me all yee.</hi> 5. Albeit there be no bar put to hinder any man from coming to Christ, yet none wil come until they be sensible of a burden whereof they cannot be freed by any other meanes: Therfore he speaketh expresly to such, saying, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden,</hi> not excluding luke-warm Laodiceans, or any other, who desire to be made sensible of sin, who desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, who desire to beleeve in God, and to fear God. 6. Seeing all things are delivered unto Christ, and all that have need are commanded to come to him, it is a miserable and damnable folly, to seek any thing belonging to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and eternall life, except in Christ Jesus only; for he telleth us, <hi>All things are delivered unto me</hi>; and saith, <hi>Come unto me.</hi> 7. God can sanctifie the love of our selves, so far as to make it a motive and allurement, to draw us unto him;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59775:74"/>
for such as are unquiet about the condition of their soul, or are burdened with any trouble which they are not able to bear, have a promise of relief, if they shall come unto him, who can shew them the true cause of their trouble, and the right outgate also; for; <hi>I will give you rest,</hi> saith he. Now <hi>rest</hi> is opposed to labour and burthens, and so importeth ful relief from al the sin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery which can trouble any man.</p>

                     <hi>Ver. 29.</hi> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your soules.</q>
                  <p>The next exhortation teacheth us, 1. To stay with Christ under his discipline, after we are come unto him; and so to joyn the study of obedience with faith: the duties of faith and obedience must not be severed: for he joyneth, <hi>Come to me, and take on my yoke.</hi> 2. Albeit Christs commands be our true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, yet in respect of the untowardnesse of our nature, the tye of doing all holy duties belonging to sanctification, of bearing the Lords chastisements, and suffering persecution, is a yoke wherein we have need to be bound: Therfore saith he, <hi>Take on my yoke.</hi> 3. It is necessary that we willingly submit our selves to this yoke, and burden, how contrary soever it seem to our nature; for, <hi>Take ye up my yoke,</hi> doth the word in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bear; or, <hi>Lift it as it were upon your shoulders.</hi> 4. When we have consented to submit to Christs yoke, we have need as Disciples daily to learn how to bear it; Therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, saying, <hi>Learn of me.</hi> 5. As unto the right bearing of the yoke of Christ, the vertues of humility and meekness are necessary; so are they to be learned, and had onely from Christ, blessing unto us not onely his Doctrine, but also his example; for it is said, <hi>Learn of me, that I am meek and lowly:</hi> now no command given unto him of the Father was grievous, no suffering made him grudg, no paines made him shrinke from his duty or to faint: his plaints of his enemies, and his answers unto them, were full of meeknesse: he stood not to abase himself for the Fathers glory, and mens good; and it is he who must give us grace to do so also. 6. True rest unto the conscience is to be found in Christs satisfaction given to justice for us, true peace in his service; for he saith, <hi>Come to me, and ye shall find rest.</hi> 7. It is sufficient in this life, that we find rest to our souls, albeit our bodies be troubled. Therfore it is said, <hi>Ye shall find rest to your souls.</hi> No more is promised.</p>
                  <q>

                     <hi>Ver. 30.</hi> For my yoke is easie, and my burden is light.</q>
                  <p>Another motive to take on his yoke, is, <hi>My yoke is easie,</hi> Hence learn, 1. That albeit Christs Discipline and manner of exercising of his followers, be a yoke and burden to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, yet it is an easie yoke and a light burden to a soul, seeking liberation from sin, and seeking salvation through Christ; Therefore saith he, <hi>My yoke is easie.</hi> &amp;c. Now it is called an <hi>easie yoke,</hi> in comparison of the covenant of works, wherein men want the help of a Mediator, and are bound to do all in their own naturall strength; but we have Christ to help us, who worketh all our works in us, and for us. 2. It is an <hi>easie</hi> yoke in comparison of sin, which maketh a man draw and bear his own ditty unto condemnation. 3. Christs yoke is <hi>easie,</hi> because albeit the ten commands renewed, and repeated in the Gospel, do require no lesse perfection to be ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at in sincerity of obedience, then under the covenant of works: yet the cords to bind on the yoke are not terrour, but love; and that little which is done in faith, and upright obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is well accepted: and much joy and peace, much courage and comfort is bestowed on such as uprightly ayme, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obey the commands of God in Christ, thus saith he, <hi>My yoke is easie, and my burden is light.</hi>

                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:59775:75"/>IN the first controversie learn first, That our Lord took much pains in going from place to place, about what the Father had given him to do; for even on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> he went from place to place, <hi>Through the corn field.</hi> 2. The work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and attending on the Lord, somtimes may be so urgent, as his servants wil forget to provide their meat; for here, <hi>His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples were an hungred.</hi> 3. God may put his chosen children to straits in this world, and suffer them now and then to taste of want; for his Disciples must for hunger, at a time, <hi>Pluck the ears of corn,</hi> and eat them for bread.</p>

                  <p>The Pharisees fish a fault where there was none, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with Christ for his Disciples. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is no new thing to see men, who are otherwise learned, and are in account for their holinesse in the church, to be adversaries unto Christ, and his Disciples; for the Pharisees here do quarrell with Christ for his Disciples cause. 2. Christs Disciples readily shall be mistaken and misconstrued, do what they please: for their plucking of eares of rough corn, to satisfie their hunger doth not escape censure. 3. Hypocrites do urge ceremonies, and externall observations, more then the greater things of the Law: for here the Pharisees quarrell the Disciples, for plucking of the corn, and purging of it from the aunds, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it on the sabbath, in the case of necessity, as a breach of the sabbath: misregarding charity to the hungry and fainting Disciples, saying, <hi>Why do they that which is not lawful on the sabbath-day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 3.</hi> But he said unto them, have ye not read what David did when he was an hungred, and they that were with him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. How he entred into the house of God, and did eat the shew-bread, which was unlawfull for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but onely for the priests?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Our Lord defendeth his disciples by four reasons: The first is this, It was no sin for David and his men, in a case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, to eat the shew-bread, which by the letter of the Law was appointed for no mans use ordinarily, save the priests: therefore without sin likewise may my disciples pluck the ears of corn and eat thereof on the Sabbath: for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59775:75"/>
the letter of the Law forbideth all manner of work opon the Sabbath, yet the intent of the Law and meaning therof was neither to forbid the Shew-bread to be made use of in such an extraordinary case of necessity, nor to forbid meat to be made ready on the Sabbath to suffice a mans hunger. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the mind of the Law-giver, and the intent, and the end of the command is not contraveened, the precept is not broken; for this is the ground of Christs defence. 2. Not reading nor considering the Scripture, whereby the meaning of the Law may be understood, is the cause of errour and mistaking of duties; This is it he saith, <hi>Have ye not read?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 5.</hi> Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the Sabbath-dayes the Priests in the Temple profane the Sabbath, and are blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But I say unto you, that in this place there is <hi>one</hi> greater then the temple.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The second reason, is, The priests for promoving of the service of the Temple, do bodily work on the sabbath, which in your language is to <hi>profane the sabbath,</hi> and yet are blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: Therefore albeit my disciples, for promoving my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (who am greater then the Temple) do pluck ears of corn, and eat thereof on the Sabbath, and so seem to you to profane the Sabbath, yet they are also blamelesse; Hence learn, 1. Whatsoever bodily work is necessary for the promoving of the service and worship of God upon the Sabbath, is not a breaking of the Sabbath; for the Priests <hi>Did bodily work</hi> in the Temple <hi>on the Sabbath-day, and are blamelesse.</hi> 2. As the body is above the figure, or shadow, so is Christ greater then the Temple, which is a figure of him: Therfore saith he, <hi>In this place is one greater then the temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 7.</hi> But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.</q>
                  <p>The third reason, is this, The Lord never appointed the outward ceremonies of his service in the first table, to hinder works of mercy prescribed in the second table: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when at one time both cannot be done, he will have the work of mercy done, and the ceremony of a sacrifice left undone, for that time. Therefore it is agreeable to Gods will, that my Disciples should rather pluck corn, and eat it on the Sabbath, by way of mercy to their own body;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59775:76"/>
then harm their health under pretext of keeping the Sabbath, which if ye had understood and considered, ye would not have condemned my Disciples without cause. Hence learn, 1. The true meaning of Gods word being known, it is able to prevent rash judgment: Therfore it is said, <hi>If ye had known.</hi> 2. Condemning of the guiltlesse doth draw the judg, being rash, under guilt: Therfore saith he, <hi>Ye would not have condemned the guiltlesse.</hi> 3. It is not every man, no not every learned man, who is acquainted with the true meaning of the Scriptures: for in saying, <hi>If ye had known,</hi> he taxeth both the <hi>Pharisees and Scribes</hi> of ignorance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Verse 18.</hi> For the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.</q>
                  <p>The fourth reason, I whom ye see to be a man, am also God, and Lord of the Sabbath, having authority to prescribe or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for my service on that day, what I please: to judge, and to punish, or pardon the breach, as I please; Therfore, If I judg this work of my Disciples to be no fault, neither should ye. Hence learn, 1. That the incarnation of the <hi>Word,</hi> or second person of the God-head, made the Son of God to be the Son of Man: but it did not diminish his Divine Authority, as he is the Son of God: for he saith, That <hi>the Son of man is Lord e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Sabbath day.</hi> 2. Christ can maintain the authority of the fourth command, and appoint any one of the seven dayes as he pleaseth, for the observation of the command: for, <hi>He is Lord even of the Sabbath,</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>Here is another dispute about the sabbath in the synagogue, whether it was a breach of the sabbath, to heal a man of a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered hand miraculously: Hence learn, 1. That Christ went on to follow his calling, notwithstanding of enemies and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: for after his disputation in the field with the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59775:76"/>
he goeth into the synagogue, where he might do good to the People. 2. Christs enemies, when they have no just quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teil against Christ or his followers, they invent one: as when they could find no sin at all in him; they sought to accuse him for miraculous healing of men on the sabbath, for want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ground of accusation; for, <hi>They asked that they might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him.</hi> 3. Malice maketh men blinde, reasonlesse and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd: for, <hi>They ask if it be lawful to heal a man miraculously on the sabbath day,</hi> wherin there can be no apparent ground of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 4. The more impudent Christs enemies be against him, the more shame and confusion the Lord will bring on them; for our Lord refuteth his adversaries by their own confessions, that it was lawfull to do more on the sabbath to a beast, then they did question him for doing unto a man; ver. 11, 12.</p>

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever impediment be put in Christs way to hinder him to do good, he will go on to do what he intendeth; for, <hi>He saith to the man, stretch out thy hand.</hi> 2. There is no need to presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose power to obey, in those to whom God giveth commands; for he can call things that are not, and make them to be: he saith here to the man whose hand was withered, who was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to stretch forth his hand, <hi>Stretch forth thy hand.</hi> 3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we know we have no power to obey what is commanded, yet at Gods command it is good to essay, and set to, as if we had power; for the man at command, <hi>stretched forth his hand.</hi> 4. While men are in the way of obedience of a command, how difficult soever it be, God can blesse the beginning of obedience, with ability to perform what is commanded; for, <hi>His hand was restored whole as the other:</hi> He preased to stretch forth a withered arme, and it became whole in the stretching forth.</p>

                  <p>Now the Pharisees being confounded in dispute by Scripture and experience, they resolve to kill Christ: Hence learn, 1. That Christs enemies, when arguments do fail them, do fal to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; for, <hi>The Pharisees seek now how to destroy Christ.</hi> 2. Christs adversaries take help one of another, and combine against him with joint wit and power, as here, <hi>They took counsell to destroy him.</hi>

                  <p>Christ withdraweth himselfe from these murtherers; Hence learn, 1. It is lawful for Christs Ministers to go out of the way of furious persecuters for a time, when the adversaries plot to kill them; for even Christ, who was able to resist, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himself from that place where they consulted to destroy him.</hi> When a Minister perceiveth that his life may do unto God, and his Church, more service, then to be killed at such a time, and in such a way, it is no wisedome for him to be stouter then his Master. 2. It is better that such as love the Gospel, should follow the persecuted Preachers thereof, then that they should want the benefit of the Gospel; as here multitudes follow persecuted Christ. 3.

                  <p>Albeit it was Christs mind, that his miracles should not be buried, yet (having his own meanes, and men, and time how, and by whom, and when he wil be made known) he loveth not, that himself, or his great works, should be the subject of common newes, rashly and idly to be divulged, and talked of by every man; Therfore, <hi>He chargeth them that they should not make him known.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Evangelist observeth a design of God, by this means to fulfill, or rather make manifest the fulfilling of a Prophesie of Isaiah, chap. 42.1. wherein it is foretold, that Christ should work great and glorious works descreetly and with little din. Hence learn, 1. That Christs coming into the world, was not with worldly pomps, and much noise, as worldly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do carry themselves with much shew; for so was it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of him by the Prophet. 2. As for the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, they are worthy that notice should be taken of them, and that men should attend unto them; Therefore is <hi>Behold</hi>

prefixed. 3. Christ is the fathers servant, in regard of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature; and in regard of his office of a Redeemer, and Mediator, being imployed in the noblest service that ever was, that is, to bring home the Elect; for God saith, <hi>Behold my Servant.</hi> 4. He is a person singled out for the purpose: in Heaven or Earth there is none like to him, for this is <hi>He whom I have chosen,</hi> saith the Father. 5. The Father loveth Christ as himself, for his own worth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t the Son of his love, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven form of his own person; &amp; in this sense he calleth him, <hi>My Beloved.</hi> 6. In Christ God is wel contented and satisfied every way, and namely as he is Surety and Under-taker for us; The Father craveth no more, no other thing for our full ransome then what Christ hath laid down, and no more in us then he hath promised to work in us: for of him saith he, <hi>In him I am well pleased.</hi> 7. He is so throughly well pleased in him for us, and in our name, that he wished no more, <hi>My soul is well pleased.</hi> 8. Christ as man is furnished fully unto all the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Mediator for ever; and the Spirit of God is bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him as he is Man, without measure; for, <hi>I will put my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon him,</hi> saith he. 9 Not only the Elect of the Jews, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Gentiles were designed to be Christs flock, that he should labour among us, and teach us how to behave our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man, how God will save us, and how he wil be served of us; how he governs the world now, and what he hath decreed to do hereafter; for it is said, <hi>He shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.</hi> Now <hi>judgment</hi> is whatsoever God would have us beleeve, or do.</p>

                     <hi>Ver. 19.</hi> He shall not strive, nor cry, neither shall any man hear bk voyce in the streets.</q>
                  <p>From these words, Learn, 1. That the manner of Christs first coming was not to subdue by strong hand, as an earthly Conquerour, as many supposed he should have come; for it was prophesied of him, <hi>He shall not, strive,</hi> that is, by externall force he shall not set up his throne. 2. Though in zeal and affection to his Fathers glory, and mens salvation; he uttered his voice and cryed, yet not the voice of contention, the voice of oftentative ambition, and imperious proclamations; for in this respect he uttered it not, <hi>He shal not cry, neither shal any man hear his voice in the streets.</hi>

                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:59775:78"/>Another point of Christs commendation teaching us, 1. That there may be much weaknesse and tendernesse in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Gods work of grace, in a converted soul, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to <hi>a smoaking flax, or bruised reed.</hi> 2. Christ will not despise these weak beginnings, nor reject such weaklings; for, <hi>He will not quench the smoaking flax.</hi> &amp;c. But will tenderly entertain the spunk of begun light, and affection, and will bind him, and strengthen a bruised reed. 3. Whither the weak work of his grace be in a particular person, or in a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, he will fight for the maintenance of it, till he have the victory; for, <hi>Iudgement shall at last be brought forth unto vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi>; that is to say, Truth shall have sentence pronounced by him in favours thereof at last, and shall have the victory against all opposition; for, <hi>He shall bring forth judgment unto victory.</hi>

                     <hi>Ver. 21.</hi> And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</q>
                  <p>The last point of the commendation of Christ, is, that he shall not only perfect his commission among the Jews, but also shall prevail among the Gentiles. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The power of the Gospel is able to perswade the greatest strangers and aliens from the common-wealth of Israel to come to him: for it is said, <hi>In his name shall the Gentiles trust.</hi> 2. It is as sufficient for faith to have Christs Name preached, as to see his person; for, <hi>The Gentiles shall trust in his Name,</hi> that is, in him as he is set forth to the audience of all, in the preaching of his truth.</p>

                     <hi>Ver. 22.</hi> Then was brought unto him one possessed with a divel, blind and dumb, and he healed him, in so much that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.</q>
                  <p>Followeth a notable miracle in dispossessing Satan of a blinde and dumbe cative, with the divers censours of Christs works by the People and Pharisees, whose wickednesse Christ rebuketh: Wherein observe, 1. That the fearfull conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men spiritually possessed by Satan, (as are all unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in whom the spirit of disobedience doth raign) may be seen in bodily possessions; and among the rest, in this man, on whom Satan shutteth all doors, that he can neither let in comfort nor let forth the sense of his misery; for, <hi>He maketh him' blinde and dumbe,</hi> which <hi>dumbnesse</hi> is ordinarily accompanied with <hi>deafnesse</hi> also. 2. Such as Christ will deliver from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, albeit they cannot come of themselves to him, yet he can furnish meanes to bring them to him; for, <hi>This blind and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59775:78"/>
dumb man was brought unto Christ.</hi> 3. Christ is the powerfull Physician of evils inflicted by the Divel, as here he giveth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in <hi>healing this man perfectly</hi>; for he came to lose the hands of Satan.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 23.</hi> And all the people were amazed, and said, Is this the son of David?</q>
                  <p>The People are moved at the sight of this work, and do see a glimpse of his God-head, and of Divine glory in him. <hi>Doct.</hi> The miracles of our Lord were so demonstrative of his Divine power, that the beholders were overcome, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to acknowledg his works to be worthy of the promised Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah: <hi>Is this</hi> (say they) <hi>the son of David?</hi>

                  <p>The Pharisees perceiving the people to be affected with the miracle, grow mad, and do blaspheme. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Satan, the more he is like to lose his prey, the more doth he rage; for the Pharisees do baspheme Christ so much the more, that they perceive the people to acknowledg him to be the true Messiah: 2. What Satan loseth one way, he laboureth to recover and make up another way, in opposing Christ and misconstruing his work, so much the more violently and wickedly, as he seeth himself like to be overcome: as is here to be seen in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees. 3. Such as fall in opposing Christ, readily grow worse and worse, till they come to a height, as may be perceived in these proud men. 4. How impudent and malicious is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and how desperate are his slaves, who dare call Christ by the name of <hi>Beelzebub</hi>!</p>

                     <p n="36">36. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself, how shall then his kingdom stand?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Christ cleareth himself, and convinceth his adversaries by five reasons: The first reason, Seeing every Kingdome, city and family set against it self, is ruined, and so also is the Kingdome of Satan; if he should assist me to cast himselfe out, it is no more reasonable to say, that I cast out divels by Satans help and assistance, then to imagine and say: that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will consent that his kingdome should fall; therefore I
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59775:79"/>
cannot with any colour of reason be thus blasphemed: From the description of the sin of these Pharsees, learn, 1. That in pondering mens sins, the Lord looks much to the inward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, mind and affection of sinners, whether they sin of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, or of presumption; of ignorance, or against their light; Therefore it is said, <hi>Iesus knew their thoughts.</hi> 2. The way to preserve all Societies, is <hi>Union</hi>; and the way to ruine them, is <hi>dissention</hi>; for, <hi>For every Kingdom, City, house di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, shall not stand.</hi> 3. Satan hath a kingdom among men, which by all means he goeth about to maintain, and will be loath, really and in effect, wholly to dispossesse himself, both of the soul and body of any in whom he hath power and place; for, <hi>If Satan cast out Satan, how shall his Kingdom stand?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 17.</hi> And if I by Beelzebub cast out divels, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.</q>
                  <p>The second reason, for clearing of Christ and convincing his adversaries, is this. You grant that your children and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall friends, when they cast out divels by the gift of miracles, do it by the power of God; Therefore that shall condemn you of malicious partiality, for your saying, That I cast out divels not by the power of God, but by Beelzebub: Hence learn, 1. That malice moveth men to misconstrue the best actions of the most innocent: for the Pharisees out of malice ascribe Christs works to the Divel, which they knew were of God. 2. The processe of justice against the wicked must be short, when their conscience and common reason in their dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est carnall friends, is sufficient to bear witnesse against their wickednesse, and to condemn them for it: upon this ground Christ saith, <hi>By whom do your children cast out Satan? therefore they shall be your judges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 28.</hi> But if I cast out divels by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God is come unto you.</q>
                  <p>A third reason to convince these men of blasphemy, is, Seeing you know that I do cast out divels by divine power of Gods Spirit, you cannot be ignorant that I am the Messiah, and that the kingdom of grace promised in the Messiah is come: and therefore you are malicious opposers of the kingdome of God in my person: Hence learn, 1. Christs manner of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting out divels was with such heavenly majesty and authority, as that his enemies knew it was by the Spirit of God: for here our Lord taketh that for granted, saying, <hi>If I cast out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59775:79"/>
by the spirit of God,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Seeing Satans kingdom is cast down by the doctrine of the Gospel, and soules are converted through the divine power of God; It is certain that the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Kingdom of Gods grace in Christ is already come; For, If I, saith Christ, <hi>cast out divels by the spirit of God, then is the kingdom of God come unto you</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>A fourth reason: If I by the supreme power of Gods spirit, did not cast out Satan, it were as impossible to thrust him out, as to spoil a strongs mans house without overcoming him first; Therefore you are wilfull blasphemers, who ascribe this work to the Divel: Hence learn, 1. That Satan is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to take, and keep possession of men, when God permitteth him so to do: and may be compared to a strong man, who brings his conquest within doors, and maintains the house a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all that might spoil him: so doth the comparison import. 2. Christ is powerful to overcome Satan, and to spoil him of his possession, and may be compared to a stronger Man. 3. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will not shed with the possession of a sinner, except by strong hand he be over-mastred; for, <hi>he must be bound, before he be spoyled.</hi>

                  <p>A fifth reason: Wheresoever I come to set up my Kingdom, all these who do not help forward my work, are really my enemies; Therefore you who do oppose me, are much more my enemies; and so your speeches against me, are to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med malicious blasphemies: Hence learn, 1. Wheresoever Christ sendeth his Gospel, all that hear it, are either for him, or against him, none are neutrals; for so he saith, <hi>He that is not with me, is against me.</hi> 2. None are for Christ, but such as do their best to gather in others unto him, (<hi>as corn to his barne</hi>) according to their calling; and whosoever do not promove Christs Kingdom, are culpable of hindering of it; for he saith, <hi>Who so gathereth not with me, scattereth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>Thus are these men convicted: now the Lord sheweth, how neere they were to perdition: and this he doth by laying before them the desperate condition of such, as sin against <hi>the holy Ghost</hi>; for each other sort of sin is pardonable, and in some person, one or other, is actually pardoned; even sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against the Mediator, are pardoned; but the sin against <hi>the holy Ghost,</hi> is never pardoned, neither in this world, by the ministeriall application of the Gospel; nor in the world to come, by the authoritative absolution of the Judg, at the last day. The Scripture in <hi>Marke</hi> 3.29. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. and 10.26. giveth us to understand, that not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very sin against conscience or against the Gospel is this sin: but that this sin is an open, wilfull, deliberate and malicious rejecting and opposing of Jesus Christ totally, and of the way of Salvation by him; and that after the holy Ghost, hath by a supernaturall operation convicted the Person of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered to the World through Christ: And therefore it is called, <hi>A blasphemie against the holy Ghost</hi>: Because this sin divelishly opposeth the supernaturall work of the holy Ghost, convincing the mind, that, <hi>Iesus is the Son of God,</hi> the only Saviour of the World; for otherwise in a common man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, every sin against God, is a sin against all the Persons. Now this sin is called Unpardonable, not because it cannot <hi>be</hi> forgiven, but because it never <hi>is</hi> forgiven: The man that falleth in this sin, never repenteth, nor getteth grace to desire to repent, but doth as a Divel desperately go on to oppose Jesus Christ: Therefore, <hi>whatsoever sin it be,</hi> fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which the man is sorrowfull and penitent, and doth flee unto Christ, to be relieved of it, it is not this sin, which the Scripture doth call The <hi>Blasphemy against the holy Ghost,</hi> how hainous soever it be. Hence learn, 1. That there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o sort of sin, except this one, which may not, yea hath not been forgiven in one mans person or other; for it is said, <hi>All manner of sin shall be forgiven unto men.</hi> 2. The sin against the holy Ghost, as it is formerly descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, cannot fall out in the person of a penitent beleever in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, to whom pardon is promised; for, <hi>This sin shal not be forgiven.</hi> 3.

It is possible, that some of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect appointed for Life, may fall in the sin of blasphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Son of God, out of ignorance, or fear, or some sort of deception, and thereafter may repent, and find mercy: for it is said, <hi>Whosoever shal speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him</hi>; to wit, Upon the conditions, and in the manner set down in Scripture, to wit, if he repent, and flee to Christ. 5. It is a dangerous matter to oppose Christ and his Gospel, in any part of his Truth, or Kingdome, or to blaspheme, and speak ill of the work of grace in his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; especiall out of hatred of the truth, and good way of God: for this draweth neer to the unpardonable sin against the holy Ghost.</p>

                  <p>There were two things which might weaken the power of his threatning: 1. The conceit of the holinesse of these Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees. 2. That their blasphemy was but a matter of words; Therefore for the peoples edification, Christ breaketh down these sconces, shewing these men to be most wicked to ver. 36. and Gods judgement to be strict, even in the matter of words, to verse 38. As for the first he proveth these men not, to be holy, but wicked, by four reasons: The first is, because their <hi>Fruits were evill,</hi> set down in the comparison of trees which being good, do bring forth goods fruits: and being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, do bring forth evill fruits; Hence learn, 1. As a tree is known to be good, or evil, by the fruits; so is a man known by the course of his deeds; for this is the intent of the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. 2. As a man carryeth himself for Christ, or against him, so is he good or evil; and though he were as blameless otherwise, as these Pharisees, yet he is a wicked man if he be against Christ; for <hi>The tree is known by his fruit.</hi>

                  <p>A second reason, because the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ect of the Pharisees were a wicked Pack, seeming to be friends to the Law, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to Christ, the true intent thereof, adversaries to the grace of God, and to righteousnesse by faith; and so not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by nature, but also by succession to their Predecessours, in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59775:81"/>
holding their poisonable doctrine, they were a generation of vipers, the worst sort of adders, who being evill, could not speak good; and having their heart full of poison, could not but speak as their heart dyted unto them; Hence learn, 1. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for unrenewed men to speak good, far more impossible to do good; for, <hi>How can you that are evil, speak good?</hi> saith he. 2. Men who glory in their forebears, as these men did in Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and do not follow their footsteps, are in Gods account to be fathered on Satan, and are the vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous brood of his children; Therefore justly doth our Lord call these men, <hi>Generation of vipers.</hi> A third reason, Because the overflowing of their hearts in blasphemous words, did prove them to be wicked blasphemers. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The heart is the fountain of a mans words and works; as it is set, so is the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of a mans words and works, good or evil; for, <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</hi> 2. Whensoever evill doth break forth in a mans words, for that time at least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil aboundeth in the heart; for, <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 35.</hi> A good man out of the treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things.</q>
                  <p>A fourth reason proving them to be wicked, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did delight to lay up wickedness in their heart, and to bring forth ill out of their heart. <hi>Doct.</hi> Whether a man be renewed and a good man, or unrenewed and an evil man, it may be known by the stuffe, which delibrately he layeth up in his heart, and deliberately brings forth out of his heart; for, <hi>If it be a good treasure,</hi> he is a good man; if it be <hi>an evil treasure,</hi> he is an evill man: for here such as the man is, such is his treasure; for, <hi>A good man out of the good treasure, and an evil man of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 36.</hi> But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shal speak, they shal give account thereof in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
                  <p>Thus Christ hath removed the pretext, and conceit of the Pharisees holiness: now he removeth the conceit of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their sin, in respect it was a matter of words, for two reasons; The first is, Idle words should be punished, much more blasphemous words: Hence learn, 1. How little soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men do esteem of words, yet in Gods ballance they weigh
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59775:81"/>
not light: for, not only <hi>wicked</hi> words, but also <hi>idle words,</hi> such as serve for no good purpose, or for no lawfull end, shall come in reckoning as so many sins; Therefore saith he, <hi>Every idle word they shall give account therof</hi> 2. There shall be a day of judgment, wherein all sins, even <hi>words</hi> shall come to be judged: for here <hi>a day of judgment</hi> is set, and this judgment shall passe upon particulars, even upon words, whereof men have not before given account, and received pardon.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 37.</hi> For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</q>
                  <p>Another reason; shewing that words will be respected by God, whatsoever men think of them; because the course of a mans words being naughty, shall be sufficient to be a ditty to prove a man unrighteous; and being well seasoned, shall be a sufficient evidence to prove a man righteous; therfore words are not to be slighted: Hence learn, That as a well gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned tongue, and the course of wisely ordered speeches, is, and shall be in Gods judgement a sufficient evidence of a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and justified; so also a loose tongue is and shal be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the contrary.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 38.</hi> Then certain of the Scribes and of the Pharisees an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.</q>
                  <p>Another dispute about signes, which the Pharisees craved of Christ; wherein learn, 1. That Christ was exercised with divers sorts of temptations by his adversaries; some openly blaspheming, some subtilly insinuating, as if they would deal reasonably with him, <hi>Master,</hi> say these men, <hi>we would see a sight</hi> as if they never had seen any of his miracles before; or, as if upon the doing of some miracle, they minded to believe in him. 2. Christs miracles were sufficient to cleare that he was the Messiah; for even his enemies can crave no more, but to have a sign; for, say they, <hi>We would see a sign from thee.</hi> 3. Obstinat unbeleevers wil not be satisfied with any of Gods words or works; but stil wil crave new ones, as these men, after numbers of signes, crave yet a sign. 4. Mis-beleevers are also limitators of the Holy One of Israel, nothing will satisfie these men but a sign at their direction: <hi>We desire to see a sign,</hi> say they.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 39.</hi> But he answered and said to them, an evil and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the Prophet Ionas.</p>

                  <p>Our Lord refuseth to give them any signe, save this, That after they had killed him, he should rise from the dead, as Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas came out of the Whales belly, and so they would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile over him, for all their malice. In this answer, learn, 1. That a people that doth not embrace the Lord, as he is pleased to offer himselfe, is a people alienate from God, and is a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of another God of their own devising; for therefore he calleth them, <hi>Adulterous generation.</hi> 2. As when Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas his doctrine was rejected by the Jewes, God made him be accepted in Niniveh: So shall it be with such, as will not receive Christ offering himselfe unto them, he shall find others to take the offer: If the Jews refuse, the Gentiles shal receive him: this is one way <hi>of having the signe of Ionas.</hi> 3.

The first witnesse is, The men of Niniveh, who repented at the preaching of Jonas: whether this repentance was better then the repentance of Achab, it skilleth not to dispute: because, presuppose it was no more then was in a naturall man, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the historicall beleeving of temporall judgement coming upon them, like unto Achabs repentance, yet it was more then these hard-hearted people did, who were obstinate unbelievers, and were neither moved with the preaching of mercy nor judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Any sort of repentance, presuppose it be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temporary, is better then obstinate unbelief, and no sort of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59775:82"/>
repentance: for Ninivehs humiliation is <hi>better</hi> then the Jews hard-hearted carriage. 2. There is more fruit of one Sermon to be expected from Pagans, then of many Sermons from the abusers of Ordinances of Religion, for <hi>Niniveh repenteth</hi> at one Sermon, Judea repenteth not after hearing many. 3. The sin of the Mis-beleever, and his judgment is the greater, by so much as the means of beleeving have been more frequently applyed, and Christ hath shown himselfe more in the use of means: for, therefore was the condemnation of the Jewes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe the greater, because <hi>Christ,</hi> who was <hi>greater then Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, was not beleeved,</hi> after long preaching and miracles wrought.</p>

                     <hi>Verse 42.</hi> The Queen of the South shall rise up in the judgement with this generation, and shall condemne it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth, to heare the wisedome of Solomon; and behold, a greater then Solomon is here.</q>

From this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we may learn, 1. That Satan is an unclean spirit, for so here is he called. 2. He may be cast out of a man in some sort, and yet the man be not renewed; As for example, He may be cast out of a bodily possession, and the man remain unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed: He may be cast out in regard of a mans outward pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted life, as he was cast out of these, who after abjuration of their ungodly life at their baptisme, did returne again to their former filthinesse, 2 Pet. 2.. He may be cast out of a mans mind by refutation of his former errours, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of him by sound doctrine: and yet the man may remain unrenewed: such as was the casting of Satan out of this <hi>evil and adulterous generation.</hi> 3.

                  <p>The Disciples ask the meaning of the parables, and a reason of this manner of Christs teaching. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a duty of love to be soliciters for the common multitude: therfore the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples do regrate their case, saying, <hi>Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</hi> that is, in a way which they wil not understand. 2. Our questions about the manner of the Lords dealing with people, &amp; manner of speaking unto them, should be proponed unto the Lord himself, and satisfaction sought from him; for, <hi>Why spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest thou to them in parables?</hi> say they: the question otherwise proponed by way of quarrelling, is dangerous.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 11.</hi> He answered and said unto them, Because it is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.</q>
                  <p>Our Lord doth answer them in a very satisfactory way: teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the matters of the Kingdom of Heaven are mysteries, which none can understand till it be given them from God, and that there are some to whom God mindeth not to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of his mysteries, they being reprobate; therfore, <hi>To them it is not given,</hi> saith he. 2. There are others, to wit, his elect ones, to whom he wil give the unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>standing of the mysteries of Heaven; for he saith, <hi>To you it is given.</hi> 3. The cause of putting
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59775:85"/>
difference betwixt one and another, in the matters of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, it is in the will of God the giver; for so doth Christ reckon, saying, <hi>To them it is not given, to you it is given.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 12.</hi> For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, even that he hath.</q>
                  <p>Our Lord doth clear, and confirme his Answer, by shewing the course kept by God in the dispensation of grace, wherein <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> and <hi>not having,</hi> is to be understood of saving grace. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such as find grace in God's eyes through Christ, have indeed a gift or possession worthy to be called <hi>a gift</hi>; for so he describeth the Elect, <hi>Whosoever hath.</hi> 2. Such as are Reprobates, or are not elected, and do not find grace in the Lord's eyes, whatsoever they have of others gifts, it is nothing in effect, but a seeming to have; for such are described, <hi>Whosoever hath not.</hi> 3. Whosoever hath gotten the Fountain-gift of saving grace, or of God's love in Christ, he shall have all other gifts, which tend to perfect sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for it is said, <hi>Whosoever hath, to him shal be given, &amp; that in abundance.</hi> 4. Whosoever hath not this gift of grace, &amp; favour in God's eyes, shall want and be deprived also of all other gifts tending to salvation, or at least, of the right use of them; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that which they seemed to have of common gifts &amp; means of salvation, <hi>shall be taken from them,</hi> so as they shall not reap eternall life thereby.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 13.</hi> Therefore speak I to them in Parables: because they seeing, see not, and hearing, they hear not, neither do they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</q>
                  <p>From this ground, that this multitude was reprobate, our Lord giveth a reason of his speaking to them in parables. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Some do see with their natural eyes Gods Works and wonders, and do hear his Word also outwardly, who do not by the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eye of Faith perceive or take up the Lord's glory shining therin; for, <hi>Some in seeing, see not, in hearing, hear not.</hi> 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning such as God hath reprobate, he will dispose so of the meanes of salvation toward them, as they shall profit nothing by them unto salvation; therefore saith he, <hi>I speak to them in parables.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 14.</hi> And in them is fulfilled the prophesie of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shal hear, and shal not understand; and seeing, ye shall see, and shall not perceive.</q>
                  <p>Left they should have thought this an hard saying, Christ sheweth, that <hi>Isaias</hi> threatned the like against the wicked in his
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59775:85"/>
time, and did prophesie of the righteous judgment of God, in this sort to come upon the reprobate in Christ's time: Hence learn, 1. That the prime reason of the with-holding of saving grace, from such as do perish, is in Gods decree of reprobation; for of the reprobate it may be said, Though the Lords works be outwardly, and in a common manner seen by them; and his Word do sound among them, and be outwardly, or in a common manner heard by them, yet this shall be without profit to them, or use making of by them; for, <hi>Such hearing, they hear and perceive not.</hi> 2. When Gods judgment pronounced in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath taken hold of one fleece of wicked persons in one age, it goeth on to be executed upon others after them, of that same sort; for the words of <hi>Isaiah</hi> spoken to the people in his own time, are to be fulfilled even upon the wicked in Christs time, some hundred years after <hi>Isaiah's</hi> prophesie, and the same words are fulfilled in our time, and shall take hold of the wicked in time to come.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 15.</hi> For this peoples heart is waxed grosse, and their eares are dul of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</q>
                  <p>The Lord sheweth the righteousness of God, in execution of this decree of reprobation, by this, that there is in them a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary induration of heart, going before the juridial induration inflicted upon them: Hence learn, 1. That beside the natural seneslesnesse of things spiritual, and the natural ignorance, and unbelief of the Gospel, there is an affected &amp; voluntary blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mind, and hardness of heart, which men draw on by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of sinning; this is it he saith, <hi>Their eyes have they closed.</hi> 2. Where unto <hi>natural</hi> blindnesse and hardnesse of heart, men superadde a <hi>wilfull</hi> blindnesse and hardnesse of heart, it is justice with God to give them over to a <hi>judiciall</hi> blindnesse of mind, and hardnesse of heart, as the comparison of this place, with that of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> cha. 6. giveth ground; for <hi>here</hi> their volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blindness is set down, <hi>They have closed their eyes</hi>; &amp; <hi>there</hi> the judicial blindnesse and hardness is set down, <hi>Shut their eyes, make their heart fat.</hi> 3. This plague is proper to the reprobat, who God wil not save, to whom God hath resolved to give no saving grace, <hi>Lest he should heal them.</hi> 4. whosoever get grace to turn fro their sins, to repent &amp; to beleeve in Jesus Christ, are not given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to a reprobate sense, shal surely be saved; For while he saith,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59775:86"/>
He <hi>wil not grant them grace to hear and understand</hi>; that is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve &amp; repent, least they should be healed, he importeth, that if they did believe and repent, they behoved undoubtedly to be healed; the exercise of Faith and Repentance being infallibly marks of saving grace.</p>

The chief doctrines to be observed herein are, 1, That the externall visible church is worthy to be called, and counted the Kingdome of Heaven, even in regard of the externall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of it in this world, notwithstanding of the mixture of wicked hypocrites in it; because therein Christ rules as King, and hath his Subjects, all professing him to be King of Saints, but especially in respect of his own elect therein, who honour him in Spirit, in whom he doth begin eternal life, and draweth it on unto perfection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The visible church is like a corn field, wherein are sown good seeds and noysome weeds, sound converts, begotten of God, and wicked hypocrites, who are the children of Satan; for <hi>the enemy sowes tares among the wheat.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. It is a matter of grief and offence, to see in the church of God so many unprofitable and noysom weeds, so many wicked hypocrites and naughty persons; this the servants coming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate the matter, doth import.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The rash zeal of servants, before they consult the Lord their Master, is ready with the hazard of the church, and true members thereof, to have such a constitution of the visible church, as they should suffer none to be a member, who are not inwardly regenerate, but have all others of whose inward Regeneration they are not assured, plucked from among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours: this is imported in, <hi>Wilt thou that we go and gather them up?</hi>

                     <hi>Verse 33.</hi> Another parable spake he unto them, The Kingdome of Heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened.</q>
                  <p>Another parable tending to this same purpose, namely, to shew that the work of Gods grace by the Gospel in the visible Church, how small appearance soever it hath, wil notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spread and prevail, according to the measure appointed of God. The doctrine is this, As good leaven, after a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent time, will leaven all the lump, to the leavening whereof it is appointed; so will the work of Gods grace in his Church by the Gospel powerfully affect, and prevail unto the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all these for whom God shall send it, and therefore we should not judge of Gods works in his Church by outward appearance; this serveth then, and should serve now, to make men faithful in teaching the truth, and to wait for a while till God shall work, and give his blessing to the hearers in his own time.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Here is rendered another reason, why Christ did speak to the people in parables, to wit, that he might fulfill what the Prophet as the type foretold, that Christ should do, and how Christ should by speaking in parables stir up his hearers to search what was meaned by this sort of speaking, as the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist stirred up his Hearers to attend the more, to what he was to deliver in parables, Psalm 78 2.. To the intent that such as would understand, might learn; and others who would not search for light, might be justly left in blindness. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Both the matter and manner of Christs doctrine is worthy to be maintained and vindicated from all misconstructions, for Heat we have the evangelist for a precedent. 2. Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers should teach nothing for matter nor manner, but what they have a precedent, for in the Scripture, for even Christ did so.</p>

                        <hi>Ver. 36.</hi> Then Iesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed, is the Son of man.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. The field is the world: the good seed are the children of the Kingdome: but the tares are the children of the wicked one.</p>

                  <p>Here the speaking in parables taketh good effect in his own Disciples; they are made sensible of their own dulnesse in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and are moved to ask light of the Lord, and so they receive satisfaction; for the Lord declareth what the parts of the parable were in their intent and signification. Hence learn, 1. That the visible Church, as it is not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son called, <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> as is shewne before; so also, not without reason, is it called here, <hi>the world</hi>; in regard it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all sorts of people in <hi>The world,</hi> and is spread through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>the world,</hi> and not limited to any one place: <hi>The field</hi> (to wit, the universall visible Church) where the seed is day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sown, is called <hi>The world.</hi> 2. The Elect, and true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers begotten by the Gospel, and true Subjects of Christs Kingdome, and heirs of Heaven, are the only proper chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdome, for, <hi>The good seed are the children of the Kingdom.</hi>

doth what he can to have hypocrites, and wicked men mixed among the godly, as members of that same church, ver. 39. for, <hi>The enemie that sowed them, is the divel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. This mixture of good and bad, is to endure to the end of the world, that is, untill the day of judgement, wherein the Angels shall have work to separate the wicked from the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for, <hi>The harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are the Angels.</hi>

                  <p>Another parable teaching us, 1.

That among all things which can be conceived to be fit to bring men unto happiness, there is only one means able to make blessed, one pearl of price, to wit, Christ Jesus; in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and grace, and that the wise man wil content himself with Christ, and what is to be found in him, and wil renounce all other things, which come in comparison with him.</p>

A time of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall feasting, is a time fit for plotting and practising against Gods Servants, as here <hi>Herods birth-day</hi> is fit for John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists beheading. 3. A foolish and gracelesse heart is easily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a small delight, as Herod is marvellously pleased with a <hi>Damsels dancing.</hi> 4. A foolish delight is able to insnare a man for practising a wicked work, as Herods vain delight inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him in a rash generall promise and oath, and so he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the murther of the Lords Servant. 5.

A gracelesse soul may have a wrestling with his lusts, ere he commit a sin, and may be sorrowfull for carnal reasons to do some wicked deed, as Herod here is loath to kill John: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conscience may tell a man of sin, and vexe him also, and yet for no right reasons; as, <hi>The King is sorry, to behead Iohn.</hi> 9. A naturall conscience is not able to resist a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, though it may restrain a man for a time; for, <hi>Herod, though he be sorry, yet he yeeldeth.</hi> 10.

                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59775:93"/>17. And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. He said, Bring them hither to me.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grasse, &amp; took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. And they did all eat, and were filled: and they tooke up of the fragments that remained, twelve baskets full.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here is the miracle of the loaves, occasioned by the Disciples care to have the multitude dismissed timously. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is wisdom to have regard unto peoples infirmity, and what they may endure in attendance of divine worship; as, <hi>The Disciples here have a care</hi> of the peoples want of food. 2. If God cal for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary attendance, he wil furnish ability, and provide for the bodies of such as prefer the feeding of their soules to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing of their bodies, providing they tempt not God herein, by neglecting wilfully ordinary means; Therefore Jesus saith, <hi>They need not depart, give ye them to eat.</hi> 3. Where God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a call to his servants to feed people, they must look to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for ability, and not be discouraged, for the little furniture which they conceive they have; for here the Disciples have no more but five loaves, and two fishes, and Christ contenteth himself with them, <hi>Bring them to me,</hi> saith he. 4. It is good in an ordinary call unto any work to look to ordinary means, as the disciples here not apprehending as yet any more then the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, do make objection, that they have but five loaves and two fishes. 5. The Lord will have our weaknesse for his work to beseen: to the end his power may the more appear; as here, the paucity of loaves and fishes must first be seen, ere he work the work. 6. In working of miracles, our Lord did so dispose of all circumstances, as might most profit the people, and glorifie the Father; in whose name and power, as being one with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did the work; as here, <hi>He ordereth the people in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, looketh to Heaven, and powerfully blesseth their provision,</hi> that there might be bread and fish enough by his divine operation. 7. Christs Ministers shall lose nothing in distributing their gifts unto the feeding of his people; for the Disciples, after more then five thousand have eaten of their few loaves, do take
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59775:93"/>
up twelve baskets full, a great deal more then they had laid down.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 22.</hi> 
                     <p>And straightway Iesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Another miracle tending to shew, that as Christ is Lord of the earth, and lives of the creatures therein, so he is Lord also of the sea and winds, wherein he exerciseth his Disciples with a plece of trouble, to make them profit in the knowledg of his spirituall Kingdom. The reasons of this short dispatch, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining of the disciples to go to sea without his bodily presence, may be seen in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. and <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. Here it is sufficient to learn, 1. That we should be sure of an urgent calling, before we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a hazardous voyage; for, <hi>Iesus constrained his disciples to go into a ship.</hi> 2. Christ wil not have men diverted from their places and callings, under pretence of waiting on him; nor to expect to live by miraculous means, but to attend upon the ordinary blessing of each mans vocation: and therfore, <hi>he sendeth the multitude away.</hi> 3. Christ, albeit the Son of God, yet because he had taken on our nature, and the office of Mediator therein, upon all occasions of retyring, he prayeth and intercedeth with God for his people, <hi>He went and prayed apart.</hi> 4. When the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are in trouble, and under trials, the Mediator is praying for their upholding: when the disciples go to sea, Christ goeth to the Mount to pray. 5. Christs Disciples must be in trouble and hazards, when others are at ease, as here it fareth with these Disciples. 6. Albeit men have Christs warrant for their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, yet are they not exempted from trouble &amp; danger therein, for here is an instance. 7. Men may have fair wheather in the beginning of a work, and danger and trouble may be kept back till they be so far ingaged, as it is more safe for them to go forward then to return; so fareth it here with the Disciples; for, <hi>The storm ariseth, when they are in the midst of the sea.</hi>

they were troubled, saying, it is a spirit; and they cryed out for fear.</p>

If God give a calling, however it seem to be

procured, a man may relye on it, and have reason to believe for assistance in following of it; for, <hi>Peter heareth Christ say, Come; and presently he casteth himselfe on the sea, and his faith for a time upheld him, so long as he kept the gripes.</hi>

                  <p>The storme continueth, and Peter beginneth to fear, and doubt, and sink. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the triall of faith, bringeth to light the weaknesse of faith; for a man may hold out a while, who at length may faint as Peter here doth. 3. When men look more to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers then to God calling them to it, no wonder that their faith be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>brangled: for Peter seeth the wind too much, and Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence too little. 4. It is safest to ponder all that faith is to meet with, if we can overtake it, before we enter in the conflict with difficulties; for Peter should have prepared against the wind, as well as against the sea, and waters. 5. Somtimes perill pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a man more when he is in the dangers, then before; and a man may seem stout before the experience of the danger, who shall prove feeble in it: men know not readily their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, till they be put to a proof; Peter doubted nothing to walk on the Sea, till now. 6. As faith groweth feeble, courage and strength, and all begin to fail; as soon as Peter doubteth, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to sink. 7. When our faith groweth weak, our prayer should be strong; for doubting Peter <hi>cryed</hi> in prayer. 8.

                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:59775:95"/>IN this contest betwixt Christ &amp; the Pharisees about traditions, learn. 1. That it is no new thing that Christ hath adversaries; and these chiefly, corrupt Churchmen, even such as bear office in places most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Religion; for here <hi>Are Scribes and Pharisees which were of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> going about to divert disciples from following of Christ, and to put a disgrace (if they could) on our Lord, for his Disciples cause. 2. It is no wonder to see Christ and his Church molested with the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie of non-conformity in humane inventions of Religion, <hi>Why do thy disciples transgress the traditions?</hi> say they. 3. Antiquity and Fathers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture, is the old charter of superstitious Formalists; for, <hi>Why</hi> (say they) <hi>do thy disciples transgresse the traditions of the Elders?</hi> 4. That which otherwise is lawful in it self, while it abideth within the limits of civill fashions, may be left undone, and be discountenanced, when it is set up in state, within the limits of Religion; therefore the Disciples did not wash their hands before meat, in the company of Pharisees, who made <hi>washing at that time,</hi> to be a holy and religious act.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 3.</hi> But he answered unto them, Why do you also transgress the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God by your tradition?</q>
                  <p>Christ putteth the Pharisees to defend their traditions, and refuteth them: Hence learn, 1. That God in wisdom bringeth mens ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to a dispute, and so to be refuted and contemned, then especially when men do presse them most; for now Christ taketh on the plan, and answereth for his Disciples, and confuteth the Formalists by four rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The first reason; By the authority of your traditions ye transgress the command of God: Therefore such authority is not to be regarded by my Disciples: Hence learn, 1. That traditions may be fathered or mothered on those that maintain them, no lesse then upon those who invented them; for Christ saith, <hi>Why do you by your traditions transgress?</hi> 2: Such as are most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ealous for humane traditions shall readily be found transgressours and contemners of divine commands, and Gods traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given by Scripture; for, <hi>Why do you transgresse the command of God?</hi> saith he. 3. When the authority of humane traditions doth loose, or weaken the obligatory power of morall command in any thing, it may and should be despised altogether, and rejected as unworthy to be a rule for a mans carriage in any thing; for, <hi>Why do you also by your traditions transgresse the command of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 4.</hi> For God commanded saying, Honour thy father and mother: and be that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his Father or his mother, It is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me,</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Christ proveth the challenge, because their traditions did warrant the children to dedicate unto the church-men, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious offering or gift, all that they might spare above their own maintenance; and so for their own filthy lucre, they deprived Parents of all maintenance from their children, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the fift command; for when the Parents, or the poore should seek support of them, their traditions bade them answer
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59775:96"/>
thus, <hi>That which thou seekest, and every other thing whereby thou mightest be helped,</hi> or <hi>profited by me,</hi> or <hi>any thing of mine, it is a gift</hi> already dedicate to the Church; And therefore hold me excused: Hence learn, 1. The duty of children unto pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is straightly urged by Gods command: and the wicked transgression of it is made capitall; for the Law saith, <hi>He that curseth, let him die the death.</hi> 2. It is a part of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to parents, that children sustain them in their need, as they are able: for not helping is here as much, <hi>As not honouring of their Father or Mother.</hi> 3. Such tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as directly, or by consequence do prejudge the true intent of any of Gods Laws (whatsoever pretence of Religion be made) are wicked; for he saith, <hi>You by your traditions have made the command of God of none effect.</hi> 4. No gift nor vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary offering presented unto God doth please him, when the duty of love adebted to others is neglected, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened thereby; for Christ calls such a <hi>gift,</hi> a breach of the fifth command. 5. Dispensation with Gods Law by humane authority, and urging of mens traditions more then of Gods commands, is in effect the abolishing of Gods Law; for so saith Christ, <hi>By your tradition, you have made the command of God of no effect.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Verse 7.</hi> Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesie of you, saying,</p>
                     <p n="8">8. This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is farre from me.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The second reason, from <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.13. By way of retorting; the challeng is, this urging of your traditions is but the bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your hypocrisie, and counterfeit drawing neer to God in externall rites, when your affections are no wayes toward God; Therefore my disciples should not receive them: Hence learn, 1. Zeal for humane ceremonies, especially joyned with the neglect of Gods precepts, doth prove grosse hypocrisie; for so saith Christ, <hi>Ye hypocrites draw neer to me.</hi> 2. The Lord esteems nothing even of the outward exercises of religious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, appointed by himself, when men do not labour to perform the same with affection; it is the heart which he looks unto in worship: Therefore saith he, <hi>Their heart is farr from me.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:59775:96"/>A third reason, from the Scripture also, <hi>Isai.</hi> 29.13. When mens inventions and precepts, are made the rule of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, God doth reject such service, and therefore your challenge of my disciples is unjust. Hence learn, That it is the Lords prerogative to prescribe all the parts of his own worship; and if a man presume to prescribe what shall be worship to him, which he hath not prescribed, it is a sufficient cause to reject mans ordinance; for, <hi>In vain do they worship me, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 10.</hi> And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>A fourth reason delivered unto the multitude, by way of apology for his Disciples, This sort of pollution which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the mouth by unwashen hands, is not a sin which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth the conscience, but the wickednesse of the heart, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the mouth; such as is these wicked mens quarrelling of my Disciples, that indeed doth pollute the man: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Pharisees, rather then my Disciples, are polluted. Hence learn, 1. That contesting against Christs Disciples, slandering and reproaching of such as do not observe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane traditions, is a pollution of the slanderer, and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then the omission of humane ceremonies, which may be omitted without pollution of sin; for, <hi>That which cometh out of the mouth, polluteth.</hi> 2. Albeit unto mocking adversaries, we need not alwayes give reasons of what we do or omit, yet unto different spectators it is good to give a reason, for their edification, and our own clearing, as here Christ giveth satisfaction to the common people; for, <hi>He called the multitude, and said.</hi> 3. The fountain of the pollution of a mans actions, is his heart, conscience and affections not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly disposed; for, <hi>Out of the heart cometh</hi> such and such evils.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 12.</hi> Then came his disciples and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</q>
                  <p>The Disciples do wonder that Christ did regard so little to displease the Pharisees: Hence learn, 1. Truth must be taught, whosoever may be displeased; for so did Christ preach, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the Pharisees were offended. 2. Nothing will vexe false
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59775:97"/>
teachers more, then the discovery of their false doctrine before the multitude, as the Pharisees for this <hi>Cause were offended.</hi> 3. Men are ready to stumble and offend at the teaching of Truth, where no stumbling block is laid before them, as at Christs doctrine, <hi>The Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 13.</hi> But he answered and said, Every plant which my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</q>
                  <p>Our Lords answer serveth for a reason, 1. Why he spake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pharisees false doctrine: and 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> against their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> why he misregarded in this case their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence-taking, because both their ceremonies, their false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and they themselves also, being altogether reprobate stuffe, were plants which God had not planted in his field, but Satan; and therefore they were all to be rooted out, for the good of the vineyard, and field of the Lords church. Hence learn, 1. That in the visible church, and Garden of the Lord, there may be some plants not of Gods plantation, but of Satans; such as false doctrine, corrupt inventions of men, thrust into Gods worship, and wicked men defenders of both; for this is imported in, <hi>Every plant which my Father hath not planted.</hi> 2. God, the good Husband-man, will have these evill weeds discovered, and cast out, as God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a calling and occasion; therefore saith he, <hi>They shall be rooted out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</q>
                  <p>Christ doth cut off any more speaking of these wicked men. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Obstinate maintainers of false doctrine, and of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt traditions, enemies to Christ and his disciples, are given over of God, and are worthy also to be given over, and let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by men, that is, fellowship is not to be kept with them; Therefore he saith, <hi>Let them alone.</hi> 2. Where the teachers and people follow mens traditions in Religion, and not the rule of Gods word, the leaders and they that are led, are both blind; This is it he saith, <hi>They be blind leaders of the blind.</hi> 3. The following of false teachers and blind guides, will not be an excuse before God for people to plead immunity: But seeing none should follow any man, but as that man doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lord, the blind guide and the blind follower shall both perish, if they hold on in their wrong way; for, <hi>Both shall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ditch.</hi>

                        <hi>Ver. 15.</hi> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> this parable.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. And Iesus said, Are ye also yet without understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entreth in at the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</p>
                     <p n="18">18. But those things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and they defile the man.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, fornications, thefts, false witnesse, blasphemies.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>washen hands defileth not a man.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Peter doth not understand the parable of not being polluted by meat, and so moveth this question. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is good to be asking of Christ, whatsoever we understand not, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever reproofe may follow for our dulnesse; therefore saith Peter, <hi>declare unto us this parable.</hi> From Christs answer: learn, 1. That when disciples do not take up the plain speeches of Christ, they are reproof-worthy; Therfore saith Christ, <hi>Are ye also without understanding?</hi> 2. Albeit Christ reprove our faults, and be angry at them, yet he wil go about to relieve us of them, for he is about to teach after reproof, saying, <hi>do not ye understand?</hi> 3. Every action or word doth testifie what is in the heart, and doth adde a degree of further pollution and guiltiness, unto that which the man had before he brake out externally; for, <hi>Evil words coming forth from the heart, do pollute the man</hi> yet more. 4. When a needless ceremony, and a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious invention of man is neglected, or forborn, it is not a sin, notwithstanding of whatsoever humane authority, or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Elders commanding it; for Christ here doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the disciples eating with unwashen hands, though contrary to the tradition of the Jewish doctors, <hi>Not to defile the man.</hi>

                        <hi>Ver. 21.</hi> Then Iesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. And behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and cryed unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David, my daughter is grievously vexed with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.</p>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59775:98"/>
cause; Learn, 1. That where Christ hath a lost sheep, or a work of mercy to work, he spareth no pains to compasse his purpose; for here, <hi>He departed to the coasts of Sidon.</hi> 2. The persons to whom Christ hath a mind, providence will draw them after him, <hi>Behold, a woman of Canaan came.</hi> 3. Faith findeth the smell of Christ where ever he be, and draweth in unto him; for, <hi>She cometh and calleth on him.</hi> 4. Faith pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with need is earnest in prayer; for, <hi>She cryed unto him.</hi> 5. Faith doth fix on Christ as the true promised Messiah; for she calleth him, <hi>Son of David</hi>: Faith looketh on Christ as compassionate and mercifull, it pleadeth for mercy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth no merit, for thus saith she, <hi>Have mercy on me.</hi> 6. Love owneth them whom it loveth, whatsoever be their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for here the trouble that her child is troubled with, she counteth it as her own, saying, <hi>Have mercy on me, for my daughter is troubled.</hi> 7. Faith giveth Christ the glory of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to do all that it desireth; so she ascribeth unto him pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to cast out the divell, saying, <hi>My daughter is vexed of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> But he answered her not a word: And his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples came and besought him, saying, Send her away, for she cryeth after us.</q>
                  <p>There are 4 means used for the triall of her faith. The first is, Christs keeping silence when she prayeth: Hence learn, That God, albeit he love the Suppliant, and do accept his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet possibly he will keep silence, and not seem to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for a time; for, <hi>He answered her not a word.</hi> The next means of her triall is the small assistance she hath of the disciples pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: wherin learn, That saith loveth the help of the prayers of the Faithfull militant, as a means prescribed of God for mutuall comfort; for, <hi>She cryed after the disciples.</hi> 2. When God thinketh it fit to try our faith, by delaying to hear us, he will for our tryall make other means which we use, to fail us also; as here the disciples would be rid of her importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and have her dispatched, that she should not trouble them; Therefore say they, <hi>Send her away, She cryeth after us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 24.</hi> But he answered and said, I am not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</q>
                  <p>The third means of the triall of her faith, is, By our Lords tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her, that his commission reached only unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel, which was indeed true, in regard of his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59775:98"/>
particular and personal Ministry in the days of his humiliation, wherein he was to make offer of his grace, first and chiefly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jews: and this is true again, If we take Israel for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God, both Jews and Gentiles: He came for these Elect ones only: But unto this woman who understood not so high a matter, it could not seem but that his commission was to the Jews only, and not to the Gentiles, of which sort was she: Hence learn, 1. That among other trialls of the faith of the Lords people, this is one, To suffer them to be questioned, whether they be of the number of the Elect; for thus much importeth, <hi>I am not sent but to the lost sheep of Israel.</hi> 2. Christ hath an errand to such as find themselves in perill to perish; for, <hi>He is sent to the lost sheep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord help me.</q>
                  <p>She cannot answer this doubt, and therefore passeth it over; and insists in prayer; what Christs commission is, she will not dispute, but sure she is, she must be helped: Hence learn, That when any doubt doth tend toward excluding us from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of such to whom the Gospel is sent, we shall do well to passe by such doubts, without disputation, and to insist in prayer, grounded upon Gods goodnesse and power to help, for so did this woman, <hi>Then came she and worshipped.</hi> 2. The more the Lord seem to refuse us, we should so much the more humble our selves before him, and continue in prayer; for it is marked, <hi>That then she worshipped, and said, Lord help me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 26.</hi> But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread, and cast it to dogs.</q>
                  <p>The fourth means of her tryall, is, By seeming to exclude her (as a heathen, or unclean dog, without the covenant) from al the benefits of the Messiah, belonging to Israel, (who are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God by covenant) as their proper food; and here the former doubt is augmented, and put more nearly home unto her: Hence learn, 1. That the Lord when he will try, doth try unto the quick, and humbleth unto the dust the soul under tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and for this end maketh the last difficulty more then any of the former; for now he saith, <hi>It is not meet to give to dogs,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Such as are within the externall covenant of Grace, are in some respect holy, as consecrate to God and appropriate unto him by covenant, and such as have the priviledges of Gods people belonging unto them, as unto children, while
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59775:99"/>
others who are without the covenant are counted dogs; This he importeth, saying, <hi>It is not meet to cast the childrens bread to dogs.</hi> 3. The representation of our unworthiness before our eys is a main point of triall of our faith: Therfore, for her last trial, he compares her <hi>to a dog.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 27.</hi> And she said, Truth Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crums which fall from their masters table.</q>
                  <p>The Lords Spirit looseth the doubt unto her: Hence learn, 1. That Christs commission, albeit it was chiefly unto the Jews to set much on their table, yet it was not so limited, but that crums of their food; especially being neglected by them, might be bestowed upon the Gentiles: this is it she seeth, <hi>Crums fall from the table.</hi> 2. The Lord in tryal of faith, makes the Believer of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord, to mark all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages whereby it may strengthen it self; Therefore saith she, <hi>Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat the crums.</hi> 3. The Believer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be humbled, as deeply as the Lord pleaseth; and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg his own unworthiness to the uttermost: only he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be content to be excluded from God, and the benefits of his grace; for this woman can be called a <hi>dog,</hi> but cannot want some crums of Christs kindness. 4. It is a special wisdom to turn motives unto discouragement, into motives to believing, and drawing so much the more near to Christ, as the motives unto dscouragement do drive us away from him; for so this woman doth, The more her natural uncleanness &amp; unworthiness, and her alienation from the common-wealth of Israel, is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto her, she beareth her self the more in upon Christ: when she seemeth to be boasted away from him as a dog, she creepeth in under the childrens table, to catch crums falling from it.</p>

                  <p>From Christs answer, learn, 1. That faith doth please Christ exceedingly; therfore saith he, <hi>O woman.</hi> 2. This is a true and kindly faith, not to take a refuse of Christ, answer as he pleaseth; but to pursue constantly our petition for his grace, and by no means to part with him: for this cause Christ saith to her, <hi>Great is thy faith.</hi> 3. Whatsoever hard expressions be due to a sinner, in regard of his natural condition, yet the believer is greatly loved and esteemed of by Christ, as here; It is now no more <hi>A dog,</hi> but <hi>O woman.</hi> 4. Howsoever Christ seem to wrestle with a believer,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59775:99"/>
yet he is purposed to give faith the victory, and to yeeld himself in this conflict to the believer, as here, <hi>Be it unto thee,</hi> saith he, <hi>as thou wilt</hi>: The believer shal have at last all that he wisheth; and Satan shall he tread under foot. 5. The prayer of his faith is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable for others; for this womans <hi>daughter</hi> was made whole <hi>from that very hour.</hi>

He will not despise his own appointed ordinary means, for so far as they can reach: nor wil he do any thing extraordinary, further then is necessary; for, He could have fed them without these seven loaves, but he wil take them and make use of them seeing they may be had. 3. Christ useth to shame the misbelief of his servants by making them actors in the work, which they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to see; for, <hi>He gave to the Disciples,</hi> &amp; they <hi>to the multitude.</hi> 4. There is no scant when the Lord giveth the banquet, for all are filled when he inviteth his guests, as here. 5. His manifold wisdom wil glorifie himself as he pleaseth, but ever in a way sufficient to manifest his divine power; for there are here more loaves and fewer people, and fewer fragments, then when by five loaves five thousand were fed, but one basket proveth the miracles as well as a hundreth, and the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the ordinary means be, he will shew his power the more.</p>

2.

Such as would make shew that they would believe, if such and such signes, or not promised conditions were granted unto them, are both lying hypocrites and tempters of God also, in prescribing new means of believing, when God hath given sufficient already; Therfore it is said, <hi>They came tempting him, in desiring a signe.</hi>

False doctrine is like leaven, for it infects the lump se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and totally; therfore <hi>Beware of leaven,</hi> saith he. 2. The doctrine of justification by works professed by the Pharisees, and the doctrine of the Sadduces denying the resurrection of the body, and the immortality of the soul, are both poisonable leaven; therfore, <hi>Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,</hi> saith he; putting both the sects in a like condition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

                  <p>Christ is offended that they should be so carefull of bread, and imagine that himself was anxious about bread also, seeing they had experience lately of his power to provide bread at his pleasure. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

Not to profit in faith, is the matter of greatest controversie between Christ and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; as here, <hi>O ye of little faith.</hi> 4. The right use of Christs works, in speciall of his miraculous feeding many with a little food, is to assure us of Christs power to provide bread for his servants, and that they need not to be anxious about that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Therefore saith he, <hi>Remember the miracle of the loaves.</hi> 5. The Lords reproof, is a mean of rectifying our understanding; for after the reproof, then <hi>they understood</hi> that he meaned by leaven, <hi>The corrupt doctrine of the Pharisees.</hi>

                  <p>Christ is about to clear and confirme his disciples in the knowledge of himself, and maketh way for this, by questions: Hence learn, 1. That it is expedient for Pastors to examine the knowledge of their flock as Christ here asked his disciples. 2. It is no new thing to see diversity of judgement concerning Christ, and the matters of his Kingdom; for there were in Christs dayes divers opinions of men about him, even among them, who were not his opposite enemies; for, <hi>Some said he was Iohn Baptist,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Of such as have most means of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Christ, most is to be expected, and if Christs Disciples have a right estimation of him, the less matter what others have; but chiefly it is necessary that such as are to preach Christ, know him rightly; Therefore saith Christ, <hi>But whom say ye that I am?</hi>

                  <p>Christ commendeth this confession of Peter, as a saving truth revealed from Heaven, whereupon in despite of Satan, he would settle his church, and rule the same by the Ministry of his servants, and would ratifie in heaven their service done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

Such as bear testimony unto Christ, he will bear testimony for them, and will give them a new name, as here he pronounceth Peter, A lively stone, builded on a sure rock, and that by way of confirmation of the name, which he had given unto him at his first calling, saying, <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> or a stone. 5. The truth that Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah, very God, and very man in one person, the anointed Saviour of the world, is, The main ground-stone wherupon the faith of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is founded, as upon a rock; for, <hi>Upon this rock I will build,</hi> saith he. 6. All the power and policy of the divel, and his instruments shall not be able to overturn this truth, nor the Lords building of his church upon it, nor the work of Gods grace in any member of the church, which is builded on this truth; for so he promiseth in a speech borrowed from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of these times when the Judges sat at the Port and gave judgement; And so what wisdome or power was in the towne, was in the gates thereof, <hi>The gates of hell shall not prevail against it,</hi> saith he. 7.

any one or moe in heaven or earth, may subject the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselves, as it is the church; for Christ hath reserved the church for himself, and hath appropriate this incorporation, as such, unto himself alone, and called the church his own proper; saying, <hi>I wil build my Church.</hi> 8. Howsoever there be many particular churches distinguished one from another, yet must they all endeavour for an unity among themselves, that they may be one church with, and to Christ, and among themselves, keeping the unity of faith in Christ, and unity of subjection to all his ordinances in the bond of peace among themselves; for Christ hath called them one, and appointed them to be one, saying, <hi>I will build my Church,</hi> in the singular number. 9. Whatsoever externall defence, comfort, cherishing, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance unto the church be required of the Magistrate, for the service of Christ, yet all the means of edification of the church, and all the administration of the means of the internall buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the church, Christ reserveth unto himself, to be done by his own means, and his own chosen instruments; for this worke he taketh unto himselfe, saying, <hi>I will build my Church.</hi>

                  <p>In this promise made to Peter, in name of the Apostles and their Successours in the Pastorall charge, in whose name he did speak: learn, 1. Christs church visible is his Kingdom, even on this earth, not an earthly Kingdom, but a spiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, wherein he as King of heaven, in heavenly things, doth reign; therfore he calleth the church visible, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> 2.

for it is said, <hi>I will give thee the keyes.</hi> 5. What the Lords Ministers do by vertue of their office, in admitting unto the fellowship of God and his Saints, or excluding from the same; binding unto judgment, and loosing from judgment in Christs Name, according to their commission, it is ratified by God in Heaven, as done by his warrant; for it is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>Whatsoever ye shall binde on earth, or loose, shall be so in Heaven.</hi>

of his wit, and worth; in a word, <hi>a mans own self</hi> is a bundle of all sort of idols, which we must either renounce, and be content to have them mortified, or else we cannot follow Christ: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith he, <hi>Let him deny himself.</hi> This self-denyall the Lord hath appointed to be helped forward by a <hi>crosse,</hi> which God will not leave to our choice, but will fit it for every man, and lay it before him, or upon him, and wil have every man humbly to stoop, and submit, and take it on, and bear it out constantly, so long as the Lord thinks fit to let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As the crosse doth force a man to deny himself, for it faileth not to take from him, and to lay upon him what he would not, so self-denyall boweth the back to take up and bear the crosse kindly; therefore said he, <hi>Let him deny himself, and take up his crosse.</hi>

                  <p>The reasons to move us so to do, are seven. The first reason is, the eschewing of the crosse to save your life, is the very way to lose your life, therefore resolve to bear the crosse; for, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will save his life,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall lose it.</hi> A second reason; to resolve to lose thy life for my sake, is the way to keep it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore resolve to bear the crosse. Hence learn, 1. That the love of this temporall life maketh men deny Christ: therefore is it, that Christ will have a man resolving about this life. 2. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will save his life by denying Christ, is a great fool; for he loseth that eternally which he seeketh, by eschewing of Christs crosse, to save for a time; for, <hi>Whosoever will save his life,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall lose it.</hi> 3. To lay our reckoning to lose life and al, rather then deny Christ, or any point of his truth, is our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test wisdom: He who maketh least account of his life, and of all things belonging thereto, in comparison of serving and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Christ, is a wise man; for he gaineth for ever in effect that which he hazards temporally for Christ; for, <hi>Whosoever,</hi> saith he, <hi>will lose his life for my sake, shall finde it.</hi>

                     <hi>Ver. 26.</hi> For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</q>

                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:59775:105"/>A third reason is, He that refuseth to bear my crosse in hope to gain thereby, shall be disappointed; for he shall lose his own soul, and so can gain nothing, though he seem to gain a world; therefore resolve to bear my crosse. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the cause of Christ cannot be maintained without the crosse be born, and hope is offered of worldly gain also, if a man shall fall off from Christs cause, it is a sore temptation, as Christs question in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering of it doth import, <hi>What is a man profited</hi> in this case? saith he. 2. He that in fear to lose, or in hope to gain some earthly thing, refuseth to maintain Christs cause, shall lose more then he can gain, were it a Kingdom; for, <hi>he loseth his soul,</hi> and <hi>what profit hath he, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</hi> A fourth reason; Nothing in the earth can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem a mans soul, when he hath shed from me for fear of the crosse, or hope of gain; therefore resolve to bear my crosse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to deny me. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is no ransome of a mans soul beside Christ, if any man deny him; for, <hi>What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi> 2. It is a special means to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us against the fear of the crosse for Christs cause, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see our irreparable losse if we deny him, and to say with our selves, <hi>What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi>

                  <p>A fifth reason; Though I may seem mean and abased, in that my followers are put to bear my crosse, yet I will be found the glorious Son of God, worthy to be suffered for; Therefore let no man think shame, of my crosse, <hi>The Son of man,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall come in the glory of the Father.</hi> The sixth reason; The fruit of bearing my crosse, or refusing of it, shall be seen at the day of judgment, when I shall be Judg, and shall reward the backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with deserved judgment, and shal crown the grace of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for me with the reward of life; <hi>He shall reward every man,</hi> saith he, <hi>according to his works:</hi> Hence learn, 1. That Christs incarnation neither should, nor shall derogate any thing from the glory of his God-head; for, <hi>The Son of man shall come in the glory of the Father.</hi> 2. The Son of man and the Son of God is onely one person; for it is said, <hi>The Son of man shall come in his Fathers glory.</hi> 3. The fruit of every mans works, whether good or ill, shall be found at the second coming of our Lord; for, <hi>Then he shall reward every man according to his works.</hi>

which shall not taste of death, til they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdome.</q>
                  <p>The seventh and last motive, is, I do promise a glance of the glory of my kingdom, unto some of you my hearers, before I die, as much as may incourage you, and all others my follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to indure any crosse for me: Therefore resolve to bear the crosse. Now some little glance of his glory he gave shortly after this, in the transfiguration; but this was not the main matter: his coming in the power of his kingdome, was then made more evident, when after his resurrection he declared himself Lord and King, in erecting his church with all her officers where he pleased, in subduing Jews and Gentiles unto himself, by the power of his Word and Spirit, in separating his church and his people from the world, without the church. This Kingly power was seen most evidently by such of the Apostles as lived lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest; and this his coming in the power of the gospel, is a pawn and evidence of his future coming to judgment, in the glory of his Father. Hence learn, 1. Whosoever get a right sight of the glory of Christs power, in converting soules, in erecting his church with all his ordinances therin, and governing of it, will not refuse to bear his crosse; for, To encourage the disciples to bear the crosse, this promise here is made. 2. Christs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and grace manifested by conversion of soules, and ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the church in the Apostles dayes, is a demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs Kingly Power, and an evidence of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto judgement; for, <hi>Some</hi> (saith he) <hi>here standing, shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his Kingdome.</hi>

                  <p>In the transfiguration, the Lords glory appeareth in three things. The first is, the alteration of the naturall obscurity of his flesh, into a glorious shining brightnesse, flowing from the in-dwelling of the God-head in him; in so farre, that the darknesse of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aiment is swallowed up in this light, springing through the same, so as it made his <hi>raiment appeare white as light.</hi> Hence learn, 1. Where the Lord pleaseth to let forth his glory, it is able to beautifie our earthly and obscure bodies, as this transfiguration, far transcending Moses his face shining, giveth evidence. 2. Glorification taketh not away the substance, nor naturall properties of the body; for here is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious transfiguration, but no abolition of the substance of Christs body.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 3.</hi> And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.</q>
                  <p>The second point of Christs glory, is the apparition of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Elias, whether in their owne proper bodies, resumed for a time, or in bodies formed for the present purpose, to be laid down again as garments, it is not materiall to inquire; for either this or that was alike easie to the Lord: and presuppose their bodies had been raised, and laid down again in dust, yet

wherein soever Moses and Elias could be serviceable to their Redeemers glory, it was not their trouble or loss, but their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; The main matter which we have to learn, is, 1. That Moses and Elias, and so all the prophets are Christs servants and witnesses unto him, all of them agreeing in one with him. 2. That the dead in the Lord are not perished, but live with God in heaven; for, Moses and Elias are seen here, kept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                  <p>The effect of this glorious vision ravisheth so the hearts of the three apostles, that they could have taken this estate for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Hence learn, 1. How joyful the sight of glorified persons shall be. 2. The sight of the least part of the glory in heaven, so ravisheth the soul, that it forgetteth all that is on the earth, and is so satisfactory, that a soul could rest on the least degree thereof, as in a heaven; for, <hi>It is good to be here,</hi> saith Peter. 3. It is our nature, if it be well with our selves, not to care for others, little mind had the Apostles what need others had of their service, when they could have stayed still on the mount.</p>

                  <p>The third point of Christs glorification, is, the testimony of the Father concerning his Son Jesus, which Peter could never forget again, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.17. First, they see a bright cloud, then they hear a voyce out of the cloud (for we are not able to behold him as he is, and must not pry into his glory, which is unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but must take heed unto what he revealed by the eare: a Voice, of his Word must reveal God unto us) and that which is here revealed concerning Christ, is, 1. That the Man Christ is true God; the Son of God, one in substance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for, <hi>This is my Son,</hi> saith the Father. 2.

                  <p>This voyce was so full of Majesty, proceeding from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent glory, that the disciples fel down. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the God-head of the Father, or of Christ is manifested, who can stand before his Majesty?

                  <p>That we may know that the voice was spoke of Jesus, and concerned him alone, he alone is left with the disciples, and now the vision is removed, when the intent of it is obtained. <hi>Doct.</hi> The Lord measureth the means of manifesting himself, as he seem fit for our good; for, <hi>When they lifted up their eyes, they saw none but Iesus only.</hi>

                  <p>The discharging of the disciples to shew the vision until the resurrection, teacheth us, that the Lord hath his own set-time, when he wil make use of what he revealeth to his servants, and will bring forth every truth in his own time, when it may be most useful; Therfore saith he, <hi>Tell no man, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.</hi>

                  <p>Upon the departure of Elias, and the discharge of revealing the vision, the three Disciples do move a question, about the Prophesie of the coming of Elias, which the Disciples do think to be now accomplished; and that by his staying still, it might have appear'd to the world to be accomplished: But Christ shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59775:107"/>
that that prophesie was accomplished another way, in John Baptist. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. What doubts do arise unto us about Scripture, among other means, let us by prayer crave solution of them through Christ, as the Disciples here <hi>asked him about Elias.</hi> 2 The adversaries of Christ are ready to blindfold themselves, and others also, by mistaking Scriptures, like these Scribes, who wil not acknowledg Christ to be come, <hi>Til Elias come,</hi> to wit, in their way.</p>

                        <hi>Ver. 11.</hi> And Iesus answered and said unto them, Elias truely shal first come, and restore all things:</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Our Lord did answer, that indeed the Scripture must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, &amp; not a letter fail; for, <hi>Elias,</hi> saith he, <hi>truly shal first come,</hi> and that when John Baptist came, this Scripture concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the coming of Elias was fulfilled, because when John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist came in the spirit and power of Elias, Elias in a manner was revived; for as Elias set himself to the reformation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when all was wrong in his time; so John Baptist, when the whole frame of Religion was marred, by the corruption of the Jewish Doctors, did renew the doctrine and worship again: <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The fulfilling of the Scriptures may readily be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of men; for, when that which is foretold is done before their eyes, they wil not see it; for, <hi>Now Elias is come, and they knew him not.</hi> 2. The world instead of receiving Gods Messengers, as becometh, are ready to abuse them, as they please; Therefore saith he, <hi>They have done to him what they listed.</hi> 3.

                  </q>
                  <p>Concerning the healing of the lunatick: Learn, 1. It is a fit time for the Lord to shew his power most, when he may have mainest witnesses, and most glory in his working; as here, he trusseth the healing of the lunatick, <hi>with his coming to the multitude.</hi> 2. The soul which beleeveth in Christ, as it find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its need pressing, so will it go speedily to Christ, so will it humbly and earnestly seek help of him, as the Lunaticks father doth: 3. The misery of a soule left unto Satan, is great, who out of malice, if he can, will vex the man who is in his power; as, <hi>the poore child was vexed in fire and water.</hi> 4. Christ doth reserve some benefits to be conferred immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly by himself, and in this case second Means and instruments (although they be imployed) do fail; as here it falleth out, <hi>I brought him to thy disciples, but they could not heal him,</hi> saith the childs Father.</p>

                     <hi>Ver. 17.</hi> Then Iesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shal I be with you? how long shal I suffer you? Bring him hither to me.</q>
                  <p>This sharp rebuking both of the mis-beleeving Jews, and also of the Apostles, for depriving themselves of the use of the gift of miracles by their unbeliefe, teacheth, 1. That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing grieveth our Lord more then peoples mis-belief, for this obstructeth all the blessings which are appointed to come by faith; Therefore he upbraideth the multitude, and his Disciples among the rest, with this sharp rebuke, <hi>O faithless ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> 2. The longer that Christ hath offered himself to a people or person, and the more patience he hath shown towards them; the more he is provoked by their mis-belief to reject them, and depart from them; therfore saith he, <hi>How long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you?</hi> 3. He is not so angry, as any passion can move him to forget to be mercifull to the miserable; for incontinent he saith of the poor Boy, <hi>Bring him hither to me.</hi>

                  <p>At a word our Lord delivereth this distressed soul. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. How strong soever, and how long soever Satans possession be in a soul, Christ can cast him out quickly; as here, <hi>Iesus rebuked the divel.</hi> 2. Christ is a perfect Physician, he can so cast out Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and remove a plague, that the party afflicted shall be no more molested, as here, The <hi>divel departed out of him, and the child was cured from that very hour.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 19.</hi> Then came the disciples to Iesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</q>
                  <p>The disciples are ashamed, and privily do aske the cause of their ill success. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is reasonable that we be ashamed of our mis-beliefe, as the Disciples were when they came to Christ, in <hi>the house privately,</hi> and apart. 2. Chastisements are then best made use of when they send men to search the sins which have drawn them on; as here, <hi>Why could not we cast him out?</hi> say they.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 20.</hi> And Iesus said unto them, Because of your unbeliefe: for verily I say unto you, if ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be unpossible unto you.</q>
                  <p>From Christs answer learn, 1. That Unbelief may be lurking, till it be brought forth in trial, and not being observed timou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly by ourselves, nor repented of in secret, may be brought forth before others, to our shame openly, and so we cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised for it, as the disciples were, to whom Christ answereth, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of your unbelief.</hi> 2. Unbelief, and other unrepented sins, may mar the exercise of most excellent gifts; for the Apostles could not cure this child, <hi>Because of their unbelief.</hi> 3. The least measure of the faith of miracles being put to work, upon the warrand of Gods word, if it be purged from unbelief, and from secure and carnall confidence, and be put forth in the own vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, (as the least graine of Mustard-seed doth put forth the sharpnesse, taste, and smell of its own kind) it is able to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate the greatest works, and to overcome the greatest diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; put the case they seemed as impossible as the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of mountaines; Therefore saith he, <hi>If ye have faith,</hi> &amp;c. 4. The same may be said of saving faith also, it being put to work upon the warrand of Gods word, to mortifie some lust, or to grow in some vertue, it shall be able to overcome all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties:
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59775:109"/>
The reason is, Because nothing is impossible to God, who when he passeth his word unto the Believer, will not fail to performe what he hath promised, whether it be in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, or an ordinary way; for it is said, <hi>nothing shall be impossible to you.</hi>

                     <hi>Ver. 21.</hi> Howbeit this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting.</q>
                  <p>Christ giveth another reason of their not being able to cure the child. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is a difference of the power of divells, and there are differences of exercises of poor souls by them; for here is a kind most violent. 2. When we find Satan strong and violent, and not yeelding ground to us, when he is opposed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or set upon by us, then must we set an edge upon our faith by prayer, and an edge upon our prayer, by fasting and separation of our selves unto the exercise of prayer; for, <hi>this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting,</hi> saith he.</p>

                        <hi>Ver. 22.</hi> And while they abode in Galilee, Iesus said unto them, The Son of man shall bee betrayed into the hands of men.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. And they shal kil him, and the third day he shal rise again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they were exceeding sorry.</p>

                  <p>There is another warning of the Disciples, concerning the cross and sufferings of our Lord, and of his resurrection. Hence learn, 1. That there is need to guard well against the scandall of the cross of Christ, before the crosse come, lest we stumble when unexpected troubles shall follow Christs cause; therfore said he, <hi>The Son of man must be betrayed.</hi> 2. The best guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst troubles, is, to look to Gods appointment, and foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the crosse, and to look to the resurrection, and out-gate promised; therfore Christ saith, <hi>The third day he shall rise again.</hi> 3. We are inclined to be more moved with the grief of the cross, then to be comforted and encouraged by the glorious out-gate of it; for, Now <hi>They were exceeding sorry.</hi>

                     <p n="25">25. He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Iesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?</p>
                     <p n="26">26. Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Iesus saith unto him, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up: and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of mony, that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>In this history of Christs paying tribute: Learn, 1. That tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute is due to Magistrats for their publick service, this is impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, <hi>Doth your Master pay tribute?</hi> 2. Christ is no unfriend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Magistrats and Rulers, nor any wayes a hinderer of paying any thing due unto them: for Peter affirmeth that Christ payed ordinarily. 3. He wil not exempt his Ministers or Followers from the common civil duties wherunto other subjects are lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Therfore he saith to Peter, <hi>What thinkest thou?</hi> &amp;c. 4. Christ by no ordinary course of Law was subject unto any power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven: for as Kings sons are naturally free from tribute, so is the Son of God naturally free also, for he is the Heir and Owner of all things; for as every King and his native children are naturally free from the burdens proper unto the subject, so is God the Father, and his native Son Christ, coeternall with the Father, naturally also free from all things which the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can impose upon him. What King is he, who will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Gods Son unto him? Therfore Christ said, That <hi>Kings children are free,</hi> of all whom he was the chief. 5. Howsoever Christ was the rich Heir of Heaven and Earth, as of his own workmanship, yet for our cause he voluntarily subjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and became poor, that he might make us rich; for he had no mony to pay his tribute. 6. As in matters of civil losse, Christ did dispense with his own right civill, and subjected himself to pay tribute, which he was not bound to do, so must his servants do: and not only must they pay tribute, which is their due by civil obligation, but rather then they mar the Gospel, and breed scandall, they must bear burdens, which civilly they are not bound to bear. 7. Christ was never so far abased at any time, but the glory of his God-head might have been seen breaking forth in the mean time, or shortly after, lest his humiliation should at any time prejudice his glory at our hands; as here at the time when he doth subject himself to pay tribute, at the same time he sheweth himself Lord of all the creatures, who can make the most wild of them to come to his angle, and bring mony with them in their mouth unto him; as here he giveth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in <hi>this fish which Peter catcheth.</hi>

                  <p>THe Disciples dreaming of a worldly kingdome of Christ, do strive for state among themselves; Hence learn, 1. The seed of ambition and prelacie is old in Ministers, and ground was found to foster it in the unmortified corruptions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; for here they are disputing, <hi>Who is the greatest in the kingdome?</hi> 2. Neither Peter nor any other of the Apostles had supremacie or majority of power over the rest; for here they ask Christ, <hi>Who is the greatest?</hi> They did not acknowledge any one greater then another, but referred the determination of this unto Christ, who simply disallowed the question, as sinfull.</p>

of power of any one over the rest of that office, but will have men so far from affecting of it, as a young child is, who knoweth not what striving for state doth mean; therfore saith he, <hi>Except ye become as children.</hi> 4. If this wicked root set up the self in a man, he must repent him of any motion toward it, and be converted; and if being convinced of the sin, he shall not be converted, and repent of it, he shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven which is above; for so much saith our Lord here to the Apostles, <hi>Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shal not enter into heaven.</hi>

                  <p>A second reason, The man furthest from affectation of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, is the man worthy of most estimation before men; therfore beware of looking toward prelaticall preheminence of one over another. <hi>Doct.</hi> True greatness of Ministers stands not in being one over another in majority of power, but in humility and farnesse from seeking a prelacy or preheminence over their brethren; for, <hi>Whosoever shall humble himself as this little child,</hi> saith he, <hi>is the greatest in the kingdome of heaven.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The third reason; I give authority unto every messenger of the Gospel, even to the meanest and most averse from this sort of preheminence, that, <hi>Whosoever receiveth him, receiveth me,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore be content with this common honour, and seek not greatnesse of one over another. The fourth reason, the ministeriall authority is not augmented by prelatical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er erected among you, nor diminished for want of it, therfore beware of prelacy; for I do give the authority of Embassadors to the meanest whom I send, even to the most humble, so as, <hi>Whoso receiveth such an one in my name, receiveth me.</hi> This may content a moderate man. A fifth reason; affectation of Majority over the brethren, is a stumbling block to little ones who beleeve in me, Therefore beware of it; for, <hi>Whoso shall offend any of these little ones,</hi> &amp;c. The sixth reason is from the danger, if they do otherwise, that it were better for a

man to die a violent and ignominious death, then by affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of prelacy, and despisisng the simplicity of a sent Minister, to hinder the work of the gospel in his hand, or the salvation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beleever, how mean soever he be, <hi>Better,</hi> saith he, <hi>that a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone were hanged about his neck,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

The 1. reason, Much wo, much sin and misery is to come upon the world by stumbling blocks cast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: Therfore beware of offences; for, <hi>Wo unto the world because of offences.</hi> The 2. reason, Greatest woe abideth the man by whom offence is given; <hi>But wo to such a man by whom offences come</hi>; Therfore beware of offences. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

Whatsoever mischief shall come, or may come by a stumbling block, shal be imputed unto him who giveth offence, or layeth a stumbling block in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers way; for, <hi>Wo to the man by whom the offence cometh.</hi> 3. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the necessity of the coming of offences in Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor the imputation of the mischief done unto the man who giveth offence, shall excuse the party that taketh offence, or save him from wrath; for stil this standeth, <hi>Wo to the world, because of offences.</hi>

profitable or necessary as your eye, or your foot, in your esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it is better to be deprived of it, then to sin, and so be cast in hell with it; therfore beware of giving offence. Hence learn, 1. That the cause of stumbling our selves, and moving others to stumble, is in our selves, to wit, some beloved lust, precious and profitable perhaps in our estimation, as our eye, or our hand, or our foot; therfore saith he, <hi>If thy hand, eye, or foot of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee.</hi>2. Such beloved lusts must either be mortified and cut off, or else we cannot but perish: and therfore better these lusts be abandoned and cut off, then they and we should both perish; <hi>Cut them off,</hi> saith he; <hi>better for thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>A fourth reason; Despising any of these little ones must be eschewed: therfore the laying of stumbling blocks must be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed; for not caring to offend them, is to despise them: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith he, <hi>Take heed ye despise not one of these little ones.</hi> The fifth reason; God esteems of the meanest of these little ones so much, that the good Angels, who daily enjoy Gods glorious presence, are ministring spirits appointed to attend them: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not despise them, by not caring to stumble or offend them. <hi>Doct.</hi> If we consider what price God and his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels set upon the meanest christian, we would be loath to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise or offend them; for, <hi>Their angels behold Gods face.</hi>

                  <p>The sixth reason; I came to redeem the meanest of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, even such as count themselves lost; Therfore ye should not despise them, by not caring to offend them. <hi>Doct.</hi> The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation and love that Christ hath of and toward the meanest christian, should move us to beware to offend or despise them; for, <hi>The Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</hi>

                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:59775:112"/>The 7th reason; It is not the will of the Father that any the least christian should perish, and therefore ye should not despise them, or misregard their offence or stumbling, where-through they may perish: This is set down in the parable of a good Shepherd; the scope whereof is to shew, that as a good shepherd regards every one of his sheep, and if they wander, will carefully seek to reclaim them and save them; so doth God regard the meanest of his elect, the meanest of christians, so as he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them from their sins, and danger of perishing, as the Text sheweth: <hi>How think ye, if a man have so many sheep?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. He that scandalizeth his neighbour doth what he can to make him perish, as the opposing of the will of the Father to preserve him, unto the power of a stumbling block, doth import. 2.

Albeit he that layeth a stumbling block before his brother, shall not be able to destroy him, yet he may put him out of the way a little, and hinder him in his course to heaven, as the parable of the shepherds reducing of the wandring sheep doth shew.</p>

                  <p>After disswading us from stumbling of others, he teacheth us how to remedy scandals given unto us by others, that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be reclaimed, and the church receive least damage ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: and 1. He giveth direction about private scandals, saying, <hi>Moreover,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When scandal is given, we must not onely beware our selves to stumble, (though we cannot eschew but be grieved) but also must study to reclaim the offender; for this direction is given to us, to remedy scandals given. 2. The scandalous sin of a brother, or professed believer especially, must be cared for, and cured by believers; <hi>If thy brother offend thee.</hi> 3. Private admonition especially, in case the offence be private, is a mean of reclaiming our brethren from their sinful courses, <hi>Go tell him his fault alone.</hi> 4.

If private admonition profit not, and the party admonished will not amend, we must not give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the cure of his scandalous course, but must use further means, and take the assistance of some others to help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim him; Therefore saith he, <hi>Take with thee one or two more.</hi> 2. The admonition of two or three, serveth to convince the Offender of his fault the more clearly, or to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against him in case of his disobedience; for, <hi>In the mouth of two or three witnesses every truth shall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</hi>

                  <p>The former failing, he teacheth what further must be done, <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When more private means avail not to remedy a scandall, Christ hath appointed more and more publick Censure and Discipline in his Church; for he saith, <hi>Go tell the Church.</hi> 2. Christ hath appointed a church of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or rulers over congregations, and over all particular persons within the same, which must attend the complaints of the Offended, and remove scandals, and who have power to call before them, and to examine and censure the Offender for that end; for so importeth Christs say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Tell it unto the Church.</hi> 3. The Church hath means and power to remove publick scandall, which being imployed by the church, and obeyed by the Offender, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is not to be used; for <hi>Neglecting to heare the Church,</hi> presupposeth the church Direction and Order to be given forth for amendment of the Offender, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the scandall. 4. When the church hath given sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon the Offender, and hath appointed the way to remove the scandall, then the Offender should obey in the Lord; for Christ declareth it a sensurable fault, to <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to bear the Church.</hi> 5. If the Offender disobey the

churches direction, for removing of the scandal, then the church may and should excommunicate the obstinate; that is, declare him to be deprived of the honour of a Christian, till he repent, and to be holden in such dis-respect, as the heathen and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans were by the Jewish Church in those dayes; for, <hi>Let him be to thee</hi> such, presupposeth, he is found and declared by the church to be holden for such. 6.

                  </q>
                  <p>This doctrine is cleared and confirmed by a parable, the scope wherof is to shew, that except we be willing to forgive, and do forgive particular injuries done to us, how oft soever our brother shall desire pardon, we cut our selves off from being pardoned of God, against whom we do sin oftner then any man can do against us. According then to the scope of the parable, we are taught, 1. That our sins against God are moe, and more heavie, then any which our brethren do comitt against us; for mens injuries against usare but <hi>pennies</hi> in comparison, but our faults against God are <hi>thousands of talents.</hi> 2. God is readier to forgive us our greater sins, then we are ready to forgive our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren their petty offences against us. 3. The consequence of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59775:114"/>
Gods mercy toward us, should move us to be mercifull one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another. 4. He who will not forgive his brother his tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, and that from the heart sincerely, the Lord will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give that man his sins, but wil cast him in hel, til he pay for his sins, and that shall never be. To dispute here of the recalling of remission of sins, is without ground, and not to the purpose, for the scope is fulfilled in this, that as the wicked servant who did not forgive his fellow-servant, got not forgivenesse, but was cast in Gaole, and into the tormentors hands, so neither should any get forgivenesse from God, who did not forgive men their trespasses.</p>

                  <p>Christs enemies move the question about divorcement, to make him odious either to men or women, howsoever he should answer. Hence learn, 1. Whithersoever Christ went, as he had disciples, so he had adversaries, who did ever seek to make him odious to the people, that his doctrin should be the less fruitful: here are cavillers, asking, <hi>Is it lawfull,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Ignorance of Scripture is the cause of error, and of idle questions; for, <hi>Have ye not read?</hi> saith Christ. 3. To come to the institution of any Ordinance of God, is the way to correct the abuses of it, as here in the matter of marriage, Christ goeth to the first institution of marriage, saying, <hi>He which made them.</hi> 4. Marriage of one man with one woman and no moe at once, is Gods ordinance, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the creation of the first couple, for he made them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>One</hi> male, and <hi>one</hi> female. To the end that this Matrimonial love might be incommunicable to any other, and indissolvable one from another; for, <hi>They two shall be one flesh.</hi> 5. The band of Man and Wife for mutuall society, is more intire then of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children; Yea, it is a sort of unity, so that man and wife become <hi>As one flesh</hi>; for in regard of mutual affection and agreement, for the mutuall welfare one of another, <hi>They are no more two, but one flesh.</hi> 6.

                  <p>The Pharisees do object the bill of divorcement, and Christ sheweth that this doth not free any man from sin, who (except in the case of adultery (shall put away his wife.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59775:115"/>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> Ordinance about the bill of divorcement, was no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the divorcement, but a judicial or civill law, providing for the credit and safety of the honest woman: for the sum of it was, <hi>I find no fault with this woman, only I cannot love her,</hi> so shee was clear, and this civill permission did deliver the man from civil punishment only, but not from sin: therfore saith he, <hi>Moses</hi> suffered <hi>you.</hi> 2. The civill punishment was spared, and the bill of divorcement permitted for the hardnesse of the mans heart, who if he should not have been suffered to put away his wife, would have some way taken away her life; for, <hi>Moses suffered you for the hardnesse of your heart.</hi> 4. This permission was but temporary, and for a time; but the first and ancient institution of marriage behoved to be the rule wherby to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect abuses crept in; therfore saith he, <hi>From the beginning it was not so.</hi> 5. Marriage is loosed by adultery, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent party is free; for he doth make exception of fornication, as a cause making the party injured to be free to put away the Adultresse. 6. And in case the unlawfully divorced party be married to another, it is Adultery; for so doth Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce.</p>

                  <p>The disciples think this doctrine hard, for in case divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were not lawful, they say it were better not to marry, then to be so straightly bound in marriage: in whom we see, 1. How impatient our nature is of all restraint, and how much we love to be at liberty, even from the bands of God; for, <hi>If so it be, it is not good to marry,</hi> say they. 2. Suddain resolutions and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are readily full of folly: for here the disciples neither do look unto their own strength, or rather inability to live in a single life, nor do they consider the incommodities of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married life, nor the commodities of marriage, where God giveth a blessing.</p>

Hence learn, that no man ought to despise or rashly reject mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, it being Gods Ordinance, and a mean to keep from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; for all men cannot receive this saying of, <hi>Better not marry,</hi> &amp;c. 2.

Albeit little children know not what to ask; or what is done unto them, yet can Christ give both his blessing, and the signes thereof to them; the ignorance of little children did not exclude them from the Sacrament of Circumcision, nor these children from imposition of Christs hands, in sign of a speciall blessing. Neither must this exception of childrens

ignorance exclude our children from Baptism; for this holdeth still, <hi>Suffer them to come unto me.</hi> 3. Seeing little children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are neither excluded from the Kingdome of Heaven in this earth, that is, from being members of the visible church; nor are they secluded from the Kingdome of Heaven which is above; therfore are they not excluded from receiving the signs and seales of the Right and Entry to such grace, namely the seal of the covenant, <hi>Baptism</hi>; for it is said, <hi>Of such is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</hi> 4.

Christ wil be known to be God by them who come unto him, or else they cannot worship him aright; for the reproof being fitted to allay the young mans high estimation of himself, (who could not speak a right word) doth import this much: <hi>Give me not divine attributes, seeing thou takest me not to be God</hi>; or give me not fairer words then thy judgment and affection do allow. 3. In proper speech, only <hi>God is good,</hi> by whom alone a man must be <hi>made good,</hi> made to <hi>do good,</hi> and made to <hi>receive good</hi>; for there is <hi>One good, even God.</hi> 4. Such as seek justification and eternall life by works, must be taught, that to keepe the whole Law in all points without the least sin, is the only way to heaven by works, (which way to every man now polluted with sin, is impossible): There is no better way to humble a proud Pharisee, then to teach him soundly the mind of the law; Therfore saith Christ, <hi>If thou wouldst enter into life, keep the Commands.</hi> 5. The precepts of the second Table, wherein Pharisees conceive themselves most perfect, are a sufficient touchstone, whereby to try their unfruitfulnesse, and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; therfore Christ names only the Commands of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table.</p>

A short exposition of the Law, makes a large opinion of righteousnes &amp; keeping of the Law; Therfore saith he, <hi>All these have I kept from my youth up.</hi> 3.

                  <p>In Christs answer, observe, 1. That Christ will put the men, who have a high estimation of themselves, unto speciall tryalls, that their inabilities may be openly known; as here, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all.</hi> 2. Every man is bound to bestow, as God directeth, all which God hath given unto him: goods, lands and life, when he is called by God unto it: And therfore Christ giveth not here a simple counsell to this man, but a speciall command to renounce the love of riches, which was his idol, and to bestow his goods as he was commanded, and that upon promise of more durable riches in Heaven, that so he may make the man who would appear perfect, to be seen a grosse worshipper of Mammon; for, <hi>Sell, and give to the poor,</hi> is a particular and expresse command given to this man. 3. Presuppose a man upon a speciall command sold all, and distributed all to the poor, as was commanded to this man, yet unto the perfecting of him there will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more, to wit, that he should be a follower of Christ, enter himselfe Christs Disciple, deny himselfe, take up his crosse, and follow Christ, that so he might have righteousnesse and life eternall by him alone; for it is here written, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect,</hi> not only <hi>sell all, &amp;c.</hi> but also, <hi>and come and follow me.</hi>

                  <p>Our Lord taketh occasion from this, to beat down, and root out this wicked weed of prelacy: This strife for State and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of Power was reproved before, and yet it is not amended. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1 Hard is it to root out the seed of a beloved sin, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the root of prelaticall ambition; it cannot be drawn out, till it be repented, for it is hard to put it out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles hearts. 2. Our Lord did esteem it a fit means to cut off strife, to take away all domination in the church, and all Majority of Power among the men of one office in his house: for where there is no higher place, where there is no great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one then to another, there all strife for the place of more power doth cease; <hi>It shall not be so among you,</hi> saith Christ. 3. The Lord alloweth domination, and Principality, and Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and exercising of authority in the civill State, but will not allow it among the Ministers of the Gospel; for having granted domination to civill Governours, he excludeth church-men from it, saying, <hi>But it shall not be so among you.</hi> 4. It is not the abuse of Majority of Power, which our Lord forbiddeth his Ministers, but simply and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he dischargeth <hi>All Majority of power, all Greatness of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of one over the rest,</hi> and doth curb the very wishes

and will of being great among their Fellow-Ministers, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every one of his Ministers, saying, <hi>Whosoever will be great among you.</hi> 5. So far must the Apostles and Ministers of the Gospel be from affecting State, and Majority of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the rest, that as they would please our Lord, they must set themselves to serve the rest of their Brethren, and to promove the worke of Christ each in others hands, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the credit each of others Ministery; for he saith, <hi>Let him be your Minister, or Servant.</hi> 6. Not only doth our Lord discharge all majority of Power among the Apostles, and in their persons among the Preachers of the Gospel, but also all stately Primacy, or Dignitary Priority: All <hi>Chiefness,</hi> albeit without jurisdiction, such as is constant and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Precedency in Assemblies; and therefore he prescribed the curbing of this inclination, by injoyning the study of submission mutuall, and each man serving of the rest, for the furtherance of the common work; for, <hi>Let him be your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> importeth this. 3. If this command do not prevail with the ambitious party, but he must needs bring forth his ambitious desires, then the rest of the Ministers are warranted to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish of that mans estimation, and to account the lesse of him, by so much as he is ambitiously inclined to a principality, and majority over the rest; for so doth the words beare, <hi>Let him be your Servant,</hi> that is, Let him be so esteemed of, and no more.</p>

It is wisdom to seek of God the greatest things, whatsoever else we need; for these men are not so curious for Alms of Mony, albeit they were Beggers, as to have the benefit of the Mediators mercy, <hi>Have mercy on us,</hi> say they. 3. Whosoever crave any benefit by Christ, must be cleare in this point, that Christ is the promised Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah? for, <hi>Son of David</hi> is their great argument. 4. We must beleeve his power and love as God incarnate, able and willing to save us; for so do they, saying, <hi>O Lord, thou Son of David.</hi>

the promised Messiah, in whom the promises were accomplished; Therfore he wil now go <hi>riding into Ierusalem.</hi> 2.

No doubt he knew what fruit to draw from it, and missed not what he expected; but did obtain all that which he intended, to wit, That the Disciples by this miracle, might be taught to make use of the gift of miracles given unto them, and certainly a tree was well bestowed, (how birthy soever it might have been) upon so noble a lesson unto the Church. It is also without warrant to ground allegories here, as if Christ had intended to shew that he desired fruits of the Church of the Jews, and of all professours of Religion, and that if they do not render fruits, when he doth call for them, then that he would curse them, and make them unable to bear fruit afterwards: such like flowers may seem pleasant, but have no solidity, as from the intention of this miracle. I grant that allusions may be made unto this tree, and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes may be drawn from it, no lesse then from any other thing: but the scope which our Lord declareth afterward, is that onely whereupon we must with warrant build; namely, He will shew his Almighty Power in blasting of so strong a tree with a word of his mouth, so that the Disciples <hi>do wonder</hi> to see the miracle, vers. 20. Whereupon our Lord doth teach them, that whensoever they should have this word for their warrant, whether extraordinarily inspired for the doing of any miraculous work in his name, or ordinarily propounded in the common doctrine of the Church, for a warrant to pray for, and expect anything, if they should act their faith, and not give wayto doubting, then they should be able to do greater miracles then the blasting of the fig-tree was, even the greatest which they could imagine: so that if the Spirit of the Lord gave a word for removing of a mountain, (for examples cause) how impossible soever it might seem, yet should it come to passe, if they did put forth their Faith to act about it; and so also, whatsoever the Word of the Lord did warrant them to pray for, and to expect of him, they should obtain it, if they did pray in faith for it; and was not this lesson worth all the figs, which either this fig-tree or any other tree could bear? <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Our Lord was never so hungry for meat and drink, but he could forbear it til a

fit time, and make it his meat and drink to be doing good, and fulfilling the Fathers will: for he loveth to edifie, and feed his Disciples here, more then to feed his naturall hunger. 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit our Lord did never harme to any man by any of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, yet had he power to curse, and miraculously to destroy, as well as to save, if he had pleased to put forth his power in justice; for the fig-tree was not able to stand, when he did curse it. 3. He trained his Disciples by his own example unto all duties which he put them unto, and here he traineth them unto the exercise of the gift of miracles. 4. The gift of miracles was never to be exercised in particular, but upon a good ground of Faith, that is upon a warrant given from Christs Spirit, for doing that work in particular; and it was necessary for him who had the gift and the warrant for doing of a miracle, to strengthen his Faith on the warrant, or else to misse of his intent, as in Peters sinking did appear. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, saith he, <hi>If ye have faith and doubt not.</hi> 5.

That men will more readily acknowledg their fault in another mans person, then in their own; therfore doth Christ draw forth these mens judgment by a parable. 2. He wil have the conscience of the wicked, subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to the righteousnes of Gods judgment against themselves, as will appear by, <hi>What think ye?</hi> compared with their answer. 3. The most odious and despised sinners, repenting and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Jesus, do find Grace and Place both in the church, and in heaven above; but such as confide in their own righteousnes, are debarred, for, <hi>Harlots,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>go into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before you.</hi>

Remorse for not believing Gods word in his servants mouth, in time by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, is a speciall spur and preparative to beleeve it the more solidly for time to come; Therefore saith he, <hi>Ye repented not, that ye might beleeve him</hi>; that is, When you saw that the Publicans had out stripped you in the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, by beleeving Johns testimony of me, ye did not lament your unbelief, that you might give him so much the more credit for time to come, and so recover your loss by faith in me.</p>

From this parable, learn, 1. That the Lords care of his visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church, is comparable to the care which the most painfull husbandman hath of his vineyard; he leaves nothing undone which may make it fruitfull: he giveth wholesome ordinances of Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, erecteth governours, civil and Ecclesiastick, appointeth them (as his tenants) to presse the fruits of a holy conversation from his people; and when they are remisse, he stirreth up some speciall instruments, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prophets and Preachers, to stir up all, and to exact of all the fruit of his labour upon his people, as may be seen in his dealing with the Jewish church. 2. Ordinarily the Lord gets a bad meeting of his people, and specially of the rulers of the church, who look more each man unto his own case, honour, and gain, than to the holy conversation of people, and glory of God; as the example of the Jewish doctors here, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Lord's people sheweth. 3. When the body of church-rulers are corrupt, if any of their fellowes shall plead the Lords cause against them, these faithfull servants shall readily be persecuted, evill intreated, and killed for their paines, as in the example of the Jewish church is to be seen. 4. As men deal with God's servants, so would they doe with God himself, if he should come as a man to them, and put himselfe in their power, to try their affections unto him, as is evident in the Jewish rulers, who flew Christ the Son of God, God manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in the flesh. 5. When a people not only do bring forth no fruits of the Gospel, but also do persecute such as do stir them up unto their duties, it is righteousnesse with God to pour out his plagues upon them, and go away from them to some other people, as he dealt with the Jews after many provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                  <p>From 118.

The not considering and believing of the Scriptures, is the cause why many do fulfill things foretold in the Scripture to their own ruine and condemnation; therefore saith he, <hi>Did ye never read?</hi> 2. The gathering of the Church is compared to the building of a Temple, wherein the Ministers and Rulers <hi>are Builders.</hi> 3. It was prophesied that Christ should be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Church-men in his time, a Stone not worthy to have any room in the building, and therefore should be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and excommunicated by them; for it is written of Christ, <hi>The stone which the Builders refused.</hi> 4. How base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soever he was esteemed of by them, yet he was indeed the Ground-stone, the Strength and Glory of the Church; so should he be seen, and acknowledged to be, contrary to all opposition; for, <hi>This Stone is become the Head of the corner.</hi> 5. The Divine Power of God appeareth most evidently in the exaltation of Christ in his Church, beyond the expectation, and contrary to the hearts of all his enemies; therefore saith he, <hi>This is the Lords doing.</hi> 6. The work of God about his Church in setting up the Throne of Christ, is a most wonderfull matter in the eyes of all who have understanding; for, <hi>It is marvellous in our eyes,</hi> saith the Prophet.</p>

                  <p>Having threatned the whole Nation of the Jewes, now he threatneth all his enemies of every sort more specially, teaching us, 1.

The first sort shal not only not prevail against him, but as here is said, shal be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken also, either to their repentance, as <hi>Paul</hi> was; or to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as ignorant and misbeleeving adversaries are. 3. Such as are adversaries out of malice he will set himself against these, as here he saith, <hi>He will fall upon them</hi> with his weight and by his mighty power <hi>grind them to powder,</hi> that is, destroy them utterly by the highest degrees of punishment, and thus he telleth the chief Priests and Pharisees their own particular doom.</p>

                  <p>THe scope of this parable is to set forth the manner of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Gospel preached: some reject the offer alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, some not only reject the offer, but do abuse, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the church, and Preachers of the Gospel: some do joyn themselves in Truth into the fellowship of the Grace of God in Christ; and some do joyne themselves unto the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59775:131"/>
church in hypocrisie, being onely called externally, but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; all this is represented in a similitude of the marriage of the Kings son. In which parable or presupposed history, we are given to understand, 1. That communion and fellowship with Christ in all graces, in his church visible, dayly preached to the world, is like a feast, a marriage feast of the King's son, abounding in all meanes of life, and joy, and honour, ready prepared, and offered unto men liberally and freely to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on such as will receive the offer, as is described, <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4.2. The acceptance, which the offer of the grace of Christ in the Gospel receiveth at the hands of many men, is like the meeting which was given to the invitation to the Kings feast; for many made sight account of the offered favour; every man preferring his own naughty matters unto the Kings grace tendred unto them, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. and some not only reject the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but also persecute and kill the preachers, as <hi>ver.</hi> 6.3. The rejecters of the Gospel of Gods grace in Christ, offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in the gospel, and much more the persecutors of the Lords servants who make the offer, shall be served as these wicked and rebellious murderers were, that is, They shall be destroyed and perish in the just indignation of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 8.</hi> Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Go ye therfore into the high wayes, and as many as ye shal find, bid to the marriage.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. So those servants went out into the high-wayes, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together all, as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>From this part of the Parable, Learn, 1. Refuse the gospel who will, and oppose it who will, God shall not want a church; but shal have as many as he pleaseth, for the countenancing of his rich and free grace, and glorifying of Jesus Christ, some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in to the gospel in truth, <hi>good guests</hi>; some coming in to the church in hypocrisie, <hi>bad guests,</hi> and all by the Ministry of Christs servants, represented by the furnishing of guests to the Kings marriage feast.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 11.</hi> And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment? And he was speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.</p>

                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:59775:131"/>13. Then said the king to his servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into utter darknesse: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>From this part, Learn, 1. That such as joyne themselves to the church in hypocrisie, and have no care to honour God by a holy life, flowing from faith and love toward Jesus Christ, shall be remarked and observed so particularly, that if there were but one, he shall not escape, but shall be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and cast in hell, there to be tormented for ever, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the punishment of the man who came in to the feast, as a friend; <hi>but without a wedding garment,</hi> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out purpose or care to honour the marriage, or the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, by a holy life proceeding from faith and love toward Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 14.</hi> For many are called, but few are chosen.</q>
                  <p>The reason of this different manner of receiving the offer of the gospel is marked. <hi>Doct.</hi> The cause why some receive the grace of Christ offered in the Gospel, in a better manner then the multitude of others do, and do adorne the gospel by a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conversation, flowing from faith and love to Jesus Christ, as the multitude of others do not, is not in the men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but in the free grace and love of God electing some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grace and glory, and leaving others to answer for their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting given to this call; for, <hi>Many are called,</hi> saith he, <hi>but few are chosen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 15.</hi> Then went the Pharisees, and took counsell how they might intangle him in his talk.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. And they sent out unto him their disciples, with the Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the wayes of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardest not the person of men.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This is Christs ran counter with the disciples of the Pharisees and Herodians; they go about either to make him odious to the people, if he should allow tribute, or make him seem an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to Cesar, if he should disallow it: Hence learn, 1. The enemies of Christ will not rest till they perish, but will assay one mean after another to draw inconveniencies upon him, and his followers: for here again, <hi>They take counsel how to intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle him in his talk,</hi> that they may have advantage of his words. 2. How close soever Christs enemies shall carry their plot, he will bring it forth to light; these men will not appear themselves, but send out and suborn others less suspected; for, <hi>They sent out their
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59775:132"/>
Disciples with the Herodians,</hi> men of the Court-religion, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Herods way, who was half an Idumean, and halfe a Jew, men subtil and politick, and fit to take advantage of words, if any thing should have escaped Christ to the seeming prejudice of Cesar, or his deputies. 3. It is admirable how fair a shew bloody adversaries of Christ may make of their great respect to Religion, of their estimation of upright Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, of their desire to grow in knowledge, from the love of truth, and such like, and yet intend nothing but to intangle, insnare, betray, and destroy Christ and his servants; for who can speake or pretend fairer then these men, saying, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, we know that thou art true,</hi> &amp;c. 4. How benummed and feared with an hot iron is the conscience of hypocrites, who being convinced of the truth of a mans doctrine, and of his honesty and fidelity, yet will not only not believe him, but also seek to destroy him, as these men give evidence. 5. The properties of a faithfull preacher are, first, He is a true and upright man, whose heart, and words, and wayes do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; he teacheth not mens precepts and devises, nor his own dreams, <hi>but the wayes of God</hi>; secondly, He teacheth truth, in truth truly, for the right end, in sincerity, aiming to informe, and perswade men to imbrace truth; thirdly, His affections doe not make him wrest his commission, for fear or favour; fourthly, He careth not for the feare or favour of any man, so as to wrest the truth for any mans cause, but without partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or personal respects he delivereth the same truth equally unto all, <hi>not regarding the person of man.</hi>

                     <hi>Ver. 17</hi> Tell us therfore, What thinkest thou? is it lawfull to give tribute unto Cesar, or not?</q>

The conceiving of spirituall things in a fleshly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is the ground of mistaking the truth, and setting up of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and heresies, as appeareth in these Sadduces; they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the doctrine of eternall life to be this, That the course of this temporary life shall be renewed and made perpetuall. 2. No man seemeth wiser in his own eyes then the blindest here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks do; they conceive that Christ himself cannot answer their objections against the truth, and this imboldneth <hi>these Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to dispute.</hi>

                  <p>Our Lord having to do with a proud hypocrite, puffed up with a conceit of his own righteousnesse, doth so answer him, as he sayeth out the spirituall meaning of the Law, that the man might see how short he came in the obedience thereof, and so doth teach us, 1. That the commandements are not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except the obedience proceed from love, this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord.</hi> 2. The commands are not satisfied, except the whole man wholly in all things obey, with his whole mind, affections, and the strength
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59775:134"/>
of all the powers of soule and body; therefore, saith he, <hi>With all thy heart, soule, and mind.</hi> 3. To love God is the greatest command, because it is the Fountain of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all the commands; and also, because all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the first Table are but branches, and evidences in part of our love to God. 4. The great commandment is not fulfilled, except a man in the sense of his short coming in love to God, seek for reconciliation with him, enter in a covenant of grace with him, and make use of his friendship, as of a reconciled God; therefore, saith he, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.</hi> 5. The commandment of loving God with all our might, and adhering to him, as reconciled unto us, and made ours by covenant, is first to be looked unto, as being of greatest consequence; for, <hi>This is the first and great command, to love the Lord thy God.</hi>

                  <p>The Pharisees asked of one commandment, and our Lord in his answer, giveth two, comprehending all: this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called the second, because it is in the next room, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter immediate worship of God to be looked unto, and because it is the summe of the second Table. It is called <hi>like unto the first,</hi> because it hath the same authority, it requireth like spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and constant obedience as the first, and must be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the first, by such as would be found obedient unto the first; and herein the envy and malice of these Pharisees is tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who pretended to love God, and yet did hate the Saviour, his Son, and all peoples salvation, who must be saved onely by him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. So many as professe love to God, must set themselves to love their Neighbour also, at his command; for he cannot love God, who will not love his Neighbour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, saith he, <hi>The second is, Love thy Neighbour.</hi> 2.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59775:135"/>
the rule and measure of our love to our neighbour; the love of God must be preferred both to our selves and neighbour, so as we must not please our selves or our neighbour by displeasing God, but our love to God being fixed in the own place: then in reason, as we would have others to do unto us, do we also unto them: for, <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self,</hi> that is, Sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and constantly.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ver. 40.</hi> On these two commandements hang all the Law and the Prophets.</q>
                  <p>The Pharisee did move the question, concerning the greatest commandement in the Law, meaning the moral Law; Christ having answered, telling him, that he had not only satisfied the question concerning the greatest commandement of the moral Law, but also had given him the summe of the whole Law, yea not only so, but also had given him the summe and scope of the whole Books of Scripture, wherupon doth hang the whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets; <hi>On these two commandements</hi> saith he, <hi>hang all the Law and the Prophets</hi>; and so shall we find it to be, if we consider the matter: for the summe and scope of the Scriptures may be comprehended in these three: The first is, To shew us what duties the perfect Law of God requireth of us. The second is, To shew how being found short of our duties, and guilty of fearful transgressions of the Law, we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with God. The third is, To shew how and by what rule we shall walke before God in new obedience: Now all these three will befound in Christs answer, and in these two great commandements; for, 1. In these great commands, the duty of perfect love is first enjoyned; for it is said, <hi>Love God with all thy heart; and thy neighbour as thy selfe.</hi> 2. Upon our presupposed short-coming in our duty, the seeking unto the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of reconciliation is insinuate, and injoyned in these words [<hi>thy God</hi>] <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.</hi> 3. After the covenanting there is injoyned an indeavour of sincere set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto the obedience of the whole Law, with our heart, mind, and soul, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. and if the words be exponed thus, then indeed upon these two commands all the Doctrine of the Law and Prophets doth hang, as explications of them, and inducements, and directions unto the obedience of them.</p>

                     <p n="45">45. If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Our Lord thinketh it not sufficient, wisely to answer the tempting questions of his adversaries, but he will also ask que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of them, to put them to shame, and so to humble them, and withall will shew forth his own God-head spoken of in scripture, if possibly some of them might beleeve and be saved; and howsoever, that his own might be edified. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As it is good to be zealous of the Law, so it is necessary to know the Messiah, who redeemeth men from the curse of the Law: for our Lord having answered the Pharisees question about the Law, asketh them, <hi>What think ye of Christ?</hi> 2. Christ is a very man lineally descended of <hi>David</hi>; for he is <hi>David's Son,</hi> so say even the Pharisees. 3. Christ is also very God; for he is <hi>David's Lord,</hi> equal with the Father, <hi>The Lord said to my Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> 4. The son of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>David's</hi> Lord distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the Father; as one of the persons of the Godhead is but one person; for, <hi>David's God,</hi> and <hi>David's Son</hi> is here spoken of as one person. 5. Christ is Fellow-partner of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory with the Father, for, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand,</hi> saith the Father. 6. Christ shall not want enemies who shall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his kingdom; this is imported in, <hi>Thine enemies.</hi> 7. Christs enemies shal be put under his power; for it is said of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Till I make thine enemies thy foot-stool.</hi> 8. There is but one divine power of the Son and Father; for as the Son reigneth in majesty over his enemies, so the Father putteth them down also; for, Sit thou, till I put them down, is; <hi>Reign thou,</hi> till this be done. 9. None can conciliat the speeches in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning Christ, except he who beleeveth and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeth him to be God and Man in one person; for if <hi>David</hi> call him Lord, how is he his son? no answer, but he is both God and Man.</p>

                  <p>The issue of this disputation is set down, to teach us, 1. That all Christ's enemies will be beaten in disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and put to silence: the force of divine Truth prudently put forth, is irresistible; therefore it is said, <hi>No man was able

The people must be warned to beware of the contagion of corrupt Teachers, when they will not amend their doings: for this is the course which Christ taketh about the Pharisees and Scribes, 2. Albeit the faults of teachers must not be spared, yet their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and office must be guarded, lest the message of God by their mouth be marred, their office must be defended, albeit their persons be corrupt; Therefore saith he, <hi>They sit in Moses chair,</hi> that is, they succeed to <hi>Moses</hi> in the ordinary office of teaching the word of God. 3. What <hi>Moses</hi> successours teach, as <hi>Moses</hi> successours, must be obeyed; that is, The truth which from the warrant of Gods Word is recommended unto us, from corrupt teachers clad with lawfull authority to teach, we ought to obey it, because the message is the Doctrine of God; albeit the Messenger be corrupt; for it is said, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

they bid you do,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> successours, with <hi>Moses</hi> warrant, from the Lords mouth, <hi>That observe and do.</hi> 2. People are in danger to follow the example of the evil life of corrupt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, rather than the command of God delivered in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and therefore had need to be warned; for, saith he, <hi>After their works do not.</hi> 3. Whatsoever commanded works a man doth, and not for the commanded ends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, it is as good as no doing: Therefore, albeit the Pharisees did many works commanded in the Law, yet because they did them to be seen of men, and as works meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to oblige God, and were more carefull of the outward ceremonies of the Law, then to observe the morall duties of justice and mercy; therefore what they did, was counted as <hi>If they did not</hi>; and Christ saith of them, <hi>They say, and do not.</hi>

                  <p>The Lord giveth a reason of this caveat, given concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pharisees. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Doctrine of the Law morall and ceremoniall, separate from the true intent of it, which is to lead unto the Gospell, where grace and strength is to be had for righteousnesse and new obedience, is a yoke unsupportable, and here called, A <hi>heavie burden, and grievous to be borne</hi>; and therefore to presse morall duties on a people, without teaching them how to draw strength from Christ for obedience, is, <hi>To binde heavie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens on their shoulders.</hi> 2. Hypocrites do teach people most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periously, and with least compassion, contributing least of any men unto the inabling of the people unto obedience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by wisdome of doctrine, or example, or prayer; therefore saith Christ, <hi>They do not move them with their finger.</hi>

                  <p>In this lamentation, our Lord is not to shew what power is in mens wicked nature to convert themselves, or to make use of the means of conversion, nor what power there is in corrupt nature to oppose that power which God putteth forth in conversion of soules: neither is he lamenting their case, as one unable to obtain his own desired end in the salvation of such as he intended to save: for no reason can extract these conclusions necessarily from these speeches; &amp; the true sense of them is obtained without any such inferences; for our Lord, as man, and a kindly Minister of the circumcision, moved with humane compassion of the miseries of his native Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, letteth forth his love in this lamentation and weeping, while he beholdeth the desperate obstinacy of the multitude running to perdition, thereby intending to make the reprobate, who should hear of his tender bowels, inexcusable; and to move the Elect unto repentance by this means. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Our Lord, as man, in the bowels of compassion was moved in the dayes of his flesh, with the misery of the most wicked, as this lamentation sheweth. 2. When Christ was most moved with the provocations of the wicked, there was no sinfull perturbation in him, to make him forget to fulfill the law of love unto his most desperate enemies; therefore he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth thus, <hi>Ierusalem, Ierusalem.</hi> 3.

And thou wouldst not, but opposed my work so far as thou couldst, <hi>in slaying the Prophets, and stoning them who were sent unto thee,</hi> for the Elects cause who were in the midst of thee. 5. The Lord will pursue his purpose, and renew messages till he both gain his own, and also make the reprobate inexcusable to the ful; for how oft, saith he, <hi>Would I have gathered thy children, and ye would not.</hi>

                  <p>Here our Lord smiteth these desperate enemies with irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable blindnesse, that from that time forward, they should never get grace to acknowledge him to be the Messiah, till at the day of Judgement they should be forced to confesse him to be the true Christ, prophesied of in the 118. <hi>Psalm.

                  <p>The fifth temptation, or fifth sort of exercise, is, The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising of many false Teachers within the Church, who shall brangle the faith of the Godly, and deceive many. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Christians may be tempted to defection by their own Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, who ere people be aware, may make defection themselves, and then fall to reduce the people; for it is said, <hi>Many false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets shall arise.</hi> 2. This sort of temptation is ready to prevail with people, and to draw such away whom open persecution could not drive from the truth; for it is said, <hi>They shall deceive many</hi>; Because disputation and opposition against the Truth, (for which we are called to suffer) by our own Teachers, when they begin to swerve from the Truth, is a harder onset a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a man's faith, than when fire and sword is threatned, in the case of a cause clear, and not questioned by our Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>

                  <p>The sixth temptation, or sort of exercise, is, That the godly shall be cold-rise in love one toward another, and not finde respect and credit readily one of another, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they shall see iniquity and hypocrisie so abound in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, as one shall suspect another, and not dare to trust one another; and so shall not let forth their love one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another, save very coldly, as it cometh to passe in the case of mutuall suspicion one of another. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Honest men do suffer much in their estimation, when the hypocrisie of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites is discovered; for iniquity abounding, breedeth mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall suspicion of one anothers sincerity, a man not knowing whom to trust, when by out-breaking of much iniquity he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth many to be false. 2. When abounding iniquity breedeth mutuall jealousie, as estimation and confidence mutuall is weakened, so is mutuall love diminished; Therefore saith he, <hi>Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</hi> 3. This is a sore trial, when beside the common adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, the Godly do grow suspicious one of another, and dare not trust one another, and so do grow cold in their love to one another; it is a sore trial, I say, <hi>When iniquity aboundeth, and love decreaseth.</hi>

them to thinke that the Siege should be raised, or the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should escape, as it had done in former times; for God had destinate the City and the Temple at that time to be ruined, as the diligent Reader of <hi>Daniel</hi> might perceive. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

Lest the faithfull should still dote upon the ceremonies of the Law, and figurative shadowes, after the Messiah's coming, it was very needfull, that the City and Temple both, whereunto the sacrifices and chiefe ceremonies were astricted, should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed and abolished, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> hath foretold. 3.

When the Lord is to pour out his wrath on a place, if all circumstances being considered, a man shall find it both lawfull and possible to withdraw himselfe from that place, it is wisdome to be gone; for, <hi>Let them who be in Iudea, flee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mountains,</hi> is as much as, it shall be safer for them in this time, to see for their own life by flight, then to dream of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting or escaping Gods judgment in that place. 2. If the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment overtake a man so suddainly, as there is no time nor means given to escape, then let men lay by all thought of worldly goods, and bestow their minds and time on that which is most needfull, that is, for preparation unto death; Therefore saith he, <hi>He that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The doctrine of election doth not give warrant unto security, but should be made use of for diligence and watchfulness; therfore saith he, <hi>Behold, I have told you</hi>; for God hath decreed, as to save the Elect, so to save them by his own means. 3. This forewarning sheweth, that albeit the elect shal not bealtogether, and without recovery deceived, yet they may be so farr mistaken, as it had been good they had watched; much sin and misery may befal a man by not watching, albeit at length he may be brought forth of it; for, <hi>Behold, I have told you before,</hi> maketh the Lord free of what ill unwatchfulnesse may let in.</p>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59775:149"/>
and that both these signes, and the destruction of Jerusalem with the Temple, should all come to passe in the dayes of them that were then living, vers. 33, 34, and he forbiddeth them to doubt hereof, because his words were more firm then heaven or earth, vers. 35. And so much for the destruction of the Temple and the signes and time therof. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When we see some part of the truth of God come to passe in our sight, it should help us to beleeve, and expect the fulfilling of the rest: as, <hi>When we see the trees bud, we know that Summer is near.</hi> 2. It is hard to our misbeleeving hearts to give that credit to Christs words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are worthy: but by so much more is our Lords love to us, and care of us to be praised and admired, that he by so many meanes goeth about to confirm and perswade us; therfore saith he, <hi>Verily I say unto you,</hi> &amp;c. 3.

                  <p>Our Lord draweth this doctrine unto use, to stir us up unto watchfulness, and to this end he setteth before us seven motives: the first motive is, There is no small hazard in case men be
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59775:149"/>
sound secure and not watching when Christ cometh, therefore watchfulnesse is necessary. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is safer to make ready for the day of judgment, and to watch lest we be surprised, then to be curious to know the particular time of it; for <hi>As, the dayes of Noah were,</hi> &amp;c. 2. As the old world did not beleeve judgement coming, albeit forewarned by Noah, that it was coming, so fares <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> with the world, and will be so with the multitude of the world, till the day of judgment; for, <hi>As in the dayes of Noah.</hi> 3. When men beleeve not things concerning the day of judgement and another life, no wonder they be given over unto, and drowned in the matters of this life; for, <hi>They were eating,</hi> &amp;c. that is, This and the like was al their care. 4. Whatsoever truth men do not beleeve when it is told them, that they do not rightly know, though they conceive the meaning of the word told them; for it is said, <hi>They knew not.</hi> 5. Who so beleeve not judgment when it is threatned, shall feele judgement and be taken away with it, when it cometh; for, <hi>The flood came and tooke them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>

                     <hi>Ver. 42.</hi> Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.</q>
                  <p>The third motive teaching us, That the Lord hath of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose kept from our knowledge the time when Christ shall come; Therfore all should watch and be ready, come when he will.</p>
                  <q>

                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:59775:150"/>The fourth motive, Set down in an example, teaching us in sense thus much, if men will watch for avoiding of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall inconveniencies, much more should Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples watch to eschew eternall destruction: and if they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ines in the Parable, so in the visible Church, onely these are wise, who with the outward Lamps of open profession, labour to be furnished inwardly, with the saving graces of the holy Spirit: namely, Faith working by love, and repentance mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying their sinfull lusts, that in newnesse of life they may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God: But whoso are destitute of inward grace in their heart, they are foolish: for the Lamps of their outward profession, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oyle, do serve to no purpose, when matters come to a triall. 5. As in the Parable, the Bridegroom cometh when they are not aware; So will Christ come unto Judgment in a day and hour that men know not. 6. As in the Parable the wise are admitted,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59775:152"/>
and the foolish excluded; So they who are inwardly renewed, and indued with the saving graces of the holy Spirit, shall be taken up to heaven; and they who are destitute of the oyle of the holy Spirit, void of true faith, and of the renewing vertue of Gods Grace shall be excluded. 7. As in the parable the wise could not help the foolish, nor the foolish hurt the wise; So the society of the hypocrites with the godly in the visible church, shall not be prejudiciall to the sound christians in the day of Gods judgment; not yet the society of the godly avail the hypocrites, among whom they have lived, but every man shall be judged according to that which is within him. 8. As in the parable the self-conceit of the Virgins, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not them; so the opinion which unrenewed persons within the visible church have of their interest in Christ, their vain confidence and foolish hopes grounded upon the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and their formal practises of externall duties, will not avail them before the Lord, at that day. 9. To be watchfull now, and to examine well our own case, and to see that we be sure of the inward anointing of the holy Spirit, whereby we are made indeed holy, is the only way to be certain of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation when Christ cometh to judgement; for this use Christ commandeth us to make of the parable; saying, <hi>Watch ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>

                  <p>Another parable tending to put all men on work, and in speciall the Ministers of the Gospel, for setting forth the glory of Christ, and of his Kingdome among men, according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man's ability and calling, under the similitude of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, giving to his servants mony to trade withall, for his use. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the man in the parable travelling into a far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, disposed of his affaires, and ordered all matters till his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; So hath our Lord Jesus given exact order in his Word to all men, and specially to his Ministers, how his house shall be governed, and how every man should serve him, till his second coming again. 2. As the master in the parable giveth not the same number of talents to each servant: So the Lord
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59775:153"/>
So the Lord giveth not a like measure of gifts to every one, but to some more, to some lesse, as his heavenly Wisdom thinketh expedient. 3. As in the parable, some made use of their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, some not: So in the visible church, some imploy the gifts they have, according to their calling, to the edifying of others, and promoving of the Kingdome of Christ, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some do misregard the Kingdome of Christ, and care not how it go with Christs matters, if their own particular go right: and therefore they make no conscience to promove Christs Kingdome in their vocation, as their duty set down in his word doth require. 4. As the master in the parable reckoned with his servants, and took an account of each mans fidelity, so shall Christ call all men, and especially Ministers to account one day, and shall search how faithfull every man hath been in his service. 5. As in the parable the faithfull servant, whether his talents were fewer or more, was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his Master, and made partaker of his joy; So every man (who in the discharge of his calling, doth seek faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the glory of Christ, and increase of his Kingdome) shall be accepted in the day of judgement, and put in ful possession of eternall life. 6. As before the Master in the parable, so also before Christ in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no excuse shall serve, to save the slothfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull servant (let a man deceive himselfe now as he list, and please himselfe with pretences as he will) all excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses shall be retorted, and made matter of his condemnation, and the unfaithfull servant shall be cast in hell. 7. As in the parable, he who had one talent, but had it not for his Masters use, is counted as if he had none, and is deprived of the possession of what he possessed, but not for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters use; So whosoever hath gifts whereby others are not profited, or Christs kingdome not promoved, what he hath is counted as if he had it not: or as if he had lost it, or put it away; and as others were not profited by his gift, so neither shall he himself be profited by it; but he that useth his gifts wel for the glory of Christ, shall be amply rewarded; the reason wherof he giveth; for, <hi>Unto every man that hath</hi> gifts, so as he hath them for his Masters use, (which is in effect to have them) <hi>It shall be given,</hi> he shall have increase of gifts, and graces, and rewards; but such as have not what they have, for the Lord's service, shall be deprived of all good which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves might have of such gifts, and shall be utterly deprived

The man who is sensible of his cleansing by Christ, will love him all his life long after; as <hi>Simon the leper</hi> here receiveth, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth Christ and his Disciples. 3. When our by-past in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities may glorifie Christ, it is no shame to bear the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials thereof; for here the Evangelist calleth him Simon <hi>the leper,</hi> though now <hi>whole.</hi> 4.

                  <p>The doctrine of the covenant of grace, being delivered by our Lord, and confirmed abundantly by miracles, the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper followeth, for sealing up of this covenant unto the believer; and to this intent menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of Christs last eating of the Sacrament of the Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, unto which was subjoyned the institution &amp; celebration of the Sacramental Supper; for the clearing of some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whereof, and of the duty of preparation for right receiving of it, that which is here spoken of the Passeover, doth give light, <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

                     <hi>Ver. 20.</hi> Now when the even was come, he sate down with the twelve.</q>
                  <p>For clearing of the history of the Lords Supper, which was instituted at the close of the Passeover, we have here set down the circumstances of eating of the Passeover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as time, place, and persons; whereby we have ground to conceive that <hi>Iudas</hi> was present at the Sacrament of the Passeover, he being one of the twelve: for first, seeing there is no question made, that as <hi>Iudas</hi> was imployed in the Apostleship with the rest, so he was admitted also with the rest unto the fellowship of all Worship and Divine Ordinances, and was present at so many former feasts of the Passeover as Christ did keep with his Disciples; there can be no inconvenience to suppose him present at the Passeover at this time also. Secondly, seeing whatsoever is said by Historiographers, concerning a common Supper, before the sacrament to be observed by the Jews (a people too much given to their own inventions, and the traditions of Elders) it is safe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t for us to thinke that Christ did keep the Law of the Passeover, as was written, <hi>Exodus</hi> 12. wherein was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a whole Lambe, with unleavened bread (not prescribing how much) and soure or bitter herbes for a sauce-drink being presupposed and included, as naturally necessary, to make the Passover to be a Supper, and an holy Feast; all which making up sufficient store of meat, to be a meal to so many men, and to furnish a sop to <hi>Iudas</hi> ere he went forth, and Elements also unto the new Sacrament, after he was gone; there is no ground to make us conceive, that there was a common Supper prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Passover; but when we find <hi>Iudas</hi> to be eating with the rest, after their down-sitting to the Passover, we have good ground to think that <hi>Iudas</hi> was partaker of the Passeover Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Thirdly, seeing the Evangelist expresly saith, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. that they made ready the Passeover, and <hi>verse</hi> 20. that Christ when the even was come, sate down with the twelve, to wit, to eat the Passover, and <hi>ver.</hi> 21. That as they, that is, Christ with the twelve, <hi>were eating,</hi> he said to them, one of you shall betray me; we may without any scruple conclude, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was present at
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59775:159"/>
the Passover, and so much the more as we find, that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists hereafter do number only eleven Disciples, untill the time that <hi>Matthias,</hi> who used alwayes to be present with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles was chosen to supply the room of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and to make up again the number of twelve, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.26. In regard of whom the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> had just ground to say, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. that Christ was seen of the twelve, because <hi>Act.</hi> 1, 21.22. <hi>Matthias</hi> being present alwayes with the twelve, and so at this apparition, and reckoned with the eleven in <hi>Iudas</hi> room, doth make the number compleat. This being presupposed, we learn. 1. That neither is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the worse, nor are the communicants polluted, albeit an undiscovered hypocrite be in company with them at the Lords Table; for <hi>Iudas</hi> was one of the twelve, with whom Christ sate down to eat the Passeover, and neither the ordinance, nor the rest of the Apostles were tainted with <hi>Iudas</hi> his fault, the pollution of the Sacrament was in <hi>Iudas</hi> only, and remained with him alone. 2. The Lord will not discover hypocritees, till they by their own deeds discover themselves, but wil suffer them to lurk among the Saints, till his own time come, as here he suffereth <hi>Iudas</hi> to lurk and to eat the Passeover. 3. Social sitting at table is a very sit posture for a religious Feast, for here Christ and his Disciples sit down at table together to eat the Passover.</p>

                  <p>Our Lord forwarneth the Disciples that he was to be betra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of them, and putteth each man to try themselves. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is possible that a man may come to the Lords table the one day, and betray him shortly after; the like fell out in Christs own Apostles, <hi>One of you,</hi> saith he, <hi>shal betray me..</hi> 2. The possibility that a communicant may become a Traitour, should put all men to search themselves, as here the Apostles are put to it, saying, <hi>Is it I?</hi> 3. Sincerety and charity wil make men search and suspect themselves rather than another, as here the Apostles say not, <hi>Is it Iudas?</hi> but, <hi>Is it I?</hi> 4. The sincere man dares not trust the deceitfulness of his own heart, but bringeth it to the Searcher therof, and relieth upon his testimony, as here the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles do, saying to Christ, <hi>Is it I?</hi>

                  <p>Now followeth a more particular relation of the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the whole Doctrine
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59775:160"/>
whereof is not to be found in any of the Evangelists or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but to be collected out of all, each contributing their part to expresse the full meaning of the Lords Spirit in this matter. Here we take up onely that which <hi>Matthew</hi> saith; and first we observe, that the celebration of the first Sacramental Supper of the Lord, was joyned in one continued supperly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Sacrament of the passeover; our Lord herein declaring the old church and new to be one in him, and the Sacraments of both, to have himself for their signification, for the Sacrament began, as <hi>They were eating,</hi> that is, sitting s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill at table, and the Supper not closed. 2. For the nature of the action, it is required there be a Table prepared, and Elements ready to be made use of: For the first Supper which is our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, was celebrated at the same Table whereat the Passeover was celebrated, wherupon there were yet remaining Elements for eating, for this much is imported in, <hi>As they were eating.</hi> 3. It is requisite also, that the Minister of the Gospel and his stock, so many of them as may communicate together at one Table at once, be assembled together, and joyntly set down together, for celebration of this holy Feast; for so was it in the patern, <hi>As they were eating, they,</hi> that is, Christ as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and his disciples as the flock. 4. The fittest posture of the Communicants in the action of this holy Feasting, is social sitting together at the Lords Table; for this was the behaviour of the first communicants, the Lord began to give the Sacrament <hi>As they were eating,</hi> that is, as they yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued sitting together socially at the Table, materials fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The part of the Minister is to take the Elements, and by the word of Institution and Prayer to sanctifie, separate and appoint them for this holy and sacramental use, so much of them and in so far as they, shall be imployed by the communicants; for, <hi>Christ blessed the bread, blessed the cup,</hi> and <hi>gave tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>s to the Father.</hi> 7. The part of the Minister also is to break the bread, and give it unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the Communicants, with a command unto them in common, or in the plural number, to take the bread, and eat it; for Christ brake the bread, and gave it to his disciples, saying, <hi>Take ye, eat ye.</hi> 8. It is the part of the Minister to expo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e and declare with authority in the Lords Name, what this Bread thus blessed, thus broken, thus given and taken, doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59775:160"/>
exhibit and seal up by Christs appointment, unto the beleeving communicant; to wit, that <hi>This bread is Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> which speech is not to be understood physically nor mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously, but judicially; that is to say, in the sense that civil judgement maketh the instruments of security of any thing, to be called by the name of it, and holden in law for it; and therfore as the instrumental elements wherby men are infeoff'd in any house or land, or rent, being orderly given and taken, are by the appointment of mens law, the very house, or land, or rent, really, and truly in law made sure to the receiver, for all lawfull and profitable effects, before the Barre of civil Justice: so this bread thus given, and thus taken, is by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and appointment of divine Ordinance, in a judicial sense, the very body of Christ suffering, judicially and truly, or really in divine Law made sure to the receiver for all profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects before the Bar of divine Justice; and as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Elements of seising a man in a house, or land, or rent (such as are, for example cause, a piece of earth, or a stone, or a staffe, or a penny) orderly given and taken, do signifie, exhibit, and confirme in law a mans right and title unto such a house, or land, or rent more strongly, then if a man did take the house or land physically in his armes, if it were possible. So this bread by Divine Ordinance, doth signifie, exhibit, and and confirme the Beleevers right and title unto Christs body, as suffering for the beleevers redemption, more certainly and surely, then if Christs body suffering were physically imbraced by him in his armes, if it were possible: and therefore, as the instrumental elements of civill inseoffment, in the termes of humane ordinance, and institution, are rightly called by the name of the lands disponed, so the Sacramentall element of bread is rightly called <hi>Christs body,</hi> disponed in the termes of Divine Ordinance and institution, which appointeth hereby right to be given unto us unto Christs body, as suffering for our redemption. 9. To assure us of ful satisfaction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat furniture for eternall life, Christ our Lord hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken bread in the Sacrament, but also hath instituted a cup, that is, both meat and drink, for certifying us, that we shall have compleat nourishment in him, commanding the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Beleevers, or communicants, in the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to drink therof; for, He also <hi>took the cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye al of it.</hi> 10. As it is necessary, that the people receive the sacramental bread with the exposition and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59775:161"/>
declaration in the Lords Name, of what it giveth them right unto by Divine Institution, so it is also necessary, that the people receive all of them the Sacramentall Cup, with declaration of what it giveth them right unto by Christ's Ordinance; for this cup, or wine in the cup, <hi>is my blood,</hi> saith the Lord, to wit, Appointed of me judicially to make you truely or really sure of your right unto my death and the blood shed, and unto all benefits bought thereof. 11. There is a Covenant of Redemption past between the Father and Mediatour Christ, wherein Christ was bound to lay down his life, by the shedding of his blood to purchase to the Redeemed remission of sins: This is impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ted in the words of, <hi>The blood of the Covenant for the remission of sins</hi>; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Son had before promised to pour out his blood for purchasing remission, and the Father had granted remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon this condition. 12. Christ did make his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before his death, and left remission of sins in legacy to his redeemed people, namely, to believing Communicants. This is imported in the words of a <hi>Testament, for remission of sins.</hi> 13. Christ did make his Testament two wayes, one in typicall promises under the Law, before he came in the flesh: and so also in types and figures he died, as it were, and was the Lamb slain from the beginning of the World: Again, He made his Testament after his Incarnation in plain and clear terms, after which he fulfilled the types of his death, and actually laid down his life for his Redeemed People: This is imported in the words, <hi>New Testament is my blood shed,</hi> Presupposing an Old Testament in the blood of typicall lambs, and other sacrifices. 14. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to this two-fold manner of making of a Testament, there was also a two-fold manner of making of a Covenant of Grace, between God and the Church, in her head Christ; one called, <hi>An Old Covenant,</hi> before he came, of typicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, painfull and chargeable rites, and harder conditions to the externall Beholder; another after his Incarnation, called, <hi>A New Covenant</hi> of better promises, and more comfortable conditions, because now the dimnesse of the shadow is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the yoke of the ceremonies is broken, and the substance of the covenant is more clearly seen, and this is imported in the word of new <hi>Covenant</hi>; for the word in the original, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>Testament,</hi> signifieth also <hi>Covenant,</hi> and is indifferently used for either; for the Testament and Covenant, is much of the same

The second reason, Except you watch and pray, you may readily come under the power of temptation, Therfore watch and pray, lest you enter into, or begin to come under the power of temptation.

Seeing we have no strength of our own to overcome temptations, the only way to prevail, is to watch, and pray to God for assistance; therefore Christ saith, <hi>Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</hi> 3. Seeing the godly are in great part flesh and unrenewed, and so are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily insnared by temptations, the spirit and renewed part hath so much more need of the help of spiritual exercises; for therfore Christ bids them watch and pray upon this reason, that howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>spirit be willing, yet the flesh is weak.</hi>

Present sufferings do blind worldly mens eyes so, as they can neither see the glory of the Saints by-gone, nor to come; for all Christ's Miracles and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his being the Saviour of others, are counted nothing of now, by these Wretches, because of his sufferings; and yet in these sufferings, Christ was doing the part of a Saviour, more than in any of his miracles: for not his miracles, but his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, are the price of our redemption. 3. The most vile and wicked reprobates will offer to believe, upon such conditions as they themselves shall prescribe unto God, as here these men do; but they who wil not believe upon the grounds of Faith, offered unto them, shall not have any such grounds as they would be at, <hi>Come down from the Crosse,</hi> say they, <hi>and we will believe him</hi>: but Christ will not come down, till he satisfie justice for us. 4.

The point of truth, which the divell and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate men can least endure, is the Doctrine of the God-head of Christ, which is the Rock whereupon the Elect are builded; Therefore, say they, <hi>He said, I am the Son of God.</hi> This point among all did gall them most.</p>

estimation and love, and could no more be loosed from the incomprehensible-fervent love of God, then the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall Union of the Divine and humane Nature could be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved; yet was it necessary, that it should suffer the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our sins, and feel the effects of the wrath and curse of God due to us for sin, in as high a degree and measure, as should be equivalent to our perpetuall destruction, and be found satisfactory to Divine Justice for us: and therefore, albeit it was impossible that the humane nature could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, <hi>in regard of Gods love,</hi> or <hi>of sustaining strength,</hi> or in regard of <hi>inherent Holinesse,</hi> or any other thing else necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily joyned with the stability of the Hypostaticall Union, yet in regard of <hi>sensible consolation,</hi> it was not onely possible, but also necessary, that for a time it should be deserted, and should taste of horrible bitternesse, and accompanying such a deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this sort of torment and anguish of Spirit could as well consist with the personall Union, as the Pain and Torment of Body could consist with it: yea, as the Personall Union gave way to his death, and remained fast till the time of the sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His Soul and body, so did it also give way to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall affliction of his humane Spirit, and to this desertion in regard of <hi>Felt comfort,</hi> and yet remained constantly fixed, and unmoveable notwithstanding; and if any should doubt how Christ his perswasion of the union of the two Natures, and of the necessity and profitablenesse of his sufferings could stand with this expression, let us consider, that no perswasion of whatsoever truth can make holy Nature senslesse of what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of it, nor hinder it to expresse how it is naturally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and what it naturally feeleth; and as perswasion of the necessity and profitableness of the searing of a bleeding wound with a hot iron, cannot hinder nature to be sensible of the pain, or to crie out in the sense thereof; so no knowledge or perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Personall Union of the two Natures in Christ, or certainty of the necessity and profitablenesse of his sufferings could reasonably hinder such an expression as this, wherein perswasion of love, and union with God, crieth, <hi>My God, my God</hi>; and holy nature, filled with the sense of wrath, due to our sins, and destitute of all comfortable feeling of Gods presence for the time, crieth forth, <hi>Why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> not by way of quarelling, but by way of admiring the terriblenesse, and abhorring the bitternesse of Divine Wrath now felt, to be far surpassing all humane apprehension, which could precede

the feeling of it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Christ our surety, beside all the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings which he suffered in his body, did suffer also sorrow, grief, anguish, torment, and desertion, in regard of comfort in his soul; for this and other expressions prove so much. 2.

That his death was the fulfilling, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of all the Levitical rites and figures of the temple, and of all the ceremonies annexed unto it, and that now they were to be esteemed as rent, and to be done away. 2. That now by the Gospel sealed up in his death, the way unto heaven was made plain and open. 3. That the partition wall between Jew and Gentiles, to wit, The ceremonial Law, which divided them asunder, was rent, and no more to stand in force.</p>
                  <p>The second wonder, is, <hi>The earth did quake</hi>: wherby the Lord gave men to understand, 1. That as he is Lord of heaven, which had given testimony unto him, by hiding its glory, when he is suffering shame; so also he is Lord of the earth, which now doth tremble before her Lord. 2. That he was to shake the heavens and the Earth by the gospel of his sufferings, and of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purchased unto sinners by his sufferings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:59775:178"/>The third wonder, is, <hi>The rocks rent,</hi> to shew the power of Jesus, who could subdue the greatest difficulties, and overcome the hardnesse of whatsoever obstinate hearts, upon whom he pleaseth to shew his power.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 52.</hi> And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the Saints which slept, arose,</p>
                     <p n="53">53. And came out of their graves after his Resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The fourth wonder, is, <hi>The opening of the graves, and the resurrection of many deceased Saints after Christ's resurrection.</hi> which was done, 1. To shew that Christ died and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, not to remain under the great power of death and the grave, but to quicken the dead, and to raise them out of their graves; and that he neither died nor rose for his own particular, but that he might redeem his own from death, and give unto them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and life. 2. To let us understand that he is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of all those that believed in him before his Incarnation, and were deceased, who were to be saved by the Messiah, no lesse then of those who believed since; and that the former are partakers of the fruit of his death and resurrection, no lesse then the later. 3. The death of the godly is only a sleep of the body, till the morning of the Resurrection come; for it is said, <hi>The bodies of the Saints which slept.</hi> 4. Resurrection, and the rest of the effects of Christ's death and resurrection, are benefits only unto the Saints, therefore only <hi>the bodies of the Saints arose.</hi> 5. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the great Harvest of Christ's death and resurrection is not to be expected till the day of judgement, yet the first fruits of that Harvest are abundantly manifested, <hi>In that many of the bodies of the Saints arose.</hi> 6. The resurrection of the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon the resurrection of Christ, who is their Head; for, <hi>He is the first born from the dead</hi>; The rest who arose unto an immortall life, came out <hi>of their graves after his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> 7. The wonders which our Lord did worke, were all able to abide the light, and wanted not sufficient witnesses; for among the rest, these Saints which were raised out of their graves, <hi>came into Ierusalem, and appeared unto many.</hi> 8. Such as did not believe in Jesus, and did not belong unto his election, were not worthy to be called to be witnesses of the blessing following upon his death and resurrection: it is sufficient that these Saints raised from death, did <hi>appear to many</hi>; for they which believe in any measure shall have confirmation abundant, that they may believe still
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59775:179"/>
more; unto them that have, it shall be given, others are worthy to be despised. 9. Albeit a visible Church be very corrupt, yet so long as there is a number of true believers in it, so long as it hath not gotten a bill of divorcement from God, it is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed of honourably, as a Church belonging unto Christ; Therefore is Jerusalem here called, <hi>The holy City.</hi>

                     <hi>Ver. 54.</hi> Now when the Centurion, and they that were with him, watching Iesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truely, this was the Son of God.</q>
                  <p>These wonders wanted not their effects; for the Captain of the Guard, and the Souldiers which were with him, were convinced by these wonders, that truely Christ was the Son of God. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lords works as well as his word, do the errand for which they are sent; for when the wonders were seen, the Souldiers were afraid, and confessed the Deity of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, saying, <hi>Truly, this was the Son of God.</hi> 2. Profane Souldiers are more easily gained unto Christ, then misbelieving Rabbies, for we hear thus much of the one, but nothing of the other, that they were any whit moved. 3. Christ's love is such, that when sinners are doing him all the dishonour they can, he will reveale himselfe unto them, and overcome them with free love: for here is a Centurion, and other Souldiers with him, turned Subjects to him, and confessours of his Name: even when he is hanging dead on the crosse, life springeth forth of him to open the eyes of these Souldiers to see his God-head, and giveth them courage to confesse it in his deepest humiliation.</p>

                  <p>When the Disciples were fled except John, It is observed here, that many women waited on, and were witnesses of Christs Death. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is usuall with the Lord, to shew his power and grace most upon the weak and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised; for here he giveth strength and courage to women to attend his sufferings, when men had failed. 2. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever grace the Lord bestoweth upon his own, it is so bestowed, as their weaknesse in themselves doth usually appear also; for these women attend, <hi>But for fear, they behold afar off.</hi> 3. The power of faith in Christ, and love to him is such, that
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59775:179"/>
it will make these that are weakest in the midst of fear and infirmities, to spare no travell nor expences, but to hazard, if need be, their life for him; <hi>Many, even women, were there,</hi> who <hi>had followed Iesus from Galilee, ministring unto him.</hi> 4. So acceptable unto Christ are the evidences of Believers love, that he will subject himselfe to the standing in need thereof, and will receive the fruit of their love, and cause to register it for the parties honour, and others edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; as here he causeth to write down, that these women <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred unto him of their means,</hi> followed him <hi>out of Galilee,</hi> and attended <hi>on him at his death</hi>; The name of some of whom he causeth to be set down, to let us see, that none of them, nor such as they, are forgotten.</p>

                     <p n="58">58. he went to Pilate, and begged the body of Iesus: then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</p>
                     <p n="59">59. And when Ioseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linnen cloth,</p>
                     <p n="60">60. And laid it in his own tomb, which he had hewn out in the Rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the Sepulchre, and departed.</p>

                     </gap>ies, to the end: Our Lord being dead, it was expedient that he should be buried, 1. That the type of Jonah, and other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in Scripture should be fulfilled. 2. That the truth of his death might be known. 3. That his buriall might be as a step lower in humiliation, so also a mid passage unto a more glorious resurrection. 4. That he might sanctifie our burials, and by following death, as it were, to its den, make a way through the grave unto our resurrection, and full victory over death and the grave. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When shame and sufferings are ended, some degrees of glory do begin, as God provideth here for an honourable buriall unto Christ, after the shame of the crosse is past. 2. Grace maketh no difference of rich or poor, but san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth riches and poverty to his own; for, <hi>Ioseph of Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea is a rich man, and a Disciple of Iesus also.</hi> 3. Love to Christ feareth no inconveniences, neither thinketh shame of any service unto Christ, for <hi>Ioseph</hi> goeth <hi>boldly unto Pilate,</hi>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:59775:180"/>
and professeth it a favour to have liberty to take care of Christs crucified body. 4. Christ both in life and death was a friend to magistracy, he will have justice satisfied, and order kept in his taking down from the crosse, no lesse then in his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, he will be taken down at Pilates command. 5. God provided for Christs buriall so, as it should be known, that he verily arose; for he is put in <hi>A new Tombe, hewen out of a rock,</hi> wherein <hi>never man did lie</hi> before him. 6. As persons are more zealous for Christ, so are they more particularly taken notice of by God; Therefore these women which did attend him so carefully, are specially spoken of. 7. Love will never shed with Christ, in what condition soever he be, and will bestow on him what it may; as these holy women do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow looks upon the place he is put into, when they can do no more.</p>

                        <hi>Vers. 62.</hi> Now the next day that followed the day of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, the chiefe Priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three dayes I will rise again.</p>

                     <p n="65">65. Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch, go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</p>
                     <p n="66">66. So they went and made the sepulchre sure, sealing a stone, and setting a watch.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>To make the matter of our Lords buriall and resurrection yet more cleare, Divine providence makes use of the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries malice; they think to keep Christ under, and to provide against his resurrection, by setting a guard about the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polchre, <hi>and sealing of the stone. Doct.</hi> 1. Christs enemies are vexed about him, how to suppresse him, as here is to be seen; while he is alive, and while he is dead they can never be secure enough, for fear he shall overcome them: when they have him dead, they know not how to make <hi>the sepulcher sure.</hi> 2. They make of his words, and of his servants words, as best serveth their purpose; for when hee told them that though they destroyed the Temple of his body, yet hee would raise it again the third day, they passed by his meaning, and made it a matter of his ditty; and now they take up his meaning and 
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59775:180"/>make advantage of it against him. 3. When Christ and his cause is brought low, every wicked man wil speak as he pleaseth, as here they call the God of truth, <hi>A deceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hypocrites do respect religion, only for their own ends, and as it may serve their turn: They pretended to have great respect to the sabbath, that they may have Christ shortly out of the way; and now they stand not to pollute the sabbath, by making a business to secure his sepulchre. 5. Magistrates are in a dangerous condition when the rulers of the church are enemies to Christ, they will ever be insnaring them in some one thing or other against Christ, as here Pilat is used. 6. He that sets not God before his eyes, but is given to please men, will prove a slave to every mans affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; such a man is Pilat, who granteth whatsoever Christs ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies doe require. 7. Whatsoever power of craftinesse can work for obscuring of Christs glory, his enemies will go about it carefully, albeit with ill successe; as here, <hi>They seal the grave-stone, and set a watch,</hi> thinking to keep Christ fast in the tomb.</p>

and trembling, such as here is to be seen in these Women, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving believed the glad tidings, <hi>They run quickly with fear and joy, and bring the Disciples word.</hi>

Joyfull is the meeting which a Soul hath with Christ, as here, Christ biddeth hese women, <hi>All bail,</hi> or rejoyce, and they <hi>Lay hold on him,</hi> and <hi>worship him.</hi> 3. An hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinner may be homely with Christ, as these Women <hi>Fall down, and worship him, and hold him by the feet.</hi> 4. Such as believe Gods Word in the mouth of his Messengers, shall find confirmation of it by Christ himselfe; for here the Lord bids them do the same things, which the Angel had commanded before, <hi>To carry news to the Apostles.</hi> 5. For all that can be said unto us, our Faith is still mixed with some doubtings, which breedeth fear, and Christ only can remove them; therfore saith he here, <hi>Be not affraid.</hi> 6. The weakest of believers are much beloved and esteemed of by Christ: Oh how high love and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is this, <hi>Go tell my Brethren.</hi> 7. The place wherein Christ is most welcome to preach, shall be most honoured by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; as here, <hi>in Galilee,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall they see me.</hi> 8. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Lord be purposed to give sensible satisfaction to his people in due time, yet doth he ever require some beliefe of his Word in the mouth of his Servants, and some obedience of Faith to go before it; Therefore saith he, <hi>Tell them that they go to Galilee,</hi> and addeth, <hi>There shall they see me.</hi>

                     <hi>Ver. 11.</hi> Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chiefe Priests all the things that were done.</q>
                  <p>The Watch set by the Priests to guard the Sepulchre, come, and tell the Priests how Christ is risen. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of Christs Resurrection were not only Angels and holy
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:59775:183"/>
men and women, but also the prophane souldiers, who were set to watch his Sepulchre; for, <hi>The watch came, and shewed the things that were done.</hi> 2. The Lord not only wil disappoint his enemies, but also triumph over them; for the watch whom the Priests sent out to obscure his glory, came back to the city, <hi>and shewed these things to the chief Priests.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Verse 12.</hi> And when they were assembled with the Elders, and had taken counsell, they gave large money unto the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</q>
                  <p>When they know that he is risen, and so behoved to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he was the Son of God, powerfully manifested by resurrection from the dead, they resolve to bear down the truth. <hi>Doc.</hi> 1. Christs malicious enemies are of the divels nature, they will never cease to oppose him, though they know him to be the Son of God: as appeareth in these chief Priests and Elders. 2. The madnesse of malicious adversaries of the Gospel, and the slavery of Satans captives, is wonderfull, as here is seen; for after they are assembled, they resolve to corrupt the witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against the light of their conscience. 3. Money is a great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll in the world, when the Priests and elders think it may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-balance the most precious Truth, and are confident for gain to make the souldiers make a lie against the resurrection of the known Messiah. 4. The more men be ingaged in a sin, they are the more forward to go on in it, and will spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e no cost to gain their point; for, These Priests and Elders gave but thirty pieces of silver to have Christ crucified, but here they gave <hi>large money</hi> to keep down the report of his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 13.</hi> Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. And if this come to the governours cares, we will perswade him, and secure you.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Iews untill this day.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>They devise a lie, and do hire the souldiers to vent it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Calumnies and lies devised by Christs adversaries, are the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Engine which they use against the gospel; when al other devises do fail, they make service to Satan by this means; such is this lie here. 2. They who are entred in service of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly masters, can hardly win out, still new and worse imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is furnished unto them; as these godlesse souldiers are
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59775:183"/>
set on, from step to step in this ungodly course of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Christ. 3. The wicked care not what shame they do put upon themselves, and one upon another, to gain their point, in case they cannot come to their purpose another way; as these men are put to say, that they slept when they should have watched, (which was a disgrace and a capitall fault) that they might make out their devise against Christ. 4. Such as do tempt unto sin, labour to make the sinner secure from worldly inconveniences, but cannot secure them against Gods Justice: as the Priests here do undertake to secure the Souldiers at the Governours hands, but no further. 5. A profane person will make sale of conscience, and tongue, and all for money; as here, the souldiers take the money upon the condition offered. 6. Such as can be content to be silent, and to keep up truth for any earthly gain, will yeild also to speak contrary to known truth for gain; as these men <hi>took the money, and did as they were taught.</hi> 7. Such as do not apprehend any wrath from God for sin, do seek no guard against it, but do think it sufficient to be secure at mens hands; as here, Money, and Assurance to be secure at the Governours hand, suffice these souldiers; having these gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them, <hi>They do as they were taught.</hi> 8. He that taketh the bait of sin, will also swallow the hook; for so soon as these men took the money, <hi>They did as they were taught.</hi> 9. Where truth is rejected, a lie will be received, were it never so incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and it is righteousnesse with God so to plague those that do not receive the truth in love; for what lesse probable speech could be spoken, than that Christ's few and fearfull Disciples should hazard to open the Sepulchre, when a Guard of souldiers were about it, that all the Guard set about the Sepulchre should be sleeping at once, and be so fast asleep, as the great stone of the Sepulchre should be rolled back, and none be awake? yea, that there should be an earthquake in the mean time, and none of them for this be awaked? and yet <hi>This saying findeth credit among the misbelieving Iews.</hi>

                        <hi>Ver. 16.</hi> Then the eleven Disciples went away into Galilee, into a Mountain where Iesus had appointed them.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Beside sundry other meetings which Christ had with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, we have here a solemn and appointed meeting, which we judge to be that meeting wherein there were above five hundred Brethren, whereof the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59775:184"/>
In which meeting Christ establisheth a Ministry in his church, for Preaching of the Word, Administration of the Sacraments, and exercise of Discipline for the better observation of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands unto the end of the World. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Let the Lord shew himself to us as he pleaseth, it is our duty to attend and keep what means and meetings he hath appointed, as the <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where he had appointed them.</hi> 2. Christ loveth the Assembly of his Saints, and doth not disappoint the expectation of those that wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in the appointed means; for in the appointed place it is said, <hi>The Apostles saw him.</hi> 2. The Faith of believers is not alwayes alike vigorous and active, neither in comparison one of another, nor in comparison of a man with himself at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times: for here are disciples who doubt nothing of Christ's Resurrection when they see him; and some also are <hi>who doubted</hi> at the first sight. 4. As Faith is clear and vigorous, so doth it see Christ to be God, and bringeth the soul down before him to worship; for such as did not doubt, <hi>When they saw him, they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped him.</hi>

                        <hi>Ver. 18.</hi> And Iesus came, and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the World. Amen.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>To remove all doubting from every man, Christ draweth nearer to them, and speaketh to the people in open audience, and giveth order for gathering and ruling his church unto the end of the World. <hi>Doc.</hi> 1. The Lord draweth near unto his own, and communicateth himselfe familiarly to them, when it is needfull, and leaveth no means unassayed which may remove doubting from his weak Disciples, as here knowing that some doubted, <hi>He came and spake</hi> in their hearing. 2. Christ not only as the Son of God, hath joynt, equal and the same Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty in Heaven and Earth with the Father, communicate unto him by eternal Generation, but also as God Incarnate, God-man, he hath supreme and absolute Authority given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him over all things in Heaven and Earth, to and for the church, all things, for the good therof, being put under his Feet, without exception of any thing, save of him who hath put all
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59775:184"/>
things under his Feet: and he hath supreme, sole, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Authority, as onely Head and King of the Church, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and maintain the way and means of gathering, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ruling his church, and all the affairs thereof unto the end of the World; for so much will these Words, being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with other Scriptures, bear, <hi>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</hi> 3. Christ hath instituted a Ministry of Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and rulers of his church, to continue from his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto the end of the World; for he saith, <hi>Goe ye, make Disciples,</hi> Teach them obedience unto me, <hi>I wil be with you to the end of the world.</hi> 4. The community of Ministers and Rulers of the church <hi>respective,</hi> have all the Nations of the earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their charge, to gather Disciples unto Christ out of them; <hi>Go, make all nations disciples,</hi> saith he. Now these are made disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whosoever are given up unto Christ, to be taught and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by him, whether by themselves, or being brought by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have power of them, as Parents and Masters are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate and consecrate unto Christ, who hath said of children elsewhere, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not,</hi> All those may and should be taken charge of, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church as Disciples, and baptized; for hee saith, <hi>Go, make Disciples of all Nations, and baptize them.</hi> 6. The community of believers, or the body of covenanted and baptized disciples, are not the subject of this authority granted for gathering of churches, administration of doctrine, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Discipline, and other publick Ordinances: but the community of the Ministers, Teachers, and Rulers, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguished from the body of Disciples, which is taught and governed; for it is said, <hi>Go ye,</hi> my Ministers; make <hi>ye Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> Baptize <hi>yee,</hi> and Teach <hi>ye</hi> them. 7. Ministers or church-rulers in this their Ecclesiastics charge, do not derive their power and authority from any under Heaven, but from Christ, who hath made all in heaven and in earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; who giveth unto them a commision to make disciples unto him out of all nations; for after he hath said, <hi>All power is given to mee,</hi> Hee subjoyneth, <hi>Goe ye</hi> therefore, <hi>and make Disciples of all Nations.</hi> 8. The commission of Christs Ministers doth extend unto the drawing Nations into subjection unto Christ, and into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, to be his disciples, and to obey all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, only by way of doctrine; for, <hi>Goe,</hi> saith hee, <hi>by Doctrine make all nations Disciples,</hi> this is the force of the Word <hi>Teach,</hi> in the Original. 9. The Ministers of the Gospel
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59775:185"/>
Teaching and Ruling-elders <hi>respective,</hi> are the true succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the Apostles, in the dispensation of the Doctrin, Sacraments, and Discipline appointed by Christ, for they are appointed in the same Parent with the Apostles, and spoken unto in the Person by Christ, saying, <hi>I will be with you unto the end of the world.</hi> 10. Baptisme is the seal of the covenant, made between God and all initiate Disciples, el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and younger; for after that they are commanded to <hi>make disciples,</hi> they are commanded <hi>to baptize them, Go make Disciples, and baptize them.</hi> 11. There are three persons in the God-head distinct one from another in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of subsistence and Operation, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost, for so beareth the text. 12. These three are one GOD undivided in Essence and Operation, equall and one in Authority and Power, their Name and their exercise of Authority is one; for it is said, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them</hi> not in the names, but in the <hi>Name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost.</hi> 13. The Covenant of Grace on both sides is made for cleansing and putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way sinne, according to the way and order prescribed by GOD, in whose Name <hi>Baptisme</hi> or sprinkling with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for assuring Disciples of remission of sinnes through CHRIST, and obliging them to study Holinesse, is given and taken. 14. The Ministers and Rulers of the Church are limited unto the commands given to them from CHRIST: they may not injoyne unto the Church any thing save the commands of CHRIST; These, and all these, and only these must they teach; <hi>Teaching them,</hi> saith he, <hi>to observe whatsoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you.</hi> 15. The baptized Disciples of Christ may not walke as they list, but must study to observe all that Christ hath commanded his Ministers to teach them; for hee saith, <hi>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</hi> 16. Faithfull Ministers have assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Christs assistance and blessing, in whatsoever part or time of the World they fall into; <hi>I am with you,</hi> saith he, <hi>unto the end of the world.</hi> 17. People need not feare to joyne themselves in church society with any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under such Pastors as do faithfully teach whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Christ hath commanded: for Christ hath promised to bee with such Teachers, and to blesse their labours to the end of the world; <hi>Behold, I am with you to the end
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59775:185"/>
of the World.</hi> 18. This whole Gospel is solid Truth, and worthy to bee imbraced, to be sealed, and to bee setled upon by all Men, according as the Evangelist gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth example unto us, closing the whole doctrine, and this last Promise, with AMEN.</p>
