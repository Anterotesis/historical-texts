            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9053:28"/>
title of a Kingdome, and bounded it with the River <hi>Loire,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenian</hi> Mountaines. After that he laboured to polish his Kingdome, administring justice to every man. In the ninth yeare of his reigne, which was the third yeare after the decease of his Father, he captivated himselfe to vices, and voluptuousnesse, in such sort, that hee grew infamous, although hee seemed much devoted to the Abby of St. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> which he caused to be built, and enriched it with the pillaging of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches.</p>
               <p>In the interim, King <hi>Aribert</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased the seventh yeare of his reigne, leaving a sonne called <hi>Chilperic,</hi> who survived him but few dayes, of whose death <hi>Dagobert</hi> was strongly suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hee immediately united the Kingdome of <hi>Aquitan</hi> to the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>France,</hi> and dismembred the Dukedome of <hi>Almania</hi> into divers parts, as <hi>Munster</hi> affirmes.

of five hundred Cowes, which they payed to those of <hi>Austrasia,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that they should keepe the <hi>Sclavonians</hi> out of the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>The Character of this King may bee thus drawne: He was better furnished with vertue than his education promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: he strained the Kingdome by Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and brought it to moderation, and obedience; the state thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingtoo much slackned by his fathers le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and as he had tun'd the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to yeeld a vertuous harmony, he grew into the opinion of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by his affection to Piety, which he made to shine most cleare and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by building and enriching many Temples, especially St. <hi>Denis,</hi> honour'd since by being the constant Sepulchre where the Kings of <hi>France</hi> lye buried. He banished also the <hi>Iewes</hi> out of his Territories. But these resplendant ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9053:30"/>
were darkened and disgraced by the foule sinne of Adultery, whereby he grew infamous to his Subjects and Strangers, and was so confirmed in this vice, that <hi>Anand</hi> Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> perswading his Conversion, was therefore banished. But his reason was awaked by <hi>Pepius</hi> constant repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, to whom banishment being threatned, yet he persisted, and by a brave importunity, neglecting his owne danger, obtained of the King to bee mercifull unto himselfe, and forsake his sinne; such was the minde of this vertuous Prince to hearken to the words of a wise man which were spoken in season, that ever after he was wary both of his words &amp; actions; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingan example of loyalty in a servant, and of Reasons victory in a Prince.</p>

themselves: making Warres, Peace, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, Ordinances and Customes of the Kingdome at their pleasure.

it is thought, he was the first of the <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Princes</hi> that usurped the revenues of the Abbies) so that all that part on this side <hi>Seine,</hi> and that which was called <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi> remained in the obedience of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Doe little;</hi> and the parts beyond the <hi>Seine</hi> with <hi>Burgundy,</hi> were under <hi>Charles the grosse,</hi> Emperour; who came to take the protection of <hi>France</hi> against the <hi>Normans,</hi> according as <hi>Fulco,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishop of <hi>Rheimes,</hi> testifieth.

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:9053:70"/>
From thence they came before <hi>Paris</hi> under the conduct of their King <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sroy,</hi> hoping there also to make a prey as they had done elsewhere; but it was so bravely defended by Count <hi>Eudes</hi> &amp; the Abbot <hi>Goslin,</hi> that they were quite frustrate of their expectation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.

               <p>This King was approved in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reigne, and reverenced by his Subjects, but afterwards having

               <p>This Kings life was a meere blanke, wherein no brave actions were inscribed for the example of posterity, being a fruitlesse branch, and the first that grew out of his stock, excepting his sonne, who derived from him no sap of vertue, but was also barren in goodnesse: Hee did so contemne his brother <hi>Charles,</hi> whom his Father had left no portion, but his favour, thereby to increase his respect to his eldest brother, so that the Emperour, whose assistance hee desired, undertooke the quarrell.

the brevity of his Reigne.

this agreement was incontinently bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon new differences which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened betweene the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> during which, the King tooke into his possession the Counties of <hi>Mans</hi> and <hi>Tours,</hi> whereupon King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> tooke a conceite, and dyed in the Castle of <hi>Chinon:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Richard</hi> his sonne undertaking the Kingdome, marryed <hi>Adele</hi> Sister to King <hi>Philip,</hi> and they both went to the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> where arriving they tooke the Towne of <hi>Acre</hi> the twelfth of <hi>July,</hi> 1191.

               <p>This King being to joyne battaile with the Emperour <hi>Otho,</hi> having cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a gilt Bowle to be filled with Wine and sopps of bread, hee said; Princes and Lords of <hi>France,</hi> heere with me as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, let every one that is resolv'd to live and dye with me this day, shew his resolution by taking a sop out of the Bowle of Wine, and eating it as I have done: which words being spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Cup was presently emptied, and afterward the battell being joyned, the King got the victory. Being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his Courtiers that some Royall Jurisdictions belonging to the Crowne
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:9053:102"/>
were usurped by the Clergy, his answer was, <hi>I had rather connive at some petty injuries, than commence Suits against the Semitears of God and his Church.</hi> This King having put away his Queene <hi>Gelberge,</hi> the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Pope of this wrong done to his Sister, and a day of hearing was appointed before the Popes Legate in the Bishops Hall at <hi>Paris: Philips</hi> Case was well defended by his Advocates, but when none appeared to plead for the Queene, a young man unknowne steps forth of the presse, and demands audience; and having deliver'd the truth, and pleaded against the King for the Queene, and when his Speech was ended, hee returned into the presse againe, and was never seene more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it ever knowne from whence he came. The amazed Judges remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Cause to the Councell, and King <hi>Philip</hi> did ride presently to <hi>Bois de Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nennes,</hi> where <hi>Gelberge</hi> was confined, and having embrac'd her, receiv'd her
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:9053:102"/>
into favour, and lived with her after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in nuptiall love. And heereby it may bee discerned, that no man can bring Nature to any perfection, for this worthy Prince was much troubled in minde, and divided in his thoughts by loving this <hi>Gelberge,</hi> whom he could not forsake, for she had got such strong possession in his affection, that he could not turne her remembrance out of his heart, pass'd away to her by deed of gift. Thus hee that could overcome his Enemies, could not conquer his passions. He reigned 44. yeares, and by his vertue governed the State with such wisedome, that all his troubles had a happy faire end; from whence this conclusion may be drawne, That a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous King is in the end happy, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hee bee compassed in with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

               <p>This King being perswaded to take revenge on a Bishop who had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand strooke fire to kindle the tindar of contention betweene him and the Pope, he said: That it was more noble in a Prince to save, than kill; to pardon, than to persecute; and to forgive and remit, rather than to revenge: for saith he, It must be of necessity that all things which angry men doe, must needs be full of blindnesse and necessity, because it is no easie matter for a man troubled with envy, to have the use of Reason; and whatsoever is without Reason, is without Art.

His Kingdome from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was marvellously troubled with
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:9053:114"/>
mutinies and popular seditions; and for that cause he was surnamed <hi>Hutin,</hi> which in old language imports mutiny and quarrells. <hi>Enguran De Marigny</hi> Count of <hi>Longue Ville,</hi> was accused be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, by <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> the Kings Vncle, for having ill governed the <hi>Finances,</hi> charged the people with many impositions and taxes, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite confusions; also for having taken money of the <hi>Flemings</hi> to grant them a peace to the disadvantage of the King: wherefore he was hanged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gallowes of <hi>Paris,</hi> which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had caused to be built.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the King caused himselfe to bee annoynted, and Crowned at <hi>Rheimes,</hi> upon the Feast of the <hi>Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the B. <hi>Virgin:</hi> then he led his Army against the <hi>Flemings,</hi> whom he forced to raise and forsake the siege of <hi>L'Isle.</hi> And at his returne he seated the Court of Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> to the end, that the pleaders should not be anymore incommodated by so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving

               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> the tenth, surnamed <hi>Hutin</hi> had two Wives, <hi>Marguerite,</hi> daughter of <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> by whom he had a daughter named <hi>Ioane,</hi> who was married after to <hi>Philip Count</hi> of <hi>Evreux,</hi> sonne to <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the late <hi>Philip the Faire,</hi> and by this meanes the Kingdome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> entered into the families of the Counts of <hi>Evreux:</hi> and <hi>Clemence</hi> sister to <hi>Carlobert, King</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> whom at his decease he left with Child of a sonne who was called <hi>Iohn:</hi> and although he dyed an infant, without having beene crowned, hee hath not beene heretofore ranked in the Catalogue of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> Neverthelesse, seeing that he was truely legitimate, and sole heire to <hi>King Lewis Hutin,</hi> he deserved the title Royall, and to bee inserted to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Kings,</hi> seeing that dying hee was

with solemnity, and Regall pompe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to St. <hi>Denis;</hi> the Princes, his Vncles, and kinred being present at his Funeralls; where hee was proclaimed, although dead, <hi>King of France,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre.</hi> In the meane time that <hi>Clemence</hi> was with Child, immediately upon the decease of <hi>Lewis Hutin,</hi> it was ordered by the Court of Parliament, that <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Philip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Count of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi> should be Regent of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> untill the fruit of the Queene (if it were Male) should attaine to the maturity of eighteene yeares: and therefore hee he bore in his Armes the Title of <hi>Philip Sonne of the King of</hi> France, <hi>and</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre, <hi>Regent of the Kingdomes of</hi> France, <hi>and</hi> Navarre. And so the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency was given to the next Prince of Blood, so that hee were the nearest to succeed the Crowne. After the death of the said <hi>Iohn,</hi> who lived but eight daies, or at the most but 20 daies, (as some do write) there was some dispute amongst the Princes of the kingdome, some

maintaining the right to bee ill grounded upon <hi>Ioane,</hi> daughter to the late <hi>Lewis Hutin:</hi> and others resting upon the Iustice of the <hi>Salique</hi> Law, which yet was never violated in <hi>France,</hi> and ordayneth, that there being never an heire Male of a King, the next of Blood, of the Male side, shall come to the Crowne, and excludes the daughters and the descendents from them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be Males. But in the end the Parliament of the <hi>Paires</hi> and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of <hi>France,</hi> adjudged that <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Tall,</hi> Vncle to the late <hi>Iohn,</hi> was the true and lawfull heire to the Crowne: which was the first debate and difference of the <hi>Salique</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>The King reigned but an yeare and an halfe, thereby to make good the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Philosophy, <hi>Nullum violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est aeternum;</hi> for his government was violent, and therefore could not long continue. <hi>Enguerand,</hi> accused by <hi>Charles</hi> Earle of <hi>Valois,</hi> and made odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the people by his oppression of

               <p>This <hi>Charles</hi> the 6. was of a magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and Heroick soule, full of the fire of true valour, which upon any brave occasion broke forth in glorious actions: which vertue was declared in his younger yeares by this answer to his Father <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, by whom a Crowne of Gold enchased with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones, and a Helmet of Steele fairely guilt, being propounded to his choise, hee answered hee would rather chuse the Helmet than the Crowne. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward being crowned King of <hi>France,</hi> this Sonne of valour rising in the spheare of Majesty, shined forth with early beames of valour; for being shewed by his Officers, his deceased Fathers rich Treasury and precious moveables, and also his Armory full of warlicke Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:9053:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and all sorts of Armes, hee said, He had rather have those Armes, than his Fathers Riches. As this King and his Noblemen marched against the Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> being entred the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of <hi>Mans,</hi> a man bare-headed and bare-legged, attired in a Coate of white Rugge, steps suddainly forth betwixt two Trees, taking hold of the Raines of the Kings Horse, and staying him, said unto him: King ride no farther, but returne backe, for thou art betrayed: The King was amazed at this voice and the man being forced with blowes to leave the Raines of his Horse, vanished. Afterward it chanced that his Page be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very sleepy, let fall his Lance upon him which carryed the Helmet, making a great noise like the rustling of Armes, the King starts with amazement at this noise, and seeing the Crimson Band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll of the Lance, having his spirits weakened with the former distempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, transported with the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this sound, sleepy with labour
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:9053:134"/>
and heate, he imagins himselfe to be compassed in with many armed men which pursu'd him to the death. <hi>Charles</hi> thus transported with this phrenzy, layes hold on his Sword, drawes it, runnes violently after his Pages, and calls them Traytors. The Pages conceiving at first that hee had beene displeased for the disorder of the Lance, flye from him: The King follows after: The Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> runnes towards him to let him know the cause of his anger. The King very violently layes at him, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; the Duke flyes, and the King follows. Thereupon all draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neare unto him, they take his Sword from him, and his thick Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet Jerkin, and scarlet Cap, and lay him on the ground.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Urban</hi> his Enemy, triumphing and rejoycing at his misery, said it was a just judgment of God for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and assisting his Competitor: But the holy Scripture sayes, <hi>O how</hi>

To a Gentleman that was ready to handle a rich Chaine of gold, which a Captaine wore about his neck, and was suspected to be made of the reliques of a Church, he said: Take heede how you touch that Chaine, for it is a holy thing.</p>
               <p>He said also, that, in regard of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at the beginning of his reigne, if by the expression of courage and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he had not procured feare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, he might have beene ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the unfortunate Princes in the last Chapter of <hi>Boccace.</hi> A rich Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having builded a faire Hospitall, he said, That having made many poore for the Hospitall, hee might justly make an Hospitall for the poore, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his sinnes into Almes-houses. Hee
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:9053:143"/>
would often say to his Noblemen, that his sonne should learne no more Latine, than <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare;</hi> and that the government of the Kingdome and Common-wealth was his best study, for other studies would too much soften his minde, and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall examples, unfortunate in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and successe, would discourage him from attempting brave Actions. He said also that the <hi>Genowayes</hi> should not long remaine under his protection, for he would bequeath them to the Divell. Being advised to send an Embassadour, that had many Dignities and Titles: he said he is like a peece of <hi>Brachigraphy,</hi> that hath many a Title but Learning very little. Being told that the Gout haunted rich men that fared delicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wore fine cloathing; he said, hee would alwaies afterward weare cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathes, because the Gout should not take him for a rich man. He could finde all things he said in his Kingdome, and his Court, except truth, which was sicke
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:9053:143"/>
in his fathers time, and was now starke dead, having before her death made no Confession to a Priest. The Realme of <hi>France</hi> he said was a meddow which he did cut every yeere, and as often as he listed. He asking a meane fellow, which knew not the King when he saw him, what he gained by following the Court? The fellow answered, I get as much as the King, that is, maintenance while I live, and a sheete when I dye.</p>
               <p>He said that a curious ignorant man, having a Library of faire Bookes, was like a crooke-backt man having a Bunch on his backe, whereby the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the one, &amp; the ignorance of the other was more discerned. He made gold the engine of his actions, saying, that an Army of silver Launces doth usually winne the victory. Great services (he said) through the arrogancy of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties performing them, or the neglect of Princes regarding them, were often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced with hatred or ingratitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore the bounty of Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:9053:144"/>
desert was more fortunate and happy than desert exceeding the bounty of Princes, not enduring to be indebted or obliged. Having felt the smart of the English warres, he said the King of <hi>England</hi> was his Brother in his owne Countrey, but hee did not like his company in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having caused a faire goodly Tombe to bee made for the faire Lady <hi>Agnes,</hi> the love of his late Father, the Cannons of the Church desiring that the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might bee removed out of the heart of the Church into a side Ile, or Chappell, he answered, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest was neither just nor reasonable, neither would he suffer her Tombe (whom his father loved) to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Monsieur Bussi</hi> was beheaded and buryed, he caused the head to be digged up againe, and placed on a wooden pole in the Market place, and so being covered with a scarlet Cappe, furred with <hi>Minivere,</hi> in regard he had
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:9053:144"/>
beene a Counsellour of the Parliament. A suiter to the King for an Office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in denyed, humbly thanked his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, who wondring at his moderate, yet man-like spirit, asked if he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a right of his answer? yes, said the Suiter, and I thanke your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty for giving me a dispatching denyall, rather than feeding delayes: with which Answer the King was so contented, that he had his Office immediatly granted.</p>
               <p>A Noble-man seeing this King ride a Hunting on a very little Horse, said he had gotten a goodly stout Horse; for though he seemed but weake and little, yet he must needes be very strong, because he carryed him with all his Counsell: Thereby taxing the King, preferring the wisedome of his owne conceite before all other Counsell.</p>
               <p>Hee demanding what present he might bestow on the English Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors that might not cost him much, was answered; That he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:9053:145"/>
them with his Musitians, that so they might not cost him much, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they had done.</p>
               <p>Before the joyning of a Battaile, this King said hastily unto a Noble-man, that he had no affiance in his service: who for proofe thereof, having desired to exchange Armes and Ensignes with the King, charged bravely on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and being supposed to be the King, was slaine: wherein the King with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping teares sayd, he had lost his life to expresse his love and loyalty. Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the <hi>Saracens</hi> were misreck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 10000 <hi>Francks,</hi> in the payment of 200000 thousand pounds for a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, he would not embarke or set saile untill the aforesaid <hi>Francks</hi> were paid: such was his fidelity to those Infidells. This King having appoynted a Bishop to goe take a Muster of the Souldiers in <hi>Paris,</hi> a great Noble-man desired a Commission to reforme the Bishops Church, saying that employment was as fit for him, as the other was for the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:9053:145"/>
Bishop. When this King was <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> he taking great pleasure in hunting, often resorted to a poore Forresters Cottage, where he did use to eate Radishes, he comming to be <hi>King,</hi> the Forrester perswaded by his Wife, &amp; in hope of reward, presented to the <hi>King</hi> a faire Radish, which his Majesty accepted, and rewarded the Forrester with a thousand Crownes. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a Courtier presented the <hi>King</hi> with a faire goodly Horse, expecting a greater reward, because he had beene so bountifull to the Forrester. But the <hi>King</hi> contrary to his expectation, gave the Courtier his Radish, wrapped up in white paper; the Courtier returning to his lodging, opening the packet, found nothing but a Radish, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he informed the King of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, as he supposed: The King said, I have paide thee well for thy horse: for the present which I gave thee cost mee a thousand Crownes; thus the poore mans good affection was wel rewarded,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:9053:146"/>
and the Courtiers audaciousnesse slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Lewis</hi> sends an Embassadour to the Emperour, to excuse him for not sending an army, promised by treaty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him not to make a greement with the Duke of <hi>Burgogne;</hi> but that he should confiscate all the Dukes Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nories that held of the Emperour, as hee would doe those that held of the Crowne of <hi>France:</hi> The Emperour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that they must not divide the Beares skinne before the Beast be dead. This King commming to an interview of the King of <hi>Castile,</hi> unto whom hee was formerly strickly allyed, conceived a contempt and disdaine each of other: The <hi>French</hi> of the <hi>Castilians</hi> sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and pride, in their words, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and apparrell: The <hi>Castilians</hi> of the plainnesse of the <hi>French</hi> attire: So as from that day these Kings did never love, and the <hi>French</hi> did ever since hate the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>

in his returne at <hi>Fournoue;</hi> but the <hi>King</hi> passing another way, escaped the plot, and came safe into <hi>France:</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intelligence of the losse of <hi>Naples,</hi> and intending a second voyage thither for the recovery of his losses, dyed of an Apoplexy, as hee was seeing a Game at Tennis in the Castle of <hi>Amboise,</hi> the seventh of <hi>April, Anno Domini</hi> 1498.</p>
               <p>This <hi>King</hi> among other facetious sayings, gave the <hi>Florentine</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours this merry Answer, denoting their unfaithfulnesse, in these two <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Verses:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Concortesia e fede poca</l>
                  <l>Va a <hi>Florence</hi> vender loca.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>To <hi>Florence</hi> he went of his Goose to make sale,</l>
                  <l>Without any faith or courtesie at all.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>which Verses were formerly made on this occasion: A Countrey Pesant sold a fat Goose to a faire Dame of <hi>Florence,</hi> for the fond satisfaction of Venery, but
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:9053:148"/>
afterward on colder thoughts growing wiser, this piece of leatherne igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, contrary to his former agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without either fidelity or cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, demanded the price of his Goose in the presence of her Husband, and made her, for the former sawce of the Goose, pay him againe. And with this <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, which had this wanton Originall, the King answered the unfaithfull Embassadours of <hi>Florence.</hi> His Queene <hi>Anne</hi> having received ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of his Death, said; Gods will be done, I doubt not but I shall be as great as I was before, intimating thereby her hopes to be Queene of <hi>France;</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards verified by her Marriage with King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth. Friar <hi>Jerosine Savonarola</hi> living at <hi>Florence,</hi> foretold in his Sermons that this King should come into <hi>Italy,</hi> and obtaine great victories, which fell out accordingly; and in those Warres nothing was gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but a stinking contagious disease, afterwards spred over all <hi>France,</hi> and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:9053:149"/>
since then called the <hi>French Poxe.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this King had ended his warres, he builded a Castle at <hi>Ambois,</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that instead of a stately Palace, hee should end his life in a base and filthy Gallery. He intending to reforme his life, it chanced the seventh of <hi>April,</hi> going after with the Queene into the Castle-ditches, hee strooke his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head against the doore of a Gallery, whereas he meant to see a set at Tennis. This blow driving him to the preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of his approaching end, hee said to his Confessour, that hee would never commit any mortall or veniall sin, if he could avoide it, which was a good reservation: upon this protestation hee fell back ward into an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had beene troubled, and dyed about 11. a clocke at night, in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber neare to a Gallery, stinking with the urine which every one made as he passed through it, being laid on a Matresse, such as they could finde by chance.

put into the said Bastile, whither the Chancellour comming to pronounce the sentence of death against him, hee shaked the Chancellour by the Arme, saying, You have judged me, and God will absolve me; hee will lay open their iniquities, which have shut their eyes, because they would not see my innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: You my Lord shall answer for this injustice before him, whither I doe summon you within a yeare and a day.

Afterward the Chancellour said that hee had brought two Divines to comfort him, and prepare him for death, but the Duke said, That he was already prepared, and that his soule was in such tranquillity, as the night before hee had spoken with God.

                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:9053:175"/>The Lord of <hi>Vatan</hi> made a kinde of a Rebellion in <hi>Berry,</hi> whereupon his Castle was taken, and he carryed to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> where he was beheaded the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of <hi>January, Anno Domini</hi> 1612.</p>
               <p>This yeare were solemnized the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of the <hi>King</hi> with the Lady <hi>Anne Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and of the Kings Sister, with the Prince of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The yeare 1614 the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> retired himselfe to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse <hi>D'Ancre</hi> was made Marshall of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Statue of Brasse of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> was by the great Duke of <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany</hi> sent to <hi>Paris,</hi> and placed with the Horse of Brasse, upon the midst of the New Bridge; And about that time the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> dyed.</p>
               <p>The Prince distasted with the Kings espousalls with the Queene at <hi>Burgos,</hi> made a hurly burly in the Countrey,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:9053:175"/>
but the Espousalls being ended, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> with a strong Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her to <hi>Fontarable,</hi> where shee was received by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and an exchange being made, the Queene was by the said Duke conveyed to <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> where shee was most magnificently entertained by the King, where hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected her, and the Nuptials were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated on St. <hi>Katharines</hi> day.</p>
               <p>The yeare 1616. such was the rigour of cold weather in <hi>January,</hi> that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were frozen, and the yce was the cause of the fall of St. <hi>Michaels</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 16. of <hi>August,</hi> the taking of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne</hi> was a cause of new commotions, and the first of <hi>September</hi> was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the <hi>Louure,</hi> and after kept under a strong guard in the <hi>Bastile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many of the Lords retired from the Court, as the Duke of <hi>Vendosme,</hi> of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> of <hi>Guise,</hi> of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and <hi>Bovillon,</hi> with other Lords, whereof some retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe, the others not: which was
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:9053:176"/>
a cause that the King in Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the causes wherefore he kept the Prince his brother in hold.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the yeare 1617. he made a Declaration against the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> in Parliament, the 17. of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> also in <hi>February</hi> against the Dukes of <hi>Vendosme, Mayenne, Bouillon,</hi> the Marquesse of <hi>Caevure,</hi> and the President <hi>le Jay.</hi> Also another Declaration was made in <hi>March</hi> for the re-union to his <hi>Domaines,</hi> and a Confiscation of the goods of the said Nobility upon the 16. of the said Moneth.</p>
               <p>This King succeeded after the Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call death of his Father, when great troubles were like to follow; but all those clouds were blowne away, and this young Prince shined forth like the Sun in a cleare skie. First of all hee went to the Parliament, and made a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that his Mother should be Queene Regent during his minority. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Jesuites received his Fathers
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:9053:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heart, with great Ceremony, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into <hi>La Flech.</hi> Here the Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and cruell Execution of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer <hi>Ravilliac</hi> deserves to be drawne forth in blacke colours. Imagine that <hi>Ravilliac</hi> was first arraign'd after he had beene put to the Rack, then condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, afterward hee was brought out of the prison in his shirt, with a Torch of two pound weight lighted in one hand, and the knife wherewith he had murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King, chained to the other: then he was set upright in a Dung-cart, now hee is doing pennance at our <hi>Ladies Church;</hi> now imagine the raging people are ready to teare him in peeces, but the Officers restraine them; the Murderer came to the Scaffold, he crosses himselfe in signe that he dyed a Papist; hee was bound to a St. <hi>Andrews Crosse,</hi> then his fatall hand with the knife chained to it, smoaks in a Furnace of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone; it is consum'd, yet hee will not confesse any thing, but roare and cry like
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:9053:177"/>
to a Soule in hell, but yet unpitied: and then his flesh was pulld off with hot Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and burnt, then scalding Oyle, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, pitch, and brimstone, melted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were powr'd into his wounds, and on his navell a roundell of Clay was set, into the which they powred molten Lead, and then he roared, but confessed nothing. At last, to conclude this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, his body was torne in pieces with foure strong Horses, which could not plucke them asunder, being so firmely knit together, untill the flesh under his armes and thighes was cut. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was this Paricide tormented and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, being the horrid picture of a Traytor, suffering extreame tortures, yet misery nor death could not enforce from him any confession. And surely if Hells tortures might be felt on earth, it was approved in this mans punishment, yet he would reveale nothing, but that he did it by the instigation of the Devil, and his maine reason was, because the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:9053:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King tollerated two Religions in his Kingdome. Oh small occasion, that for this cause one servile slave should thu quench the great light of <hi>France,</hi> whose brightnesse glistred thorow <hi>Europe:</hi> One thing this Villaine confessed, that of all the severall torments that were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and laid upon him, none was more terrible to him, than his losse of sleepe for sixe dayes and nights together, for there were appointed severall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers by turnes to keepe him waking, by thrusting red-hot bodkins into his breasts and sides; so that if he did but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to winke or give a nod, then present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they awaked him with those Irons. He was torne in peeces as I said before, and his bones burnt, the ashes whereof were scattered in the winde, as being thought unworthy of the earths buriall. This <hi>Ravaillac</hi> was borne at <hi>Angolesme,</hi> and by profession a Lawyer, and was perswaded as it is thought, by the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites to perpetrate this bloody act, by
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:9053:178"/>
murdering this Kings Father, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the hope of Learning, and the glory of Armes. Afterward the Duke of <hi>Fener,</hi> Embassadour from <hi>Spaine,</hi> came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and being brought into the Kings presence, he said that he came from the King his Master to visite his Majesty. This young <hi>Prince</hi> answered, I thanke the King my brother for his good will, I will remember him and you also: Seeing he desires it, he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from me all friendship and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, such as hee had with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased King my Father. Afterward the Lord <hi>Wotton,</hi> Embassadour from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and then Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours for confirmation of mutuall league being sent into <hi>Spaine, England,</hi> and to <hi>Rome,</hi> the King was at <hi>Rheims</hi> with solemne pompe and great state crowned.</p>
