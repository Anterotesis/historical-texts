            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause I with great griefe haue nowe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard, (most dere Reader) that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned and no lesse godly, ientle and louing man Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Melancthon is highlye belyed, in that a great sorte openlye saye that he hath denyed the trueth, or (that I maye vse their owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des) recanted (whiche thyng they saye onelye to hyndre the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of Gods trueth) I coulde do no lesse, but turne into our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshe speache, and also put out, this litle treatise of his: not so muche for the defence of his moste named and knowen fames sake (which he hath yet hitherto kepte vndefiled, so that euen the greatest enemyes of the gospell neither coulde nor haue saied otherwise of hym) as for the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortyng of many godly

and christen hertes, whiche haue, bene not alytell dismayed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged thorow suche lyes. And verely not without a cause, for his denying would do more harme to the trueth in these last and most pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relouse tymes, than any tongue or penne can expresse. And God of his goodnesse, bountefull mercye, and great power, graunt that that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer chaunce. At this tyme also, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes be to god therfore, he hath not onely not denyed the trueth, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so after his olde accustomed christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manier, plainelye confessed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it: whiche thyng this his answere to the <hi>Interim,</hi> ynough witnesseth.</p>
            <p>And although this his writing be shorte, and answere not to al the poyntes of the <hi>Interim</hi> (for that would aske great labour, and long tyme) yet it playnely answereth to

            <p>He also sheweth tokens ynoughe in the booke, that he will at leasure largelier write vpon manye poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes therof. I receiued also a letter with this treatise, from a nother godly and learned man, wherin is writen, that other and diuers lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men in Dutchlande, be in hand to shewe their meaning in writing, as touchyng the same, so that we maye be of muche better comforte then our papistes would gladly se, yea then manye of the good and faithfull christen be, that that <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> will be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>standed, &amp; not so sone and easely receaued as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papistes hope, &amp; many christen feare. This I saie chiefelye caused me to putte out this litle boke, at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4457:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But for that there be haply ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that know not what that <hi>Interim</hi> meaneth, for some. haue not seen it, and some haue not harde of it, ye and the moste vnderstande not the worde, as they that vnderstand no Latine, or not very well, neede dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me to shewe bothe what it is, and also the meanyng of the worde. <hi>Interim</hi> is a booke whiche was at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperoures Maiesties commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demet, prynted and put forth about the begynnyng of June in this yere of our Sauiours birthe. 1548. wherein is commaunded that al the Cities in Dutchlande that haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the worde of God and made a chaunge of Ceremonyes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the word, shal reforme their Churches agayne and turne to the olde popishe ordinaunces, as a dog dothe to that he hathe spued out, or a washen swyne to the myre.</p>

Thus haue ye harde what it is. Now heare what the worde signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth or betokeneth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Interim</hi> is as muche to saye, as in the meane season, or, in the meane while. And therfore haue they chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened the childe and geuen him this name, because they wyll y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we kepe all the thynges commaunded and contayned in that booke, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane while from this highedutche parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holden at Auszburg till there be a generall councell holden. There they thynke, (but God sitteth aboue in heauen, and thynketh happly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyse) to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter worsse. For because it had been an hastye worcke to haue chaunged all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at once, they of their great (I had almoste sayed) greuouse and mercilesse mercy haue borne with vs in two thynges, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to saye, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

But for as muche as the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the Boke be diuers, some be right and some be vnrighte, some speake of the chiefe articles of the belefe which all men muste knowe and vnderstand, and some of other matters whiche are not so nedeful to be knowen: we will orderly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our obedient meaning, and that that is right wyll we not <hi>casu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niose &amp; sophistice</hi> striue against, but plainely and singely acknowlege it, and agayne that that is vnright wyll we not allowe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> begynning of the boke, as touchyng the creacion and fall of man, the originall or byrthsinne, and the redempcion or raunsoming through Christe, is righte and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fautye. But afterwarde in the fourth leafe, in the title of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificacion or rightwessemakyng is this faute, that the Booke
<pb facs="tcp:4457:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
plainly saith: that we be iustified or made rightwesse through loue, and the same meaning is also afterward reherced and declared that it maye suerly be vnderstanded therby, that that booke is not agreable with the true learnig which is through gods grace preached in our Churches, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man is made rightwesse before God, and pleaseth him, for ourlorde Christes sake through belefe.</p>
            <p>And althoughe the boke saye in some places, that a man cometh to rightwesenes through belefe, yet is this the meaning of the boke, that the belefe is but a makyng readye before, and that afterwarde a man is made rightwesse throughe loue, as the boke also playnely sayeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man is afterwarde verely made rightwesse throughe loue.</p>
            <p>And to declare it selfe playnely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it saithe, that there is yet a true
<pb facs="tcp:4457:9"/>
belefe in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although he liue with an euell co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, and haue not loue: And also that a man is an inheriter of euerlasting life, throughe loue.</p>
            <p>So that this is in very dede the whol meaning, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is rightwesse, that is, pleaseth God, throughe loue and worckes, as the monckes and freers taught longe a gone. And the neadfull learnyng of belefe is not spoken of, whiche is this, althoughe loue and a good conscience muste be in vs, yet are we before God right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, we please hym throughe our Sauiour christ and for his sake, through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trust y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue in him &amp; not because of our purenesse or clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. This Article is throughe Gods grace so declared expounded and set out in our churches, that we doubte not, but there are very many men whiche vnderstand it right well, and can also well iudge the boke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4457:10"/>
We acknowledge and teache al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so and that diligently and truly, that repentaunce &amp; sorowfulnes or grefe of herte, conuersion or turning again to God; loue, a good purpose to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and a good conscience, muste be in the hert, and that this saying muste abyde true.
<q>Qui non diligit, manet in morte.</q>
He that loueth not, abideth in death.</p>
            <p>There must many neadefull ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues be together, belefe, loue, hope, a good conscience, a good purpose. &amp;c: as thys thyng is throughe Gods grace plenteously preached in our churches.</p>
            <p>But yet ouer &amp; aboue these vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es must the trust in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God be there, as is afore saied, &amp; it must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waise ouershadow thother vertues for almaner of vertues be weake in vs, &amp; there abideth yet much vnclea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in mannes herte in this lyfe</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4457:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Therefore muste we cleaue and sticke to the mediatour, and seke grace and fauour through him, for so speaketh the psalme, Before the is no man liuing rightwes. And Da. 9. saieth, heare vs not because of our rightwesnes, but because of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for the Lordes sake.</p>
            <p>And so shall we come before God and bryng thys truste in the sonne of God with vs, and knowe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe loue and other vertues be, and muste be in vs: that they yet be to weake, and that the truste in, to, and vpon the sonne of God, muste stande suer, vnstirrable and vnouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwable, and do that that is done to our rightwesmakyng.</p>
            <p>And if we speake of the rightwes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes poured into vs of God (as they calle it) we maye not leaue out this belefe and liuing trust, for it is one of the highe and neadfull vertues:
<pb facs="tcp:4457:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Yee this truste wakeneth vp coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, loue, prayer or callyng vpon God, and life in the herte, as is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Gall. 2. That I nowe liue, I lyue throughe the belefe in the sonne of God: And loue and counforth ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be or abyde in the hert, yf this belefe and this truste go not before.</p>
            <p>So that this is spoken without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideracion in the boke, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we befirst made ryghtwesse indede throughe loue, wheras yet this rightwesnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God is merciful vnto vs for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours sake, and that the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure couereth &amp; hideth our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ought moche more and highlyet to be loked to and esteamed, then our owne loue.</p>
            <p>And when we be in nede, and in earnest prayer or callyng vpon God, we seke not loue and oure owne cleannes, but be muche more affearde and shrynke for our wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse
<pb facs="tcp:4457:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and synnes: and muste seke coumforte at the onely peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, whiche God of his greate mercy and wonderfull wisedome hath apoynted vs. Thereof spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Paule. <hi>Justificati fide pacem habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> after we be made rightwesse throughe belefe, we haue peace or are at peace.</p>
            <p>And that this is the vnchaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able voyce &amp; meanyng of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in the Churche of god from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams tyme hitherto, that is plaine in the holy Scripture, and s. Paule setteth Abrahams example before our eies, and declareth this saying: Abraham beleued God, and that was counted vnto hym for right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesnes. That is, although Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham had great and highe vertues yet was this his rightwesnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and he pleased him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he beleued that God woulde
<pb facs="tcp:4457:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be graciouse and fauourable to him according as his promes sounded.</p>
            <p>And althoughe this vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the promes be ofte at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and tymes darkened, yet hath it abyden and abydeth among the vnderstandyng and perceauyng christen alwayes, as euery godlye christen mannes owne experience that hath vnderstanding, sheweth.</p>
            <p>Therfore is this one fawte in the Booke, that it sayeth, loue is true rightwesnes, and fayneth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> belefe is but a knowledge, suche a one as is in the deuels.</p>
            <p>And saith further, that a man is an inheritour of euerlastyng life, because he hath loue, and so sedeth vs to our owne workes and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothyng of this comfort, that we shall beleue, that God suerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth all those to euerlastyng lyfe that turne agayne and amend, and
<pb facs="tcp:4457:12"/>
trust vpon the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of god, through suche belefe.</p>
            <p>But that some saie, that we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not the boke, this we lette them iudge, that wyll hereafter largelier write thervpon, if it come abroade and shewe his head.</p>
            <p>And althoughe menne woulde suttely and wylily excuse it, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the poyntes therin contayned here and there together, so is it yet agaynst it selfe.</p>
            <p>For as muche then as this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, howe a man is rightwes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore god and pleaseth god, must be knowen to all men, that the righte honour maye be geuen to the sonne of God, and that men maye haue right true coumforte, must all men both the learned and the vnlearned helpe to kepe the godly learnyng of the gospell pure cleane and vndark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb facs="tcp:4457:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Therfore can we not councell that anye man receaue the booke in this poynte.</p>
            <p>And in asmuche as it is playne that no creature neither in heauen or earth oughte to chaunge the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeable councell of God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the gospell: we will through Gods grace, also from henceforthe truly teache the learnyng of belefe &amp; good workes, as we haue nowe many yeres preached and taught it in these churches, for it is so set out in the scripture of God.</p>

that the Masse is through many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roures comen in to great misuse: for whiche God vndoutedly punysheth the worlde, as it is wrytten, whoso vnworthely vseth the Sacrament, maketh hymselfe gylty of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Chryste: ought men with great earnest to seke and helpe to kepe, mayntayne, and vpholde, the trueth of this Artycle, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure of God and saluacyon of menne.</p>
               <p>And this is also one of thartycles whiche belongeth in generall to all menue bothe learned and vnlearned. Wherefore thortely to aunswere to this question.</p>
               <p>Whether the preuy Masse, or the Masse without a companye takyng it to gether be to be set vp agayne? This is oure answere. That we with true meanyng, counsel that we sette not vp the Masse agayne that
<pb facs="tcp:4457:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               <p>There shall no Gods seruyce be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened or done in the Churche, that is not ordeyned and commaunded in the worde of God.

               <p>Therefore is this fyrst vse agreyng with the wordes of Chryste, suerly the ryght and true vse, and shalbe mayntened vpholden and kepte, and there shall no other worckes be set vp therein, whiche are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.</p>

There haue not been also alwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes in tymes paste dayly Masses.

And this is the meaning of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syderacion, that these Churches bee not brought out of reast and peace, but that they may abyde in praying vnto God, and in the true Godsser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices.

nede dryuethe vs with lowlynesse to saye thus muche, that we wyll not chaunge the true learnyng whiche we haue hytherto preached in oure Churches.
