            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

weary of the yrkesome cruelty of hys Lord,<note place="margin">Senator of Rome</note> ran from

a monstrous and ougly Lyon,<note place="margin">The grateful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a cruel Lyon.</note> whose sight so appalled

the Lyon of hys payne, for which déede, the Lyon not

A shame is it therefore to humanitie,<note place="margin">Beasts teach men to be gratefull.</note> that bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish

            <p>Of which sort are these Plaiers,<note place="margin">Plaiers are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull vipers.</note> that like the Uiper

whom when the king <hi>Antigonus</hi> aduaunced to hygh
preferment of his counsell,<note place="margin">Aristodemus to Antigonus.</note> béeing but a base Cookes

not to be liberall, then which there cannot be a greater
blot to the fame of a royall Prince. If Princes then,
the Uizegerents of God,<note place="margin">Princes are vize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents of God.</note> would punish such impudent
wretches as insert themselues into their secrets to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine,
nor shame to fleare in the face of a Prince,
bedecked with modesty, (though the poysoned bayte of
treason lurketh in theyr harts.) No doubt but this vice
should be lesse practised, and vertue sooner embraced.
Worthily then deserued thys impudency her continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
torment in hell,<note place="margin">Impudency is tormented in hell.</note> in whose fruit appeareth the pathe

            <p>With what tyranny doth vice then hold possession of
these mens harts, when theyr eyes are so obstinatlie

a Common wealth, I wish these men not to sooth them

Maske thus ended, wyth visardes accordingly appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
there were certaine petty fellows ready, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome

<hi>Fastus,</hi> to the intent his education might appeare

            <p>After these seuerall Orations were ended, a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
ioy was striken in the harts of the beholders,<note place="margin">The wicked ioy in sinne.</note> as
well by reason of these spéeches, as to view the manner
of the Maske, wherein they receyued such contentation
by how much more it came vnlooked for, that they were
almost dryuen into an extasie, such was the ioy they
conceiued thereof. When <hi>Fastus</hi> and <hi>Luxuria,</hi> and the
rest of the company hadde well recreated theyr minds
with dauncing and disporting amongst these Maskers
beholding them at large (whose custome was not to
