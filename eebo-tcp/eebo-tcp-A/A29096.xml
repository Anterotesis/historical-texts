            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common Proverb that good Wine needs no lvy buſh, No more doth this good old Wine, this excellent <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of that Saint of God, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Bradford</hi> need any letters of commendation. Yet it will be requiſite to ſpeak ſomething, and I hope it will be interpreted a deed of
<pb facs="tcp:41941:3"/>charity if I interpoſe as an Advocate for the truth of this <hi>Orphan Tract,</hi> whoſe Father was a Saint on earth, and now reignes as a glorious Saint in heaven. The work is legitimate, tranſcribed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an exact Copy: and it's ſutable to the ſtile, and ſavours of the Authors ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The many choyce breathings in his letters, and this Treatiſe are all of a peece, <hi>good old gold,</hi> more pretious then that of Ophir.</p>
            <p>Something I ſhall briefely ſpeake of the <hi>Author,</hi> and then of this <hi>Tract.</hi> For the Author, what his learning was is upon Record, how ſolid and ſinuous his diſputations were with the Popiſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Spaniſh Friars, and others that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited him in priſon, and how dextrouſly he managed all his Diſputations, <hi>with Wiſdome, judgement,</hi> and <hi>zeale,</hi> you may read largely in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Foxes Martyrology.</hi> He was a man of an acute witt, penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting judgement, and had the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and advice of <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> to enter into the Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>His piety was rare and eminent. As was the man, ſo was his communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, holy and uſefull. Who ſo reads his
<pb facs="tcp:41941:3"/>ſpirituall breathings, (I might almoſt call it a tranſcendent ſtyle) in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, muſt needs confeſſe, that he was one of the holieſt men that ever <hi>lived ſince the Apoſtles time.</hi> Take a taſt of him in theſe few characters,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was a zealous, plaine, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Preacher of Gods word, He knew how to divide the word aright, and walke accordingly. He had thoſe two rare Qualifications of a Preacher <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He was a <hi>Boanerges</hi> a ſonne of Thunder, to impenitent, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate ſinners, but a <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a ſonne of conſolation to the children of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He was of an humble ſelfe-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit. I never read of any, that had a meaner opinion of himſelfe, then he had. You ſhall finde the ſubſcription of his letters, <hi>Miſerrimus peccator, a very hypocrite, the moſt hard-hearted unthankefull ſinner, a very painted hypocrite, John Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> So cheap an eſteeme had he of himſelfe. This humility is an adorning grace, next to the garment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, none like to it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtles phraſe is Emphaticall 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
<pb facs="tcp:41941:4"/>
               <hi>Be ye cloathed with humility:</hi> Let it be your uppermoſt garment; <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Fundamentum ſanctitatis eſt humilitas.</hi> This holy man's example is worthy of our imitation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He was much acquainted with God, and enjoyed a holy communion and familiarity with him, in Prayer &amp; Meditation. He meditated much, and Meditation is the ſpirituall digeſtion of the ſoule. It's a divine ruminating upon the word read, or Preached: when we meditate ſeriouſly on the Promiſes, Attributs, or ſuch choyce ſubjects, <hi>we are up in the Mount with Moſes,</hi> we ſoare aloft, even to heaven, being carryed by the wings of holy meditation. This medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is an uphill duty, <hi>Iſaack, Moſes, Paul,</hi> and other Saints of God, have found ſweet conſolation flowing from it: And he joyned prayer to Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was frequently upon his knees, <hi>and he would not riſe up, till he felt ſomething coming in,</hi> ſome ſpirituall illapſe darted upon his ſoule. His practice was ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Bernard's</hi> reſolution, <hi>Nunquam Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine diſcedam a te ſine te.</hi> He ſtudied uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon his knees, and prayed much
<pb facs="tcp:41941:4"/>in his ſtudy; and indeed he ſtudies well who praies well. And he can take the moſt comfort of his ſtudy, who reaps the fruits of his paines, as Returnes of his prayers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He was of a melting tender heart. He wept much and mourned, that he could not bring his dull heart to love Jeſus Chriſt more. At table as he ſate at meat, he uſually pulled his hat down before his eyes, and poured forth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of teares upon his trencher. He had a tender heart, bowells opened to the Priſoners, he had a tender care both of their bodies and ſoules. When he was in Priſon, he viſited frequently his Fellow-Priſoners, and ſpent much time in praying for them, exhorting of them, and contributing liberally out of his purſe unto them.</p>
            <p>I need adde no more, for what I can ſay is too little &amp; beneath the Authors worth, of whom the World was not worthy: He lived a Saint, and died a Martyr.</p>
            <p>Now, for this worke which I here preſent to the Reader, I am aſſured, that its not ſpurious, but the genuine
<pb facs="tcp:41941:5"/>iſſue of this worthy Author. Herein is handled <hi>The Doctrine of Repentance,</hi> with many moving conſiderations thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Perhaps his plaine Phraſe may not ſuite this curious age, which is too too much given to affectation of words, <hi>Sed diſtinguenda ſunt tempora.</hi> Thoſe times were not uſed to ſet forth or garniſh their diſhes as now they are, yet, the food is wholſome, plaine and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And if our palates cannot reliſh ſuch food, I feare there's ſome diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in them, and it's our duty to pray for the removall thereof, I ſhall not make a Panegyrick on the Treatiſe. The work will abundantly commend it ſelfe. <hi>Here's Evangelicall Repentance, preſt home unto the Conſcience,</hi> with many cogent convincing Arguments. It was then ſpoken in ſeaſon, and it's a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that can never be preſt our of ſeaſon: Theſe are Goſpel daies. The Kingdome of heaven is at hand, and of all times Goſpel times are peculiar times of Repentance. The Lord calls upon all rankes of men, <hi>Magiſtrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, People, Repent, Repent.</hi> Various diſpenſations call on us to repent, ſome
<pb facs="tcp:41941:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>times God ſpeaks in the Thunder of judgement, ſometimes in the Muſick of mercy: Both by mercies and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we are called to Repentance. The laſt words of this holy Martyr were <hi>Repent England:</hi> And truly the words of a dying man ſhould be much ſet by, Eſpecially of a dying Saint, who bequeaths this Legacy to England in his laſt breath.</p>
            <p>Now whoever thou art, that readeſt this book, and art hereby won, to think on thy waies, and turne unto God, give God the glory, and look on it as a ſpeciall hand of providence, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this book to thy ſight. I will not detaine thee longer from reading this enſuing Treatiſe; Read it, and read it againe, with prayer and Meditation, and the Lord teach thee to profit by it. And ſo I commend thee to the grace of God, and bid thee heartily Farewell; entreating thy prayers for him, who in love to thy ſoule, hath revived this Treatiſe, and remaines</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing over entreated to Preface ſomething to this Peece, I crave a little patience, whileſt I ſpeak a little both to the <hi>Worke</hi> and <hi>Workman;</hi> In the Work, there is, <hi>1.</hi> The <hi>Matter, 2.</hi> the <hi>Frame</hi> or compoſure conſiderable, the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is <hi>Repentance,</hi> and thats a thing, which will never be out of ſeaſon, till ſin, which never is in ſeaſon, be out of mens hearts and lives. Some men (indeed) have thought (in temptation only I hope) this a worke (for ſome at leaſt in theſe daies) too <hi>legall,</hi> and below their <hi>Goſpel pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi> but if it be rightly stated and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, it will be found a Goſpell both <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>priviledge</hi> beyond the mercy of Law, and never more ſeaſonable then in times of <hi>Grace Act. 17. 30,</hi> much preſſed by the <hi>Lord of Preachers</hi> and his forerunners, by his Apoſtles, and their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors down to our Authors time, who frequented no one doctrine or duty more. For the <hi>forme and manner</hi> of handling this Theme, we referre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, his <hi>method,</hi> his <hi>ſtile or phraſe.</hi> In the firſt, we muſt allow a latitude to him, to others, according to each mans gift and genius, ſo long as <hi>curioſity and confuſion</hi> be avoided, and the
<pb facs="tcp:41941:6"/>
               <hi>capacity</hi> of the hearer conſidered. Much I know is written about the <hi>Method of Preaching,</hi> and it muſt be granted, that nothing contributes more to the <hi>memory</hi> both of the ſpeaker and hearer, then <hi>method</hi> doth: Howheit, the rule holds that the <hi>greateſt art is to diſſemble art,</hi> and that Preacher who <hi>ſtudies himſelf and his people moſt,</hi> uſually ſpeaks moſt to the <hi>heart,</hi> and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification; a Workman may fetch his ſtuffe from anothers ſhop, but if he will make the ſuit fit, he muſt apply himſelfe to the party concerned, and take meaſure of him; I mean this, a Teacher muſt fetch all his <hi>materials</hi> from the <hi>word,</hi> but his application from the <hi>Auditory,</hi> and herein this <hi>good man</hi> was his crafts maſter.</p>
            <p>Nor will his Method (I am confident) be quarrelled by any true <hi>Artiſt,</hi> he begins with a deſcription of the <hi>Term, of the Thing,</hi> and that done, he caſts it into the parts, vindicating them from falſe gloſſes and miſtakes, and reſtoring them to their proper ſenſe; and the way thus cleared, he bears down all before him with ſtrength of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and application, wherein lies the life of this, of any Sermon.</p>
            <p>For his <hi>Phraſe,</hi> thats ſuited to the <hi>times</hi> wherein he lived, and to the <hi>matter</hi> that lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and whilſt 'tis ſo, it was not needfull, either to alter a tearme unleſſe it were ſuper annua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or to <hi>adde</hi> a word, unleſſe it were to make up a

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41941:10"/>not in any wiſe uſe it after our corrupt fantaſies; but to the end for which it is given and lent us, that is; to the ſetting forth of Gods praiſe and glory, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, converſion and obedience to his good will and holy lawes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto his long-ſuffering doth, (as it were) even draw us, if our hearts by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency were not hardned. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our life in the <hi>Scripture</hi> is called a <hi>walking;</hi> for that, as the body draweth dayly more and more neare its end, that is the earth: even ſo our ſoul draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth daily more and more neere unto a period, that is, ſalvation, or damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, heaven or hell.</p>
            <p>Of which thing, in that we are moſt careleſſe, and very fooles, (for we alas, are the ſame to day, we were yeſterday, and not better or nearer to God, but rather nearer to hell, Sathan and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; being covetous, idle, carnall, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, negligent, proud, &amp;c. I think my labour cannot be better beſtowed then with the Baptiſt, Chriſt Jeſus, and his Apoſtles, to harp on this ſtring, which of all other, together with faith, is moſt neceſſary, and in theſe daies moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41941:10"/>What ſtring is that? ſaith one? Forſooth brother, the ſtring of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> the which Chriſt our Saviour did uſe, firſt in his Miniſtry; and as his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, at this preſent I will uſe unto you all: <hi>Repent for the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſentence thus pronounced, and Preached by our <hi>Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,,</hi> as it doth command us to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> ſo to the doing of the ſame, it ſheweth us a ſufficient cauſe to ſtirre us up thereunto; namely, <hi>for that, The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven</hi> (which is a Kingdome of all joy, peace, riches, power and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) <hi>is at hand,</hi> to all ſuch as doe ſo, that is, as do <hi>repent.</hi> So that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereof is, as though our Saviour might thus ſpeak preſently: <hi>Syrs</hi> for <q>that I ſee you all walking the wrong way, even to Sathan, and unto hell fire, by following the Kingdome of Sathan, which now is coloured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vaine pleaſures of this life, and fooliſhneſſe of the fleſh, moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly, to your utter undoing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: behold and marke well what I ſay unto you: <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41941:11"/>that is, an other manner of joy and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, honour and riches, power and pleaſure, then you now perceive or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, is <hi>even at hand,</hi> and at your backs: and if you will turne againe, that is <hi>repent</hi> ye, you ſhall moſt truely and pleaſantly feele, ſee and inherit. Turne againe therefore I ſay; that is <hi>Repent,</hi> for this joy I ſpeake of, <hi>the Kingdome of heaven is at hand.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Here we may note, firſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our natures, in that to this commandement. <hi>Repent</hi> you, he addeth a cauſe, <hi>For the Ringdome of heaven is at hand:</hi> For by reaſon of the corruption and ſturdineſſe of our nature, God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all his commandements, commonly, either addeth ſome promiſe to provoke us to obedience, or elſe ſome ſuch ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe, as cannot but ſtirre us up to hearty labouring for the doing of the ſame: as here, to the commandement of acting repentance, he addeth this Aetiologe or cauſe, <hi>For the Kingdome of heaven is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Againe, in that he joyneth the commandement as a reaſon, ſaying: <hi>For the Kingdome of heaven is at hand.</hi> We
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41941:11"/>may learne that of the Kingdome of heaven, none (to whom the Miniſtry of Preaching doth appertaine) can be partaker, but ſuch as repent and doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. Therefore, dearely beloved, if you regard the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> in that you cannot enter therein, except you repent: I beſeech you all of every eſtate, as you deſire your own peace of conſcience to repent and amend. The which thing that ye may doe, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour my beſt now to helpe you, by Gods grace.</p>
            <p>But firſt, becauſe we cannot well tell what repentance is, through ignorance, and for lack of knowledge, and falſe teaching: I will (to begin withall) ſhew what Repentance is. Repentance, is no Engliſh word, but we borrow it of the Latiniſts, <note place="margin">1. Reſipiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia.</note> to whom it is an after thinking in Engliſh: in Greeke, a being wiſe afterwards: in Hebrew, <note place="margin">2.<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
               </note> (unto God eſpecially) without ſome good hope or truſt of pardon, for that which is already done and paſt, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (after hearty ſorrow) an earneſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41941:12"/>purpoſe to amend, and to turne to God with a truſt of pardon.</p>
            <p>This definition may be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Firſt a ſorrowing for our ſinnes.</item>
               <item>2. Secondly, a truſt of pardon, which otherwiſe may be called, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of God's mercy, by the merits of Chriſt, for the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes,</item>
               <item>3. And thirdly, a purpoſe to amend, or a converſion to a new life. The which third or laſt part, cannot be called ſo properly a part, as an effect of that repentance we now ſpeake of, as towards the end ye ſhall ſee by Gods grace. But yet leſt ſuch as ſeeke for occaſion to ſpeake evill, ſhould have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſion, if they tarry not out the end of this ſermon: I therefore divide repentance into the three foreſaid parts.
<list>
                     <item>1. Of ſorrowing for our ſinne.</item>
                     <item>2. Of good hope or truſt of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</item>
                     <item>3. Of a new life.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus you may ſee what the thing is; a ſorrowing for ſinne, a purpoſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41941:12"/>with a good hope or truſt of pardon.</p>
            <p>This penance not only differeth from that which men commonly take to be <hi>penance,</hi> in ſaying and going over our enjoyned Ladies Pſalters, ſeaven peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall Pſalmes, ſuperſtitious Faſtings, Pilgrimages, Almes-deeds, and ſuch like things; but alſo from that which the more learned have declared, to conſiſt of three parts: namely, contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confeſſion, and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Contrition,</hi> they call a juſt, and a full ſorrow for their ſinne. For this word, <hi>juſt and full,</hi> is one of the differences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Contrition,</hi> and <hi>Attrition,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> they call, a numbering of all their ſinnes in the eare of their ghoſtly Father: for as (ſay they) a judge cannot abſolve without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the cauſe or matter; ſo cannot the Prieſt, or ghoſtly Father, abſolve from other ſinnes, then thoſe which he doth heare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Satisfaction</hi> they call amends making unto God for their ſinnes, by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due works, <hi>Opera indebita,</hi> workes more then they need to doe, as they terme
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41941:13"/>them: This is their penance which they Preach, Write, and allow: But how true this ſtuffe is, how it agreeth with Gods word, how it is to be allowed, taught, Preached written, let us a little conſider.</p>
            <p>If a man repent not, untill he have a <hi>just and full ſorrowing</hi> for his ſinnes (dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved) when ſhall he repent? For in as much as hell fire, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Divels, is a juſt puniſhment for ſinne: In as much as in all ſinne, there is a contempt of God, which is all goodneſſe, and therefore there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of all ilneſſe: alas; who can beare or feele this juſt ſorrow, this full ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our ſinnes, this their contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they doe ſo diſcerne from their attrition? ſhall not man by this doctrine rather deſpaire, then come to repentance? If a man repent not untill he have made confeſſion of all his ſinns in the eare of his ghoſtly Father: if a man cannot have abſolution of his ſins, untill his ſins be told by tale and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Prieſts eare, in that (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) none can underſtand, much leſſe then utter all his ſins: <hi>Delicta quis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligit?</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41941:13"/>Who can underſtand his ſins? In that <hi>David</hi> complaineth of himſelfe elſewhere, how that his ſinnes have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowed his head, and as a heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then doe oppreſſe him; alas ſhall not a man by this doctrines be utterly dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from repentance? Though they have gone about, ſomething to make a plaiſter for their ſores of confeſſion or attrition, to aſſwage this ſtuffe; bidding a man to hope well of his contrition, though it be not ſo full as is required, and of his confeſſion, though he have not numbred all his ſinnes, if ſo be that he doe ſo much as in him lieth: deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved, in that there is none, but that herein he is guilty (for who doth as much as he may?) think yee, that this plaiſter is not like ſalt to ſore eyes? Yes undoubtedly, alas when they have done all they can, for the appeaſing of conſciences in theſe poynts, this is the ſumme, that we yet ſhould hope well, but yet ſo hope that we muſt ſtand in a mammering and doubting, whether our ſins be forgiven. For to beleeve <hi>remiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem peccatorum,</hi> that is, to be certaine of forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, as our Creed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41941:14"/>teacheth us, they count it a preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. O abomination, and that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therein, but in all their penance as they paint it!</p>
            <p>As concerning <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> by their <hi>Opera indebita,</hi> undue workes; that is by ſuch works as they need not to doe, but of their own voluntarineſſe and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe: (wilfulneſſe in deed) who ſeeth not monſtrous abomination, blaſphemy, and even, open fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? For if ſatisfaction can be done by man; then Chriſt died in vaine, for him that ſo ſatisfieth, and ſo reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he in vaine; ſo is he a Biſhop and a Prieſt in vaine. <note place="margin">Deut. 6.2. Mat. 22.</note> Gods law requireth love to God with all our heart, ſoule, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, might and ſtrength: ſo that there is nothing can be done to God-ward, <note place="margin">Mark 20. Luke 10.</note> which is not contained in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: nothing can be done, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above this. <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> Again, Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to man-ward, that we ſhould love one another as he loved us. And think you, beloved, that we can doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to our Neighbourward, which is not herein comprized?</p>
            <p>Yea, let them tell me, when they do
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41941:14"/>any thing ſo in the love of God, and their Neighbour, but that they had need to cry: <hi>Remitte nobis debita noſtra,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> forgive us our ſinnes. So farre are wee off from ſatisfying. Doth not Chriſt ſay: <note place="margin">Luke 17.</note> When you have done all things that I have commanded you, ſay: that ye be but unprofitable ſervants? Put nothing to my word, ſaith God, Yes, <note place="margin">Apoc. 22. Deut. 4.1.</note> workes of ſupererogation, (yea, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abomination) ſay they. Whatſoever things are true (ſaith the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paule</hi>) Whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to love, whatſoever things are of good report, if there be any vertue, <note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> if there be any praiſe: have you them in your minde, and doe them, and the God of peace, ſhall be with you. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this leſſon well regarded would pull us from Popiſh ſatisfactory Works, which doe deface Chriſts treaſures and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>In heaven and in earth was there none found that could ſatisfie God's anger for our ſinnes, or open heaven for man, but onely the Son of God <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41941:15"/>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Lion of the Tribe of Juda,</hi> who by his bloud hath wrought the work of Satisfaction; and he <hi>onely is worthy</hi> all <hi>honour and glory,</hi> and <hi>praiſe;</hi> for he hath opened the <hi>book with the ſeaven ſeales,</hi> and done all.</p>
            <p>Dearely beloved, therefore abhorre this abhomination, even to think that there is any other ſatisfaction to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for ſinne, then Chriſts blood on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Blaſphemy it is, and that horrible, to think otherwiſe. The blood of Chriſt purifieth (ſaith St <hi>John</hi>) <hi>from all ſinne.</hi> And therefore he is called the <hi>Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the World,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, there was never ſinne forgiven of God, nor ſhall be from the beginning untill the end of the World, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through Chriſts death: Prate the Pope and his Prelates as pleaſe them, with their Pardons, Purgatory, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Trentalls, Diriges, workes of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation, ſuperabomination, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I am he (ſaith the Lord) <hi>which putteth away thine offences,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai 45.</note> and that <hi>for my own ſake, and will no more remember thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Put me in remembrance</hi> (for <hi>we will reaſon together</hi>) and tell me what thou
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41941:15"/>haſt for thee, to make thee righteous. Thy firſt father offended ſore, &amp;c. And thus writeth S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John, If any man ſinne, we have an advocate</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.</note> 
               <hi>even Jefus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation, or ſat is faction for our ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As in the fourth chapter he ſaith; that God hath ſent his ſonne to be a <hi>propitiation,</hi> or <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for our ſinnes: According to that which <hi>Paule</hi> writeth, where he calleth Chriſt a <hi>mercifull and faithfull</hi> Prieſt, to purge the peoples ſins. So that blind Buſſards and perverſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts they be, which yet will prate, that our merits or Workes do ſatisfy for our ſinnes, in part or in whole, before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme or after.</p>
            <p>For to omit the teſtimonies I brought out of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> which the blind cannot but ſee: I pray you remember the Text out of <hi>Eſay,</hi> which even now I rehearſed, being ſpoken to ſuch as were then the <hi>people of God,</hi> and had been a long time, but yet were fallen into grievous ſins, after their adoption into the number of Gods Children. It is for <hi>mine own ſake</hi> (ſaith God) that I put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41941:16"/>thy ſinnes. Where is your parting of the ſtake now? If it be for Gods own ſake, if Chriſt be the propitiation: then recant, except you will become Idolaters, making your works God and Chriſt. Say as <hi>David</hi> teacheth: <hi>not to us Lord, not to us, but to thy name be the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is to be noted, that God, doth caſt in their teeth, even the ſinne of their firſt Father, leaſt they ſhould think that yet, perchance, for the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and goodneſſe of their good Fathers,</hi> their ſinnes might be the ſooner pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo God accept their works.</p>
            <p>If they had taken ſatisfaction, for that which is done to the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on publikely, by ſome notable puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> was uſed to <hi>open</hi> offendors, ſhadowes whereof, and ſome pore Traces yet remaine, when ſuch as have ſinned in Adultery, go about the Church with a Taper in their ſhirts; Or if they had taken ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for reſtitution to Man ward, of ſuch goods as wrongfully are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the which true repentance cannot be without: or if by ſatisfaction, they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41941:16"/>had meant a new life, to make (as it were) amends to the Congregation thereby, as by their evill life, they did offend the Congregation; in which ſenſe the Apoſtle ſeemeth to take that which he writeth in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. where the old interpreter calleth <hi>Apologian, ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> which rather ſignifies a defence or anſwering againe. If I ſay, they had taken ſatisfaction any of theſe waies, then they had done well, ſo that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to God had been left all only to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Againe if they had taken confeſſion, either for that which is to God private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either for that which is to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation publiqucly, either for that which is a free conſultation with ſome one learned in Gods booke, and called thereunto as firſt it was uſed and I wiſh were now uſed among us, either for that which is a reconciliation of one to another, it had been ſomething; yea, if they had taken it for faith, becauſe it is a true demonſtration of Faith. as in <hi>Paul</hi> we may ſee, when he calleth Chriſt the <hi>Captaine of our Confeſſion,</hi> that is of our Faith (and ſo confeſſors were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41941:17"/>called in the Primitive Church) ſuch as manfully did witneſſe their faith with the perill of their lives: if, I ſay, they had taken it thus, then had they done rightwell.</p>
            <p>And ſo Contrition, if they had left out their ſubtill diſtinction, between it and Attrition, by this word <hi>just or full,</hi> making it a hearty ſorrow for their ſinnes, then we would never have cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out againſt them therefore. For we ſay, repentance hath three parts; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, if you underſtand it for a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſorrow for ſinne; Confeſſion, if you underſtand it for faith, of free pardon in Gods mercy, by Jeſus Chriſt; and Satisfaction, if you underſtand it not to God-wards (for that only to Chriſt muſt be left alone) but to man-ward in reſtitution of goods wrongfully or fraudulently gotten, of name hindred by our ſlaunders, and in newneſſe of life: although (as I ſaid before) none will ſhew more plainely by Gods grace that this laſt is not ſo much a part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as a plain effect or fruit of true repentance.</p>
            <p>I might here bring in examples of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41941:17"/>their penance, how perilous it is to be embraced: but let the example of their grand-ſire <hi>Judas</hi> ſerve, in whom we ſee all the parts of their pennance, as they deſcribe it; and yet notwithſtanding he was damned. He was ſory enough, as the effect ſhewed: he had their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition fully, out of the which he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed</hi> his fault, ſaying, <hi>I have betrayed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood:</hi> and thereunto he made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, <hi>reſtoring the mony</hi> he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But yet all was but loſt, he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up himſelfe, his bowells burſt out, and he remained a child of perdition for ever. I would wiſh that this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Judas,</hi> in whom ye ſee the parts of their Pennance, contrition, confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſatisfaction, would move them to repentance, and to deſcribe it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better, making hope or truſt of Gods free mercy a piece thereof, or elſe with <hi>Judas</hi> they will marre all.</p>
            <p>Perchance theſe words, contrition, coufeſſion, and ſatisfaction, were uſed as I have expounded them at the firſt, But in that we ſee ſo much danger and hurt by uſing them without expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; either let us joyne to them open
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41941:18"/>expoſitions alwaies, or elſe let us not uſe them at all, but ſay as I write, that repentance is a hearty ſorrow for our ſinnes, a good hope or truſt of pardon, through Chriſt, which is not without an earneſt purpoſe to amend, or a new life. This repentance is the thing, whereto all the Scripture calleth us. This repentance do I now call you all unto: this muſt be continually in us, and not for a Lent-ſeaſon, as we have thought: this muſt increaſe daily more and more in us, without this we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">Search therefore your hearts all, all ſwearers, blaſpheamers, lyers, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, lewd, or idle talkers, jeſters, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, covetous perſons, drunkards, gluttons, whoremongers, theeves, murtherers, ſlanderers, idle livers, negligent in their vocations, &amp;c.</hi> All ſuch, and all other as lament not their ſinnes, as hope not in Gods mercy for pardon, and purpoſe not heartily to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, to leave their ſwearing, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whoredome, covetouſneſſe, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c. All ſuch I ſay, ſhall not, or cannot enter into God's Kingdome, but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41941:18"/>hell fire is <hi>prepared</hi> for them, weeping, and <hi>gnaſhing of teeth:</hi> whereunto, alas, I feare mee, very many will needs goe, in that very many will be as they have beene; let us even to the wearing of the tongue to the ſtumpes, Preach and Pray never ſo much to the contrary, and that even in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt: as now I beſeech you all; all and every Mothers Child, to repent and lament your ſinne, to truſt in Gods mercy, and to amend your lives.</p>
            <p>Now me thinkes ye are ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed: whereby I gather, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently you deſire this repentance, that is, this ſorrow, good hope, and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, The which that you may the rather attaine, and get to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as I have gone about to be a mean to ſtirre up in you (by Gods grace) this deſire of Repentance, ſo through the ſame grace of God, will I goe about now to ſhew you, how you may have your deſire in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>And firſt concerning this part, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſorrow for our ſinnes, and hearty lamenting of the ſame: For this; if you deſire the having of it, you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41941:19"/>that you thinke not that of your ſelves, or of you own free will, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes you can get it. You may eaſily deceive your ſelves, and mock your ſelves, thinking more of your ſelves then is ſeemely. <hi>All good</hi> things, and not peeces of good things, but <hi>all good</hi> things, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>James, come from God the Father of light.</hi> If therefore repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be good (as it is good) then the parts of it be good. From God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe they come, and not of our free will. It is the Lord that'mortifieth, that bringeth down, that humbleth, ſaith the Scripture in ſundry places: After thou hadſt ſtricken me (ſaith <hi>Jeremy) I was aſhamed,</hi> Loe he ſaith After thou hadſt ſtricken me: and therefore pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he, even in the laſt words almoſt, he writeth, <hi>Turne us O Lord, and we ſhall be turned,</hi> The which thing <hi>David</hi> uſed very often.</p>
            <p>Wherefore firſt of all, if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt have this part of repentance, as for the whole, becauſe it is Gods gift; ſo for this part goe thou unto God, and male ſome little prayer, as thou canſt, unto his mercy for the ſame, in this or like ſort.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41941:19"/>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercifull Father of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe I have ſinned and done Wickedly; yet, through thy goodneſſe, have received a deſire of repentance,</hi> whereto, this thy long-ſufferance doth draw my hard heart: I beſeech thee, for thy mercies ſake in Chriſt, to work the ſame repentance in me; and by the ſpirit, Power, and Grace, ſo to humble, mortify, and feare my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for my finnes, that in thy good time thou maiſt comfort and quicken me againe through Jeſus Chriſt thy dearely beloved Sonne.</p>
               <p>AMEN.</p>
            </q>
            <p>After this ſort, I ſay, or otherwiſe, as thou thinkeſt good, if thou wilt have this firſt part, Contrition or ſorrow for thy finnes, do thou begge it of God, through Chriſt, And when thou haſt asked it, as I have laboured to drive thee from truſting in thy ſelfe; ſo now I goe about to move thee from flattering of thy ſelfe, from ſluggiſhneſſe, and negligence, to be diligent to uſe theſe meanes following. Unto prayer, which I would thou ſhouldeſt firſt uſe as thou canſt: Secondly get thee Gods Law as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41941:20"/>a glaſſe to look in: for in it, and by it, cometh the true knowledge of <hi>ſinne,</hi> without which knowledge there can be no ſorrow. For how can a man ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his finnes, which knoweth not his finnes? As when a man is ſick, the firſt ſteppe to health, is to know his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: even ſo to ſalvation, the firſt ſtep, is to know thy damnation due for thy many ſinnes.</p>
            <p>The law of God therefore muſt be gotten, and carefully looked in; we muſt look in it ſpiritually, and not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as the outward word or letter doth declare and utter: and ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour teacheth us in <hi>Matthew,</hi> expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſixth and ſeaventh Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not only after the outward deed, but alſo <hi>after the heart,</hi> making there the <hi>anger</hi> of the heart, a kind of murther; luſting after another mans wife, a kind of adultery.</p>
            <p>And this is one of the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Gods Law and mans Law; that of this (man's law I meane) I am not condemnable, ſo long as I obſerve out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly the ſame. But Gods Law go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the roote and to the heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41941:20"/>me for the inward motion, although outwardly I live moſt holily. As for example; if I kill no man, though in my heart I hate, man's law condemneth me not: but otherwiſe doth Gods Law. And why? for it ſeeth the root from whence the evill doth ſpring. If hatred were taken out of the heart, then loftineſſe in lookes, detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in tongue, and murther by hand, could never enſue. If luſting were out of the heart, curioſity in countenance, wantonneſſe in words, loathſome bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in body would not appeare.</p>
            <p>In that therefore this outward evill ſprings out of the inward corruption. <note place="margin">Iames 2.</note> ſeeing Gods Law alſo is a law of <hi>liberty,</hi> as ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall</hi> as ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paule,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> perfectly and ſpiritually it is to be underſtood, if we will truely come to the knowledge of our ſinnes. For of this inward corruption, reaſon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth little or nothing. I had not known (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) that <hi>luſting</hi> (which to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to them which are guided on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reaſon, is thought but a triſte) I had not knowne (ſaith he) this luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have been <hi>ſinne,</hi> if the Law had
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41941:21"/>not ſaid, <hi>Non concupiſces,</hi> thou ſhalt not luſt.</p>
            <p>To the knowledge therefore of our ſinne (without which we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or be ſorry for our ſinne) let us ſecondly get us God's law as a glaſſe to look in: and not only literally, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or partly; but alſo ſpiritually, inwardly and throughly. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the heart, and ſo ſhall we ſee the foule ſpotts we are ſtained withall, at leſt inwardly, whereby we the rather may be moved to hearty ſorrow and ſighing. For as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, it is a glaſſe which feareth no body, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven look what a one thou art, ſo it painteth thee out.</p>
            <p>In the Lawe we ſee it is a foule ſpot, not to love the Lord our God, with all (I ſay) our heart, ſoule, power, might, and ſtrength, and that continually.</p>
            <p>In the Law it is a ſoule ſpot, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make to our ſelves any graven image or ſimilitude, to bow thereto, &amp;c. but alſo, not to frame our ſelves wholly after the word and image whereto we are made.</p>
            <p>In the Law we ſee that it is ſoule
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41941:21"/>ſpot, not only to take Gods name in vaine, but alſo not earneſtly, heartily, and even continually to call upon his name only, to give thankes unto him only, to believe, to publiſh, and live in his holy word.</p>
            <p>In Gods Law, we ſee it is a foule ſpot to our ſoules, not only to be an open prophaner of the Sabbath day, but alſo not to reſt from our own words and works, that the Lord might both ſpeak and work in us and by us; not to heare his holy word, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Sacraments, not to give occaſion to others to holineſſe, by our example in <hi>Godly</hi> workes, &amp; reverent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming of the Miniſtry of his Word.</p>
            <p>In Gods Law, we ſee it a foule ſpot to our ſoules, not only to be an open diſobayer of our parents, Magiſtrates, Maſters, and ſuch as be in any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over us; but alſo not to honour ſuch even in our hearts, not to give thankes to God for them, not to pray for them, to aide, to help, or relieve them, to bear with their infirmities, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In Gods Law, we ſee it is a foule
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41941:22"/>ſpot in our ſoules, not only to be a man-queller in hatred, malice, proud lookes, brags, back-biting, railing, or bodily ſlaughter: but alſo not to love our neighbours; yea, or enemies, even in our hearts, and to declare the ſame in all our geſtures, words and works.</p>
            <p>In Gods law, we ſee it a foule ſpot to our ſoules, not only to be a Whoremonger in luſting, in our hearts, in wanton looking, in uncleane and wanton talking, in actuall doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unhoneſtly with our Neighbours Wife, Daughter, ſervant, &amp;c. But alſo not to be chaſt, ſober, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in heart, lookes, tongue, apparell, deeds, and to help others thereunto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In Gods Law, we ſee it is a foule ſpot to our ſoules, not only in heart, to covet, in look or word to flatter, lye, colour, &amp;c. in deed to take away any thing which pertaineth to another: but alſo, in heart, countenance, word and deed, not to keepe, ſave and defend, that which pertaineth to thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as thou wouldeſt thine own.</p>
            <p>In Gods Law, we may ſee it a foule
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41941:22"/>ſpot, not only to lye and beare falſe witneſſe againſt any man; but alſo, not to have as great a care over thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours name, as over thine own.</p>
            <p>Sinne in Gods Law, it is we may ſee, and a foule ſpot, not only to conſent to evill luſt, or carnall deſires, but even the very carnall luſts and deſires them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are ſinne, as ſelfe love, and many ſuch like. By reaſon whereof I think there is none that looketh well therein, but though he be blameleſſe to the World, and faire to the ſhew; yet certainly, inwardly his face is foule arrayed, and ſo ſhamefull, filthy, poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, and ſcabbed, that he cannot but be ſorry at the contemplation thereof, and that ſo much more, by how much he continueth to look in this glaſſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>And thus much concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond mean, to the ſtirring up of ſorrow for our ſinne, that next unto Prayer we ſhould look in Gods law ſpiritually. The which looking, if we uſe with prayer, as I ſaid, let us not doubt, but at the length God's ſpirit will work, as now to ſuch as believe; for to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41941:23"/>all is in vaine, (their eyes are ſtarke blind, they can ſee nothing) to ſuch as believe (I ſay) I truſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done even already. But if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by prayer, nor by diligent looking into Gods law ſpiritually, as yet thy hard, unbelieving heart feeleth ſorrow, nor lamenting for thy ſinne. Thirdly, look upon the tagge tied to Gods Law: for to his Law there is a tagge tied, that is, a penalty, and that no ſmall one, but ſuch an one, as cannot but make us caſt our curriſh tailes between our leggs, if we believe it; for all is in vaine, if wee be faithleſſe, not to beleeve before wee feele.</p>
            <p>This tagge, is Gods malediction or curſe. <hi>Maledictus omnis</hi> (ſaith it) <hi>qui non permanet in omnibus quoe ſcripta ſunt in libro legis, ut faciat eam.</hi> Loe, accurſed (ſaith he) is all, no exception, all, ſaith God which continueth not in all things (<hi>for he that is guilty of one is guilty of the whole,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>James</hi>) in all things therefore (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them, He ſaith not, to heare them, to talke of them, to diſpute of them, but, to doe them.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41941:23"/>
            <p>Who is he now that doth theſe? <hi>Rara Avis,</hi> few ſuch Birds, yea none at all. <hi>For all are gone out of the way,</hi> though not outwardly by word or deed, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly at the leaſt by default, and wanting of that which is required: ſo that a child of one nights age is not pure, but (by reaſon of birth-ſinne) in danger of Gods malediction: then much more we, which alaſſe, <hi>have drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in iniquity, as it were water,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith; but yet we quake not. Tell me now, good brother, why doe you ſo lightly conſider Gods curſe, that for your ſins paſt <hi>you are ſo careleſſe as if you had made a covenant with death and damnation,</hi> as the wicked did in <hi>Eſais</hi> time? what is Gods curſe? At the Popes curſe, with book, bell, and candle; O! how trembled we which heard it, although the ſame was not directed to us; yea, hanging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, all by reaſon of our ſinnfs: alas, how careleſſe are we? O faithleſſe hard hearts! o <hi>Jeſabels</hi> gueſts, rocked and laid aſleepe in her bed! O wicked wretches, which being come into the depth of ſinne, doe contemne the ſame! O ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowleſſe ſinners, and ſhameleſſe harlots.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:41941:24"/>
            <p>Is not <hi>the anger of a King death?</hi> and is the anger of the King of all Kings, a matter ſo lightly to be regarded as we doe regard it, which for our ſinnes are ſo wretchleſſe, that we ſlugge and ſleep it out? As <hi>wax melteth away at the heat of the fire</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) ſo doe <hi>the wicked periſh at the face or countenance of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>This gift God gave unto us Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, before all Nations under the Sunne, and that of their exceeding love towards us. But alas, alas; for our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe ſake, for our ſinne ſake, for our carnality and prophane living, Gods anger hath touched, not only the body, but alſo the mind of our King, by a long ſickneſſe, and at length hath taken him away by death; death, cruell death, fearefull death, O, if Gods judgement be begun on him, which as he was the chiefeſt, ſo I think the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and godlieſt in the Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (alas) what will it be on us, whoſe ſinnes have overgrowne ſo our heads, that they are climed up to heaven? I pray you (my good brethren know, that Gods anger towards us for our ſinnes cannot but be great: yea, too fell, in that we ſee it was ſo great, that our good King could not beare it. What befell Jewry, after the death of <hi>Joſias?</hi> Lord ſave England, and give us repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: my heart will not ſuffer me to tarry longer herein: I hope this will cauſe ſome repentance.</p>
            <p>If therefore the prayer for Gods
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41941:29"/>feare, the looking in God's glaſſe, and the tagge thereto will not burſt open the blockiſh heart, yet hope I, that the repetition of theſe examples; eſpecially of our late King, and this troubleſome time, will move ſome teares out of thine heart, if thou wilt pray for Gods Spirit accordingly. For who art thou (think alwaies with thy ſelfe) that God ſhould ſpare thee more then them, whoſe examples thou haſt heard? What friends haſt thou? Were not of theſe Kings, Prophets, Apoſtles, learned, and come of holy ſtocks? I deceive my ſelfe (think thou with thy ſelfe) if I believe that God, being the ſame God that he was, will ſpare me; whoſe wickedneſſe is no leſſe, but much more then ſome of theirs. He hateth ſinne now as much as ever he did. The longer he ſpareth, the greater vengeance will fall: the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he draweth his Bow, the ſorer will his ſhaft pierce.</p>
            <p>But if yet thy heart be ſo hardned, that all this will not move thee; then ſurely art thou in a very evill eſtate, and remedy now I know none. What, ſay I, none? Know I none? Yes, there is one,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41941:29"/>which is ſuresby, as they ſay, to ſerve, if any thing will ſerve: You look to know what this is forſooth, the Paſſion, and Death of Jeſus Chriſt. You know, the cauſe, why Chriſt became man, and ſuffered as he ſuffered, was the <hi>ſinnes of his People,</hi> that he might ſave them from the ſame.</p>
            <p>Conſider the greatneſſe of the ſore, I mean ſinne, by the greatneſſe of the Chyrurgion, and the ſalve. Who was the Chyrurgion? no Angel, no ſaint, no Arch-angel, no power, no creature in heaven nor earth: but only he, by whom all things were made, all things are ruled alſo; even Gods own Deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and only beloved ſonne, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man.</p>
            <p>Oh what a great thing is this, that could not be done by the Angells, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, Potentates, powers, or all the creatures of God, without his own ſonne? who of neceſſity muſt come down from heaven, to take our nature, and become man. Here have ye the Chyrurgion: great was the cure, that this mighty Lord took in hand.</p>
            <p>Now, what was the ſalve? certainly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41941:30"/>of an uneſtimable value, and of many compoſitions: I cannot recite all, but rather muſt leave it to your hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, Thirty three yeares was he curing our ſore: he ſought it earneſtly, by faſting, watching, praying, &amp;c. The ſame night that he was betrayed, I read how buſy he was about a plaiſter in the Garden, when he lying flat on the ground, praying with teares, and that of blood not a few, but ſo many as did flow down on the ground againe; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this ſort, <hi>Father</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if it be poſſible, let this cup depart from me.</hi> That is, if it be poſſible, that elſe the ſinnes of man kind can be taken away, grant that it may be ſo. Thou heardeſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> crying for the Idolaters: thou heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Lot</hi> for the <hi>Zoarites: Samuel, David,</hi> and many other, for the Iſraelites. And, deare Father, I onely am thine own Sonne, as thou haſt ſaid, <hi>in whom thou art well pleaſed:</hi> wilt thou not heare me? I have by the ſpace of thirty three years, done alwaies thy will: I have ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled my ſelfe, that I would become an <hi>abject amongſt men,</hi> to obay thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (deere Father) if it be poſſible
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41941:30"/>grant my requeſt, ſave man-kind, now without any farther labour, ſalves, or plaiſters. <hi>But yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Sir, what heard he? Though he <hi>ſweat blood and water,</hi> in making his plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for our ſore of ſinne, yet it framed not. Twice he cryed without comfort; yea, though to comfort him God ſent an Angel, we know that yet this plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was not allowed for ſufficient, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hereunto, Chriſt Jeſus, was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, forſaken of all his Diſciples, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne of his dearely beloved, bound like a Theefe, belyed on, buffeted, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, ſcourged, crowned with thornes, crucified, racked, nailed, hanged up be, tween two theeves, curſed and railed upon, mocked in miſery, and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up the ghoſt; <hi>then bowed downe the head of Chriſt,</hi> then God the Father which is the head of Chriſt; allowed the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to be ſufficient and good for the healing of our ſore, which is ſinne. Now would God abide our breath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtinke, damnation, guiltineſſe, was taken away, by the ſweet ſavour of the breath of this Lambe, thus <hi>offered once for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41941:31"/>
            <p>So that here, dearely beloved, we as in a glaſſe may ſee, to the bruiſing of our blockiſh hard hearts, Gods great judgement and anger againſt ſinne. The <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> the King <hi>of</hi> Kings, the <hi>brightneſſe</hi> of Gods glory, the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, the dearling of his Father, in <hi>whom he is well pleaſed,</hi> hangeth betweene two Theeves, crying for thee and mee, and for us all; <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh hard hearts that we have, who delight in ſinne. Look on this, ſee the very heart of Chriſt pierced with a fpeare, wherein thou maiſt ſee, and read Gods anger for ſinne. Woe to thy hard heart that pierced it.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the firſt part of Repentance, I meane, for the meanes of working contrition. Firſt uſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. then look on Gods Law: thirdly, ſee his curſe: fourthly, ſet examples of his anger before thee: and laſt of all, ſet before thee the precious death of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>From this and prayer ceaſe not, till thou feele ſome hearty ſorrow for thy ſin. The which when thou feeleſt,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41941:31"/>then labour for the other part, that is, faith, in this ſort.</p>
            <p>As firſt in contrition I willed thee not to truſt to thy free will, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it: ſo doe I will thee in this. Faith is ſo farre from the reach of mans free-will, that to reaſon it is plain foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe. Therefore, thou muſt firſt goe to God, whoſe <hi>gift it is;</hi> thou muſt I ſay, get thee to the <hi>Father of mercy,</hi> whoſe worke it is, that as he hath brought thee downe by Contrition, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thee, ſo he would give thee Faith, raiſe thee up, and exalt thee.</p>
            <p>In this manner therefore, with the Apoſtles, and the poore man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel that cryed, <hi>Lord increaſe our Faith; Lord help my unbeleefe,</hi> pray thou and ſay, <hi>O mercifull and deare Father, of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in whom, as thou art well pleaſed, ſo haſt thou commanded us to hear him. for as much as he often biddeth us to aske of thee, and thereto promiſeth that thou will heare us, and grant us that which in his name we ſhall aske of thee. loe, gracious Father, I am bold to begge of thy mercy, through thy Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, one ſparkle of true and certaine perſwaſion of thy goodneſſe and love towards
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41941:32"/>mee in Chriſt, where through, I being aſſured of the Pardon of all my ſinnes, by the mercies of Chriſt thy Sonne, may be thankefull to thee, love thee and ſerve thee in holineſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe all the daies of my life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this ſort, I ſay, or otherwiſe, as God ſhall move thee, pray thou firſt of all, and look for thy requeſt at Gods hand, without any doubting, though forthwith thou feeleſt not the ſame; for oftentimes we have things of God given us, long before we feele them as we would doe. Now unto this prayer, uſe thou theſe means following.</p>
            <p>After prayer for Faith, which I would ſhould be firſt; Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame ſpringeth out of the hearing, not of Maſſe, Mattins, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Councells, Doctors, Decrees, but out of the hearing of Gods word, get Gods word; but, not that part which ſerveth ſpecially to Contrition; that is, the Law: but the other part, which ſerveth ſpecially to conſolation and certain perſwaſions of Gods love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, that is, the Goſpell or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of Gods mercy in Chriſt, I mean the free promiſes.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:41941:32"/>
            <p>But here thou muſt know, that there are two kindes of promiſes; one, which is properly of the Law, another of the Goſpel. In the promiſes of the Law, we may indeed behold Gods mercy, but ſo, that it hangeth upon the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our worthineſſe, as if thou love the Lord withall thy heart, &amp;c. thou ſhalt find mercy. This kind of promiſe though it declare unto us Gods love, which promiſeth where he needeth not: yet unto him that feeleth not Chriſt, <hi>which is the end of the Law,</hi> they are ſo farre from comforting, that utterly with the Law they bring man to great deſpaire; ſo greatly we are corrupt, for none ſo loveth God as he ought to doe, From theſe therefore get thee to the other promiſes of the Goſpel, in which we may ſee ſuch plenty, and franke li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of Gods goodneſſe, that we cannot but be much comforted, though we have very deeply ſinned. For theſe promiſes of the Goſpel doe not hang on the condition of our worthineſſe, as the promiſes of the Law doe; but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and hang on Gods truth, that as God is true, ſo they cannot but be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41941:33"/>to all them which lay hold on them by Faith; I had almoſt ſaid, which caſt them not away by unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>Marke in them therefore two things; namely, that as well they are free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, without any condition of our worthineſſe, as alſo that they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally offered to all (I ſay) which are not ſo ſtubborne, as to keep ſtill their hands, whereby they ſhould receive this almes in their boſomes, by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. As concerning Infants and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you know I now ſpeak not; but concerning ſuch as be of years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and under the Goſpel. And now you look that I ſhould give you a taſt of theſe promiſes, which are both free and univerſall: except none but ſuch as except themſelves. Well, you ſhall have one or two for a ſay.</p>
            <p>In the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>John</hi> ſaith our Saviour! <hi>So God the Father loved the World,</hi> that he would give his Deareling, his one only ſonne, that <hi>all that believe in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life.</hi> Loe, Sir, he ſaith not, that ſome might have life? but all ſaith he. And what all? all that love him with all their hearts? all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41941:33"/>that have lived a good life? Nay all that beleeve in him. Although thou haſt lived a moſt wicked and horrible life, if now thou believe in him, thou ſhalt bee ſaved, Is not this ſweet grace?</p>
            <p>Againe, ſaith Chriſt: <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are laden, and I will refreſh you.</hi> Let us a little look on this letter, <hi>Come unto mee,</hi> Who ſhall come? Lords, Prieſts, Holy men, Monkes, Friars? yea, Coblers, Tinkers, Whores, Theeves, Murtherers alſo, if they lament their ſinnes. Come unto mee (ſaith he) all ye that labour and are laden; that is, which are afraid and weary of your ſinnes. And what wilt thou doe, Lord? <hi>And I ſhall refreſh you</hi> ſaith he.</p>
            <p>Oh what a thing is this: <hi>And I will refreſh you?</hi> Wot you who ſpake this? He that never told lie: He is the <hi>truth,</hi> there was <hi>never guile found in his mouth:</hi> and now will he be untrue to thee (good brother) which art ſorry for thy greivous ſinnes? No forſooth, <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth ſhall paſſe, and periſh, but his word ſhall never faile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>God would have all men
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41941:34"/>ſaved.</hi> Loe, he excepteth none.

I ſpeak not now of Infants, I ſay, nor need I enter into the matter of Predeſtination. In preaching of repentance, I would <hi>gather</hi> where I could with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As ſurely as I live,</hi> (ſaith God') <hi>I will not the death of a ſinner.</hi> art thou a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Yea: Loe, God ſweareth, he will not thy death. How canſt thou now periſh? Conſider with thy ſelfe, what profit thou ſhouldeſt have, to believe this to be true to others, if not, to thy ſelfe alſo: <hi>Sathan doth ſo.</hi> Rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with Peter; that the promiſe of Salvation pertaineth not only to them which are nigh, or to ſuch as are falne a little: but alſo to all, to whom the Lord <hi>hath called,</hi> be they never ſo farre off.</p>
            <p>Loe, nowby me, the Lord calleth thee, thou Man, thou Woman, that art very farre off. The promiſe therefore pertaineth to thee, needs muſt thou be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41941:34"/>ſaved, except thou with Satan ſay, God is falſe. and if thou doe ſo, <hi>God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and cannot deny himſelfe:</hi> as thou ſhalt feele by his plagues in hell, for ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring God, to think that he is not true. Will he be found falſe now? The matter hangeth not on thy worthineſſe, but it hangeth on God's truth. Clap hold on it, and I warrant thee, Chriſt is the <hi>propitiation for our ſinnes; yea for the ſins of the whole World,</hi> of Jew and Gentiles; believe this, Man; I know thou belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt it: ſay therefore in thy heart ſtill, <hi>Domine adauge mihi fidem,</hi> Lord encreaſe my faith: Lord help my unbeleefe. Bleſſed <hi>are they which ſee not</hi> (by reaſon) <hi>this but yet believe:</hi> Beloved, we <hi>muſt hope above hope,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> did.</p>
            <p>And thus much for a taſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which are every where, not only in the new Teſtament, but alſo in the Old. Read the laſt end of <hi>Leviticus</hi> 26. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30. Where he ſaith, <hi>God tarryeth looking for thee to ſhew thee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> alſo the 40, and ſo forth to the 60. Read alſo 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 33. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Howbeit if all this will not ſerve,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41941:35"/>and if yet thou feeleſt no faith, no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſwaſion of Gods love; then prepare thy ſelfe unto Prayer, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent conſidering of the free and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall promiſes of the Goſpel. Thirdly ſet before thee thoſe bleſſings which heretofore, and at this preſent, God hath given thee. Conſider, how he hath made thee a Man or a Woman, which might have made thee a Toade, or a Dogge; And why did he this? Verily, becauſe he loved thee. and thinkeſt thou, if he loved thee when thou waſt not, to make thee ſuch a one, as he moſt graciouſly hath; and will he not now love thee, being his handy work? Doth he hate any thing that he made? Is there unableneſſe with him? Doth he love for a day, and ſo farewell? No, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>God loveth to the end,</hi> his <hi>mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever.</hi> Say therefore with <hi>Job. Operi manum tuarum, porrige dextram,</hi> that is, to the work of thy hands, put thy helping hand.</p>
            <p>Againe, hath he not made thee a Chriſtian Man or Woman, where if he would he might have made thee a Turk or Pagan? This thou know'ſt he did of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41941:35"/>love, and doſt thou think his love is leſſened, if thou lament thy ſinne? Is <hi>his hand ſhortned for helping thee? Can a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man forget the child of her wombe? and though ſhe ſhould, yet will not I forget thee, ſaith the Lord.</hi> He hath given thee limbes, he hath given thee witt, reaſon, diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. to See, heare, goe, &amp;c. He hath long ſpared thee, and borne with thee, when thou never purpoſed'ſt to repent: and now thou repenting, will he not give thee mercy? Wherefore doth he grant thee to live at this preſent, to heare him to ſpeak this, and mee to ſpeak this but of love to us all? Oh, therefore let us pray him, that he would adde to this, that we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe love-tokens, that he loveth us, and indeed he will doe it. Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our eyes in thy gifts, to ſee thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious goodneſſe, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to tarry in this I will not. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man conſider Gods benefits, paſt and preſent, publike and private, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and corporall, to the confirming of his faith, concerning the promiſes of the Goſpel, for the pardon of his ſinnes.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:41941:36"/>
            <p>I will now goe about to ſhew you a fourth meane to confirme your faith in this, even by examples. Of theſe there are in the Scriptures very many; as alſo daily experience doth diverſely teach the ſame, if we were diligent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve things accordingly; wherefore, I will be more breefe herein, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to time, which ſtealeth faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe tranſgreſſed grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly, as the painfull puniſhment, which we all as yet feele, proveth, if nothing elſe. Though by reaſon of his ſinne, he diſpleaſed God ſore, and ranne away from God, (for he would have hid himſelfe; yea, he would have made God the cauſer of his ſinne, in that he gave him ſuch a Mate, ſo farre was he from asking mercy) yet all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, God turned his fierce wrath, neither upon him nor <hi>Eve,</hi> which alſo required not mercy; but upon the Serpent Sathan: promiſing unto them a <hi>ſeed, Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> by whom, they at the length ſhould be delivered. In to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken whereof, though they were caſt out of Paradiſe for their nurture, to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41941:36"/>ſerve in ſorrow, which would not ſerve in joy; yet he made them apparel to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their nakedneſſe; a viſible docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and token of his inviſible love and grace, concerning their ſoules. If God was ſo mercifull to <hi>Adam,</hi> which ſo ſore brake his commandement, and rather blamed God then asked mercy; Thinkeſt thou, O man, that he will not be mercifull to thee, which blameſt thy ſelfe and deſireſt pardon?</p>
            <p>To <hi>Cain</hi> he offered mercy if he would have asked it, <hi>What haſt thou done, ſaith God? the voyce of thy Brothers blood, Cryeth unto me out of the earth.</hi> O mercifull Lord (ſhould <hi>Cain</hi> have ſaid) I confeſſe it; But a las he did not ſo, and therefore, ſaid God; Now, that is, in that thou deſireſt not mercy; <hi>Now,</hi> I ſay, <hi>be thou accurſed &amp;c.</hi> Loe, to the reprobate he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered mercy, and will he deny it thee, which art his child?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Noah</hi> did he not ſinne and was drunk? good <hi>Lot</hi> alſo, both in <hi>Sodom</hi> diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a little with the Angels, <hi>prolonging the time;</hi> and out of Sodome he fell very foule; as did <hi>Judah</hi> and the Patriarks againſt <hi>Joſeph;</hi> but yet I ween they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41941:37"/>found mercy. <hi>Moſes, Myriam, Aaron,</hi> though they ſtumbled a little, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they mercy: Yea, the people in the wilderneſſe often ſinned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed God, ſo that he was purpoſed to have deſtroyed them. <hi>Let me alone</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>that I may deſtroy them.</hi> But <hi>Moſes</hi> did not let him alone, for he prayed ſtill for them, and therefore God ſpared them. If the people were ſpared, through. <hi>Moſes</hi> prayer, they not praying with him, but rather worſhiping their golden Calfe, eating &amp; drinking, &amp; making jolly good cheere: Beloved, why ſhouldeſt thou doubt whether God will be mercifull to thee? having as indeed thou haſt, one much better then <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for thee &amp; with thee, even Jeſus Chriſt, who <hi>ſitteth on the right hand of his Father, and prayeth for us,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſſe faithfull in his Fathers houſe, the Church, then <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the Synagogue. <hi>David,</hi> that good King, had a foule foile, when he committed Whoredome with his faithfull ſervants wife, <hi>Bethſheba;</hi> whereunto he added alſo a miſchievous murther, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her husband, his moſt faithfull

            <p>In this ſinne though a great while he lay aſleepe (as many doe now adaies, God give them good waking) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by the Sacrifices he offered, all was well, God was content: yet at length, when the Prophet, by a Parable, opened the offence, and brought <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in remembrance of his own ſinne, and in ſuch ſort, that he gave judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt himſelfe; then quaked he, his Sacrifices had no more taken away his ſinnes, then our Sir <hi>Johns Trentals,</hi> and wagging of his fingers over the heads of ſuch as lie aſleepe in their ſinnes (out of the which when they are awaked, they will ſee, that it is neither Maſſe nor Mattins, bleſſing nor curſing will ſerve) then I ſay, he cryed out, ſaying, <hi>Peccavi Domine, I have ſinned</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>againſt my Lord and good God,</hi> which hath done ſo much for me; I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed indeed <hi>

But what ſaith God, by this Prophet: <hi>Dominus tranſtulit pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum tuum, non morieris;</hi> The Lord hath taken away thy ſinnes, thon ſhalt not dye. O good God, he ſaid, but <hi>Peccavi,</hi> I have ſinned: but yet from his heart, and not from his lips only, as <hi>Pharavh</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> did, and incontinently he heareth; <hi>Thou ſhalt not dye, the Lord hath taken away thy ſinnes:</hi> Or rather, hath laid them upon the back of his ſonne Jeſus Chriſt, who bare them, and not only them, but thine and mine alſo, if that we will now cry but from our hearts, <hi>Peccavimus,</hi> we have ſinned, good Lord we have done wickedly, enter not into judgement with us, but be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto us after <hi>thy great mercy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of thy compaſſions, doe away our iniquities,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </expan> invocaver it nomen Domini, ſalvus erit.</hi> He or ſhee, whoſoever they be that call upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved. In confirmation whereof, this Hiſtory is written, as are alſo the other
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41941:38"/>which I have recited, and many more which I might recite. As of <hi>manaſſes</hi> the wicked King, which ſlew <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet, and wrought very much wickedneſſe; yet the Lord ſhewed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon him. being in priſon, as his prayer doth teach us. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> though for a time he bare Gods anger, yet at the length he found much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</p>
            <p>The City of Ninivie alſo found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, as did many other, which for brevity I will omit, and will bring forth one or two out of the New Teſtament, that we may ſee God to be the ſame God in the New Teſtament, that he was in the Old.</p>
            <p>I might tell you of many, if I ſhould ſpeake of the Lunatick, ſuch as were poſſeſſed with Divels, Lame, Blind, dumb, deaf, lepers, &amp;c. but time will not ſuffer me, therefore, one or two ſhall ſerve. <hi>Mary Magdalen had ſeven Divels,</hi> but yet they were caſt out of her: and of all others, ſhe was the <hi>firſt</hi> that Chriſt appeared unto, after his reſurrection. <hi>Thomas</hi> would not believe Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, though many told him, which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41941:39"/>had ſeen and felt him: by reaſon whereof, a man might have thought that his ſinnes would have caſt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. <hi>Except I ſhould ſee and feele</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will not believe.</hi> Ah wilfull <hi>Thomas;</hi> I will not, ſaith he, but Chriſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto him, and would not looſe him, neither will he thee, beloved, if with <hi>Thomas,</hi> thou wilt keepe company with the Diſciples, as <hi>Thomas</hi> did. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> fall was ugly he accurſed himſelfe, if ever he knew Chriſt, and that for feare of a Maiden, and lyed not once, but three ſeverall times, and that in the hearing of Chriſt his Maſter; but yet the third time Chriſt looked back, and caſt on him his eye of grace, ſo that he went out and wept bitterly. And after Chriſts reſurrection, not only did the Angels will the Woman to tell <hi>Peter,</hi> that Chriſt was riſen, but Chriſt himſelfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto him; ſuch a good Lord is he.</p>
            <p>The Theefe hanging on the Croſſe, ſaid thus; <hi>Lord when thou comeſt into thy Kingdome, remember mee;</hi> And what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer had he? <hi>This day</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41941:39"/>is this, in that he is now the ſame Chriſt to thee and mee, and to us all, if we will runne unto him? for he is the ſame. <hi>Chriſt to day and to morrow, untill he come to judgement,</hi> Then indeed, he will be inexorable; but now is he more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give then we to aske. If thou cry, he <hi>heareth thee even before thou cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Crie therefore, behold, man, <note place="margin">Iſai 31. Mat. 7.</note> he is not partiall. <hi>Call,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I will he are thee; aske and thou ſhalt have; ſeeke and thou ſhalt finde;</hi> though not at the firſt, yet at the length. If he tarry a while, it is but to try thee. <hi>Nam veniens veniet, &amp; non tardabit;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> He is coming and will not be long.</p>
            <p>Thus have you foure meanes, which you muſt uſe to the attaining of faith, or certain perſwaſion of Gods mercy towards you, which is the ſecond part of repentance; namely, prayer, the free and univerſall promiſes of Gods graces, the recordation of the benefits of God, paſt and preſent, the examples of Gods mercy. Which although they might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, yet will I put one more to them, which only of it ſelfe, is full ſufficient; I meane, the death of the Sonne of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41941:40"/>God, Jeſus Chriſt; which if thou ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of thy mind, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme thy aſſurance; for it is the great Seale of England, as they ſay; yea, of all the World, for the confirmation of all Patents and perpetuities of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, whereunto we are all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>If I thought theſe, which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recited, were not ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme your faith of Gods love towards ſuch as doe repent, I would tarry lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger herein. But becauſe I have been both long, and alſo I truſt, you have ſome exerciſe of conſcience in this dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (or elſe you are to blame) I will but touch and goe, conſider with your ſelves what we are, miſers, wretches, and enemies to God. Conſider what God is, even he which hath all power, maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, might, glory, riches, &amp;c. perfectly of himſelfe, and needeth nothing, but hath all things. Conſider what Chriſt is, concerning his God-head, coequall <hi>with his Father,</hi> even he by whom all things were made; he, I ſay, by whom all things are ruled and governed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Man-hood, the onely Deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41941:40"/>of his Father, in whom is all his joy. Now Syr, what a love is this? that this God which needeth nothing, would give wholly his own ſelfe to thee, his enemy, wreaking his wrath upon himſelfe, in this his ſonne: as a man may ſay, to ſpare thee, to ſave thee, to win thee, to bye thee, to have thee, to enjoy thee for ever. Becauſe thy ſinne hath ſeperated thee from him, to the end thou mighteſt come eftſoones into his company againe, and therein remaine; he himſelfe became, as a man would ſay, a ſinner; or rather ſinne it ſelfe, even a malediction or curſe: that wee ſinners, we accurſed by our ſinne, might by his oblation or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for our ſinnes, by his curſe, be delivered from ſinne and from maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For by ſinne he deſtroyed ſinne, killing Death, Sathan, and ſinne, by their own weapons; and that for thee and mee (man) if we caſt it not away by unbeliefe. Oh wonderfull love of God. Who ever heard of ſuch a love? The Father of Heaven for us his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to give hís own dearly beloved Sonne, Jeſus Chriſt, and that not only
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41941:41"/>to be our brother, to dwell among us: but alſo, to the <hi>death of the Croſſe</hi> for us? Oh wonderfull love of Chriſt to us all, that was content and willing to work this deed for us. Was there any love like to this love?</p>
            <p>God indeed hath commended his charity and love to us herein, <hi>that when we were very enemies unto him, he would give his own ſonne for us,</hi> That we being men, might become, as you would ſay, Gods; God would become man, That we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortall, might become immortall, the immortall God would become mortall man. That we earthly wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches might be Cittizens of Heaven, the Lord of Heaven would become, as a man would ſay, earthly. That we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accurſed, might be bleſſed, God would be accurſed. That we by our father <hi>Adam,</hi> being brought out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, into the puddle of all pain, migh be redeemed, and brought into Paradiſe againe, God would be our Father and an <hi>Adam,</hi> thereunto. That we having nothing, might have all things; God having all things, would have nothing. That we being vaſſailes,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41941:41"/>and ſlaves to all, even to Sathan the Fiend, might be Lords of all, and of Sathan: The Lord of all would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a vaſſaile, and a ſlave to us all, and in danger of Sathan. Oh love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible. Who can otherwiſe think now, but if the gracious good Lord diſdained not to give his own Sonne, his own hearts joy for us his very enemies, before we thought to beg any ſuch thing at his hands; yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were? Who, I ſay, can think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but that with him, he <hi>will give us all good things.</hi> If when we hated him and fled away from him, he ſent his Sonne to ſeek us: who can think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then that now we loving him, and lamenting, becauſe we love him no more, but that he will for ever love us? He that giveth the more to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, will he not give the leſſe to his friends? God hath given his own Son, then which nothing is greater; even to us his enemies: and we now being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his friends, will he deny us faith and pardon of our ſinnes? which though they be great, yet in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are nothing at all to the price
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41941:42"/>given, Chriſt Jeſus would give his own ſelfe for us, when we willed it not: and will he now deny us Faith, if we will it? This will is his earneſt, that he hath given us truly to look indeed, for the thing willed. And look thou for it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: for as he hath <hi>given thee to will, ſo will he give thee to doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt gave his life for our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and by his death he delivered us. O then, in that he liveth now, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dye, will he forſake us? his heart blood was not too deare for us, when we asked it not: what can then be now too deare for us, asking it? Is he a changeling? Is he mutable as a man is: Can he repent him of his gifts? Did he not foreſee our falls? Paid not he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the price? Becauſe he ſaw we ſhould fall ſore, therefore would he ſuffer ſore. Yea, if his ſuffering had not been enough, he would yet once more come again. God the Father, I may ſay, if the death of his ſonne incarnate. would not ſerve, would himſelfe and the Holy Ghoſt alſo become incarnate, and dye for us.</p>
            <p>This Death of Chriſt therefore look
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41941:42"/>on, as the very pledge of Gods love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, whoſoever thou art, how deepe ſoever thou haſt ſinned. See, Gods hands are nailed, they cannot ſtrike thee; his feet alſo, he cannot run from thee; his armes are wide open to embrace thee: his head hangs down to kiſſe thee: his very heart is open, ſo that therein looke; nay even ſee, and thou ſhalt ſee nothing therein, but love, love, love, love to thee: hide thee there, lay thy head there with the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt.</p>
            <p>This is the clift of the Rock, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Elias</hi> ſtood. This is for all aking heads a pillow of downe.</p>
            <p>Anoint thy head with this oile, let this oyntment embalme thy head, and waſh thy face.</p>
            <p>Tarry thou on this firme rock, and Ile warrant thee. Say with <hi>Paul, What can ſeparate me from the love of God? can death, can poverty, can ſickneſſe, hunger,</hi> or any miſery, perſwade thee now that God loveth thee not? Nay, nothing can ſeperate thee from the love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath loved thee in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; whom he loveth he loveth to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41941:43"/>end. So that now where abundance of ſin hath been in thee, the more is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of grace. But to what end? Certainly, that as ſinne hath reigned to death, as thou ſeeſt, to the killing of Gods Sonne; ſo now <hi>Grace muſt raigne to life,</hi> to the honouring of Gods Sonne, who is now alive and cannot dye any more.</p>
            <p>So that they which by faith feele this cannot any more dye to God, but to ſinne, whereto they are <hi>dead and buried with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Chriſt therefore liveth, ſo doe they, and that to God, to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe, The life which they live, is, <hi>In fide Filii Dei:</hi> in the faith of the Sonne of God, whereby you ſee that now I am ſlipt into that, which I made the third part of repentance: namely, newneſſe of life, which I could not ſo have done, if that it were a part of it ſelfe indeed, it is an effect or fruit of the ſecond part; that is, of faith, or truſt in Gods mercy. For he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, that is, is certainly perſwaded, ſinne to be ſuch a thing, that is the cauſe of all miſery, and of it ſelfe ſo greatly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41941:43"/>angreth God, that in Heaven nor in earth, nothing could appeaſe his wrath; ſave onely the death and precious bloodſhedding of the Sonne of God, in whom is all the delight and pleaſure of the Father: he, I ſay, that is perſwaded thus of his ſinne; the ſame cannot but in heart abhorre and quake to doe or ſay; yea, to think any thing willingly, which Gods Law teacheth him to be ſinne.</p>
            <p>Again, he that beleeveth, that is, is certainly perſwaded, Gods love to be ſo much towards him, that where through ſinne he was loſt, and made a firebrand of Hell; the eternall Father of mercy, which is the omni-ſufficient God, and needeth nothing in us, or of any thing that we can doe, to deliver us out of Hell, and to bring us into Heaven; did ſend even his own moſt deare Sonne out of his boſome, out of heaven into hell (as a man would ſay) to bring us, as I ſaid, from thence into his own boſome and mercy, we being his very enemies: he I ſay, that is thus perſwaded of Gods love towards him, and of the price of his redemption, by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41941:44"/>the deare blood of the Lamb immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but love God againe; and of love doe that, and heartily deſire to doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the which might pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Think you, that ſuch a one know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things by Faith, will willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſt and wallow in his wilfull luſts, pleaſures and fantaſies? Will ſuch a one as knoweth by Faith, Chriſt Jeſus to have given his blood to waſh him from his ſinnes play <hi>the Sow</hi> to nuzle in his puddle of filthy ſinne and vice againe? Nay, rather then he will be defiled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by his wilfull ſinning, he will waſh often the feet of his affections, watching over the vice ſtill ſticking in him; which as a ſpring, continually ſendeth out poyſon enough to drowne and defile him, if the ſweet water of Chriſts paſſion in Gods ſight, did not waſh it, and his blood ſatisfy the rigour of Gods juſtice due for the ſame.</p>
            <p>This blood of Chriſt ſhed for our ſinnes, is ſo deare in the ſight of him that beleeveth, that he will abhorre in his heart to ſtamp it, and tread it under his feet.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:41941:44"/>
            <p>He knoweth now by his beleefe, that it is too much, that hitherto he hath ſet too little by it, and is aſhamed thereof. Therefore for the reſidue of his life; he purpoſeth to take better heed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then before he did. Becauſe he ſeeth by his faith, the grievouſneſſe of Gods anger, the fouleneſſe of ſin, the greatneſſe of Gods mercy, and of Chriſts love towards him, he will now be heedy to pray unto God to give him his grace accordingly; that as with his eyes, and tongue, hands and feet, &amp;c. he hath diſpleaſed God, doing his own will: even ſo now with the ſame eyes, tongue, &amp;c. he may diſpleaſe his own ſelfe, and doe Gods will: Willingly will he not doe that which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the death of the ſonne of God. He knoweth he hath too much ſinne, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly in him, ſo that thereto he will not adde willing offences.</p>
            <p>This willing and witting, offending &amp; ſinning, whoſoever doth flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe therein; doth evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and ſhew, that he never yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, taſted of Chriſt truly. He was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truely perſwaded or beleeved, how
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41941:45"/>foule a thing ſinne is, how grievous a thing Gods anger is, how joyfull and precious a thing, Gods mercy in Chriſt is, how exceeding broad, wide, high, and deepe Chriſts love is: Perchance he can talke and Preach of Faith, but yet truly in heart he never felt it effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for if he did once feele this raviſhing conſolation indeed, then would he be ſo farre from continuing in ſinne, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and wittingly, that wholly and heartily he would give over himſelfe to that which is contrary, I meane to a new life, renewing his youth, even as the Eagle doth. For as we, being in the ſervitude of ſinne, demonſtrate our ſervice, by <hi>giving over our members to the obaying of ſinne, from iniquity to iniquity: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo we being made free from ſinne, by faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and endued with Gods ſpirit, a <hi>ſpirit of liberty,</hi> muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate this freedome and liberty, by giving <hi>over our members to the obedience of the ſpirit: by the which we are lead and guided from vertue to vertue, and all kind of holineſſe.</hi> As the unbelievers declare their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, by the working of the evill ſpirit in them, in the outward fruits of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41941:45"/>fleſh: even ſo the believers declare their faith, by the working of Gods Spirit in them outwardly the fruits of the Spirit. For as the Divell is not dead in thoſe which are his, but worketh ſtill to their damnation: ſo is not God dead in them which be his, but worketh ſtill to their ſalvation: The which working is not the cauſe of the one or the other being in any; but only a demonſtration, a ſigne, a fruit of the ſame: As the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> is not the cauſe of the Apple tree, but the fruit of it.</p>
            <p>Thus then you ſee briefely that new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, is not indeed a part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but a fruit of it, a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the juſtifying faith, a ſigne of Gods good ſpirit poſſeſſing the heart of the penitent: as the old life is a fruit of impenitency, a demonſtration of a lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faith, or unbeliefe, a ſigne of Sathans ſpirit, poſſeſſing the heart of the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, which all thoſe be, that be not penitent.</p>
            <p>For meane I know none; He that is not penitent, the ſame is impenitent; he that is not governed by Gods ſpirit, the ſame is governed by Sathans Spirit.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41941:46"/>For all that be Chriſtians are governed with the ſpirit of Chriſt, which ſpirit hath its fruits. All other that be not Chriſts, are the Divels. <hi>He that gathereth not with Chriſt ſcattereth abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore my dearely beloved, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to conſider this, and deceive not your ſelves. If you be not Chriſts, then pertaine you to the Divel; of which things the fruits of the fleſh doth aſſure you, as whoredome, adultery, uncleanneſſe, wantonneſſe, idolatry, witch-craft, envy, ſtrife, contention, wrath, ſedition, murther, drunkenneſſe, gluttony, blaſphemy, ſlothfulneſſe, vaine talking, ſlandering &amp;c. If ſuch like fruit as theſe grow out of the trees of your hearts; ſurely, ſurely, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell is at Inne with you, you are his birds, whom when he hath well fed, he will broach you, and eat you, chaw you and champ you, world without end, in eternall woe and miſery. But I am otherwiſe perſwaded of you all. I truſt you be all Chriſt Jeſus his people, and his children; yea, and his brethren by faith.</p>
            <p>As you ſee your ſins in Gods Law,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41941:46"/>and tremble, and ſigh, ſorrow and ſob for the ſame: even ſo you ſee his great mercies in his Goſpel and free promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and therefore are glad, merry and joyfull, for that you are accepted into Gods favour, have your ſins pardoned, and are endued with the good ſpirit of God, even the ſeale and ſigne Manuel of your election in Chriſt Jeſus, even before the <hi>beginning of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The which ſpirit, for that he is the Spirit of life, is given to you, to work in you, with you, and by you, here in this life ſanctification and holineſſe, whereunto you are called, that ſo ye might <hi>be holy even as your heavenly father is holy.</hi> I beſeech you all by admonition and warning of you, that you would <hi>ſtirre up the gifts of God,</hi> given to you ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and particularly, to the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Church, that is; I pray you that you would not moleſt the good Spirit of God, by rebelling againſt it, when it provoketh and calleth you to goe on forward, that he <hi>which is holy, might yet be more holy, he which is righteous, might be more righteous;</hi> as the evill ſpirit moveth and ſtirreth up the filthy to be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41941:47"/>yet more filthy, the covetous, to be more covetous, the wicked to be more wicked.</p>
            <p>Declare you now your repentance, by workes of repentance, Bring forth fruits, and worthy fruits.</p>
            <p>Let your ſorrowing for your evils, demonſtrate it ſelfe, departing from the evils you have uſed.</p>
            <p>Let your certainty of pardon of your ſins, through Chriſt, and your joy in him be demonſtrated, by purſuing of the good things which Gods word teacheth you. You are now in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gods workmanſhip, to doe good works which God hath prepared for you to walk in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto all men, hath appeared, and teacheth us, that we ſhould deny ungodlineſſe and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, and that we ſhould live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, &amp; godlily, in this preſent world; looking for that bleſſed hope, and glorious appearing of the mighty God, and of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, which gave himſelfe for us, to redeeme us from all unrighteouſneſſe, and to purge us a peculiar people unto himſelfe, fervently given unto good workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again; Titus 3. <hi>For we our ſelves alſo
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41941:47"/>were in times paſt unwiſe, diſobedient, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſerving luſts, and divers pleaſures, living in maliciouſneſſe and envy, full of hate, and hating one another. But after that the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and love of God our Saviour to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, appeared, not by the deeds of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which we wrought, but of his mercy he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us by the fountain of the new birth, and with the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour; that we once juſtified by his grace, ſhould be heires of eternall life, through hope.</hi> This is a true ſaying. But I will make an end for I am too tedious.</p>
            <p>Dearely beloved, repent your ſinnes: that is, be ſorry for that which is paſt, beleeve in Gods mercy for pardon, how deepely ſoever you have ſinned, and both purpoſe, and earneſtly purſue a new life, bringing forth worthy and True fruits of Repentance.</p>
            <p>As you <hi>have given over your members from ſin to ſin,</hi> to ſerve the Divel; your tongues to ſweare, to lye, to flatter, to ſcold, to jeſt, to ſcoffe, to beaſtly talke, to vain jangling, to boaſting, &amp;c. Your hands to picking, griping, idleneſſe, fighting, &amp;c. Your feet to skipping, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41941:48"/>to evill, to dancing, &amp;c. Your eares to heare Fables, lyes, vanities, and evill things, &amp;c. So now, give over your members to godlineſſe, your tongues to ſpeak, your eares to heare, your eyes to ſee, your mouthes to taſt, your hands to worke, your feet to goe about ſuch things as may make to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſobriety of life, and love to your brethren, and that daily more and more, diligently: for in this way to ſtand you cannot, either better or worſe you are to day, then you were yeſterday. But better I truſt you be, and will be if you marke my Theme; that is; repent you. The which thing that you would, as before I have hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſought you: even ſo now, yet once more I doe again beſeech you, and that for the mercies of God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord: Repent you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent you, for the Kingdome of heaven (that is a Kingdome full of riches, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, mirth, beauty, ſweetneſſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall felicity) is at hand. The eye hath not ſeen the like, the eare hath not heard the like, the heart of man cannot conceive the treaſures and pleaſures of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41941:48"/>this Kingdome, which is now at hand to ſuch as Repent; that is, to ſuch as are ſorry for their ſinnes, beleeve Gods mercy, through Chriſt, and earneſtly purpoſe to lead a new life.</p>
            <p>The God of mercy, through Chriſt his Sonne, grant us his holy ſpirit, and work in our hearts this ſorrow, faith, and new life; which through his grace I have ſpoken of, both now and for ever.</p>
            <p>AMEN.</p>
