            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Moſt Reverend Fathers, and Reverend Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe ſpecial Providence of God, and His Majeſties tender regard of the Peace and Conſciences of His Subjects, and his deſire of their concord in the things of God, hath put into our hands this opportunity of ſpeaking to you as humble Petitioners, as well as Commiſſioners, on the behalf of theſe yet troubled and unhealed Churches, and of many thouſand ſouls that are dear to Chriſt; on whoſe behalf, wee are preſſed in ſpirit in the ſenſe of our duty, moſt earneſtly to beſeech you, as you tender the peace and proſperity of theſe Churches, the comfort of His Majeſty in the union of his Subjects, and the peace of your ſouls in the great day of your accounts, that laying by all former and preſent exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and alienating differences, you will not now deny us your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and aſſiſtance to thoſe means that ſhall bee proved honeſt and cheap, and needful to thoſe great, deſirable ends, for which wee all profeſs to have our offices, and our lives.</p>
            <p>The things which wee humbly beg of you are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you will grant what wee have here propoſed and craved
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107960:3"/>
of you in our Preface; Even your charitable interpretation, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of, and conſent unto the alterations and additions to the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy now tendered unto you, that being inſerted, as wee have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it [may bee left to the Miniſters choice to uſe one or other at his diſcretion] upon His Majeſties approbation, according to his gracious declaration concerning Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. And that (ſeeing wee cannot obtain the form of Epiſcopal Government, deſcribed by the late Reverend Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and approved by many Epiſcopal Divines) wee may at leaſt enjoy thoſe benefits of Reformation in Diſcipline, and that freedome from Subſcription, Oaths and Ceremonies, which are granted in the ſaid Declaration, by the means of your charitable Mediation and Requeſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Seeing ſome hundreds of able, holy, faithful Miniſters are of late caſt out, and not onely very many of their Families in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, but (which is of far greater moment) abundance of Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in <hi>England, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> are overſpread with lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ignorance, and are deſtitute of able, faithful Teachers: And ſeeing too many that are inſufficient, negligent, or ſcandalous, are over the Flocks (not meaning this as an accuſation of any that are not guilty, nor a diſhonourable Reflection on any party, much leſs on the whole Church) wee take this opportunity earneſtly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, that you will contribute your indeavours to the Removal of thoſe that are the ſhame and burdens of the Churches; and to the Reſtauration of ſuch as may bee an honour and bleſſing to them. And to that end, that it bee not imputed to them as their unpardonable Crime, that they were born in an Age and Country which required Ordination by Parochial Paſtors, without Dioceſans: And that Re-ordination (whether abſolute or hypothetical) bee not made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the future exerciſe of their Miniſtry. But that an Univerſal Confirmation may bee granted of thoſe ordained as aforeſaid, they being ſtill reſponſible for any perſonal inſufficiency or crime. Were theſe two granted (The Confirmation of the Grants in His Majeſties Declaration, with the liberty of the Reformed Liturgy offered you, and the reſtoring of able, faithful Miniſters to a capacity to bee ſerviceable in the Church of God, without forcing them againſt their conſciences to bee Re-ordained) how great would bee the benefits to this unworthy Nation? How glad would you make the peoples hearts? how thankful ſhould wee bee (for the cauſe of Chriſt, and the ſouls of men) to thoſe that grant them, and procure them; being conſcious that wee ſeek not great things for our ſelves, or for our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107960:3"/>
Brethren; that wee are ambitious of no greater wealth or honour, than our daily bread, with ſuch freedome and advantage for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of our Miniſtry, as may moſt conduce to the ſucceſs, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of holineſs and peace; wee ſhall take the boldneſs to ſecond theſe Requeſts, with many of our reaſons, which wee think ſhould prevail for your conſent, chuſing rather to incur whatſoever cenſures or offence may by any bee taken againſt our neceſſary freedome of expreſſion, than to bee ſilent at ſuch a time as this, when thouſands of the ſervants of the Lord, that are either deprived of their faithful Teachers, or in fears of loſing them, together with the freedome of their conſciences in Gods worſhip, do cry day and night to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for help, and would cry alſo in your ears with more importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Requeſts, if they had but the opportunity as now wee have.</p>
            <p>And 1. Wee beſeech you bear with us while wee remember you, that you are Paſtors of the flock of Chriſt, who are bound to feed them, and to preach in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, and to bee laborious in the Word and Doctrine; but are not bound to hinder all others from this bleſſed work, that dare not uſe a Croſs or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, or worſhip God in a form which they judge diſorderly, defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, or corrupt, when they have better to offer him <hi>(Mal.</hi> 1. 13, 14.) Is it not for matter and phraſe at leaſt as agreeable to the holy Scriptures? If ſo, wee beſeech you ſuffer us to uſe it, who ſeek nothing by it, but to worſhip God as neer as wee can, according to his will, who is jealous in the matters of his worſhip. If indeed yours have more of ſtrength, and ours of weakneſs, yet let not Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers caſt the children from the Houſe of God, becauſe they are ſick or weak, and need the more compaſſion; let not our Phyſicians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve their Patients ſhall all bee famiſhed, or caſt off, whoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature and appetites cannot agree to feed on the ſame diſh, with the ſame preparation and ſauce. Hee that thrice charged <hi>Peter</hi> as hee loved him, to feed his Lambs and Sheep, did never think of charging him to deny them food or turn them out of his fold, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all others to feed them, unleſs they could digeſt ſuch forms and ceremonies, and ſuperſcriptions as ours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. May wee preſume to minde you, that the Lord of the Harveſt hath commanded us to pray that more Labourers may bee ſent into the Harveſt. (For ſtill proportionably the Harveſt is great, and the Labourers are few) <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 37. And that the Lord hath not furniſhed them with his gifts in vain, nor lighted theſe Candles to put under a Buſhel, but to bee ſet on a Candleſtick, that they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107960:4"/>
may give light to all that are in the houſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 15: And that there are few Nations under the Heavens of God, as far as wee can learn, that have more able, holy, faithful, laborious and truly peaceable Preachers of the Goſpel (proprotionably) than thoſe are that are now caſt out in <hi>England,</hi> and are like in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to bee caſt out, if the old Conformity bee urged. This witneſs is true, which in Judgement wee bear, and muſt record againſt all the reproaches of uncharitableneſs, which the Juſtifier of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous at his day will effectually confute. Wee therefore beſeech you, that when thouſands of ſouls are ready to famiſh for want of the bread of Life, and thouſands more are grieved for the Ejection of their faithful Guides, the Labourers may not bee kept our, upon the account of ſuch Forms or Ceremonies, or Re-ordination; at leaſt till you have enow as fit as they to ſupply their places, and then wee ſhall never petition you for them more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And wee beſeech you conſider when you ſhould promote the joy and thankfulneſs of His Majeſties Subjects for his happy Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whether it bee equal and ſeaſonable to bring upon ſo many of them ſo great calamities as the change of able, faithful Miniſters, for ſuch as they cannot comfortably commit the conduct of their ſouls to, and the depriving them of the Liberty of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip; calamities far greater than the meer loſs of all their worldly ſubſtance can amount to: In a day of Common Joy to bring this cauſeleſly on ſo many of His Majeſties Subjects, and to force them to lye down in heart-breaking-ſorrows, as being almoſt as far undone, as Man can doe it; this is not a due requital of the Lord for ſo great deliverances: Eſpecially conſidering, that if it were never ſo certain, that it is the ſin of the Miniſters that dare not bee Re-ordained, or conform; its hard that ſo many thouſand inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent people ſhould ſuffer even in their ſouls for the faults of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And if wee thought it would not bee miſ-interpreted, wee would here remember you, how great and conſiderable a part of the three Nations they are, that muſt either incur theſe ſufferings, or condole them that undergo them; and how great a grief it will be to His Majeſty, to ſee his grieved ſubjects; and how great a joy it will bee to him, to have their hearty thanks and prayers, and ſee them live in proſperity, peace and comfort under his moſt happy Government.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And wee may plead the nature of their cauſe, to move you to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107960:4"/>
compaſſionate your poor afflicted Brethren in their ſufferings. It is, in your own account, but for refuſing Conformity to things indifferent, or at the moſt, of no neceſſity to ſalvation. It is in their account for the ſake of Chriſt, becauſe they dare not conſent to that which they judge to be an uſurpation of his Kingly power, and an accuſation of his Laws as inſufficient, and becauſe they dare not bee guilty of addition to, or diminution of his Worſhip, or of worſhipping him after any other Law, than that by which they muſt bee judged, or ſuch as is meerly ſubordinate to that. Suppoſe they bee miſtaken in thinking the things to bee ſo diſpleaſing to God; yet it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in them to bee fearful of diſpleaſing him, and careful to obey him; a diſpoſition neceſſary to all that will bee ſaved, and therefore to bee loved and cheriſhed in them by the Paſtors of the Church; who ſhould bee very tender of putting them to ſuffering, or caſting them out of the Church, becauſe they dare not do that which they judge to bee ſo great a ſin againſt the Lord, deſerving damnation to themſelves. Should not the love of Chriſt command us to bee tender of thoſe that are ſo tender of his honour, and to take heed what wee do to men for taking heed of ſin, and being afraid to offend the Lord; and ſhould not the ſpecial love of Chriſtians, and the common love of men, command us, to bee loath to drive men by penalties, upon that which they judge doth tend to their everlaſting damnation, and which indeed doth tend to it, becauſe they judge it ſo to do; For hee that will do that which hee thinks to bee ſo great a ſin as is before deſcribed, to pleaſe men, or to eſcape their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no doubt deſerveth the wrath of God, and ſhould wee not bee loath to drive men upon ſin and condemnation: though wee were ſure that their own infirmity is the occaſion. If it bee ſaid, that by this Rule nothing ſhall bee commanded, if men will but ſcruple it. Wee anſwer, Things in themſelves neceſſary, or commanded by God, muſt bee commanded by man, becauſe ſcruples make them not unneceſſary, and make not void the Laws of God, and it will bee a ſin even to the ſcrupulous to diſobey: But things diſpenſible, and of themſelves unneceſſary, ſhould not bee rigorouſly urged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to whom they would bee a ſin, and cauſe of condemnation. It is in caſe of things indifferent in your own judgement, that wee now ſpeak. If it bee ſaid, that it is humour, pride, or ſingularity, or peeviſhneſs, or faction, and not true tenderneſs of conſcience that cauſeth the doubts, or non-conformity of theſe men. Wee anſwer, ſuch crimes muſt bee faſtened onely on the Individuals, that are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107960:5"/>
firſt proved guilty of them; and not upon multitudes unnamed and unknown and without pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; and you know it is the prerogative of God to ſearch the heart, and that hee hath ſaid, <hi>Judge not that yee be not judged, for with what judgement yee judge, yee ſhall bee judged, and with what meaſure yee mete, it ſhall bee meaſured to you again.</hi> Mat. 7. 1, 2. <hi>And who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant, to his own Maſter, hee ſtandeth or falleth; yea, hee ſhall bee holden up, for God is able to make him ſtand.</hi> Rom. 14. 4. And who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to bee better acquainted with their hearts, than they are themſelves! <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man, which is in him;</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 11. And they are ready to appeal to the dreadful God, the ſearcher of hearts, and the hater of Hypocriſie, that if it were not for fear of ſinning againſt him, and wounding their conſciences, and hazarding, and hindering their ſalvation, they would readily obey you in all theſe things; That it is their fear of ſin and damnation that is their Impediment, they are ready to give you all the aſſurance, that man can give by the ſolemneſt profeſſions, or by oath if juſtly called to it.</p>
            <p>And one would think that a little Charity might ſuffice to enable you to beleeve them, when their non-compliance brings them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuffering, and their compliance, is the viſible way to favour; ſafety, and proſperity in the world. And if men that thus appeal to God concerning the intention of their own hearts, cannot bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, even when the State of their worldly intereſt bears witneſs to their profeſſions, but another ſhall ſtep into the Throne of the heart-ſearching God, and ſay [It is not as they ſay, or ſwear, It is not conſcience, but obſtinacy or ſingularity] all humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe upon theſe terms will bee overthrown: And what remedy have they, but patiently to wait, till God that they have Appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, ſhall decide the doubt, and ſhew who were the Aſſertours of truth or falſhood.</p>
            <p n="6">6 And wee crave leave to repreſent to you the great diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in neceſſity and worth, between the things in queſtion, and the ſalvation of ſo many, as may bee obtained by the free and faithful exerciſe of the Miniſtery, of thoſe that now are, and that are yet like to bee laid aſide; Do you think the Lord that died for ſouls, and hath ſent us to learn what that meaneth <hi>[I will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and not ſacrifice,</hi> Mat. 9. 13.] is better pleaſed with Re-ordination, Subſcription and Ceremonies, than with the ſaving of ſouls, by the means of his own appointment: If it bee ſaid that Publick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

and peace and concord do promote the ſalvation of many, and therefore are to bee preferred before the ſalvation of fewer. Wee anſwer, Concord in holy obedience to God doth indeed promote the ſalvation of all that entertain it; but Concord in Ceremonies, or Re-ordination, or Oaths of obedience to Dioceſans, or in your queſtioned particular forms of Prayer, do neither in their nature, or by vertue of any promiſe of God, ſo much conduce to mens ſalvation; as the preaching of the Goſpel doth, by able faithful and laborious Miniſters. And how comes it to paſs that unity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and order muſt bee placed in thoſe things, which are no way neceſſary thereto! Will there not bee order and concord in Holy obedience and acceptable worſhiping of God, on the terms which wee now propoſe and crave, without the foreſaid matter of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? Wee here ſhew you that wee are no Enemies to order, and our long importunity for the means of concord, doth ſhew that wee are not enemies to concord.</p>
            <p>If it bee ſaid, that other men that will conform to the things in queſtion may convert and ſave ſouls better than thoſe that are facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſobedient: Wee firſt humbly crave that reproach may not bee added to affliction, and that none may bee called factious that are not proved ſuch; and that Laws impoſing things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in your judgement, and ſinfull in theirs, may not bee made the rule to judge of faction: But that men who live inoffenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under civill Government, and in matters of Faith and Worſhip, ſubſcribe to all contained in the holy Scriptures; and indeavour to promote Univerſal Peace and Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>y on theſe termes, may not bee made offenders by the making of Laws and Canons, that muſt force them to bee ſuch: Conſequently <hi>Daniel</hi> was an offender that would not forbear praying openly by the ſpace of thirty daies. But antecedently to that Law, hee was confeſſed juſt, by them that ſaid <hi>[Wee ſhall not finde any occaſion againſt this Daniel, except wee finde it againſt him concerning the Law of his God]</hi> Dan 6. 5, 7, 10. The Law which hee muſt break was made to make him a breaker of that Law; take away that law and take away his fault. Wee accuſe none of the like intentions, but wee muſt ſay, that it is eaſie to make any man an offender, by making laws which his conſcience will not allow him to obſerve, and its as eaſie to make that ſame man ceaſe to ſeem diſobedient, obſtinate, or factious, without any change at all in him, by taking down ſuch needleſs Laws. Wee may again remember you what Chriſt a ſecond time doth preſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 7.

               <hi>[But if yee had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice, yee would not have condemned the guiltleſs.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And next, to the reſt of the objection, wee anſwer; That ſad experience tells the world, that if the Miniſters that wee are plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, bee laid aſide, there are not competent men enough to ſupplie their Rooms, and equally to promote the ſalvation of the flocks: This is acknowldged by them who ſtill give it as the reaſon why Miniſters are not to bee truſted with the expreſſing of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in their own words, nor ſo much as to chuſe which Chapter to read, as well as which Text to preach on, to their Auditours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee ſhall have Miniſters ſo weak, as to bee unfit for ſuch a truſt: And men that are not wiſe enough for ſo eaſie a part of their duty, as to chuſe fit portions of Scripture to read, are unlikely to afford an equal aſſiſtance to the ſalvation of the people inſtead of the labours of ſuch as wee are ſpeaking for.</p>
            <p n="7">7 And it muſt bee remembred that in our Ordination, wee muſt profeſs that [wee are perſwaded that the Holy Scriptures contain ſufficiently all Doctrine, required of neceſſity for eternal ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.] and that wee will teach or maintain nothing as required of neceſſity to eternal ſalvation, but that which wee are perſwaded may bee concluded and proved by the ſame] and that one of the articles of the Church containeth the ſame doctrine of the ſcriptures ſufficiency: and to theſe wee are called to ſubſcribe; And the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that wee now ſpeak for, are ready to ſubſcribe to all contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Holy Scriptures, and willing to bee oblieged by the Laws of men to practiſe it: And hee that hath all things neceſſary to ſalvation is received of God, and ſhould therefore bee received by the Church, if the Apoſtles argument bee good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. 3. [For God hath received him] ſeeing then you do profeſs that none of your Impoſitions that cannot bee concluded from the ſcripture, are neceſſary to ſalvation, let them not conſequentially bee made neceſſary to it, and <hi>more</hi> neceſſary than that which is ordinarily neceſſary.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, that ſo many men ſhall bee forbidden to preach, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they dare Subſcribe and uſe theſe things; you will tempt them to infer, that Preaching being ordinarily neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. And theſe things called indifferent being made neceſſary to preaching and preferred before it, therefore they are made neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation, and preferred before that which God hath made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;</p>

If it bee ſaid, that this will as much follow the making of any other indifferent thing to bee neceſſary to preaching, and ſo the Church ſhall make no orders; Wee anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſmaller things muſt not bee impoſed by unproportionable penalties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That though the Church may prefer a ſober, peaceable Preacher before one that is Schiſmatical and unpeaceable (which is not at all to exclude Preaching) yet the Church may not make any thing neceſſary to Preaching it ſelf; that is of it ſelf unneceſſary, and not antecedently neceſſary, at leaſt by accident.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And if our Religion be laid upon your particular Liturgy, wee ſhall teach the Papiſts further to inſult, by asking us, where was our Religion two hundred years ago? The Common-Prayer-Book as differing from the Maſs-Book, being not ſo old, and that which might then bee the matter of a change, is not ſo unchangeable it ſelf, but that thoſe Alterations may bee accepted for ends ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable as are now before us.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And wee humbly crave that wee may not in this bee more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly dealt with, than the Paſtors and People of the Antient Churches were: If wee may not have the Liberty of the Primitive times, when for ought can bee proved, no Liturgical Forms were impoſed upon any Church, yet at leaſt let us have the liberty of the following Ages, when under the ſame Prince there were diverſity of Liturgies, and particular Paſtors, had the power of making and altering them for their particular Churches.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And if you ſhould reject (which God forbid) the moderate propoſals which now and formerly wee have made, wee humbly crave leave to offer it to your conſideration, what Judgement all the Proteſtant Churches are likely to paſs on your proceedings, and how your cauſe and ours will ſtand repreſented to them, and to all ſucceeding Ages. Though wee earneſtly deſire the tolleration of thoſe that are tollerable, and the peaceable Liberties of all that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree on the Catholick terms of Primitive Simplicity, in Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline, yet have wee our ſelves ſo far drawn neer you, as that the world will ſay, you reject thoſe that are for Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy it ſelf, and ſet Forms of Liturgy, and are not ſo much as charged by you at all, as diſagreeing in any point of Faith, if you ſhall reject us. If after our ſubmiſſion to His Majeſties Declaration, and after our own Propoſals of the Primitive Epiſcopacy, and of ſuch a Liturgy as here wee tender, wee may not bee permitted to

If you would not grant this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Communion to others, with whom Chriſt will hold Communion in grace and glory; yet it will appear more ſtrange to the world, that you ſhould caſt out the Epiſcopal alſo, that dare not go beyond the Rule of Holy Scripture, and the Example of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Simplicity.</p>
            <p>And wee doubt not but you know, how new and ſtrange a thing it is that you require in the point of Re-ordination: When a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non amongſt thoſe called the Apoſtles depoſeth thoſe that Re-ordain, and that are re-ordained; And when it is a thing that both Papiſts and Proteſtants condemn, when not onely the former Biſhops of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that were more moderate were againſt it, but even the moſt ſervent adverſaries of the Presbyterian way; ſuch as Biſhop <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi> himſelf, how ſtrange muſt it needs ſeem to the Reformed Churches to the whole Chriſtian world, and to future Generations, that ſo many able, faithful Miniſters ſhould bee laid by as broken Veſſels, becauſe they dare not bee re-ordained? and that ſo many have been put upon ſo new and ſo generally diſ-reliſhed a thing?</p>
            <p n="11">11. And wee crave leave to remember you, that the Holy Ghoſt hath commanded you to over-ſee the flock, not by conſtraint, but willingly, not as being Lords over Gods Heritage, but as Enſamples to the Flock: And that it is not onely more comfortable to your ſelves to bee loved as the Fathers, than to be eſteemed the Afflicters of the Church, but that it is needful to the ends of your Miniſtry for the people<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And to diſſemble, and ſay, and ſwear, and do, the things which they beleeve not, is ſuch an aggravated hypocriſie (being in the matters of God, and

joyned with perfidiouſneſs) as wee may ſuppoſe cannot render them acceptable to any, that have not renounced Religion and Humanity, much leſs ſhould they bee conſtrained to it. And when it is known that mens judgements are againſt the things impoſed, and that penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are no means adapted to the informing and changing of the judgement; but to force men to do the things they know, wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they ſhould not bee uſed, and ſo uſed in the caſe of things indifferent, where they are not neceſſary to the common good, and where the ſufferers, have never had ſufficient means to change their judgements.</p>

occaſioned already by theſe Impoſitions, ever ſince the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the daies of King <hi>Edward</hi> 6th. and the grievous fruits of thoſe Diviſions! How they deſtroyed Charity (the character of Chriſts Diſciples) and exaſperated mens minds againſt each other: How they corrupted mens prayers and other exerciſes of devotions, and made them pray and preach againſt one another: How their tongues were emboldned to the cenſuring of each other, one party calling the other, Factious, Schiſmatical, Singular, and Diſobedient; and the other calling them Antichriſtian, Proud, Tirannical, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, Perſecutors and Formaliſts: And ſuch language ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the uncharitableneſs and diviſions; till the increaſe of impoſing rigour on the one ſide, and of impatience under Sufferings on the other ſide, was too great a preparation to thoſe greater cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which are yet bitter to the remembrance of all whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts or paſſions have not Conquered their humanity. And the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of ſo much of the cauſes and effects, doth infallibly prove, that if the ſame impoſitions bee ſetled upon us, the ſame Heart-diviſions will bee ſtill continued: Brethren will diſdain the name and love of Brethren to each other; which yet Chriſt himſelf by condiſcending and reproving love, vouchſafeth to them all. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of loving one another with a pure heart, fervently, there will bee, if not hating, yet grudging at one another, cenſuring and deſpiſing one another; Which effects will ſtill increaſe their cauſe, and make one ſide think, that they are neceſſitated to bee more rigorous in their Coercions, and the other think that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to bee more cenſorious againſt thoſe by whom they ſuffer.</p>

And nature having planted in all men an unwillingneſs to ſuffer, and denied to all men a love of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and neceſſitated men to feel when they are hurt, and made the tongue and countenance the Index of our ſenſe; theſe Effects will be unavoidable, while ſuch Impoſitions are continued, and while a fear of ſinning will not ſuffer men to ſwallow and digeſt them, and what wrong ſuch diviſions about Religion will be to the Kingdome; and to His Majeſty, wee ſhall not mention, becauſe our Governours themſelves may better underſtand it.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, what univerſal eaſe, and peace, and joy would be the fruits of that happy unity and concord, which the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable forbearances which wee humbly petition for, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce; how comfortable would our Miniſterial labours bee, when wee had no ſuch temptations, burdens, or diſquietments? When wee lay not under the Reproofs of Conſcience, nor the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, or diſpleaſure of our Superiours, but might ſerve the Lord without diſtraction, and bee among his ſervants without ſuch fears, <hi>(Phil. 1. 14. 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 10.) How much would the hands of the Builders be ſtrengthened for the work of God, when they ſpeak the ſame things, and there are no diviſions among them, but they are perfectly joyned together in the ſame minde and judgement, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. when they are like-minded, having the ſame love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one accord, of one minde, doing nothing through ſtrife or vain glory, which will never be while the one calls the other factious and ſchiſmatical, and the other calleth him ſuperſtitious and tyrannical; but when Chriſt hath taught us in lowlineſs of minde to eſteem o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers better than our ſelves, and not to look every man on his own things (his own gifts, and virtues, and worth, and intereſt) but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man alſo on the things of others; and till the ſame mind bee in us, that was in Chriſt Jeſus, that humbled himſelf, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and made himſelf of no Reputation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 2, to 9. How much ſhould wee honour the Body, the Spirit, the Hope, the Lord, the Faith, the Baptiſm, the God and Father of all Beleevers, which are one, if wee were one among our ſelves, which will never be, till with lowlineſs, and meekneſs, and long-ſuffering,

wee forbear one another in love, inſtead of hating, reviling and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting one another; and till wee endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit (though given in various degrees) rather than an unity in unneceſſary things) in the bond of peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and till the well-joynted and compacted body do edifie it ſelf in love, by a due contribution of mutual ſupply, and grow in Chriſt the proper head, inſtead of contending with it ſelf, and diſ-joynting and tearing it ſelf into peeces, becauſe of our different meaſure of underſtanding, and our unavoidable differences about ſome ſmall unneceſſary things, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16. How beautiful would our holy Aſſemblies be, and how delightful the worſhip of God there ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, if wee had all laid by, the unchriſtian ſpirit of hatred, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, emulation, murmuring, wrath, variance, ſtrife, hereſies, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all uncharitableneſs, and with one minde, and one mouth did glorifie God <hi>(Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21.

If the very Babes were fed with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Milk of the Word, and all malice, and guile, and hypocriſie, and envies, and evil-ſpeaking were laid aſide, it would prove the beſt way to their growth, and a ſurer way to your preſent and eternal peace, than caſting them out becauſe they cannot bear your burdens, or digeſt ſome unneceſſary things, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. How good and how happy a thing would it bee for Brethren to dwell together in unity? <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 133. 1.) And as thoſe that by one ſpirit are baptized into one body, and know they have need of one another, to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute honour to the parts that lack it; yea to beſtow more abundant honour upon thoſe members which wee think to be leſs honourable, and more abundant comlineſs, on the uncomely parts, as knowing thoſe members are neceſſary that ſeem to be more feeble. If indeed wee would have no Schiſm in the body, the natural way is, for the members to have the ſame care one for another, as ſuffering all with one that ſuffereth, and rejoycing all with one that's honoured,

No ſuch things as our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Impoſitions, were then made neceſſary to the unity and concord of the members of the Church.</p>
            <p n="18">18. And wee humbly offer to your conſideration, which way will moſt gratifie Satan in his cauſe and ſervants, and which will moſt promote the work and intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt. The ungodly that have an inbred enmity to holineſs, and to the holy ſeed, will bee glad to ſee ſo many of them ſuffer, and glad under the ſhelter of your diſpleaſure and afflictings, to finde opportunity to reproach them, and add affliction to affliction. The common adverſaries of our Religion, and of the King and Kingdome will rejoyce to ſee us weakned by our Diviſions, and employed in afflicting or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring one another, and to ſee ſo many able Miniſters laid aſide, that might do much diſpleaſure to Satan, by the weakening of his Kingdome, and by promoting the Goſpel and Kingdome of the Lord.

The Apoſtles and Elders <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. declare unto the Churches, that it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and them, to lay upon them, no greater burden, than neceſſary things; impoſing them becauſe antecedently neceſſary (for that is given as the reaſon, of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and impoſition) and not only making unneceſſary things, neceſſary, by impoſition, for then the Impoſition had been unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, though it was not a ſimple, unchangeable neceſſity, yet it was a neceſſity by accident, <hi>pro tempore &amp; loco;</hi> antecedent to the impoſition of that aſſembly. Seeing then ſuch things commend us not to God; and if you uſe them, at leaſt, you are not the better. Sin not againſt Chriſt, by ſinning againſt your brethren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 8, 9, 11, 12. much more take heed of forcing them to ſin.</p>

Thou haſt given him to bée head over all things to the Church, and haſt given the Heathen to bée his Inheritance, and given him a name above every name, and given all power, and judgement unto him. Wée thank thée for the New and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Covenant, for thy great and precious promiſes; That thou haſt given us eternal life in Chriſt. That wée have the clear and ſure Revelation of thy will in the Holy Scriptures. That thou foundedſt thy Church upon Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the head Corner ſtone. And haſt committed to thy Miniſters the word of Reconciliation, that as Embaſſadours ſpeaking in the ſtead of Chriſt they might beſeech us to bee reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto thee. Wée thank thée that by them thou haſt opened our eyes, and turned us from darkneſs unto Light, and from the power of Satan unto God. Wée were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by Satan at his will; but thy mercy ſaved us by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt. Thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt juſtly have left us to the blindneſs of our mindes, and to the hardneſs of our hearts, to ſeared conſciences, to bee paſt feeling, to our own hearts luſts, to walk in our own Counſels, and to work uncleanneſs with greedineſs, when we ſo oft refuſed to come to Chriſt, that wee might have life, and would not have him to reign over us. But thy patience waited on us in our ſin; And all the day long didſt thou ſtretch forth thy hand to a diſobedient and gain-ſaying People. When wee turned from thee, thou calledſt after us, to turn and live. Thou dreweſt us to thy Son, and openedſt our hearts to attend unto thy calls: Thou lovedſt us firſt, and was found of them that ſought thee not. Thou haſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107960:24"/>
pardoned our great and manifold tranſgreſſions, and iuſtified us by Faith in Chriſt, and given us Repentance unto life: Thou haſt adopted us to bee thy ſons, and joynt heirs with Chriſt; and made us his members, and given us his ſpirit: Wee are no more ſtrangers but fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of thy houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; Bleſſed bee the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus-Chriſt, who of his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, to an Inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Heaven for us. Thou keepeſt us by thy mighty power through Faith unto ſalvation, ready at laſt to bee revealed, though (when they are needful) wee muſt for a ſeaſon bee in heavyneſs under tribulations; thou haſt promiſed, that all things ſhall work together for our good; in all our ſtraits thou granteſt us acceſs to the Throne of grace, bidding us call upon thee, in the time of trouble, and promiſing to deliver us, that wee may glorifie thee, every where wee have leave to lift up unto thée holy hands, Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the houſe of Prayer, and the Aſſembly of the Saints. Thou haſt heard the voice of our ſupplications when wee have cried unto thee; great is thy mercy towards us, O Lord. Thou haſt delivered our ſouls from the loweſt Hell; Thou haſt ſent forth from Heaven thy mercy and truth; and ſaved us from the reproach of him that would ſwallow us up: Thou art our Hiding place; In the ſecrets of thy preſence thou preſerveſt us from trouble, from the pride of men, and from the ſtrife of Tongues.

                              <hi>THat you may diſcern the Lords body, and underſtand the nature, uſe and benefits of this Sacrament, you muſt know that God created man in his own Image, to know, and love, and ſerve his Maker; That man fell under the guilt of ſin and condemnation, and left his holy Fitneſs for the work for which hee was created. That hereupon the wonderful love and wiſdome of God provided us a Remedy in our Redeemer, to the end hee might not loſe the glory of his Creation, that hee might pardon and ſave us upon terms. Securing the honour of his Juſtice, and attaining the ends of his Law and Government, and recover us to his love and ſervice, by appearing to the world, in the greateſt demonſtrations of Goodneſs, Love, and Mercy; By the greateſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Condiſcenſion, hee firſt promiſed, and then gave his onely
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107960:26"/>
Son the Eternal Word, to take mans nature into perſonal union with his God-head; that being God and Man, hee might bee a fit Mediator between God and Man, to reſtore us, and reconcile us to himſelf. Thus Jeſus Chriſt, conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and born of the Virgin Mary, became the ſecond Adam, the Phyſician and Saviour of undone Sinners, the Captain of our Salvation, to bee the glorious King and Head of all that are ſanctified and ſaved. Hee revealed the Holineſs, the Goodneſs, and the Love of God, by the perfect Holineſs, Goodneſs, and Love of his Bleſſed Perſon, Doctrine, and Converſation, and by ſuffering for us all the Afflictions of this life, and at laſt the curſed death of the Croſs, as a Sacrifice and Ranſome for us. That all this might be effectual to our Recovery, hee made for us a new and better Covenant, and preached it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, undertaking the Pardon, Juſtification, and Sanctification of all that by unfeigned Faith do take him for their Saviour, repenting of their ſins, and conſenting to be ſanctified by his Word and Spirit (by which alſo hee inviteth, and draweth men to himſelf, and giveth them to beleeve) Into this bleſſed, pardoning, ſaving Covenant, wee are firſt ſolemnly entred by Baptiſm. And when Chriſt was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to leave the world, and to give up himſelf a Sacrifice for us, and intercede and exerciſe the fulneſs of his Kingly Power, as the Churches Head; and by his grace to draw men to himſelf, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for his glory; hee did himſelf inſtitute this Sacrament of his body and blood at his laſt Supper, to bee a continued Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Remembrance of his Death, and therein of his own and his Fathers Love until his coming; appointing his Miniſters by the Preaching of the Goſpel, and Adminiſtration of theſe Sacraments to bee his Agents without, and his Spirit within, effectually to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Grace.</hi>

Ends aforeſaid (their Juſtification, Sanctification, and Glorification) and to ſignifie and ſolemnize the Renewal of their Covenant with him, and their holy Communion with him, and with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.]</p>
                           <p>It being the renewing of a mutual Covenant that is here ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, as wee commemorate Chriſts Sacrifice, and receive him and his ſaving benefits, ſo wee offer and deliver to him our ſelves, as his redeemed, ſanctified people, to bee a living Acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, thankfully and obediently to live unto his Praiſe.</p>
                           <p>Before the receiving of this holy Sacrament, wee muſt examine our ſelves, and come preparedly: In the receiving of it, wee muſt exerciſe holy affections ſuited to the work; And after the receiving of it, wee muſt by conſideration of it, indeavour to revive the ſame Affections, and perform our Covenant there renewed.</p>
                           <p>The holy Qualifications to bee before Provided, and in Receiving exerciſed, and after Receiving, are theſe. 1. A true beleef of the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, concerning the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; the Perſon, Offices, Works, and Sufferings, and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Chriſt. 2. The ſenſe of our ſinful and undone condition, as in our ſelves, and of our need of Chriſt: ſo as humbly to loath our ſelves for our tranſgreſſions: with the ſenſe of our preſent weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to bee ſtrengthened, and ſins to bee forgiven. 3. A true deſire after Chriſt for pardon, and ſpiritual Nouriſhment and Salvation. 4. A thankful ſenſe of the Wonderful Love of God, declared in our Redemption, and in the preſent offers of Chriſt, and Life. 5. The exerciſe of holy love and joy in the ſenſe of this unſpeakable Love, (if theſe two bee not felt before wee come, yet in, and after the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament) we muſt ſtrive to exerciſe them. 6. A love to one another and forgiving wrongs to one another, with a deſire after the Communion of Saints. 7. The giving up our ſelves in Covenant to God, with reſolution of renewed Obedience. 8. A patient hope for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt himſelf, and of the Everlaſting Kingdome where wee ſhall bee perfectly united in him, and glorified with him.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe onely are to bee invited to the Lords Table, and to come, that truly repent and beleeve, and unfeignedly conſent to the terms of the Covenant (though all are not to bee invited thus to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and repent, and ſo to come) But thoſe are to be admitted, by the Paſtors, if they come, who, having the uſe of reaſon to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what they do, and examine themſelves, have made a Perſonal Profeſſion of Faith, Repentance and Obedience; and are Members

                           <p>The benefit of the Sacrament is not to be judged of onely by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Experience and Feeling, but by Faith. God having appointed us to uſe it, and promiſed his Bleſſing, wee may and muſt beleeve, that hee will make good his Promiſe, and what ever wee feel at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that wee ſincerely wait not on him in vain.</p>

                           <p>YOu are invited hither, Dear Brethren, to bee Gueſts at this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Table, by the Lords Command, to receive the greateſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to perform the greateſt duty. On Chriſts part, All things are made ready. The Feaſt is prepared for you, even for you that by ſin have deſerved to bee caſt out of the preſence of the Lord; for you that have ſo oft neglected and abuſed Mercy. A Feaſt of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, free to you, but dear to him. You were loſt, and in the way to bee loſt for ever, when by the greateſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Condiſcending-love, hee ſought and ſaved you: You were dead in ſin, condemned by the Law, the Slaves of Satan; There wanted nothing but the Executing-ſtroak of Juſtice, to have ſent you into endleſs miſery: When our dear Redeemer pitied you in your blood, and ſhed his own to waſh and heal you. Hee ſuffered, that was offended that the offender might not ſuffer. Hee cried out on the Croſs, <hi>My God, My God, Why hast thou forſaken mee,</hi> that wee who had deſerved it, might not bee everlaſtingly forſaken. Hee died, that wee might live: O how would the mercy of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have affected you, if you had firſt lyen one year, or month, or day in Hell; Had you but ſeen your dying Lord, or ſeen the damned in their miſery, how do you think you ſhould have valued the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that is now revealed and tendred to you; ſee here Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this holy Repreſentation. Behold the ſacrifized Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world. It is his will to be thus frequently crucified before your eyes. O how ſhould wee bee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſhame, and loath our ſelves, that have both procured the death of Chriſt by ſin, and ſinned againſt it? And how ſhould wee all bee filled with joy, that have ſuch myſteries of Mercy opened, and ſo great. Salvation freely offered to us! O hate ſin, O love this Saviour; See that you come not hither without a deſire to bee more Holy, nor with a purpoſe to go on in wilful ſin; Bee not deceived;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107960:28"/>
God is not mocked, but if you heartily repent and conſent to the Covenant, come and welcome; Wee have commiſſion from Chriſt to tell you, that you are welcome. Let no trembling, contrite ſoul draw back, that is willing to bee Chriſts upon his Covenant-terms, but beleeve that Chriſt is much more willing to bee yours. Hee was firſt willing, and therefore died for you, and made the Covenant of Grace, and ſent to invite and importune you to conſent, and ſtayed for you ſo long, and gave you your Repentance, your willingneſs and deſire. Queſtion not then his willingneſs, if you are willing. It is Satan and unbeleef that would have you queſtion it, to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both of Chriſt and you. Come neer, obſerve, beleeve and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the Riches of his Love and Grace. For hee hath himſelf invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you, to ſee and taſte, that you may wonder. You are ſinners, but hee inviteth you to receive a renewed, ſealed pardon of your ſins, and to give you more of his Spirit to overcome them. See here his broken Body and his Blood, the Teſtimonies of his Willingneſs. Thus hath hee ſealed the Covenant, which pardoneth all your ſins, and ſecureth you of your Reconciliation with God, and your Adoption, and your right to Everlaſting Bleſſedneſs. Deny not your conſent, but heartily give up your ſelves to Chriſt, and then doubt not, but your Scarlet, Crimſon-ſins ſhall bee made as white as Wooll, or Snow. Object not the number or greatneſs of them againſt his Grace. There is none too great for him to pardon to penitent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. Great ſins ſhall bring great glory to his Blood and Grace. But ſtrive you then for great loathing of your ſins, and greater love to ſuch a God, and greater thanks to ſuch a Saviour. Unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly ſay, <hi>I am willing Lord to bee wholly Thine,</hi> and then beleevingly take Chriſt, and Pardon, and Life, as given you by his own appointment in the ſealed Covenant.

Receive now a crucified Chriſt here repreſented, and bee contented to take up your Croſs,

Nor yet the Childe of Parents juſtly excommunicate, or that live in any notorious, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſin, or have lately committed ſuch a ſin (as if the Childe be gotten in Adultery or Fornication) and being juſtly convict of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth penitently to confeſs it, and promiſe Reformation. But if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Parents bee duly qualified, and preſent the Childe to bee baptized (or another for them in caſe they cannot bee preſent) the Childe is to bee received unto Baptiſm.</hi>

Let the Parents or owners come to the Miniſter at ſome convenient time the week before, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him when they intend to offer their Childe to Baptiſm, and give an account of their fore-ſaid capacity, and receive his further Miniſterial Aſſiſtance for the fuller underſtanding of the uſe and benefits of the Sacrament, and their own duty; The Font is to bee placed to the greateſt conveniency of the Miniſter and People. The Childe, or Children being there preſented, the Miniſter may begin with this or the like ſpeech directed to the Parent, or Parents (that preſenteth it.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THat you may perform this ſervice to God with underſtanding, you muſt know, that God having made man in his own Image, to love, and ſerve him, our firſt Parents wilfully corrupted themſelves by ſin, and became the Children of Death, and the Captives of Satan, who had overcome them by his temptation; And as by one man ſin entred into the World, and death by ſin, ſo death paſſed upon all, for that all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God. Wee are conceived in ſin, and are by nature children of wrath. For who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean. By the offence of one, Judgement came upon all men to condemnation. But the infinite Wiſdome and Love of the Father hath ſent his Son to bee the Saviour of the World. The Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt on Earth, and overcame the Devil and the World; Fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, and ſuffered for our ſins upon the Croſs, and roſe again, and reigneth in Glory, and will come again, and judge the World in Righteouſneſs; In him God hath made and offered to the World a Covenant of Grace, and in it the Pardon of ſin to all true Penitent Beleevers; and power to bee the Sons of God, and Heirs of Heaven; This Covenant is extended to the ſeed alſo of the Faithful, to give them the benefits ſuitable to their age, the Parents dedicating them unto God, and entring them into the Covenant, and ſo God in Chriſt will bee their God, and number them with his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Covenant is to be ſolemnly entred into by Baptiſm (which

Is it a ſmall Mercy for this Childe to bee accepted into the Covenant of God, and waſhed from its Original ſin, in the Blood of Chriſt, which is ſignified and ſealed by this Sacramental waſhing in water, to be accepted as a Member of Chriſt, and of his Church, where hee vouchſafeth his Protection and Proviſion, and the Means and Spirit of Grace, and the renewed pardon of ſin upon Repentance, and for you to ſee this happineſs of your Childe! The duty on your part, is, firſt to ſee that you are ſtedfaſt in the Faith and Covenant of Chriſt, that you periſh not your ſelf, and that your Childe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Childe of a Beleever; And then you are beleevingly and thankfully to dedicate your Childe to God, and to enter it into the Covenant in which you ſtand. And you muſt know, that your Faith, and Conſent, and Dedication will ſuffice for your Children no longer than till they come to age themſelves, and then they muſt own their Baptiſmal Covenant, and perſonally renew it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and give up themſelves to God, or elſe they will not bee owned by Chriſt. You muſt therefore acquaint them with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, as they grow up, and with the Covenant now made, and bring them up in the fear of the Lord. And when they are actually penitent Beleevers, they muſt preſent themſelves to the Paſtors of the Church to bee approved, and received into the Communion of the Adult Beleevers.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>If the Perſons bee before well inſtructed in the nature of Baptiſm, and Time require Brevity; the Miniſter may omit the firſt part of this ſpeech, and begin at the deſcription of Baptiſm, or after it. If there bee need of ſatisfying the People of the duty of Baptizing Infants, the Miniſter may here do it; otherwiſe let the Queſtions here immediately follow.</hi>

            <p>Whether the Miniſter come with the Company that brings the Corps from the houſe: or whether hee meet them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them at the burial place, is to bee left to his own diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Let him (at leaſt if it bee deſired) inſtruct and exhort the people concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death, and the life to come, and their neceſſary prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>Upon the receipt of great and extraordinary mercies, the Church (having opportunity) is to Aſſemble for publick Thankſgiving unto God, and the Miniſter to ſtirre up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a lively ſenſe of the greatneſs of thoſe mercies, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to Celebrate the praiſes of God, the Author of them. And it is not unmeet in theſe daies to expreſs our joy in Feaſting and outward ſignes of Mirth, provided they bee uſed moderately, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, and inoffenſively, and not to gratifie ourſenſual deſires, and that wee releeve the poor in their neceſſities (which alſo on daies of Humiliation and other ſeaſons. wee muſt not forget.) The occaſions of ſuch daies of Humiliation and Thankſgiving being ſo various, as cannot bee well ſuited by any ſtanding forms, the Miniſter is to apply himſelf to the reſpective duties, ſuitable to the particular occaſions.</p>

But if after private Admonition (while the offence is ſuch, as requireth not publick confeſſion) the Sinner bee penitent, let the Miniſter privately apply to his Conſolation the promiſes of the Goſpel, with ſuch cautelous prudence as is moſt ſuitable to his condition.</p>
            <p>And if hee repent not till after publick admonition, or that the ſcandall bee ſo great and notorious, as that a publick confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neceſſary, let him at a ſeaſonable time appointed by the Paſtor, with remorſe of conſcience, and true contrition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels his ſin before the Congregation, and heartily lament it, and clear the honour of his Chriſtian profeſſion, which hee had ſtayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and crave the prayers of the Church to God for pardon, and reconciliation through Chriſt, and alſo crave the Miniſterial Abſolution and reſtauration, to the Communion of the Church, and profeſs his reſolution to do ſo no more; but to live in new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, deſiring alſo their prayers for Corroborating and preſerving grace.</p>
            <p>It is only a credible profeſſion of repentance, that is to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the Church.</p>
            <p>The foregoing Cautious muſt bee carefully obſerved in ſuch confeſſions, that they bee not made to the injuring of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or of the Church, or of the reputation of others, or of the Life, Eſtate, or Liberty of the offender, or to any other ſhame than is neceſſary to the manifeſting of his repentance, and the clearing of his Profeſſion, and the Righting of any that hee hath wronged, and the honour, and preſervation of the Church.</p>
            <p>When hee hath made a credible profeſſion of repentance, It is the Paſtors duty, Miniſterially to declare him pardoned by Chriſt, but in conditional terms [If his repentance be ſincere] And to abſolve him from the cenſureof non Communion with the Church, if he was under ſuch a cenſure before his penitence, and to declare him meet for their Communion, and to encourage him to come, and require the Church to entertain him into their Communion with gladneſs, and not upbraid him with his fall, but rejoyce in his recovery, and endeavour his confirmation and preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the time to come: And it is his duty accordingly to admit him to Communion, and theirs to have loving Communion with him: All which the penitent perſon, muſt beleevingly, lovingly, &amp; joyfully receive.
