            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been an old ſaying amongſt
Philoſophers, and experience doth
prove it to be true, <hi>Non datur vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
that is to ſay, Nature will not
admit of any vacuity, or emptineſſe. For ſome
one or other of the Elements, but eſpecially
Ayre, and Water doe inſert themſelves into all
manner of concavities, or hollowneſſes, in, or
upon the earth, whether they are ſuch as are
formed either by Art or Nature. For the one it
is ſo obvious, and manifeſt, as that it needs not
any proofe at all. As for the other, I ſhall make
it manifeſt unto you by eaſie demonſtration.
Let there be gotten a large veſſell of glaſſe, or
other, having beſides the mouth another
hole (though but a little one) at the top: poure
water into the veſſell by a tunnell thruſt into
the mouth of it, and you ſhall finde that as the
water runneth into the veſſell, a winde will
<pb facs="tcp:23237:5"/>
come forth of the little hole, ſufficient to blow
out a candle being held over it. This proveth,
that before the water was poured into the veſſell
(though to our ſight it appeared to bee empty)
it was full of ayre, which forced out of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
as the water ran in; and the reaſon hereof
is, becauſe the water is by nature of a maſſie, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till,
ſubſtance; and the ayre of a windy, light, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporative
nature: The knowledge of this, with
the rarifaction of incloſed ayre, is the ground

                     <p>1 Note therefore, that the nature and property of the
water in all the glaſses that have no vent holes at the top,
is, to aſcend with cold, and deſcend with heat. But in

a certaine token that the weather will continue at that ſtay

are the <hi>prima principia</hi> (I meane the materialls)
whereof euery ſublunary body is compoſed, and into the
which it is at laſt diſſolued.</p>
                     <p>2 Euery thing finding a diſſolution of thoſe <hi>naturae
catenae,</hi> that is, meanes whereby their <hi>principia</hi> are conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and ioyned together, their lighter parts aſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23237:33"/>
and theſe that are more groſſe and heauy, doe the
contrary.</p>
                     <p>3 It is impoſſible for one and the ſelfe ſame body to
poſſeſſe at one time two places; It followeth therefore,
that a denſe body rarified, and made thin, eyther by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or potentiall fire, requireth a greater quantity of room
to be conteyned in, then it did before. Hence it is, that if
you lay your hand upon a glaſſe, hauing a ſtraight mouth
reuerſt into a diſh of water, it rarifieth the ayre contayned
therein, and makes it breake out thorough the water in
bubbles. Alſo, that gunpowder incloſed in the barrell of
a gun, being rarified by fire, applied unto the touch-hole,
it ſeeketh a greater quantity of roome, and therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
the bullet out of the barrell. This is called violent
motion.</p>
                     <p>4 According unto the ſtrength and quantity of a
denſe body rarified, and according unto the forme and
length of its incloſure, it forceth its compreſſer further
or neerer at hand.</p>

                     <p>IF ſo be you haue at any time diuers ſorts of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and it is your deſire to know which of them is the
ſtrongeſt, then you muſt prepare a box, as A, B, being
foure inches high, and about two inches wide, hauing a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:23237:34"/>
lid ioynted unto it. The box ought to be made of iron,
braſſe, or copper, and to bee faſtned unto a good thick
plank, and to haue a touch-hole at the bottom, as O, and
that end of the box where the hinge of the lid is, there
muſt ſtand up from the box a peece of iron or braſſe, in
length anſwerable unto the lid of the box: this peece of
<figure/> iron muſt haue a hole quite
through it, towards the top,
and a ſpring, as, A, G, muſt bee
ſcrewed or riueted, ſo that the
one end may couer the ſayd
hole. On the top of all this i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
or braſſe that ſtandeth up
from the box, there muſt bee
ioynted a peece of iron (made as
you ſee in the figure) the hinder
part of which is bent down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and entreth the hole that the ſpring couereth; the
other part reſteth upon the lid of the box. Open this
box lid, and put in a quantity of powder, and then ſhut
the lid down, and put fire to the touch hole at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and the powder in the box being fired, will blow
the box lid up the notches more or leſſe, according as the
ſtrength of the powder is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo by firing the ſame quantity
of diuers kindes of powders at ſeuerall times, you may
know which is the ſtrongeſt. Now perhaps it will bee
expected that I ſhould ſpeak of the making of Saltpeter,
Gunpowder, Coales, with the refining of Sulphur: but
becauſe they are ſo commonly to bee had, and to bee
bought at better rates than I know they can bee made by
any that intend it for their priuate uſe, I haue forborne it:
There are diuers I am ſure that would willingly bee in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23237:34"/>
action: I haue thought fitting therefore to ſet downe the
collection of naturall Saltpeter, which is a kinde of white
excreſcence growing upon ſtone-wals, and (as I haue
ſeene great ſtore) in the arches of ſtone-bridges. Firſt
therefore gather this white excreſcence, and adde unto it
Quick lyme, and Aſhes, mingle them, and put them into
a halfe-tub that hath a hole to draw the liquor out at;
then put into this halfe-tub warm water, and let it ſtand
untill all the peter be diſſolued; let it then drain out at
the hole by little and little, and if the liquor be not cleere,
double a brown paper, and put it within a tunnell, and
ſtraine the liquor through it. Then boyle it and ſcum it
untill it bee ready to congeale, neither too hard, nor yet
too tender: then take it from the fire, and put it into ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
veſſels, either of earth or braſſe; ſet them in a cold
place two or three dayes, and it will ſhoot into iſicles, and
this is called Rochpeter. Thus much for the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.
Now I am come unto the Formers, the number
whereof I cannot certainly determine, becauſe it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
upon the variety of each particular perſons inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now that I may formally proceed, I will firſt make
ſome diſtinction of each kinde in generall; and then I
will ſpeak of euery particular contained in each generall.
Fire-works are of 3 ſorts.</p>
                     <p>1 Such as operate in the ayre, as Rockets, Serpents,
Raining fire, Stars, Petards, Dragons, Fire-drakes, Feinds,
Gyronels, or Fire-wheeles, Balloons.</p>
                     <p>2 Such as operate upon the earth, as Crackers, Trunks,
Lanterns, Lights, Tumbling bals, Sauciſſons, Towers,
Caſtles, Pyramids, Clubs, Lances, Targets.</p>
                     <p>3 Such as burn in or on the water, as Rockets, Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins,

The next figure marked with M, N, doeth expreſſe

H; they muſt all of them be turned very even and ſmooth;

The firſt rammer noted with the figure G, muſt bee
ſeuen inches and a halfe long, from 3 to 4, and haue a
hole at the end of it, as the rowler had; this rammer is
to ram the compoſition into the former (hauing the coffin

rammer noted with the figure H, muſt be fiue inches and
three quarter long from 5 to 6, and it muſt haue no hole
at the top as the other had; it ſerueth to ram the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

broach. The diameter of the thickneſſe of theſe two
rammers muſt be a thought leſſe than the diameter of the
rowler, to the end they may not hurt the coffin, being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

parchment, or ſtrong canuaſſe, rowle it hard upon the
rowler, ſo often untill it will go ſtiffe into the body of the
Former: then thruſt it rowler and all through the ſayd
hollow body of the Former; put then the broach of the
formers breech into the hole of the rowler, and with a
peece of ſtrong packthred choake the coffin within halfe
an inch of the rowlers end (which you may do beſt, and
with moſt eaſe, if you firſt dip the end of the coffin into
fayre water, ſo that it may be wet quite through) after you
haue choaked the coffin, you muſt thruſt the breech of
the former, the coffin alſo with the rowler in it, up into
the body of the former: then pin the breech faſt to the
body of the former with the pin, and on the rowler
giue one ſtroak or two with a mallet lightly, then unpin
the breech, and with the rowler thruſt the coffin out of
the bottom of the former, lay it by untill the end be dry.

made of blacke leade, oker, or blacke chalke, or elſe
Charcoals made of Aſh, Sallow, or Beech, ſplit in ſunder,
and pointed; alſo a wing: having provided theſe your
implements, you ſhall thus begin to worke. Firſt, let the
thing, whoſe pourtrature you intend to take, ſtand before
you, ſo that the light be not hindred from falling upon
it, and with a pointed peece of charcoale draw it ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally;
which when you have done, conſider a while whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the parts thereof are proportionable, and whether
it carry the ſemblance of the thing that you drew it from,
which if it do not, wipe it out with your wing, and begin
anew: but if it be faulty on one part onely, wipe onely
that part out, and draw it againe; whenſoever it liketh
you, or that you have ſo drawne it, that you can finde no
great fault in it: wipe it over gently with your wing, ſo
that you may perceive the former ſtrokes: then with your
blacke chalke, or blacke lead plummets, draw it as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
and as curiouſly as you can, and ſhadow it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the light falleth upon it; This way is workeman
like, and the moſt difficult of all, yet by a little practice

charcoale, and white chalke pointed, which will ſhew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

you muſt wet it in faire water, and let it dry of it ſelfe; this

reſteth againſt the ball of the thumb, and the point is

when you have done, heat them red hot, and dip them
ſtraight downe into ſope, and by ſo doing, they will bee
hard indeed. Note that if in the dipping of them into
the ſope, you turne your hand never ſo little awry, the
Graver will be crooked. Theſe Gravers made and harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
