            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That God hath choſen out this creature Man, whoſe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

is from being a Babe and a Suckling to bee his <hi>Champion,</hi> whereby he will quell and deſtroy all his enemies; that is in this ſecond Verſe. The other Branch is,</p>

               <note place="margin">2.</note> That God hath choſen this creature Man to be his Viceroy, his Deputy, to rule and govern all the workes of his hands: God hath truſted him ſo farre, as to put all that hee hath made under Mans feet; and having done theſe two things for him, made him his Champion to conquer his enemies, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his houſe for the governing of his friends; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines more to bee done for him, this is to bee a little inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to God himſelfe; <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art thus mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of him? or the ſonne of man, that thou ſhouldeſt thus viſit him?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Analyſis of the Text.</note> The firſt of theſe two, Mans being choſen to bee Gods Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, to ſtill or quiet Gods enemies; I have choſen to ſpeake of this day: and in it there are theſe two things to bee han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled.

onely thus, that now was fulfilled that of the Pſalme, that Babes ſhould acknowledge him, when Rulers rejected him; but that cannot bee all the meaning, for it is cleare that the Scribes and Phariſees did intimate, that Chriſt ought not to permit them them thus to blaſpheme; it was blaſphemy to aſcribe that to him that was peculiar onely to God; and Chriſt alledges this Text as an apology for himſelfe, why he did receive that acclamation, which hee might not have done, if the Pſalme had not acknowledged it to bee his due; and had not this been a due acknowledgement of theirs, Chriſt could not thus have excuſed them, children may not be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak blaſphemy: But the other Scriptures will yet make it plainer,<note place="margin">

Firſt, take that of the Lord Chriſt himſelf, who is the head and Captain-generall of the Party, when hee came into the world to undertake this grand enemy, even the enemy, and the avenger; marke how hee appear'd, the ſtate of the world then ſtood thus, the Devill and his Angels in all places were worſhipped as ſo many Gods, the Empires and Kingdomes of the world were all at the Devills diſpoſe, hee was then the God of the world, and ruled in the hearts of all; the Lords friends lived in one onely corner of the world, in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and they were at that time brought into captivity to the great red Dragon, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the profeſſed enemy of the God of Heaven, and theſe were his vaſſalls; Among them commeth Chriſt as a Champion to undertake this great adverſary; and thus he enters the Liſts, <hi>borne</hi> in a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>wrapped</hi> up in rags, <hi>bred</hi> a poor Carpenter, <hi>lives</hi> 30 yeares in the world almoſt untaken notice of, when hee did come to ſhew that hee was the Saviour who had undertaken the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of his people from their thraldome, they who ſhould have owned him, and joyned with him, ſcorn'd him, rejected him; none but a few women and children, and fiſhermen, would ſo much as acknowledge that hee was ſent of God, yea, they never leave him till Jewes and Romans, (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the counſell of the Devill) had agreed together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, they tooke him, hung him upon a croſſe, crucified him, and there let him remaine a ſhame and a reproach, and curſe, and laughing-ſtock to all the world, and now was the time hee was to fight the field; thus was hee accompliſhed for the warfare, and now was hell let looſe upon him: who that ſhould have looked upon Chriſt at that time, would ever have thought that deliverance ſhould have come by him? would not all have ſaid of him, as ſome of the ſonnes of Belial did of <hi>Saul,</hi> and with a great deale of more reaſon toe, <hi>How can this Man ever ſave us?</hi> fieſh and blood, I dare ſay, would have given up the Cauſe as loſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, take another inſtance in the firſt Champions whom Chriſt ſends out in his Name, <hi>his Apoſtles,</hi> and the reſt of

his Diſciples, taken out of Fiſher-boates, and from other the like conditions, and hee ſends them to reduce the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſubjection: ſee what probability there was, that they ſhould ever ſpeed: they goe out a Company of weake men, without money in their purſe, without a ſword by their ſide, unto a prejudiced world, where all were engaged againſt them, and thus muſt they go to ſubdue the world, and how I pray? by preaching ſuch a Doctrine as was for the greateſt part utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the capacity of man, ridiculous to mans reaſon, that they ſhould beleeve in a crucified God, and appoint them a way of ſelfe-deniall, plucking out their right eye, and cutting off their right hand, and their right foot, and forſaking all, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a croſſe, and following a crucified God, and when they had done all, then they ſhould looke for that which no man ever ſaw, a reward in a place where no man ever was that they had heard of, a reward of glory in another world, after they had undergone nothing but miſery in this world, and with this Doctrine muſt they overcome the world. When <hi>Mabomet</hi> came out, hee had a Doctrine that ſuited Mans reaſon and his luſts. And when Antichriſt came, hee had a way that would pleaſe whatſoever was in a carnall heart, but theſe muſt go out with that, againſt which every man hath as many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as hee hath luſts in his heart. Would ever any man thinke, that all this project and undertaking would not have fallen preſently into the duſt? I could goe on (but that I have many things to handle) and ſhew you that in all the Churches conflicts it hath been ſo. When God ſent a ſhepheard to fetch 600000 men out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they were in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, how ridiculous an attempt would it appeare to fleſh and blood?

I adde further, every particular Saint who is brought home to Chriſt, is a

And when multitudes followed Chriſt himſelfe, the Phariſees demanded, Doe any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees beleeve on him? <hi>John</hi> 7. 48. And <hi>Hierome</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in his dayes, that when one <hi>Paulinus</hi> a brave young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man imbraced Chriſtian Religion, there was more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at it, than if a Mule had caſt a foale: now this leſſon may fully inſtruct you in the reaſon of it, ſo farre as any of their principles are able to make up a judgement, the cauſe of the Church is a loſt cauſe, Chriſt and his Saints are but like <hi>David</hi> againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> they are but wormes againſt a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and what wiſe man would ever engage himſelfe in ſuch a fooliſh and unlikely buſineſſe? who that hath underſtanding would put his fortune into a Ship that hee thinkes will ſinke in the Sea, which will daſh againſt the next rocke, or bee ſplit with the next wave? Indeed when the Church is ſmiled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and countenanced by Kings and Princes, it's no marvaile though wiſe, rich, and great men doe joyne with it; but when warres and perſecutions are raiſed againſt it, which hath moſt-what been the Churches lot hitherto, wonder not though wiſe men withdraw from it, when they can ſee nothing but ruine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them who take with this ſide; and this is the very reaſon of their withdrawing, and this alſo abundantly ſatisfies mee in our preſent trouble, wherein we have had ſo many Lords, ſo many Gentlemen, ſo many Learned men, ſo many great and rich men to have deſerted the Cauſe that the Parliament was engaged in. I ſolemnly profeſſe, I rather wonder that any wiſe man, if not ſanctified, hath ſtayed, that any Man not guided by the Spirit of God, ſhould venture himſelfe in a Cauſe that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo deſperate as this Cauſe of Chriſt hath done to the eyes of fleſh and blood. I juſtly call it the Cauſe of Chriſt and his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113855:10"/>
Church, becauſe it's apparent that the Parliaments engaging themſelves for reformation of Religion, as well as preſerving civill Liberties, hath provoked moſt of theſe enemies againſt them. Therefore let this ſatisfie you abundantly, when the multitude of the world generally goe againſt the Cauſe of Chriſt, they thinke it folly to owne it, becauſe they looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a loſt Cauſe. But the other Branch affords many excellent Uſes: One is,</p>

In the name of God, I promiſe it to every one that hath undertooke with Chriſt, in the Cauſe of his Church, they ſhall ſucceed well.

might be given for every one of them, but I will goe no ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then my Text, which I know will ſatisfie you: My Text ſaith, Out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings thou haſt <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> ſtrength, or <hi>thou haſt founded</hi> ſtrength, ſo the Hebrew word ſignifies, conſtituted, made, appointed; and that word when it is applyed to God, ordinarily ſignified one of theſe two things; ſometimes his Counſell, or what his Decree hath appointed, but moſt commonly it ſignifies his making or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a thing.

God hath founded it there; why hath the Bull that ſtrength in his horne? why hath Man ſuch ſtrength in his armes? why the Serpent in his ſting? God hath founded it: Philoſophers will carry you on from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reaſon, and ſhew how theſe ariſe out of their compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and natures; but when all is done, it muſt be reſolved into this, <hi>God hath appointed it,</hi> and made it ſo and ſo, God hath founded this ſtrength in them, and thus to bee exerciſed by them. And now I ſhould think this Leſſon were very fit for application, did I not know it neceſſary to remove one great ſtumbling block out of the way, which when I have done in a few words, I ſhall endeavour to ſet it home in 2 or 3 Uſes.</p>

the time of the Fathers, when <hi>preces &amp; lachrymae,</hi> prayers and teares, were all the weapons which the Church did uſe; but now when you have ſpoke all theſe things of the power of Preaching, and Praying, and Confeſſing, and Covenanting, you are glad to betake your ſelves to Armes, to ſee what they will doe, to helpe theſe out, whence it's apparent you dare not reſt in theſe as ſufficient helpes; and ſo they throw this as a ſtumbling block in our way; but this is eaſily removed.

I ſay therefore, that wee have all the ſame meanes of defence againſt unjuſt violence, that are common to us with other men, as we are <hi>Men,</hi> and wee have the ſame meanes of defence, as wee are Freemen, which other Freemen have; and wee challenge in this no more then wee might lawfully uſe, if wee were Papiſts or Turks, if we were Pagans, Jews, or Indians: we challenge not this to belong to chriſtianity, as peculiar to it, we have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that by the law of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> men may defend
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113855:17"/>
themſelves againſt unjuſt violence; if the Turkes ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade a Countrey of Chriſtians, they will tell him, that as they are Chriſtians, their <hi>Praying,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſing,</hi> and <hi>Singing,</hi> and <hi>Covenanting,</hi> theſe ſpirituall weapons out of their Mouth will quell them; but as they are <hi>Men,</hi> they have a liberty to defend themſelves againſt him, <hi>&amp; vim vi repellere;</hi> or if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man were travailing upon the highway, &amp; a Thief ſhould demand of him, how as he is a Chriſtian, hee defends himſelfe from his enemies; he would tell him by Faith, by Prayer, by the Word of God, by weapons out of his Mouth; but if the Thiefe aſſault him, to take his life or his purſe, as hee is a man, hee will uſe his ſword, and his Chriſtianity will ſanctifie this uſe of his ſword to him. The like inſtances might bee given in other things which concerne Chriſtianity. If any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, how live you as a Chriſtian? I would anſwer, by <hi>faith,</hi> by <hi>every word that comes out of Gods mouth;</hi> but yet as wee are Men, wee muſt eate our bread by the ſweat of our browes, and as wee are Chriſtians our Chriſtianity ſanctifies theſe other meanes of life unto us, it takes them not away from us: So when unjuſt violence is offered to us, contrary to the laws of the Land, looke what defence is lawfull by our Lawes, Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deprives us not of that, it ſanctifies that, and wee have all theſe which I have ſpoken to boot: And ſo is it in our preſent buſineſſe, when the Parliament (the higheſt Court of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, the Court where all controverſies between the King and his Subjects receive their finall judgement and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) were proceeding to reform abuleſ, and call ſome grand Delinquents and Incendiaries to a legall tryall, a force was raiſed to protect theſe Offenders, and conſequently to compell the Parliament to deſiſt from their work: (and let once the authority of Parliaments bee overthrowne, wee are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved and conquered people;) thereupon the Parliament, the repreſentative body of the Kingdome, takes Armes to defend themſelves, and to bring in theſe evill doers to condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; this (ſay wee) wee doe according to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Lawes of the Kingdome, and were the Kingdome and

Parliament Papiſts or Proteſtants, Chriſtians or Heathens, the caſe is the ſame as to the matter of the warre, the Lawes of the Land warranting this juſt defence; now our being Chriſtians, and true beleevers, deprives us not of this defence which wee enjoy as Engliſhmen, but ſuper-addes theſe five things which I have ſpoken of, to ſanctifie our other lawfull meanes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and to make them the more effectuall; and bleſſed be the name of God, wee have found it by experience.

Wee in our extremities have ſought God, Prayed to him, Covenanted with him, Humbled our ſelves before him, owned his Truth, and profeſſed it; and God hath carryed all our affaires ſo, that when oftentimes our wiſe Councellors have failed, and our Armies have failed, and all other helpes have come in, and have told us, that wee are like to bee ruin'd, the Babes and Sucklings never failed to carry it in the times of our extremities: And I have begged it from God, and ſaid it in this place, and cannot but ſay it againe, I would thinke it a wonderfull glory to God, to have it truly Written and Recorded, how in all our extremities, the power that hath come out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings hath ſaved us from utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine: Our adverſaries have laughed at theſe things, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed all the weapons of our Mouth to bee but wind,

Exhortation to maintaine thoſe Forces for time to come.</note> Secondly, becauſe this is the great way of our conquering our enemies, I beſeech you (I principally ſpeake to your Lordſhips, and to thoſe that are intereſted in being the great Councell of the Kingdome) take care that this Magazine of the Mouth, the powers that come out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings may bee preſerved and recruited, and not any wayes disbanded; It is now a great diſpute among you that are wiſe Stateſmen, what wee ſhould doe with our Armies? whether (there being no viſible enemy in the Field) it would not bee fitteſt to disband our preſent Armies? A diſpute I have nothing to doe with; but this I have to doe with, and make bold to tell you, whatſoever you doe with other Armies, you muſt not disband the Forces of the Babes and Sucklings, out of whoſe Mouth comes your ſtrongeſt helpe. You are farre from having your worke done as yet, <hi>Ireland</hi> is in a ſad condition, <hi>England</hi> is wofully unſetled, terrible diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are found every where; looke to it, that you have a force about you; what other Forces are needfull, I leave to your wiſdomes, but ſure I am theſe Babes and Sucklings, are the <hi>Triarii,</hi> the <hi>Veterani,</hi> the old Souldiers, the Life-guard of <hi>England,</hi> disband them once and you are loſt. Therefore for the Lords ſake, ſee that this power that my Text drives at, may have all the encouragement that may bee: <note place="margin">To this end be carefull of two things.</note>And to this end, your Lordſhips muſt be carefull of theſe Two things. Firſt,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1.</note> To give all the aſſiſtance poſſible, that theſe Souldiers may bee encouraged and multiplyed in all parts of the Land, I meane, that the Goſpel may ſpread, the Preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that Saints might bee wonne, and that the Church might bee inlarged, bee ſetled in peace, that there might be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to ſeek God, and to ſerve him according to his will; and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113855:18"/>
know you for certaine, that every ſoul which ſhall be wonne to Chriſt, be it the ſoule of a woman, or of an old man that ſtoops for age, or of a childe, yet every ſoule wonne to Chriſt, and ſo numbred among theſe Babes and Sucklings will bee as ſtout a ſouldier as ever you did employ, and will in your extremity doe more then all the experienced Captains that tread on En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ground, becauſe God is with theſe, and theſe muſt carry it; the power of heaven is engaged with them, therefore for the Lords ſake further Religion, the propagation and ſettling of it; you are wiſe, and can think of the wayes which have been often ſet before you, God Almighty bleſſe you in it, and ever let theſe parties be deare in your eyes, who have ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Heaven, let them bee owned as the Souldiers who will never fail you, though others may and will. The other thing I humbly adviſe is this,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2.</note> That you would alwayes carry this in your wiſe thoughts, never to engage in any cauſe, wherin you ſhould not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with the power that comes out of the Mouthes of theſe Babes and Sucklings: you have found, (though it may be carnall eyes ſee it not) that the prayers and teares of Gods people, and their cleaving to God, and their intereſt in your Cauſe, hath been the greateſt meanes under heaven to keepe your Lordſhips to be a Parliament Houſe to this day; and the Lord keep you, that whatſoever buſineſſe you have, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt or warre ſoever you may have, that your Cauſe bee ſuch, that theſe Babes and Sucklings bee not conſtrained to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from your aſſiſtance; my meaning is, that the Cauſe bee ever good, and ſuch a Cauſe as God will own, and as God cals you to; hitherto your Cauſe hath been manifeſt, and your way hath been cleare; the Lord keep you, that you and the Babes and Sucklings of my Text may live and dye together, and then wee are well enough; but when ever you engage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, or without them, you will be worſted.</p>

helpe in the great worke that now is in hand; doe not ſay you can contribute nothing, it may bee ſome of you have no Money or Lands, no wiſdome or authority: I am ſure thou haſt that which Gods people may receive benefit by, Chriſt hath given thee a mouth, which is a quiver full of choice arrowes; thou canſt profeſſe Chriſts truth, thou canſt ſing his praiſes, thou canſt call him <hi>Abba</hi> father, thou canſt be one of his remembrancers, thou canſt pray for the peace of <hi>Zion,</hi> thou canſt ſay, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven, let thy kingdome come;</hi> and little doeſt thou know what great things thou maiſt doe, in thy Cloſet, in thy Chamber, in the Fields at thy work; no tongue can utter what admirable helpe thou maiſt give; thou maiſt reach <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the one, and deſtroy the other: O for the Lords ſake lay out your ſtrength to the utmoſt; come out (I ſay) and helpe the Lord all that are able; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee that</hi> in a famine <hi>withholds Corne,</hi> the people will curſe him; what will thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be, if thou withholdeſt thy help in the needfull time of trouble; you know <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s ſpeech to <hi>Heſter, Who knowes but thou cameſt to the Kingdome for ſuch a time as this?</hi> I ſay to thee without any if or and, I know thou art indued with all this ſtrength, for ſuch a time as this, O therefore fill thy mouth with praiſes, with confeſſions, with prayers, and with whatever elſe may quell the Lords and thy enemies, even the enemy and the avenger.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113855:19"/>
muſt be uſed and done aright; and there are excellent Rules for every one of theſe, to teach us how to uſe them, ſo as to make them effectuall, but a Sermon will not beare the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them, I ſhall at the preſent commend onely two directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are common to them all:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1.</note> 1 See that that Mouth out of which all this ſtrength muſt be exerciſed, bee a ſanctified Mouth, a Mouth ſeparated to, and engaged in Gods Cauſe onely; let it not bee the Mouth that St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeakes of, <hi>Out of the ſame Mouth comes curſing and bleſſing;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>James</hi> 3. 9. 10.</note> let it not be a Mouth that ſhall ſing <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to Chriſt in the Temple, and <hi>crucifie him</hi> in the Court; that ſhall ſing a <hi>Pſalme</hi> to him in the Congregation, and a <hi>bawdy Catch</hi> in an Alehouſe or Tavern; that ſhall <hi>bleſſe</hi> his Name in the aſſembly of his people, and <hi>bleſpheme</hi> him in the company of prophane ones; that ſhall talk of <hi>Heaven and holineſſe</hi> in one compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and <hi>uncleanneſſe and luxury</hi> in another, this is a Mouth end a Mouth, a double Mouth, that the Lord takes no more pleaſure in, then in a double heart: No, let the Mouth, that is ſuch an excellent inſtrument as this, and the tongue in it, let it (I ſay) bee for the Lord, and for the Lord onely, let it bee a ſanctified Mouth. And ſecondly,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2.</note> 2 That though all this power muſt be exerciſed out of the Mouth, yet it muſt come further then from the Mouth, the Mouth is the inſtrument, it is the gun if you will, or the ſword, but the Mouth it is not the magazine, it is not the ſtore-houſe; though the tongue is the glory for execution, there muſt bee another thing that muſt be the fountaine: <note place="margin">A double ſtore-houſe, whence the Mouth muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with ſtrength.</note>and therefore this ſanctified Mouth muſt fetchall from another treaſury, &amp; there is a double ſtore-houſe whence it muſt be furniſhed. <note place="margin">1 Chriſts Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note>1 <hi>Chriſts merit,</hi> the meritorious cauſe of all the conqueſt, <hi>is the blood of the Limbe;</hi> goe not thou out in the force of thy prayer, ſay not, I can pray, I can preach, I have a bold Spirit to confeſſe Chriſt, and I have taken the Covenant, and will ſtand to it: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid thou ſhouldeſt thinke this can contribute any thing becauſe it is in thee; no, but let the blood of the Lambe be the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe upon which thou relyeſt, faith in it will make the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113855:20"/>
ſling ſtones, able with <hi>David</hi> to kill theſe <hi>Goliahs;</hi> take this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and thou canſt doe nothing. <note place="margin">2 From a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified heart.</note>2 See that all come out of the <hi>good Treaſury within,</hi> from a ſanctified heart; when thy <hi>Mouth makes conſeſſion,</hi> ſee that it come out <hi>of a heart that beleeveth;</hi> if thou <hi>ſing</hi> to Gods glory with thy mouth and voice <hi>it muſt bee with grace in thy heart;</hi> if thou wilt <hi>pray,</hi> ſee to it, that it be not lip-labour, or onely a company of words or ſentences well compoſed, but let it bee the powring out of the heart, the crying with the heart, with an humble heart, with a beleeving heart; and ſo let thy Covenanting bee, thou wilt ſweare a Covenant, let thy heart ſtand to it, and hold it out, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it; this is the way to uſe theſe Mouth-weapons aright. I ſhould have inlarged my Diſcourſe upon them, but I rather feare I have been burthen ſome already to your patience. <hi>Conſider what I have ſaid, and the Lord give you underſtanding in allthings:</hi> And I ſhall end.</p>
