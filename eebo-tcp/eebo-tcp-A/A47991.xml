            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM A Gentleman in Flanders TO A LORD in the PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>NO Motives leſs forceable than the love of my Country, and your Service, could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon me to have given you this Trouble. And firſt I ſhall acquaint you what News we have in this part of the World. The King of <hi>France</hi> has reſolved to ſend with all Expedition Ten thouſand Men into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and an Agreement made with the Turkiſh Privateers to have <hi>Breſt</hi> and the Ports of <hi>Ireland</hi> for their Harbors; but what is moſt conſiderable, the new Pope has declared himſelf in Favour of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and a general Peace: The whole of this is probable, the firſt part certain.</p>
            <p>Now all I beg from your Lordſhip is to lay aſide all Paſſon, Diſſatisfaction and Revenge, and give but Time to your ready Wit to think, What <hi>England</hi> was in <hi>No</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> What it is now : and What it is like to be.</p>
            <p>In <hi>November</hi> laſt, we had a King who had an indubitable Right to the Crown, and Malice cannot deny him theſe Qualities; He is a Prince Frugal, Brave, and Merciful even to a Fault; A Kingdom wealthy, (for I heard it affirmed by knowing Bankers, That there was more Money in <hi>London</hi> than in <hi>Amſterdam, Paris</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) a Trade the greateſt that ever our Kingdom had; a Revenue great, and raiſed only upon our Superfluities ; with an Univerſal Peace with the whole World.</p>
            <p>Now ſee what we are at preſent; we have an Uſurper upon the Throne, engaged in a War with <hi>France, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> our Trade ruined; our Revenue changed from Cuſtoms to Poll-Bills, and Land-Taxes; with the Addition of Free-Quarter, and that in Private Houſes.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee what hopes we have of ſeeing <hi>England</hi> free from this Miſery.</p>
            <p>I remember a moſt excellent and true Maxime I learned from your Lordſhip, <hi>That to alter the Succeſſion of the Crown was to entail a War upon the Kingdom.</hi> And the Truth of this we ſaw verified in the Wars betwixt <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and in our late Uſurpations; and until the indubitable Heir of the Crown was reſtored, <hi>England</hi> ſtill continued in a ſtate of War, though the Uſurper had then <hi>France</hi> to his Friend.</p>
            <p>Is this the preſent ſtate of <hi>England?</hi> Let every Landed and Trading Man conſider then, that we are engaged in War; and War muſt be maintained, or Souldiers will maintain themſelves, which is worſe. But the great Query <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, How all theſe Wars muſt be maintained? The Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is eaſie; they muſt be maintained by Land, or Trade: for Trade, that is already gone, and once loſt is hardly retrieved; and the Cuſtoms which afforded a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Money the laſt Year, will the next hardly defray the Officers Salaries. For Land, it is already charged with Seventy thouſand Pound <hi>per Menſem,</hi> which by a tolerable Calculate is a Twentieth part of the clear yearly Revenue of the Kingdom; concurring to this I <abbr>s</abbr>
               <hi>per</hi> 
               <abbr>l</abbr> upon all Land, there is another Twentieth part; and the like upon perſonal Eſtates: So that he who hath 600 <abbr>l</abbr> a Year muſt allow a Hundred for meer Taxes. Were this all, it were ſupportable; but the Country-man muſt pay his Rent out of Wooll, Corn, and Cattle; Wooll which gave 8 <abbr>l</abbr> a Stone, will not now give 4 Corn and Cattle fell at the ſame Rate proportionably; then the Farmer can pay but half Rent: So here 600 <abbr>l</abbr> is reduced to 250. And I believe many would be glad to have well payed them 250 <abbr>l</abbr> neat Money, for 600 <abbr>l</abbr> a Year Land.</p>
            <p>Another Conſideration no leſs melancholy than this is, our Trade gone; this needs no Proof, every Man doth both ſee and feel it; and no Trade no Sea-men, no Sea-men no Navy, no Navy no Wooden Walls; and then our <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Conquered than if it were upon the Continent. And ſure it is worth a Thought to think, What muſt become of all thoſe Sea-men, Dray-men, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Forty other ſort of Mechanick Trades, whoſe Livelihood and Subſiſtance depended upon Trade: They muſt and will live, and <hi>Maſianello</hi> like will take it without diſtinction from thoſe that have it.</p>
            <p>Nor can any reaſonable Man imagine, that a King turn'd out of Three Kingdoms will leave any Stone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd for his Reſtauration, but will rather come with Force as a Conqueror than not at all. And the thing will not look difficult to him that doth but conſider how the Diſcontents increaſe in <hi>England;</hi> and as their Neceſſities grow, ſo will their Hatred to the Government, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate their diſpair of ever ſeeing either Peace, or Plenty, without ſeeing their lawful King ſeated upon his Throne. Freſh and great Supplies are now preſs'd for, and that ſpeedily; which though granted, can never be raiſed; for no Revenue can ſtand long when Money does not circulate: And it's now obvious to Men of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt capacity, that the Kingdom of great <hi>Britain</hi> can never be happy, until they ſee his Majeſty in <hi>White-hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, I beg for your own ſake, the ſake of your Country, and all that can be called Good, Pious and Juſt, to Conſider theſe weak Notions I have offered to you, and improve them by that excellent Wit, eloquent Tongue, and diſcerning Judgment, Gifts given you from Heaven; and if not employed to this good End, expect a Judgment for miſapplying ſuch Faculties. But boldly communicate your Thoughts both to Lords and Commons, that as they tender the happineſs of Themſelves, or Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they reſtore his Majeſty, who will deny nothing for their Good, and conſiſtent with his own Security.</p>
            <p>The Author, I think, you cannot gueſs at; but if you ſhould, conceal him: For it's one that deſires to live to ſerve you, and queſtion not his Power of doing it.</p>
