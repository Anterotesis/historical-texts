         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have laid the greateſt Task upon me, that I ever under-went in all my Days: You have obliged me to ſpeak of the moſt important Matters of our Nation, and allowed me ſcarce one Minute for Thought or Premeditation: But may that Almighty Power, <hi>by whom Kings reign,</hi> inſtruct me! and may an Heart and Soul full of Loyalty, furniſh my Tongue with Argument and Elocution!</p>
            <p>My Undertaking is great and difficult: Who can ſpeak of Kings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Awe and Reverence? Or, Who can be an Orator, when thoſe Two contrary Paſſions of <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> at once ſtruggle in his Breaſt? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look back to the Peaceful Days of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the laſting Happineſſes of his Reign, but I muſt drop a Tear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Hearſe: Nor can I look forwards, towards the preſent Glories of <hi>James</hi> the Second, but I am overwhelm'd with Joy, and a Loyal Tranſport ſeizes me. We have loſt One of the Beſt of Princes, which ever ſway'd theſe <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Scepters, <hi>Charles the Gracious;</hi> a Prince, who was the Care of Heaven, the Darling of his Subjects; whoſe Life was a Miracle, and his whole Reign one continued Bleſſing: <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> were the Supporters of his Throne; and <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Good Wiſhes</hi> the Legacy he has left us. I cannot relate the laſt Words of that Incomparable Prince, without a Sigh; I dare not name them, without Tears for our general Loſs: Thus he remembred us in his dying Words, if ſuch a Prince may be ſaid to die: <hi>Brother! I am now going to reſign up my Self to</hi> God, <hi>and my Crown and Government to</hi> You; <hi>Grant me theſe few Requeſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>In all Your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakings, ſet the Fear of</hi> God <hi>before Your Eyes, and let that direct you.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>Remember to maintain the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as now by Law Eſtabliſhed.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. <hi>Govern Your Subjects with Mercy, Eaſe and Peace.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>IV. <hi>Be good to my Queen, and Children.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>This was the Royal Legacy which he left us; a Legacy, truly becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Prince as <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. But this is not all, though a great deal more than we deſerved, the greateſt Bleſſing is ſtill behind; He has Jeſt us his <hi>Royal Brother, JAMES</hi> the Second, to Succeed him in his Throne, and Vertues: This muſt wipe away all our Griefs, this muſt make our Joys Perfect, and Crown our Lives with a laſting Happineſs. The <hi>Sun</hi> is ſet with us; but no Night follows: <hi>Charles the Gracious,</hi> is only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd for <hi>JAMES the Juſt:</hi> And though our King be dead, yet the Monarch lives. We are bleſt again with a Gracious Prince; A Prince, whoſe Vertues need no <hi>Panegyrick;</hi> and to Praiſe him according to his moſt Excellent Greatneſs, is above the feeble Power of <hi>Oratory</hi> and <hi>Eloquence.</hi> What Vertues can we wiſh for in a Prince, which our preſent Soveraign brings not to his Throne? What Joyes are wanting to make us Happy, which he will not beſtow?</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101609:1"/>
            <p>Would we have our Religion ſecured? We have the Laws on our ſide, and the Royal Word of a King for't: The King has declared, That he will maintain our Religion, as now by Law Eſtabliſhed; and do what in him lies, to make the Church of <hi>England</hi> flouriſh.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen! <hi>Where the Word of a King is, there is Power:</hi> And what the King hath declared, he will make good; for no Prince is juſter to his Word, than he is. Would we have our Rights and Liberties preſerved? We have a Prince of the greateſt Juſtice upon Earth. Whil'ſt he was a Subject, he was the moſt Faithful Friend, and the Beſt of Maſters to his Servants; and, I hope, a good Maſter will never make an ill King. But more; We have his Royal Promiſe, <hi>That he will walk in the Steps of his deareſt Brother.</hi> Would we have the Glories of our Kingdom maintain'd; would we ſee the Old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bravery once again Flouriſh! We have now the moſt Victorious and Warlike Prince in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> a King, who dares attempt any thing, but an ill Act; a King, who has been a Souldier almoſt from his Cradle. I need not tell you, how he ſignalized his Valour under the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> I need not ſpeak of his Magnanimity under <hi>Don Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> againſt the <hi>French</hi> King then in League with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels: I need not remember you of the Extraordinary Hazards of his Royal Perſon, in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Engagements, fighting for the Rights and Honour of our Nation, and expoſing himſelf in a Shower of Fire and Bullets; Bullets, which diſtinguiſh not the greateſt Prince from the meaneſt Souldier.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> He was then the Joy and Treaſure of our Nation; and our Repreſentatives in <hi>Parliament,</hi> did not only gratefully acknowledge his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; but did almoſt Loyally chide him, for hazarding his Royal Perſon in War, in whom all our Hopes and Expectations were center'd. He is ſtill the ſame <hi>JAMES the Juſt,</hi> the Valiant, and the Brave; though we (I wiſh I were not to name it, for the Honour of my Nation) ingratefully revolted from him.</p>
            <p>Away then with all <hi>Phanatick</hi> Fears and Jealouſies! Can the Grand-Child of <hi>James the Peaceful,</hi> can the Son of <hi>Charles the Martyr,</hi> can the Brother of <hi>Charles the Gracious,</hi> can the Victorious and Juſt <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Albany</hi> prove an ill King? It cannot be. Can he, who has been an Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Subject for Fifty two Years together; can the juſteſt Maſter, and the firmeſt Friend, and the moſt Faithful Brother, prove an ill King? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; and <hi>God</hi> forbid, that any one ſhould think it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> Let us remember our Duties, and endeavour all we can to be Loyal; and then we need not doubt, but <hi>God</hi> will bleſs us with a Merciful and a Gracious King. Our Submiſſion to his Rule, our Content and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obedience under his Government, will return to us in Showers of Mercy, Kindneſs and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Good Subjects do generally make good Kings; and if our King ſhould prove otherwiſe, it will be our own Faults. What ſhall I ſay more? <hi>Charles the Gracious</hi> ſtill lives in <hi>JAMES the Juſt.</hi> We have only chang'd the Name, not alter'd the Sovereign.</p>
            <p>Away then with thoſe odious Names of <hi>Whigg</hi> and <hi>Tory;</hi> let'em be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and buried: Let us remember, that we are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men; the former will teach us Loyalty and Allegiance to our King; Love, Unity, and Good Wiſhes towards one another: the latter will engage us to maintain the Glories and Peace of our Church and Nation; and to preſerve the Beſt of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the Happieſt of <hi>Governments.</hi> Let us all, with one Heart and Mind, Bleſs <hi>God</hi> for theſe Mercies; and ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God ſave King</hi> JAMES <hi>the Second.</hi>
