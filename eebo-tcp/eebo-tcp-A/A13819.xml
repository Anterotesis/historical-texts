         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> BELEEVE) First I thinke it
needfull to expound this word
BELEEVE; then to shew the
vse of it: and lastly to what end
it is vsed of the beleeuers. The
word seemeth of a compound
and proper signification, deeper than meere
English can vnderstand: for it meaneth therein
or thereby throughly to liue, wherein we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue:
yeelding vp the possession of all spirituall
senses; disposed from all earthly affection of the
members, by the true mortification in spirit: for
this syllable (be) in apposition, is no lesse posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
or effectiue with vs at this day, than with the
Hebrewes of ancient time (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) or BE: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
importeth in, by or through: but far more
inwardly of vs to be vnderstood, bicause it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
a most secret meaning to the word it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:
as for example, thinke and bethinke, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a very deepe cogitation to thinking: get
and beget; where it hath some speciall conceit in


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2602:5"/>
meaning, seem and beseem; here it makes that,
which was in outward shew, only like it self, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
becom a very beautifull creature to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.
(Besides, this syllable (be) that holdeth
so small room in a Common-wealth, causeth any
adiunct to remaine substantially in his subiect, as
I BELEEVE) to wit, I am wholy liuing in God the
father, &amp;c. so, as quicksiluer confoundeth all
other mettals, and transformeth their bodies by
his liuelyhood: so doth this syllable bring a word
of common and open sense, to a most close and
necessarie signification in spirit: so that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
argueth a trustie confidence in the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
subiect of spirit; and for the time of stedfast
beleeuing, the spirit hath no manner of sympathie
with the flesh, but the flesh remaineth dead, and
mortified to all naturall inclination, in pleasure
or suffering: whether it be health or sicknes, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
or pouertie, loue or hatred, cheerfulnes or
griefe of hart, or any other pleasure or calamitie
incident whatsoeuer: the communion of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
being hereby redeemed out of the prison of
flesh, and euapored into life eternall. For the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is no more ruled by the flesh, but the flesh by


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2602:5"/>
the spirit. What then is subiect to this spirituall
beleef,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 29.</note> mettals, wood or stone, as the altar Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,
or such like? No, you shall not finish, that
you haue in your mind to do, if you serue wood
or stone as the heathen. Is it mettall? not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousest
of all mettals, gold: for mightie Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
haue been deceiued by their golden Idols,
and haue perished:<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 1.</note> as Nebuchadnezar by his
Image of sixtie cubits high, and six broad. The
Idols stand vp as a palme tree,<note place="margin">Ierem. 10. 5.</note> but speake not;
they are born, for they cannot goe; they can doe
neither euill nor good:<note place="margin">Ierem. 10. 9.</note> fear them not. Siluer
plates are brought from Tarshish, and gold from
Vphaz, the work of mens hands. There shall com
out of Bels mouth that,<note place="margin">Ier. 51. 44.</note> which he hath swallowed
vp, and the nations shal no more flow vnto it. But
the wall of Babell shall fall, and become an asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
among nations. Can men make gods
that are no gods? Can their owne hands make
them a redeemer, or their handy worke saue
them? No: for the beleef of all men being liuely
and spiritual, cannot liue for euer, or be faithfully
reposed in such vnprofitable subiects; seeing, in
them there is no blast of life: for, they neither


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2602:6"/>
breath, nor smell, nor hear, nor walk, nor speak,
wherin then can they liue? How should they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
a man, that trusteth in them? but both the
caruer and the work perisheth togither. What
then is subiect to this spirituall beleef? A horse;
bicause he runneth fiercely in the battel; or many
thousand chariots; bicause they seem inuincible:
or man, bicause he can deuise and determin long
before: nay, or princes; that so many millions of
knees bow vnto? these all haue place of life, for
they, both breath, smell, hear, and speak, and eeke
can go and not be borne: yet seeing their bodies
be altogither fraile and dissoluble, wasting to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
there is no place for euerlasting life found
in them, whereupon the spirit of beleef should
work; much lesse any meanes, wherby the grosse
nature of man might be iustified.<note place="margin">Psal. 33. 17.</note> The horse is
void of vnderstanding.<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 28.</note> All Pharaos chariots and
confidence perished at once.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24. 1.</note> Dauid was plagued
for numbring of his host of eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
fighting men, whose power and trust was
soon abated by affliction. This teacheth vs then
the vanity of gold, the senslesnes of wood and
stone, the weak defence of horse and chariot; nay


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2602:6"/>
more,<note place="margin">Psal. 118. 9.</note> the vtmost safety of an host, and the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in princes: for here, Dauid being a king,
could not saue his host from the pestilence, nor
his incomparable number worke their Lords se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie;
wherfore man (we see) is not the thing to
be beleeued in: albeit, he hath both sense and
power, in a firme vnderstanding. For in nothing,
but in man is this worke of faith required, so that
whatsoeuer is aboue man knoweth al things, and
what so is below him hopeth for nothing. One
man may trust in another, or one may aduaunce
himselfe aboue his fellowes; but the one and the
other do both fall,<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 11.</note> as when the children of Israell
murmured against Moses, being a man, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the punishment to be his, that was inflicted
on them, shewing that in their prosperitie, they
beleeued in him only: wherefore they perished
infinitely through their misbeleef: for as they
were obedient to man; so died they in their own
corruption. Otherwise if man could be saued by
beleeuing in man, or in mans works, there is not
one that would be disinherited of eternall life,
and the promise of saluation would seem meerly
friuolous.<note place="margin">Numb. 20. 10.</note> Moses and Aaron lifted vp themselues


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2602:7"/>
at the rock, whose honor was abased by extreme
punishment.<note place="margin">Gen. 10. 8.</note> Nimrod began to be mighty vpon
the earth, and erected a kingdom by his owne
might: to wit, the cities Babel, Erech, Accad, and
Calne,<note place="margin">Gen. 11. 4.</note> all built in the land of Shinar. Who said,
com let vs build vs a citie and a tower, whose top
may reach vnto heauen, that we may get vs a
name; lest we be scattered vpon the earth. He had
spoken more prophetically if he had said, that we
may be scattered vpon the earth: seeing it becam
suddenly the cause of their horrible confusion;
so that they were made as aliens in their country
and citie, one not vnderstanding anothers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
euen so are the arrogant depriued of
their glory, when their most prouident securitie
turneth to destruction. By this is shewed, what it
is to beleeue, what manner of creature is bound
to beleeue, and who are misbeleeuers. Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the necessary vse of it, and to what end
we so constantly vse the same. Vnderstand ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that it is the ioint of all the articles of our
faith: nay, without it can be made no effectuall
article at all; but all the whole speech becommeth
a confused heap of faithlesse syllables. By belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2602:7"/>
we are discerned from Infidels and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
people, that are as bruit beasts, without any
hope or knowledge, our religious constancy is
manifested, our bond of amity and league of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
societie sealed. It is the fire, hammer and
touch, to purifie, mally and try vs; it is the winde
that diuideth the wheat from the chaff: it is a most
comfortable meditation in all seasons; a salue
against all offences and scandals whatsoeuer. A
man may in his mind beleeue, and not vtter it:
but then cannot his faith appeere vnto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
So that he shall becom a stumbling blocke
vnto them: and thus much for the very protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the word. Now concerning the end of
beleeuing, it is to be saued: and touching the
cause, why we must not beleeue in the vanity of
the aboue recited powers, it is; that there is no
safetie or saluation in them: for man hath no
power of his owne saluation, neither is any man
to put trust in the strength of his owne arme, to
deliuer him from death. We beleeue therfore
that the subiect of this our spirituall faith shal liue
for euer: and that the spirit that now is imprisoned
in this our flesh, shall mortifie our corrupt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

by an vnwauering faith, which before it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
to fly vnto that eternall dwelling place,
may so sanctifie our fowl and sinfull nature, that
we bee made fit vessels to comprehend eternall
life. For seeing there is no manner of saluation
with flesh, wood or stone, or any other thing that
our earthly senses can perceiue, we must inuent a

a college or digestion of all senses, and meer spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

spirit that we are to beleeue in: for it is the very
issue of all things, the breth of his mouth created
all, maintaineth all, yea and destroieth all at his
will; him are we to worship as Lord of all, who in

or end IEHOVA, who euer was, only is, and

he himself is the root of time, &amp; the point therof:
his beginning is vnsearchable; his presence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable,
and his continuance euerlasting: in
him then we must beleeue that will be saued, or
delight to liue for euer and euer; not liply only in

conceiuing that his infinite maiestie and power
that giueth our vnderstanding matter to worke

vpon: before him standeth the end of all flesh, the
relaxation of spirit, the volubility of all soules is

any God besides him, or like him; therfore speak
no more presumptuously; let not arrogancy com

The bowe and the mighty men are broken,
and the weake haue girded themselues with
strength; they that are full are hired foorth for
bread, and the hungry are no more hired: so that
the barren hath borne seuen, and she that hath
many children is feeble. The Lord killeth, and
maketh aliue; bringeth downe to the graue, and
raiseth vp; the Lord maketh poor, and maketh
rich;<note place="margin">Psal. 113. 7.</note> bringeth down, and exalteth: he raiseth vp
the poor out of the dust, and lifteth vp the begger
out of the dunghill, to set them among princes,
and to make them inherit the seat of glory. For
the pillars of the earth are the Lords, and he hath
set the world vpon them: he will keep the feet of
his saints, and the wicked shall keepe silence in
darknes. For in his owne might shall no man be
strong; the Lords aduersaries shall be destroied,


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2602:11"/>
and out of heauen shall he thunder vpon them:
the Lord shall iudge the ends of the world, and
shall giue power vnto his king, and exalt the horn
of his annointed. Therfore whoso beleeueth
stedfastly in him, he is already translated into life
eternall. Through this beleef was Enoch and
Elias taken vp quick into heauen, to remain hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

pleased God; for he walked with him, and was

Eliah while hee walked with Elisha taken by a

on this heauenly Godhead, that he knew before
that he should be taken vp, when as he said to
Elisha;<note place="margin">2. King. 2. 9.</note> What shal I do for thee before I be taken
from thee? Neither must we think that there is
any other mediation to be made for vs by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
saints, or elementall creatures of what sort
soeuer, than our owne spirituall confession and
liuely protestation: for after we duly conceiue
what a God he is, by him our temporall life (that
beleeue) shall be translated into euerlasting life.
This is the fountaine of nature, and nature it self;
the author of antiquity,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 22.</note> and the ancient of daies;


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2602:12"/>
whose word is truth; whose being is inuariable,
and whose place is perfection. He made man the
most excellent creature on the earth, whom he
created in honor,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 15.</note> and placed in pleasure. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his owne image made he him,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 27.</note> that hee
might be glorified in him, and gaue him domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ouer all his creatures in earth. This then is
to be beleeued of vs, that as we remained in him
and his power before all worlds were made, and
before our first father Adam was created: so
when he shall take this life from vs that he hath
giuen vs, and bereaue vs of this earthly steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that we shall return again to that euerlasting
place, wherin we were first elected and prepared,
before the world was made, or any foundation
laid therof. Adam fell by misbeleef to death by
neglecting the first caueat that God gaue him,
who soon, by the inticement of the woman, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
extremely, by eating of the only forbidden
tree of the garden:<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> both being circumuented by
the subtilitie of satan, the prince of darknes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are we our selues free from that corruption,
which he wrought vnto vs his posterity: yet God,
to keepe his owne image from desperation, hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2602:12"/>
to promise him life again,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> if he would harken
vnto it: which, no doubt, Adam laid hold on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contented for to leaue the pleasure, that he
had in this world, only hoping for life in the
world to com.<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 23.</note> For, he named his wife Euah, life,
foreseeing that she should be the mother of life,
and, that her seed should bruse the serpents head,
which he counted a sufficient reuenge vpon his
deadly enimy.<note place="margin">Isai. 27. 1.</note> In what day, the Lord with his
mighty sword should visit the piercing serpent:
yea, that crooked serpent, and slea the dragon in
the sea: and he most assuredly beleeued, that it
should happen, though in his daies he might not
see it.<note place="margin">Deut. 3. 28.</note> Euen so trauelled Moses for the rest he

and likewise Dauid warred for the peace of
Salomon.<note place="margin">1. King. 1.</note> Therfore let men be wise, and take
heed of surfetting in too much pleasure of this
world, least they be wholy disinherited of the
world to com. We see how glad Adam was to
imbrace this little branch of life, wheras before,
he made no reckoning of the whole body which
he enioyed. His beginning was happines, but by
his disobedience, hath left a cursed inheritance to


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2602:13"/>
all nations of the earth. Wherefore it is not
ynough for vs to continue in the state, wherin we
were first borne, albeit, it had been blessednes in
him so to haue done: for, then we abide still, as
children of wrath.<note place="margin">Col. 3. 5. 6.</note> But, seeing so many, so little
alter from their nature, let vs all bee circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and looke about vs, how to escape this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of ignorance, the bait of satan, as the part of
a wise man is, to see, both before and behinde,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Hom. II.</note> not too much besotted with the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the present time. Let vs, therfore, looke
back and consider by our fall, from whence our
redemption is to com: then, with a liuely faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
lay hold of it, as did Adam and the rest of
the holy fathers, which, before the law or any
ordinances were made, receiued the comfort of
the holy Ghost: hauing an entire hope of the
continuall grace of the same God. For, from
thencefoorth Adams conscience dwelt in the
Lord: so that, he beleeued in God the father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
maker of heauen and earth. And this was
a true faith in him, bicause he had no other father
but God, who was almighty: for he made him of
nothing, he made also heauen and earth: earth to


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2602:13"/>
bring foorth creatures, and heauen to nourish
them vnto mans vse. Therfore we rightly say
(Our father) or, I beleeue in God, the father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
maker of heauen and earth. For, euery
mans faith is knowne vnto himselfe, and, another
mans faith is to him vncertaine. This beleefe
brought life vnto him that was dead; likewise
Noah his beleefe was the same in the arke; such
was Abrahams, when he would haue offered his
only sonne Isaac: in whose seed, the blessing of
all nations was hoped for,<note place="margin">Gen. 12 3.</note> according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
and the like in many other, which, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity
I recite not:<note place="margin">Exod. 4. 30.</note> as Moses by his wondrous mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in the land of Egypt: in so much as he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
al the wit,<note place="margin">2. King. 6. 6.</note> &amp; magick of that land; Elisha made
iron to swim in the water, with many other, which
became true prophets of things to come: so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
was their beleef in those daies, that their
daily bread was the heauenly cogitation of this
eternall subiect,<note place="margin">Matt. 6. 11.</note> the infinity of power, happines,
strength and honor; the recorder of his owne
hand-work; the register of all that is done; the
cause of all things that shall happen. We haue, in
respect of him, no maner of being, no presence,


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2602:14"/>
no life, no perfection; our being is inconstant;
for man is vnstable in all his waies. Our presence
is of no abiding:<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 5.</note> for he hath made our daies but
as a span long. To conclude, our actions and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations
are so peruerse and wicked, that it
might repent the Lord of our redemption, as it
repented him that he made man.<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 7.</note> And a very smal
number should enter the ark, and be saued. That
poore life which we haue, is no more to be respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
than death it self, seeing it withereth as the
lilly in all his glory. Our greatest perfection is
but extreme imperfection, when as the works of
God in beginning, middle and end, are absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect for euer. His beginning endeth, his
mean time both beginneth and endeth: his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
is a momentary end, and there is no
other mean time with him. Is it then ynough to
say, I BELEEVE IN GOD THE FATHER AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY
MAKER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH?
In no wise: for although we are bound to beleeue
so much, yet is it not all that is required of vs; for
the very Iews beleeued thus much: whose beleef
was to be saued. They saw the saluation of the
Lord a far off through remorse in conscience:


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2602:14"/>
considering their fall, and the wickednes of mans
thoughts all day long. Adam their father had lost
his state of knowledge, they therfore remained
in ignorance sinfull; and their whole hope was
to be grounded vpon the comfortable promises
of that God, and otherwise it had been hard for
them to haue conceiued in their minds so great
an eternity, and such an immortall happines. But
God bereauing man his image of that honor
which he once affoorded him, which is to say, the
inheritance of a paradise, would not vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him, but rather make him by a liuely faith
to await for a blessed estate to abide for euer, yea
for euer and euer. As Adam being first in the
adoption of blessednes and life, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we all by him: became accursed and died,
made vs accursed and to dy daily: and as he by
the almighty Gods meanes hoped to regain his
saluation; so we particularly ought to scan the
meanes of his saluation, to keepe our fraile flesh
from desperation; to comfort our guiltines of
death, and to keep vs from euerlasting damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
His meanes was the comfort of a victory,
wherin he reioiced as a giant to run his course:<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 5.</note>


               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:2602:15"/>
and he did most constantly beleeue, that as God
promised, so he should vanquish his most subtile
and deadly enimy. What could more win the
hart of man, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such a promise? Sundry such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
from age to age were reuealed to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity:<note place="margin">Gen. 9 26.</note>
As to Noah; Blessed be the God of Sem.
To Abraham;<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 6.</note> I will multiply thee as the stars of
heauen, when as yet he had no child, and his wife
was old. To Dauid by the prophet Nathan; I will
be his father,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 7. 14.</note> he shall be my sonne: if he sin, I will
chasten him with the rod of men, but my mercy
shall not part away from him, as I tooke it from
Saul, whom I haue put away before thee; and
thine house shal be established, and thy kingdom
for euer before thee; thy throne shall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
for euer.<note place="margin">Ier. 33. 14.</note> In that day I will cause the
branch of righteousnes to grow vp vnto Dauid,
and he shall execute right iudgement in the land:
then shall Iuda be saued, and Ierusalem dwell
safely: and he that shall call her, is the Lord our
righteousnes. For thus saith the Lord; Dauid shal
neuer want a man to sit vpon the throne of the
house of Israell. This is the good then which the
Lord will performe vnto the house of Israell, and


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2602:15"/>
vnto the house of Iuda. These were all most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
promises still to stay the hart of man in
his owne saluation:<note place="margin">Isay. 7. 14.</note> yet receiued Isay a greater
light, when he vnderstood the name of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror:<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24.</note>
but Daniell the greatest comfort, to
whom the precise time of victory and blessing to
all the world was foretold, which was in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Messias, which we call CHRIST the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
Iesus that was promised the sauiour of
the world. These men were reuiued by meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises;
but we being adopted heires of their hope
do exceed their faith in beleeuing in this Iesus:
for we conclude with Peter,<note place="margin">Matt. 16. 16.</note> that he is the sonne
of the liuing God. Wherfore we say; AND IN
IESVS CHRIST, to be vnderstood euery mans
Iesus or Sauiour that beleeueth: whom Iesus or
Iehoshua the sonne of Nun, sauiour and captain
of the Israelites, prefigured long before; that as
he led Moses people into the promised land, and
sustained them in all their iourneyes: so shall this
Iesus defend and keep vs, that call and trust vpon
him, from all subtile and malitious inuentions of
satan, and the world whatsoeuer, and most cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously
carrie vs through this vale of misery,


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2602:16"/>
to a promised land of rest, a paradise, wherin he
himselfe is Lord; and they that will not endure
patiently the calamities, vexations, and variety
of this iourney to rest, shall surely haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with the murmurers of Israell, and the ten
wearied and vncomfortable spies of the land of
Canaan, which might not see the land againe,
that they had once without cause blamed,<note place="margin">Numb. 13. 29.</note> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Gods decree. And (no doubt) with their false
reports greeued many thousand soules; and had
not the Lord put into the harts of Iosua and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb
his valiant seruants to speak the truth, many
surely might haue perished in infidelity: but the
Lord found Caleb as a hart harty, and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
not fearing death; who was therfore rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with a second youth,<note place="margin">Ioshu. 14. 11.</note> both in strength and
wisdome; his youth came againe vnto him, and
his age returned forty yeeres, answering well the
question of regeneration, or second birth, made
by Nicodemus to our true Iosua,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 4.</note> or sauiour in
the Gospell, to still and pacify the grudging mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
of the people, which the false spies had raised
through the host. Iosua was to them a shepheard,
signifying our shepheard Iesus that guideth vs to


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2602:16"/>
heauen. The blind Iewes maketh saluation in this
word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> saue vs; where they haue both in word
and sense Iesus; yet will it not agree with their
consciences to say Iesus saue vs: but the cause of
their wilfull error in this point is, that they may
couer many sinnes with one excuse. For to say
he came not, vtterly denieth his condemnation
to be by them; it denieth that he was crucified by
them; it denieth that they so wickedly pierced
him; it denieth that they gaue him gall and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to drink; it excuseth their buffering, mocking
and scourging of him; their spitting at him; their
crowning of him with thornes, and generally
whatsoeuer else they did despitefully vnto him.
But when these things were alleaged to them,
and the certainty of his comming to be iust in the
fulnes of time, prooued: they began (wheras be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they skilfully contended) with bashfulnes to

bruised reed shall he not breake: euen so pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
went he as a sheep vnto the slaughter, not
opening his mouth. Oh how vnspeakable see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
this patience to vs his followers, when, the
least occasions (the greatest in this respect being
nothing) can withdraw our most heauenly and
deuout cogitations of spirit, to the most earthly
and sensuall wil of the flesh? Which plainly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth
our vnwilling seruice of God; our vrged
obedience towards him; our most vndutifull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of him; our idle hands in his vineyard;
our dull eares in hearing him, and whatsoeuer
else we neglect, which generally is the time plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of vs all. Wherfore (good brethren) serue


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2602:18"/>
him as ye ought, willingly: obey him liberally:
humbly attend on him: be not found idle in the
vintage, nor as deafe adders stopping your eares
at the voice of the charmer, charm he neuer so
wisely: neither harden your harts as in the day
of prouocation, or in the day of temptation in
the wildernes, and let vs learne to serue the world
euen as it serueth vs, which is euen then to loath
it, when it seemeth most amiable, then to refuse it
when it most desireth vs; and then to fear it most
when it most fawneth vpon vs. But what crosses
can the frailty of mans flesh abide? or from what
will or earthly pleasure can it abstaine? truly not
the least: although it were to win the euerlasting
ioy of heauen. Notwithstanding, Iesus warneth
vs to suffer reproches for his sake,<note place="margin">Math. 5. 11.</note> adding bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes
to our patience: and also he willeth vs to
com vnto him all that are weary and heauy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,<note place="margin">Math. 11. 28.</note>
and he will refresh vs. Likewise he saith vnto
vs; Take on my yoke, and learn of me, for I am
meeke and lowly in hart, and ye shall finde rest
for your soules. Recording the prophets exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations

Take heed to the ancient waies of your fathers


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2602:19"/>
Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, which is the good
way; walk therin, and you shall find rest for your
soules. This is the saluation that the prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
so much delighted in:<note place="margin">Psal. 69.</note> For, saith he, God will
saue Sion, and build againe the walles of the city
of Iuda, and they shall dwell there, and inherit
it, and the seed of his seruants shall inherit it;
and they that loue his name shall dwell therin.
Iesus was sent, not only a sauiour to the Iewes
that faithfully receiued him, bicause they were
his owne kindred: but also vnto them that were
without, yea euen the Gentiles: As it is said;
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath
raised vp a mighty saluation for vs in the house of
his seruant Dauid: to be a light to lighten the
Gentiles, and a glory to the people of Israel: and
to perform the oth which he sware to our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Abraham, that he would giue vs. There may
we well vnderstand and mark, that he was sent a
deliuerance to all nations, that they whosoeuer
should call vpon him, might be deliuered from
the feare of their enimies ghostly or bodily, to
wit, the outragious threatnings of Satan, or any
opprobrious comminations of this world. This


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2602:19"/>
was the saluation that Simeon prophesied of, and
receiued comfort by,<note place="margin">Luke 2.</note> when he said; Lord now
lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace; for mine
eies haue seen thy saluation: and likewise Maries
thanksgiuing,<note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> when she said; My soule doth mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
the Lord, and my spirit reioiceth in God my
sauiour. It seemeth the prophets had no greater
comfort than still to be foreshewing of this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
the redemption of the world; as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
mention.<note place="margin">Isai. 1. 2. 3.</note> In that day the highest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

let vs go vp to the mountaine of the Lord, to the
house of the God of Iacob; and he will teach vs
his waies, and we will walk in his pathes: for the
law shall go foorth of Sion, and the word of the

vpon the throne of Dauid, and vpon his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to order it, and to establish it with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

zeale of the Lord of hosts will performe this.
But there shall come a rod foorth of the stock of
Iesse,<note place="margin">Isai. 11. 1. 10.</note> and a graffe shall grow foorth of his root:
and in that day the root of Iesse which shall stand
vp, for a signe vnto the people: the nations shall
seek vnto it, and his rest shall be glorious. This
then is the most true, and comfortable rest for
the soules of all them that trust in him.<note place="margin">Isai. 22. 17.</note> And the
work of iustice shall be peace, euen the work of

vnto all the world, as in the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Let them giue glory vnto the Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his praise in the Islands: which whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
bicause it so strongly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth this work, let
the reader apply it to this place. I haue held my
peace a long time, saith the Lord, and refrained
my selfe euen a thousand yeeres;<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 7.</note> by the which

His annointing is prophesied here like wise;
The spirit of the Lord is vpon me,<note place="margin">Isai. 61.</note> therfore the


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2602:21"/>
Lord hath annointed me; he hath sent me to
preach good tidings to the poor; to binde vp the
broken harted; to preach liberty to the captiues;
and to them that are bound the opening of the
prison, &amp;c. What a woonderfull delight had this
prophet from time to time to set before the eies
of the people the comming of their sauior, Iesus?
yea the whole world was too little to withdraw
him from the confidence that hee had already
conceiued of his redemption to come. This
therfore I thought not amisse to lay downe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the prophets confidence, the rather to
strengthen the weake harted, and to stay such as
should be falling. For if the prophet by the ey of
faith could assure saluation imminent to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers
of the people: how much rather then is
it to be required, that we by the help of our sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnderstanding should not faile of that faith.
For haue not our ears heard Christs own words?
Haue not our eies seen the manifestation of him
in the flesh? Who hath not heard of his works
that he did on the earth?<note place="margin">Math. 1.</note> Who hath not heard of
his birth?<note place="margin">Math. 2.</note> And that he was carried into Egypt?
Haue we not heard that he was baptized in Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan?<note place="margin">Math. 3.</note>


               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:2602:21"/>
Haue we not heard of his fasting,<note place="margin">Math. 4.</note> preaching
and the diuels tempting of him? Haue we not
heard of his woondrous cures?<note place="margin">Math. 8.</note> Haue we not
heard how he made Apostles to preach? Haue
we not heard of the feeding of fiue thousand
men with three loaues and two fishes?<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> and many
other miracles which he did? Yea surely: we haue
heard of his passion, his descension, and ascension
also; and yet is all this too little to enable our
weake spirits to faith, except with Didymus we
feel, or with Nicodemus enter into the wombe
againe: our wickednes is so great, that through
faith we can imagine no assured saluation for vs
in our God: wherupon suddenly we say with the
foole;<note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note> Tush there is no God. But wo to them that
say to their maker, Thou madest me not. Shall the
vessell say to the potter, Thou didst not fashion
me, or make me excellent, or why didst thou not
make me honorable, as som other of thy work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship?
Surely the vessell that inquireth thus,
shall be dasht and broken in a thousand pieces. Is
the work better than the workman? or whence
was the creation of man?<note place="margin">Psal. 24.</note> Open ye euerlasting
doores, and the king of glory shall com in. Now


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2602:22"/>
seeing we haue all heard of this Iesus, the sonne
of God our redeemer, our euerlasting quietnes
and rest: let vs all study to be rich in the true
knowledge of him, and therby, only to receiue
the most glorious comfort of this world. First to
know assuredly, that he, the same that was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
came according to the fulnes of time, for the
saluation of mankinde. Bicause he being God,
begotten of his father before all worlds, became
man by his father borne in the world, whom the
world was not woorthy of. He became flesh to
free and saue vs from our sins,<note place="margin">Math. 1. 16.</note> and clense vs from
our wickednes: to translate our corrupt nature
into incorruption: our mortall seed into immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality:
and to conclude, our vile and vnstable
flesh, into most pure and steddy spirit, to last with
him for euer and euer, Amen. This Iesus is not
the sauiour of the spirit and soule after this life
only: but the preseruer and defender of all that
verily trust in him, from dangerous mischances,
or euill fortunes in this world also whatsoeuer:
as is to be noted in the example of the Iailor, first
the miraculous meanes of Paul and Silas,<note place="margin">Acts. 16. 37.</note> their
deliuerance out of bands, when the doores flew


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2602:22"/>
open, and their fetters were loosed; then Paules
aduising of the Iailor, saying, Do thy selfe no
harmme, we are all heer; and lastly, by the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of Paul and Silas to saluation, wishing him
to beleeue in the Lord Iesus Christ, and both he
and his house should be saued: wherupon both
he and his house were baptized out of hand, and
were saued. For our owne sakes I thought it not
amisse, to lay downe the strong faith of this so
soon-conuerted Iailor; before, as it were, a meer
stranger to christianity, to incite vs to a more ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
conuersation in our owne profession: likewise
the faith of the Centurion is to be noted,<note place="margin">Math. 8.</note> by our
sauiours approbation, saying; Not in Israel haue
I found the like faith. So the faith of the two blind
men that cried incessantly,<note place="margin">Math. 9.</note> Sonne of Dauid haue
mercy vpon vs: who euen as Christ bad them,
beleeued his power, and receiued their sight.
With many other like places in scripture to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
our weak faith, to extinguish infidelity, and
root out Atheisme throughout the whole body
of all Christian churches. Wherfore let vs say,
It is Iesus that we follow; he is our master, we
fear not: and not mistrust at euery little tempest


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2602:23"/>
of this world when the wicked rise vp against vs,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 1.</note>
imagining vaine things. Peter failed of faith at
the beginning of the wind, wherby he began to
sink; but then that the Lords saluation might
seem more manifest, he cried, Lord saue me: and
he passed safely. Heer the Lord made the very
floods a sufficient rock to build his church vpon:
for through his faith he passed them as on the
firm ground. Now, that Iesus was called Christ
the true Messiah, or annointed, whom the Lord
annointed with the oile of gladnes aboue his
fellowes;<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 9.</note> foreshewed in all ages from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world, vntill he came to be annointed
the most holy.<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24.</note> Neither among men is there any
other name giuen vnder the cope of heauen, by
which we can be saued: he being the end of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,
or ioyfull yeeres; the sealing vp of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,
visions, miracles, and of all ceremonies:
whom the Lord annointed with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 7.</note>
and set him ouer the work of his own hands.
The Paschall lambe being now offered vp once
for all.<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29.</note> He was called the annointed,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 6.</note> bicause it
was the manner of the Iewes coronation and
election both of kings and priests; it pertained


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2602:23"/>
vnto him; for he was their lawfull king apparent,
whom, the wise men from the East visited to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
at Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Math. 2. 1.</note> saying, Where is he that is
borne king of the Iewes?<note place="margin">Mich. 5. 2.</note> Thou Bethleem art
little to be among the thousands of Iuda, yet out
of thee shall com the ruler in Israel, whose goings
foorth were from the beginning euerlasting, that
is to say, out of the house of bread shall proceed
the bread of life, food for our soules vnto euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life. Our fathers did eat Manna, and died,
but whoso eateth of this Manna shall liue for
euer.<note place="margin">Psal. 110. 4.</note> As he was also high sacrificer after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Melchizedek, it pertained vnto him: but
the Iewes receiued him not as king, bicause he
was Iosephs sonne, and a Carpenter, and came
not like a king in white raiment, neither as a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer,
bicause he was to imitate Melchizedek
in his priesthood, and not Aaron. Neither did
their blinde harts conceiue that the law should
be changed; and dreamed of none other priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
but Aarons, when as in deed Melchizedek
was a figure of the true Messiah, as in a large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
is expounded,<note place="margin">Isai. 9. 6.</note> by the prince of peace:
for Melchizedek was king of Salem.<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 18.</note> Sem and


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2602:24"/>
Melchizedek are both one, who for his vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
might be called the king of righteousnes,
Malchi-zedek:<note place="margin">Hebr. 7. 1.</note> and for his antiquity without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and without mother, without beginning or
end of daies. His birth was vnserchable, bicause
he was born before the flood; and his end of
daies not seen, bicause he out-liued all his owne
posterity of the next age. Therefore saith Noah,
Blessed be the God of Sem,<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 26.</note> and God will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
Iapheth to dwell in the house of Sem. So
the priesthood of Melchizedek remained in Sem
that had this blessing of God:<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 19.</note> and he blessed
Abraham,<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 20.</note> who paid him tithe of all. Thus much
of Iesus, which was called Christ, in whom we
also beleeue: of whom his disciples first receiued
the cognizance of Christianitie in Antiochia,
where they were presently persecuted by Herod.
Such Herods haue been euer vntill this day, but
they are such, whose darknes vanquisheth their
light. Let vs therfore be euer glad to say, We
haue found the Messiah,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 41.</note> which is the Christ. To
this end therfore God sent his onely begotten
sonne, that whosoeuer beleeueth in him should
not perish, but haue euerlasting life. He it is that


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2602:24"/>
declareth God;<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 18.</note> for he is in the bosom of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for this Christ is sent a sauiour to the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
of saluation; but to the vnbeleeuers a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
iudge of condemnation, which shall be thus;
they saw the light, and being ashamed of their ill
works,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 8.</note> hid themselues in darknes, the mother of
all errors and vntruthes: for truth loueth the
light, and the light doth glorify it. HIS ONLY
SONNE.<note place="margin">Math. 3. 17.</note> This is my welbeloued sonne in whom
I am well pleased;<note place="margin">Psal. 118. 22.</note> this is the head corner stone
that ioineth togither the building of Iapheth and
Sem.<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 35.</note> The father loueth the sonne, and hath giuen
all things into his hands. He that beleeueth in the
sonne hath euerlasting life:<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. 38.</note> and out of his belly
shall gush floods of liuing waters:<note place="margin">Deut. 18. 15.</note> but he that
obeieth not the sonne, shall not see life, and the
wrath of God abideth in him:<note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 14.</note> this is the well of
waters springing vp vnto eternall life, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
drinketh therof, should not thirst againe.
Now, to wit what the thing is that we worship,
and beleeue in: It is the only sonne of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of his father before all worlds spiritually:
for God is spirit, and to be worshipped in spirit
and truth. And as the Iewes beleeued that this


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2602:25"/>
Messiah the son of God should com, so we must
know and beleeue, that he is com: they refused
him in the flesh, and we may not plead IGNORA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVS
in spirit: let our spirits then be guided with
knowledge, otherwise our beleef is no beleef;
for no credit can be giuen to an vncertain hope.
Wherfore,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5. 39.</note> let vs search the scriptures; for in them
we thinke to haue eternall life, and it is they that
testifie of him: otherwise, but a few by ignorance
can be excused,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> bicause these things are written
for our learning and aedification. As the father
raiseth vp from death and quickeneth; so the son
also quickeneth whom he will. And the father
iudgeth not, but referreth all iudgement to his
sonne; bicause all should honor the sonne as the
father: and they that honor not the sonne as the
father, honoreth not the father that sent him. So
whosoeuer heareth his word, and beleeueth in
him that sent him, shall not com vnto condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but hath passed from death to life: for as the
father hath life in himselfe, so hath the sonne. To
beleeue cannot be to seek honor one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but of God alone, and his son Iesus Christ:
for when Moses stroke the rock,<note place="margin">Exod. 17. 6.</note> seeking honor


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2602:25"/>
of the children of Israel, saying, Hear now ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
shall we bring you water out of the rock?
Here for not sanctifieng the Lord in the presence
of the Israelites, and for honoring themselues in
the Lords miracle, both Moses and Aaron were
cut off from the hope they had to see the land of
promise. If Moses being a faithfull leader of the
Lords owne host, and an approoued seruant of
the mighty God Iehoua, fell by disobedience
into arrogancy,<note place="margin">Exod. 17.</note> seeking his owne honor more
than Gods, and was so seuerely punished: oh that
men would but think, how fearful a sentence that
was, by which he was depriued of forty yeeres
hope, and the fauour of so long trauel, which was
so sore in the wildernes. How much more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
shall our iudgement be, if any way we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
or fall away from a sincere and perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef,
which we haue had in God the father, and his
sonne Iesus Christ: or if we beleeue not the
word that testifieth of him, and through which
we see him daily? Moses had but a meer hope
of things to come, which things we haue seen
through faith: and we are strongly to abide ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
giuing all honor to the sonne as to the father,


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2602:26"/>
in whom we beleeue, &amp; by whom we liue &amp; haue
our being.<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 37.</note> This only sonne of God Iesus Christ
is the bread of life, the true sabaoth or rest, the
very top and end of Iubiles: let vs study to enter
into this rest. His meat is to doe his fathers will;
and let our sustenance be, to follow him and doe
his will: and let vs not labor only for the meat
that perisheth, but for the meat that dureth euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly,
which the sonne of man shall giue vnto
vs: for him hath God the father sealed: and the
work of God is to beleeue in him whom he sent
(his sonne.) This is the rock that followed the
host, and the rock wherupon the Lord hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his church: this is Gods rock, and the rock
of the All-sufficient:<note place="margin">Iohn. 10. 20.</note> he and the father is one. And
whosoeuer liueth and beleeueth in him shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
dy:<note place="margin">Iohn. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26.</note> he shall gather togither into one the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, from all corners of the earth, by his
death and passion. He is the sonne of God that
taketh away the sinnes of the world:<note place="margin">Nomb. 21. 9.</note> this is he
that was to be lifted vp,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 14.</note> and exalted aboue all
heauens. Lord who beleeueth our report, and
vnto whom is thine arme reuealed? And Lord
who shall dwell in thy tabernacle,<note place="margin">Psal. 15.</note> and rest vpon


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2602:26"/>
thy holy hill? Euen he that leadeth an vncorrupt
life, and doth the thing that is right. For this is the
vine, and his father is the husbandman; and the
branch that beareth not fruit in him, he cutteth
off: and euery one that beareth fruit, he purgeth,
that it may bring foorth more. So must we abide
in him, and he in vs: for as the branch cannot
beare fruit, except it be in the vine; no more can
we except we abide and dwell in him. Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
pray for the peace which is in him; for the
peace of Iesus Christ the sonne of God, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the afflictions of the whole world. Let vs
be of good comfort,<note place="margin">Iohn. 16. 13.</note> he hath already conquered
the world:<note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> and let vs kisse the son least he be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and so we perish euerlastingly; for if his
wrath be kindled yea but a little, blessed are all
they that put their whole trust and confidence in
him: for the father hath put all things in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vnder his feet;<note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> and giuen him the vtmost parts
of the earth for his possession. OVR LORD.
He is the soueraigne Lord of the whole earth,
and inspireth the harts of kings and princes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

humble, and putteth down the mighty from their

as a round cup full of liquor; her belly as an

as a tower of Iuory; her eies as the fish-pooles in

thou on my right hand, till I make thine enimies

in whom our fathers trusted, and were counted


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2602:27"/>
iust,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> as it is manifest in the epistle to the Hebrues,
where, a whole chapter is spent in reciting their
faith: the learning wherof I refer to the diligence
of the reader, seeing it is a full record of all the
ancient fathers beleef. This is the Lord of al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
for he hath purchased vs all by the offering
vp of his body, and sheading of his blood, to
free vs from these links of sinne, wherin we are
intangled through Adam: And therfore he hath
now full power to say,<note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> Com ye blessed of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and inherit euerlasting life: or go ye cursed
into vtter darknes, where shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth. And as we were then bound
with the chaines of sinne growing in our carnall
bodies, stirring vs vp to do the will of the flesh: so
are we at this day (being rid out of those bands
by the death and passion of our Lord) bound
likewise to him in spirit, to serue and obey him as
obedient seruants, looking for no reward by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert;
but by his meer fauour and mercy inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with him of life eternal. Therfore is he Lord
ouer kingdoms and nations, and there is no
higher power than that which the father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him: He is the holy one that dwelleth in the


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2602:28"/>
praises of Israel,<note place="margin">Psal. 22. 3.</note> in whom our fathers trusted, and
were deliuered: his therfore is the kingdome,
power,<note place="margin">Math. 6. 13.</note> and glory for euer and euer, Amen. He is
the Lord of hosts, that now fighteth for the house
of Israel; whose fight let vs manfully vndertake,
commending our weake forces to his mighty
protection:<note place="margin">Psal. 18.</note> for he is a sure rock of defence in all
his waies. WHICH WAS CONCEIVED BY
THE HOLY GHOST, BORN OF THE VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINE
MARY. This especially doth confirme
our beleef in Christ Iesus his only sonne; in that,
he was conceiued by the holy Ghost. All spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
conception is from God the father of spirit
and life, whose works are all miracles in our
cleerest sight; but this comprehension of our
sauiour was meerly spirituall: therfore he truly
descended from God the father of spirit: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cam togither, she was found with child,
and that which was conceiued in her was of the

Papists are seen extremely doting, when they
make the virgine Mary the queen of heauen, and
the speciall means by whose praiers and aduoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they attaine to saluation; as if of necessity
there must be both king and queen: which absurd
conclusions might, by Homers diuinity, be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
reproued and corrected, when he saith;

gouernment of many is not good; let there be
one king. Which words, although he spoke them
not diuinely, yet our experience telleth vs, that
it was skilfully aduised concerning a Common-wealth.
In saying thus, they abrogate the power
of Christ, and his authority in heauen, and make
the Trinity imperfect in vnity of Godhead, the
persons not hauing equal relation each to other:
they giue vnto Mary that which pertaineth vnto
Christ; all one with God, conceiued by the holy
Ghost of his father. Wherfore it is he that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

still our King, our Iudge, and Sacrificer,
whose kingdom is infinit, whose iudgement is

Saint Iohn saith; If any man sinne, we haue an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate
with the father,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2. 1.</note> Iesus Christ the iust, and
he is the propitiation for our sinnes. But in that
he was born of the virgine Mary, he was a fleshly
body, to stand for the redemption of all flesh; yea
of his owne mother, whom he reproued of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
when she said: Why hast thou dealt thus
with thy father and me? we haue sought thee with
heauy harts. He answered; How is it that ye haue
sought me, know you not that I must go about
my fathers busines? but they vnderstood not.
Which sheweth, that she was of the earth earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and now sleepeth (no doubt) with her fathers,
waiting for a glorious resurrection of an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
body, by the intercession of her owne Iesus,
to whom all power is giuen both in heauen and
earth, as it is said: Blessed is the fruit of thy
womb, for thou hast brought foorth the sauiour
of our soules; the true Emanuel, God-with-vs.
For he came in flesh to take away the sinne of the
flesh; and is also in spirit to continue with al them

that beleeue in him, for euermore. Neither may
we imagine any other wight in heauen or earth
woorthy to be beleeued in, besides the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

the father, and the father and sonne all one: so
the holy Ghost being of them both, conueieth vs
vnto them by an assured faith, that we may be
with Emanuel, which is God with vs for euer. He
was called Emanuel long before by the prophet
Isai; A virgine shall conceiue a sonne, and she
shall call his name Emanuel. SVFFERED VN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER
PONTIVS PILATE, WAS CRVCIFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED,
DEAD AND BVRIED. The prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
spake of this his passion,<note place="margin">Psal. 22. 16.</note> saying, Dogs haue
compassed me, and the assembly of the wicked
haue inclosed me: they pierced my hands and
my feet. He submitted himselfe to the hands of
Pontius Pilate; for he knew his hower was euen
then com, and that his kingdom was not of this
world;<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> otherwise, as he saith, his soldiers would
haue fought, and not had suffered him to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
into the hands of men. Seeing then his
time was com, in which all things should be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
according to his fathers will, he besought


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2602:30"/>
of his father, the cup, to wit, of bitter anguish,
might passe from him: and lifting vp his eies to
heauen,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> said; Father, the hower is com, glorify thy
sonne, that thy sonne may glorify thee. When he
was to be betraied by the child of perdition Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,<note place="margin">Psal. 110.</note>
and knew it; how great was his patience,
when as he reprooued him not, but told him;
What thou doest,<note place="margin">Iohn. 13 27.</note> do quickly. Pontius Pilate was
a Roman, vnder whose hands Christ suffered:
shewing, that as the Romanes had alwaies perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
the lowe Ierusalem, the true Church on
earth; so, that the Lord should iustly continue his
wrath in them; and that they might remaine in a
perpetuall curse: they also persecuted him whom
the world was not woorthy of, the high Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
the spirituall Church. Which example of
cruell tyranny hath euer since beene found in
them, and shall be doubtlesse euen to their owne
destruction. But they will say, Pilate was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to crucify him againe and againe, and he
excused him, not guilty; true: wherfore Pilate
was so much the more guilty of his death, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he could find no fault in him. For when the
power to loose one was in him, and not in the


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2602:30"/>
Iewes,<note place="margin">Iohn. 19. 10.</note> as he said to him, Knowest thou not that I
haue power to crucify thee, and power to loose
thee: &amp; to them, he had tried Christ to be guiltles;
yet willing to deserue the applause of the Iewes,
and the fauor of Caesar, cleane against his owne
conscience, to his vtter condemnation to death,
he loosed Barrabas a notable murtherer,<note place="margin">Acts. 3. 14.</note> and
executed that most iust king of peace and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
to euerlasting life. It is like this manner of
cruelty will not be left among the Romans, vntill
a finall desolation (the end of affliction) come
vpon them, according to the prophecy of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam.<note place="margin">Nomb. 24. 24.</note>
Ships shall come from the coasts, Kittim
Lord of Italy or Romania, and subdue Ashur, and
vanquish Heber; and he (to say) that Kittim shall
come to destruction: a most plaine prophecy
not yet sufficiently noted for our defence against
them. By Ashur are meant all the Babylonians,
Medes, Persians, and Assyrians his posterity. So
vnder Heber is signified all his posterity the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues,
and consequently the Iewes, of whom
Christ rose a naturall branch. So from time to
time their policy hath been to erect an earthly
monarch, by daily persecutions of the Church,


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2602:31"/>
against their own spirituall consciences: and by a
catholike persecution of the church, to exalt their
catholike tyranny in steed of the Church. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I see them iustly called Catholiks, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
for the vniforme massaker of true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Now therfore least we should mistake this
Christ by ignorance of his death: our beleef is a
consonant speech most diuinely composed for
our vnderstanding, that we may as well perceiue
the certainty of his passion, as of his incarnation:
wherfore it is necessarily mentioned in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef:
his conception, his incarnation, his passion,
the manner of his passion, and the end therof.
Touching his conception and incarnation, I
haue before spoken: touching the certainty of
his passion, his very enimies confesse, that such a
Christ came according to the prophets, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:
for their chronicles and ancient monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of time say no lesse. Notwithstanding they
wilfully mistook him, and abandoned him for a
false Christ. That Pilate was a Roman, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
themselues confesse, and that he had such
an office, they do not deny; and that such a Christ
at the same very time suffered vnder his hands:


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2602:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for their owne sakes they must conclude, if they
at all hope for saluation in him. Hitherto I find
not one idle word to be spared as friuolous or
improper concerning our Christian faith: and it
is most euident, that if any of these words had
been omitted, or for breuity sake, not penned: of
necessity they must had beene deliuered and
taught for the better vnderstanding of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe.
HE WAS CRVCIFIED. This was the
manner of death that he was put vnto by Pilate,
the curse of the law: for by the Iewes owne law;
Cursed is he that hangeth on the true.<note place="margin">Deut. 21. 23.</note> But Christ
bought vs from the curse,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> being made a curse for
vs, that now in the true seed of Abraham all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the earth, the sonnes of Iaphet might be
blessed by the God of Sem, and that Iaphet and
Sem might now dwell togither. Nay the Iewes
made this curse more reprochfull in Christ, than
by the law otherwise could be deuised. For the

these two commandements hang the law and

malice, they cried, crucify him, crucify him, which
is to say, Naile him, naile him to the tree. Neither
can the washing of Pilats hands before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Math. 27. 24.</note>
make his guiltines vnguilty; they thought
that they could not vse him too hardly: For they
made account heerby to see him do many great
miracles, as he had done before, insomuch that
they assaied him with all temptations, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that his time was finished, and that he was
to enter the Ark of saluation, as a new Noah, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of the world. Neither did they regard the
limits of his manhood, but scourged him, buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, spit on him, and pierced his sides. They
mocked him,<note place="margin">Math. 27. 40.</note> saying; He that destroied the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and built it againe in three daies, let him saue
himself: their blindnes did not comprehend the
temple of a second Salomon, the body of Christ
a second Adam, which should within three daies
be destroied, and built againe to stand for euer
and euer: iust the distance of old Adams natural
yeeres from the foundation of the first temple:
so proceeded they still to tempt him, euen with


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2602:32"/>
extremity of anguish to his soule, and mortall
torments to his body, when most patiently he
crieth;<note place="margin">Math. 27. 46.</note> ELI, ELI, LAMMA SABACTA NI?
My God,<note place="margin">Psal. 22. 2.</note> my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
but they vnderstood him not; and soon after he
gaue vp the ghost, * and died. And his soule left
the vaile of his fleshly body: at the consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all,<note place="margin">Math. 27. 51.</note> the vaile of the temple rent from the
top to the bottom,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 3. 14.</note> shewing that the high sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
was not from thencefoorth yeerly to enter in,
to make oblation and attonement for the sinnes
of the people: but that Christ being once offered
vp for all, was made high sacrificer for al, to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
all ceremoniall priesthood of the law; and
therfore was he called a high sacrificer for euer,<note place="margin">Psal. 110. 4.</note>
after the order of Melchizedek:<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.</note> his office was so
far aboue the Leuites, as Melchizedek excelled
Aaron; the one being only high sacrificer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the law, the other an old paterne of priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
before the law, whom Christ was to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate:
that in the appointed time, he might take
away and abolish the ceremonies of the law, and
make reconciliation for the sins of the people by
his death:<note place="margin">Hebr. 2. 17.</note> seeing he was sent as another Moses a


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2602:33"/>

DEAD. This word sheweth the end of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it was euen vnto death; neither might
this word be spared: for he might suffer vnder
Pontius Pilate, and be crucified, yet not vnto
death: and might had been by the interruption
of passion void of death at all. Wherfore this is
necessarily added, WAS CRVCIFIED, DEAD.
That we cannot think he suffered fantastically, or
that he suffered in vaine: for at his expiration he
was said to be dead. He died that day wherin
Adam fell, being with vs a friday, which was the
Iewes saboth euen, that he might performe and
finish to vs the long promised and liuely saboth,
which through the fall of Adam we had need of.
A most fine note, that we became bound and free
in one day: the interruption of time being 3960
yeeres or therabouts. Heer we may wel perceiue
the eternity, yea the euerlasting memory of the
Lords counsell and prouidence. What end is
there of his wisedom? Who can imagine a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wisedom than this? which is to search the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
and figures of this Christ his most certaine


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2602:33"/>
comming. It is a true pathway to Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and teacheth vs to imitate him in spirit and
truth, and to ground our beleef according to that
knowledge of him now com. Verily it is much to
be lamented, that these things are so smoothly
ouerpassed of many, and so little regarded of
any: by the which, the Lord had such pleasure to
foreshew his sonne vnto the Iewes, now for our
aedification: insomuch that by most diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
of the same, they haue continually pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
large volumes in the admiration of it. But
we thinke and contend, that it is ynough to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Christ our redeemer, and to beleeue
in him whom the father hath sent: we are much
deceiued to call that ynough, which is in due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
nothing. For the diuell acknowledged
Christ to be the sonne of God (which the Papists
are alwaies ready to obiect, when we argue iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by faith) but the text saith, that he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him with trembling. So then, before we can
acknowledge him our redeemer: we must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
learne, how we became bound; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we can rightly beleeue in him whom the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath sent, we must needs vnderstand some


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2602:34"/>
warning of his message: which most often and
breefly is repeated throughout the body of the
old Testament. Then must we try, whether he
came according to the fulnes of time, wherin the
father promised to send him: and afterward when
he is come, whether his message be of God or
not, he himselfe exhorteth vs to make trial. These
seem good ground-works to build our faith vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for as it is required in vs to beleeue, so is it
most expedient for vs to know him in whom we
do beleeue: bicause it separateth vs from death
to life, as before I alleaged. For example, Christ
saith to the theef;<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 43.</note> This day shalt thou be with me
in paradise: and againe of himselfe; Father, into
thine hands I commend my spirit. But concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his body, it died in the flesh: for it was wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in linnen, and laid in a tombe by Ioseph a
iust man of Arimathaea and Nicodemus, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the manner of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 52.</note> and buried: and
to manifest that his body was dead, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of men, the women prepared sweet odours
and ointments, and rested the Saboth day. Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus
might heer see a cleerer sight of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
birth than he had before: neither was his


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2602:34"/>
buriall an illusion to deceiue mens sight: for the
Iewes would not be mocked, but commanded a
watch and sure fastening to the doore, least his
disciples should steal him away; keeping in mind
the words that he spake vpon the earth:<note place="margin">Math. 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 64.</note> Within
three daies I will rise. Thus haue I concluded his
passion, the manner of his passion, and also his
buriall, which was according to the law. HE
DESCENDED INTO HELL. Heer commeth
the article that drew me to this whole discourse:
for that I saw the learned somthing at ods about
it; yet so, as all, both the one and the other did
firmly hold it necessarily inserted in our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
faith. Neither wil I take vpon me heer so much
to reconcile the learned, which diuersly allow of
it, as to debell the vnlearned opinions, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
it not at all: holding it a superfluous and
needlesse article to be taught among Christian
families. It is somthing strange when clownes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in sophistry. This kind of men had rather be
followed as Christs of a new church, than follow
Christ as disciples of the true Church. It behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them therfore, in whom remedy consisteth,
speedily to redresse such erronious errors: least


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2602:35"/>
some other soone after should deny that hee
ascended into heauen;<note place="margin">Acts. 23.</note> wherby a sect of Saduces
might arise amongst vs,<note place="margin">Math. 27.</note> denying any resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at all; and so the latter error become greater
than the former. Now therfore concerning the
misconstruing of these words; then touching the
abiection of them; and lastly, how to vnderstand
them both in their vtmost force; and also how
they were first ment in the primitiue Church: as
appeereth by the indifferency of the penners of
them. But as concerning his descending or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
downe, no man (I know) will deny this word
that hath any feeling of the ascension and going
vp: which is most manifest by Saint Pauls Epistle
to the Ephesians, which reciteth the prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids
words mentioned in the Psalmes.<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 8.</note> Thou art
gon vp on high,<note place="margin">Psal. 68.</note> and hast led captiuity captiue;
thou hast receiued gifts for men, yea euen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
hast thou led, that the Lord God may
dwell there: praised be the Lord which ladeth vs
daily, Selah. But Saint Paules allusion is this: that
he ascended, and captiued captiuity, and gaue
dwelling places to men. Now insomuch that he
ascended, saith he, what is it but that he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2602:35"/>
first into the lower parts of the earth? and he
that went downe is he that went vp aboue al hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
to fulfill all thing<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If therefore he had been
to go downe to the place of the damned, as some
will; he must had descended into the lowest part
of the earth, as he went vp to the highest heauen:

his height; nay <gap reason="foreign">

wherwith he glorified his sonne, is aboue all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
for they were made by him, and they are the
work of his owne hands, and waxe old as doth a

euen so the damned are to haue their portion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
all the earth by opposition. Seeing, as happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and vnhappines are extremities; so are their
habitations most extreme, and remote one from
the other, which cannot be in places to be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by flesh, except we will deuise to make pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories

haue done, or our eies more sharp than Moses

this, that seeing the state of the damned is perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

which is all one
as to say, What is it but that he also descended

to the place of the damned; he would
had said, that he descended far vnder all the earth:
or as the Epistle of Iude mentioneth, vnder dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<note place="margin">Iude.</note>
where the condemned angels are reserued
in euerlasting chaines, making a certain analogy
of his ascension and descension. But Saint Paul
was to speake of Christs going downe into the
lower parts of the earth, to say, the bowels of the
earth, to vanquish death, wherwith his humanity
was imprisoned, as the sonnes of Adam: and of
his going vp aboue all the heauens, to win life
and possesse inheritance for all his chosen. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by his descension was not meant the place
of euerlasting torment, but as a man should say,
he went downe into the parler of the earth, to put
off his humanity, and put on diuinity; to put off
corruption, and put on incorruption; to put off
mortality, and put on immortality: and lastly, to


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2602:37"/>
put off death, and cloath himselfe with life, to wit,
that he might be a body in all respects as before,
but freed from the bands of the flesh, shewing
plainly the maner of our resurrection toward, as
it is said;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> Christ is risen from the dead, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the first fruits of them that sleepe: for as by
man came death, so also by man shall all be made
aliue: and as in Adam all men dy; so by Christ
shall all men reuiue. But of his resurrection and
ascension shall be said more in due place: only
this a little to shew, to what end he descended:
which was to destroy death in his owne body,
that was the last enimy to be destroied.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 15. 26.</note> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he being no more in subiection vnto death,
hath the only power vnder his father to destroy
death in vs quick and dead, that beleeue, at his
next comming: for as the resurrection to come
of flesh is of two kindes, one from life to life, and
the other from death to life: Behold, we shall not
all sleep,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> but we shall all be changed; so Christ
was to signify in his death, the nature of both. It
is manifest that he rose as they that shall not
sleep; for his bones and flesh perished not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had the wormes hold on him: it also appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2602:37"/>
that he was changed as they that sleep: for
he rose out of the belly of the earth within three
daies; euen so long was Ionah in the whales bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Seeing then death was his last enimy, and all
things were put in subiection vnder him saue
death: it is plaine, that by his death (which was the
conquering of death) he finished all that might
be expected of him, for the saluation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Then as the article followeth, HE ROSE
FROM THE DEAD. We must vnderstand, and
be sure heerby, that he came first downe to the
dead, which is to say, into the earth that bringeth
foorth all things to death: as if a man should say
the mother, or the very state of death, which in
Hebrue is called <gap reason="foreign">

Heer is declared the plain and naturall force of
that same word with the Hebrues, which we call
hell, the graue. This sheol both all and some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse

in the very words: they say, DESCENDIT AD
INFEROS, which is all one with Saint Paules
words, he descended to them beneath in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
parts of the earth, to wit the dead, from whence
he was to rise with victory: though the Papists

<gap reason="foreign">

me thinks they grosly erre, seeing the scripture
maketh mention of no other punishment after
this life for sin, than the second death, the haruest
of all flesh, when Christ shall sit in iudgement
vpon his firy throne to diuide the goats from the
sheep, saying; Come ye blessed of my father, and
inherit euerlasting life: and to the sinners; Go ye
cursed into euerlasting darknes, where shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
somthing strange to Grecians that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with it, as if we should
say, into the house of the graue, confirming my
former words. But the Papists will obiect, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
else should he descend being once buried,
but to the damned? which I admit a question, and
for answer refer them to S. Paules words, which
are alredy recited. What is it, but that he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
first into the lower parts of the earth? That he
descended (therfore) they confesse, and to what
place he went, this place (I know) will very effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
prooue vnto them; how that he was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
also it is most true, as before is shewed: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2602:40"/>
he was buried, and also descended: for Saint
Paul meaneth, that his descension is all one with
his buriall: taking the occasion of speech from
his ascension. Wherby it seemeth, that some pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of this Creede haue stuck vpon this article,
fearing least this word, Hell, should bring them
into an error; beyond al authority of scripture: &amp;
(while they graunt it to be the place of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
they durst not admit this article at all, but
that he was buried, and rose again the third day.
Neither did they see how well the one or the
other might suffice, both being rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
But the forme that we most vse is, he was
buried and descended into hell; where it is pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as two articles, being indeed but one: which
is to say, simple truth, in that he was buried; and
Saint Paules argument of the manner, when he
saith, He descended, &amp;c. Now indeed this word
Hell is vsed throughout the whole nation of the
Gothes, to wit, in the countries Sueuia, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
and Saxonia, that is, Insula Britannica. For as
far as the Gothes inlarged their territories, their
language remained still in force: therfore in
Swedland they say he went downe to Heluet; in


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2602:40"/>
Germany to Helle; in our English, which is to
say, old Saxonish Hell. Now concerning the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
deriuation of the word according to the
letter: it is plainly shewed in derision of the
king of Babylon after his death, by these words;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> How art thou fallen from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">Isai. 14. 12.</note>
O hellel, the sonne of the morning, which is
to say Lucifer. For, as the Painims worshipped
the sunne as a God, while he shined in his most
glorious height: so likewise in his absence they
abhorred him; supposing that in his declination
he visited them in the earth. And the heathen
people at this day that haue not yet known God,
still obserue the same kind of worship. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence
it commeth, that the word is so disputable with
vs. Though the Painims were ignorant of the
sunnes course, yet they were not ignorant of their
owne language: for they reserued this word from
Isai, till their owne christianity; so that when they
had found another God, they made this their
Hell, to wit, Lucifer as before. But seeing we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
know the course of the sunne, we must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
hold it to be the graue; without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
arguments of places that were neuer heard


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2602:41"/>
of. Therfore mark the resolution of the speech,
HE WAS DEAD AND BVRIED, AND DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCENDED
INTO HELL. Now insomuch as
he was buried, he rose again; in that he was dead,
he rose from the dead: insomuch as hee went
downe into Hell, to wit, the secret place of the
dead, to put off death and to put on life: he went
vp to heauen the euerlasting seat of life; and
dwelling place of aeternity. And as with the
Astronomers, there is reckoned among other
spheres, that which they call CoeLVM EMPY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REVM,
or IGNEVM, a firy throne aboue all
spheres,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 24.</note> the light that none can attaine vnto: so
would necessity graunt the place of the damned
soules to be in opposition far vnder all spheres:
for no aeternity can continue in changeable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
whether they be heauenly or earthly: but
to prooue that this word cannot signify euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
punishment, and that our sauiour descended
into no corruption, thus I argue. All perfect
meanes of saluation was foretold by the spirit of
God to the Iewes, that they who beleeued or
mistrusted, might iustly be saued or condemned:
But all that was prophesied, was but of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2602:41"/>
buriall, and resurrection; therfore was his
passion, buriall, and resurrection the perfect
meanes of saluation: seeing he himselfe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
long before; for he had his perfection from
his father euer before all worlds. And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Dauid saith;<note place="margin">Psal 16.</note> Thou wilt not leaue my soule
in hell, nor suffer thy holy one to see corruption:
that his body should neither corrupt nor perish
in the graue, so pure was he, that he escaped the
snares of death. Now we are not only to define
the word, but also to search the authority therof,
which must be in the scripture, and not elswhere.
In the Bible is found no one word that can signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the state of the happy or vnhappy: therfore
this word, Hell, is not meant the state of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
nor any other corruption than the graue, or
the state of death. Neither is it dangerously pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or vsed, as some late vpstart vnlearned haue
thought: contending, that it ought not to be said
as part of our Christian faith; which obiection
aboue is sufficiently answered. Indeed Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shewed any farther article of faith, than that
he should suffer many things of the elders,<note place="margin">Math. 16. 21.</note> and
of the high priests and scribes at Ierusalem, and


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2602:42"/>
be slaine, and rise againe the third day: this was
all that he added to the perfection of the church,
which he promised euen then to build vpon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
faith; which mystery Peter vnderstood not;
wherfore he became an offence: so that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in spirit, and ended in the flesh. If any other
article had needed, Christ would in this place
haue added it for the perfection of his church,
which he had promised to build: but all that he
added, was in the words before recited; therfore
in these words consisteth the perfection of the
church, the members of Christ, which is the rock
and foundation therof. For had not the Iewes
had a perfect warning of redemption to come,
through the Messiah sauiour of the world, and
the full meanes therof, and of all that he was to
perform for the saluation of mankind: how could
they take notice of their redemption, or be iustly
condemned for misbeleef? for they that liued
in the time of Christs humanity, were to see that
which their fathers hoped for. If then we will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know what ought the substance of our faith
to be? I answer in a word; Our faith ought to be
the haruest of our fathers hope: so that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2602:42"/>
that we haue receiued that which they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for: so through one faith in one Iesus, they
and we are both saued.<note place="margin">Isai. 53. 8.</note> Who shall declare his
age? for he was cut out off the land of the liuing.
Heer my purpose was to shew, that this article
might safely be vsed, without adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
or offence to such as I before meant. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as we now see with our eies, and beleeue
that Iesus the true Christ came and finished his
pilgrimage heer on earth, being the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
sonne of God, conceiued by the holy Ghost,
born of the virgine Mary, crucified according to
the prophets: so, what he was to do, he himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to the fathers in spirit, insomuch that they
also saw their saluation by the eie of faith, which
they had in the same Messiah,<note place="margin">Colos. 1. 18.</note> the first born of the
dead, and of al things to haue the preheminence.
He is the reconciliation of all the world: and
euen as his father spred the heauens, and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them, and created the earth and sea, with all
the implements; so is the sonne commaunder of
all, and the beginning and end of all things are
in his hand: he is made iudge of all flesh, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
as it were in the meane time to reconcile

the limits, and to constraine all nations to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him: He was made all one with the father,
the beginning of the world, and the last end must

thirty yeeres after the promise, cannot disanull
the couenant. God gaue the promise to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
but death reigned from Adam to Moses,
euen on them also that sinned, not after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Adams transgression, which was as a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the second Adam. Seeing then before the
law all men were dead in sinne without any hope
of iustification to eternall life: it was most need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that the Gospell should be preached vnto
them.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 6.</note> Wherupon it seemeth Saint Peter conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
his speech of preaching: to this end was
the Gospell preached also to the dead, that they
might be condemned according to men in the
flesh, but might liue according to God in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Now this is plaine, that whoso were vnder
the law, were condemned by the law according
to the flesh. By this all men vnder the law were
iudged by the law. But seeing the dead were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the law (howbeit many righteous men, to


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2602:44"/>
whom the promise was giuen, were iustified by
faith) they were not to be iudged or condemned
by the law, but by the spirit of Christ that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
vnto them, while they were in the prison of
death, that they might beare fruit in the resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
also: otherwise should they be born without
adoption in Christ at all, like as the cloudes are
congealed and melt againe to nothing: or as the
wind passeth through the aire, and no man mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it: so without law or grace should they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
without conscience, which the Atheists now
adaies would soon graunt. But their iudgement
long ago is not far off,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 3.</note> and their condemnation
sleepeth not. They are wels without water, and
clouds caried about with a tempest, to whom the
black darknes is reserued for euer. Now if we
doubt, that Christ did preach in the spirit before
he came in the flesh: let vs consider the Epistle of
Saint Iude,<note place="margin">Iude. vers. 9.</note> where is said touching blaspheming
of authority; Yet Michael the Archangel (Christ)
when he stroue against the diuell about the body
of Moses, durst not blame him with cursed spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
but said; The Lord rebuke thee. Mark then,
this Michael was a cheef Angell, yea more than


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2602:44"/>
an Angell,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12. 5.</note> as the Reuelation sheweth also; There
was a battell in heauen, Michael and his Angels
fought against the Dragon; and the Dragon and
his angels fought, but they preuailed not, neither
was their place found any more in heauen. And
the great Dragon that old serpent called the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
and satan, which deceiueth all the world: he
was euen cast into the earth, and his angels were
cast out with him. Heer Christ the seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
brused the serpents head. This Michael is
the man-child that was borne to rule all nations
with a rod of iron,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 9.</note> and break them in peeces like
a potters vessell. Diuers times is this Michael spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
mentioned through the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament;<note place="margin">Dan. 10. 12.</note>
Lo, Michael a cheef prince holpe me:
and there is none that holdeth with me,<note place="margin">Dan. 10. 22.</note> but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
your prince.<note place="margin">Dan. 12.</note> In that day shall Michael stand
vp, the great prince, which standeth for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of thy people. And in the same place; Lo
Michael one of the cheef princes cam to help me.
Wherfore it is to too absurd for vs to think, that
a king hauing banished an offender for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
into a most desolate place of the world, to
remaine there for euer; would himselfe go after


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2602:45"/>
to obteine greater power ouer him. For what
greater subiection can there be, than for euer,
yea for euer and euer to abide a slauish vassall in
all seruitude, horror, &amp; trembling? Therfore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
not that the Holy one saw other corruption,
than in flesh; for he droue the prince of darknes
into a corner, where the sink of all corruption is.
Now what perfection he could draw out of this
sink, that he himself had cursed; let the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of all men try and iudge, and be warned with
Peter, that they defile not the things that the
Lord hath purified, and that they cleaue not so
fast to corruption, as to peruert the Lords waies,
and besot their own vnderstanding. Concerning
the word,<note place="margin">Apoc. 6. 8.</note> Hell, it is written; Behold a pale horse,
and his name that sate on him was Death, and
Hell followed after him; and power was giuen to
them ouer the fourth part of the earth, to kill with
sword and with hunger, with death, and with the
beasts of the earth. Heer we see that our exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
plainly take Hel for the graue, that is alwaies
woont to follow after death.<note place="margin">Pet. 2. 13.</note> So when the day of
the Lord shall come, by which the heauens being
on fire shall be dissolued, and the elements shall


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2602:45"/>
melt away with heat: and a new heauen and a
new earth established, wherin dwelleth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes:<note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 1.</note>
and the first heauen and the first earth
passed away: and when the Lord shall creat new
heauens and a new earth, and the former not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.
For,<note place="margin">Isai. 65. 19.</note> saith the Lord, as the new heauens
and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain
before me;<note place="margin">Isai. 66. 22.</note> so shall your seed and your name
continue, and from moneth to moneth, and from
sabaoth to sabaoth shall all flesh come to worship
before me, saith the Lord, and they shall go forth
and looke vpon the carkases of men that haue
transgressed; for their worm shall not dy, neither
shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be an
abhorring vnto all flesh. This is the miserable
condition of the wicked ones, the second death,
the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone:<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 8.</note> at
the opening of the books, &amp; the resurrection of
all flesh, which is to say, when the sea, death and
Hell shall giue vp their dead,<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 1.</note> which are in them:
and they shall bee iudged according to their
works: then both death and Hell, which haue all
this while had power ouer flesh, to cut it off from
inheritance of this life, through the curse; shall at


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2602:46"/>
the last resurrection be vanquished to all flesh,
and cast into the burning lake by our Lord &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Iesus Christ our forerunner. In this world
shall the cursed endure his damnation, and the
happy shall feel his blessednes. He that liueth in
this world an hundred yeeres, shall dy a yoong
man; neither shall any be called a child of yeers:
but he that buildeth in this world shall inhabit,
and they that plant vineyards shall eat of the
fruit; neither shall they plant, and another eat:
but they shal inioy the works of their own hands,
and shall not be made to labour in vaine, and
bring foorth in fear: for they are the seed of the
blessed of the Lord, and their buds with them. Yet
concerning his descension remaineth this one
thing, he made his graue with the wicked, &amp; with
the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ich in his death, though he had done no wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
neither was any deceit in his mouth.
Now in that it is said, he made him a graue; he
chose him a place in the earth, whereinto he
vouchsafed to descend and be buried for our
saluation: though many wicked and rich men lay
as glorious as he, whom the cell of the earth was
far vnworthy to conteine.<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 2.</note> Where the many that


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2602:46"/>
sleep shall awake to euerlasting life, and some to
shame and perpetuall contempt. Againe, that he
was buried, and descended also into hell, read the
ancient Christian meaning of the word (Hell)
in the example of the rich man written by Luke
the Euangelist, translated into Saxonish many
yeeres ago, which saith thus; <hi>ha <abbr>peand</abbr> re peleza dead
and paer on Hell bebynzed.</hi> which is now as much as to
say, And the rich man died and was buried in hel.
I should think it very absurd therfore farther to
vrge any comment or exposition for the word,
Hell: seeing (no doubt) these expositors of the
Gospels, sufficiently vnderstood what they said in
their owne language. Nay, whosoeuer will not
yeeld vnto so plain a testimony of truth, the mark
of controuersie: he may be thought little zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
yea obstinate in his own profession. Now
of such as would haue Hell to be in the earth, and
to meane the place of the damned, and would
prooue it by the word,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 26.</note> Gulf, that was betweene

of the places, which the Lord hath shut vp
from vs and our vnderstanding. For saith the
Lord;<note place="margin">Gen 3. 22.</note> Behold, the man is becom as one of vs, to

his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat

foorth from the garden of Eden, to till the earth,
whence he was taken. And the Lord hath set Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,
and the blade of a sword shaking, to keep
the way of the tree of life. Heer we see that the
iealous God excluded Adam out of the garden,

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2602:47"/>
Wherfore the plaine and open things are
for vs and our children to obserue and do: but
the secret and hidden things pertaine vnto God
only. The prophet Ionah was a most excellent
figure of our sauiour, if a man do diligently mark
his prophesie.<note place="margin">2. King. 14. 25.</note> First, his name signifieth a doue in
the Hebrue voice, in the likenes wherof Iesus
receiued the spirit of his father from heauen, wher
he himself confesseth,<note place="margin">Math. 3. 16.</note> that he saw the heauens
open, and the spirit of God descending like a
doue,<note place="margin">Psal. 74. 16.</note> and lighting vpon him, the true turtle doue,
whose soule the beast had neuer power of. Ionah
his message was to preach; so Christ: Ionah wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
suffered shipwrack,<note place="margin">Iona. 1. 12.</note> for the safety of the
ship and mariners; Christ willingly indured the
curse for the saluation of the earth, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
therof: Ionah was in the belly of the fish
three daies and three nights; so long was the son
of man to be in the belly of the earth: Ionah de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
into the belly of hell; for saith he, I cried
in mine affliction vnto the Lord, and he heard
me; out of the belly of hel cried I, and thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
my voice. Which hel is heer nothing else but
the vale of death, and extreme mist of darknes,


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2602:48"/>
wherinto our sauiour also descended for the
same space. Ionah arose and went to Niniueh to
finish his message of preaching; Christ arose like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and ascended into heauen, to consummate
all his fathers will, after he had once yeelded vp
his spirit into his hands,<note place="margin">Math. 17. 50.</note> and had destroied the
temple of his body, and built it againe in three
daies. Ionah had pity on the gourd, for which he
had not laboured, neither made it grow, which
came vp in a night, and perished in a night: so
dealeth Christ with his adopted members, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
pity euen of the meere fruits of darknes,
whose beginning and end is not to be discerned
of men: for they abide not the light that truth
loueth. THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN.
He walked the path of life, euen to the presence
of his father,<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 10.</note> the fulnes of ioy; at whose right
hand are pleasures for euermore: which path he
hath also shewed to vs his followers, whose flesh
yet doth rest in hope. Let vs therfore (perceiuing
the mortality of our vaile) euen for his sake striue
to enter into that path, how narrow or straight
soeuer it seemeth; the crooked and hard waies
are passed with care and fear to eternall ioy: but


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2602:48"/>
the wide and easie waies in this life leade to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and pull vs hastily to condemnation
and euerlasting woe in the world to come. Our
sauiour Christ by his power which he receiued
of his father in heauen, could destroy the temple
and build it againe in three daies,<note place="margin">Iohn. 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> as he said; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
this temple (pointing at his body) and I will
build it in three daies. Which is a very fine and
perfect exposition of the rock, where he saith;
Thou art Peter, and vpon this rock (pointing to
himself) I will build my Church: but the blind
Iewes vnderstood not of what temple he spake,
albeit he had called it so: neither will the Papists
vnderstand of what rock he spake, albeit it was
his name long before. His power was so infinite,
not only in framing to himselfe a new body,<note place="margin">Math. 27.</note> but
to many other that slept in the dust of the earth,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.</note>
such was his will to manifest his attractiue power
to all flesh, that hopeth for the resurrection in the
world to com: when the time of recreation of all
flesh shall appeer.<note place="margin">Psal. 17.</note> Wherfore stay our steps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
O Lord, in these thy paths, that our feet
slide not, and deliuer vs from the hands of such
as haue their portion in this life. Concerning his


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2602:49"/>
resurrection Saint Paul testifieth at large, how
that he died for our sinns according to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and that he was buried, and rose againe the
third day,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> and that he was seen of Cephas, then
of the twelue; after that he was seen of more than
fiue hundred brethren at once; of whom many
at that time remained as a confirmation of his
testimony, the rest being asleep. After that he was
seen of Iames, and then of all the Apostles, and
last of all, of him. Which chapter I intreat the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
reader to turn to, bicause it wholy concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
this article: For it prooueth the resurrection
of the dead, and that Christ is already risen; then
that we all shall rise, and the manner how. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
for me to make a new frame of the same texts,
adding nothing but forme to my purpose, were
meer arrogancy, or rather, as Saint Paul saith,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and might seem vnto the reader as the
hony of one bee, in comparison of a whole field
of sweet flowers. In many other places, where the
whol Psalm, chapter or book co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in handling, I refer the reader to the ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
testimonies therof, whether it be of prophets,
Euangelists, or Apostles, which were the neerest


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2602:49"/>
recorders of that time. FROM THE DEAD.
Which is to say, them that sleep, for whom Saint
Paul willeth vs not to lament, as others that are
clean without hope: for saith he, as we beleeue
that (our) Iesus died and rose againe; so (our) God
through Iesus will bring againe those that sleep
with him; for the Lord shall come downe from
heauen with a showt and the voice of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle,<note place="margin">1. Thes. 4. 13.</note>
and with the trumpet of God, and those
that be dead shall rise first, and then those which
remaine aliue shall be carried vp with them in
cloudes to meet the Lord in the aire; and so shall
we all be with the Lord. Also he taught his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. 3.</note>
that he should rise againe the third day: and
after I am risen I will go into Galile before you.<note place="margin">Mark. 14. 28.</note>
His ascension in this place is little to be spoken
of, bicause by his descension it hath sufficiently
appeered by the contrary argument: yet thus
much he testifieth,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. 34.</note> saying; Whither I go you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
(in the flesh) come. In my fathers house are
many mansions: if there were not I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
vnto you. I go to prepare a place for you.
Let not your harts be troubled, ye beleeue in
God, beleeue also in me. Though I go to prepare


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2602:50"/>
a place for you, I will come againe, and receiue
you vnto my selfe, that where I am there may you
also be: and whither I go you know, and the way
you know. For it is I that am the way, the truth,
and the life. No man commeth to my father but
by me:<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> if yee had knowen me, you should had
knowen my father also, and from hencefoorth ye
know him, and haue seen him. Moreouer he saith
to Mary;<note place="margin">Iohn. 20. 17.</note> Touch me not, for I am not yet ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to my father, but go to my brethren, and say
to them; I ascend to my father and to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and to my God and your God. Heer he
most comfortably becommeth brother vnto vs,
acknowledging his father and ours to be all one,
through his precise and faultlesse obseruation of
his fathers will. After that he had breathed vpon
his disciples the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Iohn. 20. 22.</note> and at the sea of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias
comforted them againe with his presence:
he was taken vp in a cloud out of their sight; and
while they looked stedfastly towards heauen as
he went, two men stood by them in white appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,<note place="margin">Acts. 1. 9.</note>
which said; Ye men of Galile, why stand yee
gazing into heauen? This Iesus which is taken
vp from you into heauen, shall so come as you


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2602:50"/>
haue seen him go into heuen. Abraham receiued
three Angels with the presence of God:<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 2.</note> Lot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
two Angels as messengers from God of
his saluation in the absence of the Lord:<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 3.</note> for the
Lord sent them to destroy the city. In such places
is the office of the Trinity to be marked, and
most diligently considered. Likewise, that he
ascended it appeereth by S. Lukes words;<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 51.</note> And
it came to passe, that as he blessed them he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from them, and was carried into heauen: into
that ancient and euerlasting house of his father;
where the riches and treasure of Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
lay, where neither rust, nor moth could
corrupt, nor theeues break through and steale;
which is the farthest height of heauen, and aboue
all heauens that we can imagine, as is abouesaid.
Let vs not therfore be gazers, woonderers, or
strangers to the things that ought to be most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
vnto vs. For nothing appeereth plaine to
them that know not God, and him whom he sent
our sauiour Iesus Christ. HE SITTETH AT
THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD THE FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER
ALMIGHTY. Who being the brightnes

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2602:51"/>
and bearing vp all things by his mighty
word,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> hath by himselfe purged our sinnes, and
sitteth at the right hand of his fathers maiesty in

prophesie of Dauid, saying; The Lord said
vnto my Lord, sit thou on my right hand till I

is the right hand that shall find out them that hate

                     <desc>•</desc>

The right hand of the Lord hath the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence;<note place="margin">Psal. 118.</note>
the right hand of the Lord bringeth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
things to passe. Dauid being a prophet, and
speaking vnto men, was to vse the phrase of men,
and also to allude vnto the manners and power
of men: for all the preferment that hath been
among men, hath been to place authority on
the right hand, seeing all actiuitie, worthines,
prosperity, readines and facility consisteth in the
right hand of a man. This was the reason of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
his figuratiue speech to make men vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the preheminence of the most High: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
indeed God is all spirit, and hath no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with flesh, as it is already prooued. His right


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2602:51"/>
hand is a threatning hand to them that hate him:
but it entertains them kindly that loue and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him in spirit and true holines, as doers of his
will, and obseruers of his commaundements.
Which thing the prophet slacked not, when he
said; Lo I com: for in the book of life it is written
of me, shewing his election by the holy spirit. Yet
why doth he so stedfastly affirme, that it is written
of him, &amp;c? surely his owne soule told him. For
saith he,<note place="margin">Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 40.</note> I desired to do thy good wil, O my God,
yea thy law is within my hart; and I say thy right
hand,<note place="margin">Psal. 44.</note> thine arme, and thy cheerfull countenance
saueth and defendeth all such as thou fauorest.
Againe,<note place="margin">Psal. 18.</note> thy right hand hath staied me, and thy
louing kindnes made me grow. I beheld the Lord
alwaies before me (saith he) and he is at my right
hand,<note place="margin">Acts. 2.</note> there shall I not be shaken. By this we may
well perceiue the worthines of Christ, receiued
by his father into that holy place, into which he
entred, a sacrificer for sinne once for all; so there
is one God, one mediator betwixt God and man
Iesus Christ. Wherfore lift vp your harts vnto
the Lord; let your soules be lifted vp on high, yea
and fly vnto heauen as a bird with a most cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2602:52"/>
note, and a new song, praising God, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Hosanna in the highest, which is to say, Saue

shall hee come thence? TO IVDGE THE
QVICK AND THE DEAD. Now Gods throne
is a firy throne, whose comming to iudgement
no man knoweth: who, at his comming shal bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
with the holy Ghost and with fire, comming
suddenly as a theef in the night; or as a maister,
whose return the seruant knoweth not: least the
wicked should be forewarned to flee from the
anger to come, and aduaunce themselues, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the aduantage of this life: therfore they
shall giue account to him that is ready to iudge
both the quick and the dead.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 5.</note> Iudge nothing, O
people of the earth before the time; vntill the
Lord commeth, who will lighten things that are


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2602:52"/>
hid in darknes, and make the counsels of the hart
manifest: and then shall euery man that doth so,
haue praise of God. Christ commanded his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to preach, that he was ordained of God a
iudge of quick and dead. Saint Paul saith; I wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ that
shall come againe to iudge the quicke and the
dead at his appeerance and his kingdom:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.</note> which
is to say, when his kingdome shall come that we
daily pray for in the Lords praier: in which king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
the Lord make vs partakers of his sonnes
inheritance, euen as we growe in him vnto the
house of the liuing, Amen. I BELEEVE IN THE
HOLY GHOST. Heer againe is the first tenor
of our confession repeated, to wit, I beleeue in,
which ought to haue relation wholy and seueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the three persons only, least we make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of all; as some do, which take it literally,
without discerning the sense at all; but saying in
haste, I beleeue in the holy Ghost, the holy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
church, the communion of saints, &amp;c.
Heer the simple (except he be taught) cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
but that he beleeueth in the catholike
church, and in the communion of saints, &amp;c. so


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2602:53"/>
far foorth as in the holy Ghost, or in the other
two persons: but of this point anon more at
large. I beleeue in the holy Ghost. Why? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in the father and the sonne, as is abouesaid,
and the holy Ghost is all one with the father and
the sonne; for he proceedeth both of the father
and the sonne, and with the father and the sonne
togither is glorified: therfore I equally beleeue
in the holy Ghost, as in the father or the sonne,
or as in both, father and sonne. For, bicause the
holy Ghost is exempted from neither, it pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to each one, and to both alike. The holy
Ghost was the father and the sonne before the
world; the sonne was the holy Ghost and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the world; the father is the holy Ghost and the
sonne in the world to come. The concentricall Trinity being thus;
<list>
                  <item>Father,</item>
                  <item>Sonne,</item>
                  <item>Holy Ghost,</item>
               </list>
whose might, authority, and power shal be at that
time all one ouer them that shal be baptized with
the holy Ghost and with fire: for now, euen to
day is the holy Ghost labouring in the harts of
men, to win them vnto the father and the sonne.
Wherfore harden not your harts as in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2602:53"/>
in the day of temptation in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Happy shall the wise virgins be, which are
found with oile in their lampes, not trusting to
borrow in the busie day of all flesh when none
can lend. Wherfore, good brethren, be not as
the foolish virgins, the sleeping disciples, the
sluggish seruants, or as the busie Martha: but
haue care to choose the better things during the
time of the flesh, that the holy Ghost may find a
resting place in your soules, to bring you to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life.<note place="margin">Math. 11. 5.</note> Then shal it be said; The blind receiue
their sight, the hault go, the lepers are clensed,
the deaf hear, the dead are raised vp, and the poor
receiue the gospell.<note place="margin">Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. 38.</note> Take heed, watch and pray,
least ye enter into temptation:<note place="margin">Mark. 13. 33.</note> Take heed, watch
and pray, for ye know not when the time is. For
Christ saith;<note place="margin">Iohn. 14. 16.</note> I will pray the father, and he shall
giue you another comforter, that he may abide
with you for euer, the spirit of truth whom the
world cannot receiue, bicause it seeth him not,
nor knoweth him; but ye know him: for he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
with you, and shall be in you. I will not leaue
you comfortlesse, I will come to you: yet a little
while and the world shall see me no more; but ye


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2602:54"/>
shall see me: bicause I liue, ye shall liue also. And
in the same place following, Christ saith; These
things haue I spoken vnto you being present with
you, but the comforter which is the holy Ghost,
whom the father will send in my name, he shall
teach you all things, and bring all things vnto
your remembrance which I haue told you; and
so foorth to the end of the chapter. And in the
next chapter; But when the comforter shall com,
whom I will send vnto you from the father, euen
the spirit which proceedeth of the father: he shall
testifie of me, and ye shall be witnesses also; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
ye haue been with me from the beginning.
And againe Christ saith; I tell you truth, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
for you that I go away: for if I go not
away, the comforter will not com vnto you; but
if I depart,<note place="margin">Iohn. 15. 26.</note> I will send him vnto you: and when he
is come, he will reprooue the world of sinne, of
righteousnes, and of iudgement; of sinne, bicause
they beleeue not in me; of righteousnes, bicause
I go to the father, and ye shall see me no more; of
iudgement, bicause the prince of the world is
iudged.<note place="margin">Iohn. 16. 7.</note> I haue yet many things to say vnto you,
but ye cannot hear them now, howbeit when he


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2602:54"/>
is come which is the spirit of truth, which will lead
you into all truth: for he shall not speake of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but whatsoeuer he shall hear, that shall he
speak; and he shall shew you the things to come:
he shall glorify me; for he shall receiue of mine,
and shall giue it vnto you. To this place may be
applied the Lords words spoken by the prophet
Ioel;<note place="margin">Ioel. 2. 28.</note> I will powre out my spirit vpon all flesh,
your sonnes and your daughters shall prophesy,
your old men shall dreame dreames, and your
yoong men shall see visions: and also vpon the
seruants, and vpon the maidens in those daies wil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
I powre my spirit. Whosoeuer therfore shall call
vpon the Lord with a contrite hart, dooing the
works of the spirit, and not of the flesh; he shall
be saued. For in mount Sion and in Ierusalem
shall be deliuerance, as the Lord hath said, and in
the remnant whom the Lord shall call. The holy
Ghost is a diuers gift vnto the chosen; to som the
gift of prophesie; to some the interpretation of
toongs: as Saint Paule saith touching spirituall
gifts;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> Brethren, I would not haue you ignorant,
wherfore I declare vnto you, that no man spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
by the spirit of God calleth Iesus execrable:


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2602:55"/>
also, no man can say that Iesus is the Lord, but by
the holy Ghost. Now there are diuersity of gifts,
but the same spirit: and there are diuersity of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations,
but the same Lord: and there are
diuersity of operations, but God is the same, and
worketh all in all. Now the manifestation of the
spirit is giuen euery man to profit withall: for to
one is giuen by the spirit, the word of wisdome;
to another the word of knowledge, by the same
spirit; and to another the operations of great
works, and to another prophesie, and to another
the discerning of spirits, and to another the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity
of toongs, and to another the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of toongs. Now all these are the body of
Christ, and members seruing to seuerall vses in
the church of God, as some for apostles, some for
prophets, some for teachers, some to do mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
some for healers, some for helpers, some for
gouernors, some for linguists, and some for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters.
This gift lighteth on the chosen in many
shapes: it came vpon the sonne of man in the
likenes of a doue;<note place="margin">Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 3.</note> it came vpon the Apostles in
the form of clouen toongs like fire; it came vpon
disciples at Ephesus,<note place="margin">Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. 6.</note> that neuer before heard of


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2602:55"/>
the holy Ghost, by Pauls laying hands on them.
How the faithfull may be assured of this gift, let
them read the eight chapter of the Epistle to the
Romans, concerning the hope, patience, and
prosperity of this gift, which will something ease
the tediousnes of this treatise. Therfore, kind rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
take it in woorth that I so often send thee to
the spring it selfe, for the water that is most sweet
and fresh; the carriage not far, and the burden
easie: albeit, I will not omit to lay downe in this
place the fruits of the flesh, and the fruits of the
spirit: for they rebell ech one against the other,
&amp; the operations of both are contrary. For the
works of the flesh are adultery,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 19.</note> fornication, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes,
wantonnes, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred,
debate, emulations, wrath, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentions, seditions,
heresies, enuie, murther, drunkennes, gluttony,
and such like; which things whosoeuer doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
he shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
But the fruit of the spirit is loue, ioy, peace, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering,
gentlenes, goodnes, faith, meeknes,
and temperancy, against which there is no law.
Thus much I thought good heer to mention, that
ye may haue in this Enchiridion as it were a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2602:56"/>
compas to passe by; for as by it, we recouer
a direct course againe after many stormes, and at
last come to a safe port: so if by the weaknes of
the spirit you wend with the tempest of the world,
doing the will of the flesh; then haue you also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your eies, the points of hope, patience, and
prosperity, the direct course vnto the holy land,
where ye shall arriue and anchor more safe than
sowls in their nests,<note place="margin">Luke. 9. 58.</note> or foxes in their holes; yea or
any treasure in the depth of the earth: for all such
things in the day of iudgement shall shew foorth
their owne property, and be reuealed vnto the
eies of the liuing: at which day shall be the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest,
wherunto the tares also are reserued as well
as the wheat. This is the land that is more worth
than all kingdoms; heer is the plentifull field that
multiplieth so manifold; this is the field of hid tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;<note place="margin">Math. 13.</note>
the pearle of great price; the draw-net that
gathereth of all kinds; the fruitfull senuy, and the
sauory leuen. The heires of this kingdom shall
shine as the sunne: thus much concerning the
comforter, that guideth the chosen to saluation.
Now touching the catholike church. If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in the catholike church, we bring a curse


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2602:56"/>
vpon vs: for the church are the members of
Christ their head; not cleer from sinne, bicause
the old man remaineth yet in them: and saith the
prophet; Cursed is the man that trusteth in man,
and maketh flesh his arme. One man may haue a
sympathy with another, vntill perfection shall
come by grace. Also if we beleeue in the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
church, we lessen the power of God our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
of Christ our sauiour, and of the holy spirit
our comforter, to whose power no perfection is
wanting: for it made vs perfectly, it saueth vs
assuredly, and most intirely releeueth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth
vs daily. Which creation, saluation, and
consolation, the holy catholike church so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieth
on; as is needfull for any one member of
the same: should we presume then to be made
holy, bicause they are holy? or saints by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in the holy members of the church? or will
we all be catholikes one by one, bicause we all
make one catholike church? No, there is no saint
but he whom the spirit sanctifieth; nor any catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
but the church: which is the composition of
many members into one catholike and perfect
body of Christ the head; through the holy Ghost

what sort it is:<note place="margin">Num. 20. 10.</note> and if any mans work abideth, he
shall receiue wages; but if his work burne, he
shall lose (his labour.) Againe, know ye not that


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2602:57"/>
ye are the temple of God, and the spirit of God
dwelleth in you? This much hath shewed that
we are the very temple of God, founded vpon
Iesus Christ, of which the holy Ghost is minister,
and dwelleth in vs. Which temple if any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,
God the builder will destroy him; for the
temple of God is holy. More concerning this
point, read the whole third chapter of the first
Epistle to the Corinthes; this temple of the Lords
was sanctified in old time: yea euen when he
dwelt in no house;<note place="margin">2. Sam. 6. 6.</note> but walked in a tent or taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
leading his seruant Moses though the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
with the children of Israel, euen as a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
leadeth his sheep. Such was his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
toward his possession at that time, that in
fower hundred and fowerscore yeeres he dwelt
in tents and tabernacles, and his arke remained
within the curtaines. Then Salomon built a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for his name, against the comming of Shiloh
then to be sent, Iesus Christ, the very foundation,
wals, and borders of the catholike church, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
togither a communion of saints by the holy
Ghost, a most comfortable minister in the same.
Therfore there is no catholike, but the Lords


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2602:58"/>
building, which is the common passion of the
members of Christ. And we are not to beleeue in
the catholike church, of which our selues are
members: but we beleeue that we be of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
church, and that we are part of the Lords
husbandry and building vpon his sonne Iesus
Christ the rock, euen the foundation that was
reuealed by God the father vnto Peter. For when
doubt arose who he should be, Peter confidently
answered; Thou art that Christ the sonne of the
liuing God: and Iesus answered and said vnto
him; Blessed art thou Simon the sonne of Ionah,
for flesh and blood hath not reuealed this vnto
thee, but my father which is in heauen: and also I
say; Thou art Peter, and vpon this rock will I
build my church, and the gates of hell shall not
ouercome it. Heer met I somthing concerning
the catholike errors of the Popish church: that
make PETROS, PETRA, PETRA ROMA, and
ROMA CATHEDRA PETRI, which in a word
may be easily confuted: for Peter, at the pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
of the words, Thou art Peter, &amp;c. was in
the coasts of Caesarea Philippi Tetrarchae far
from Rome: neither was it euer spoken of by any


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2602:58"/>
testimony now of sixe hundred yeeres old, that
Peter was at Rome, only a new opinion of that
church hath of late inueterated. Concerning the
word, Rock; all rocks of saluation are spiritually
taken:<note place="margin">Psal. 18. 3.</note> as Dauid saith; The Lord is my rock and
my redeemer. And in another place it is said;
Tzuri shaddai, My rock is the all-sufficient: but
this is meant of our sauiour a rock of saluation;
seeing vpon it he will build his church, a temple
not made with hands: therfore of necessity must
this rock be taken spiritually, as a reuelation of
God from heauen to Peter of his sonne Iesus
Christ, which was the faith of Peter, when he said;
Thou art the annointed, the sonne of the liuing
God. And vpon this faith will Christ build his
church, so sure as vpon a rock neuer to be moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:<note place="margin">Psal. 123.</note>
for they that trust in the Lord, as mount Sion
cannot be mooued: the gates of hell shall not
preuaile against the building on this rock; for the
true faith in Christ shall continue for euer, yea
euen as an euerlasting building, that the fire nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wasteth nor consumeth. There was no cause
why Peter should haue receiued a speciall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2602:59"/>

               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:2602:60"/>
but in regard of his reuelation from God:
for it is said; Happy art thou, bicause my father
hath shewed thee this. Vpon this rock will I build
my church, and the gates of hel shall not preuaile
ouer it, and I will giue thee the keies of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heauen, and whatsoeuer thou bindest on
earth shall be bound in heauen, and whatsoeuer
thou loosest on earth shall be loosed in heauen.
Indeed Christ shewed that he himselfe had the
keies, when he saith very comfortably to Iohn;
Fear not,<note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 18.</note> I am the first and the last: him that Isai
prophesied of, which am aliue and was dead, and
behold I liue for euer and euer: verily I haue the
keies both of death and hell. And in another
place; Let him that hath eares, hear what the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
saith vnto the churches, and write to the angell
of the church in Philadelphia;<note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 7.</note> these things saith
the true and holy one, that hath the key of Dauid,
who openeth and no man shutteth; who shutteth
and no man openeth. And in the next verse; I
know thy works; behold I haue giueu before thee
an open gate, and no man can shut it, bicause
thou hast little power, and thou hast kept my


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2602:60"/>
commandements, and not denied my name. The
key of Dauid is manifested vnto vs, when he
saith; Open ye euerlasting doores, and the king
of glory shall com in. Heer was his faith as a key,
and therfore called the key of Dauid. He foresaw
the lion of the tribe of Iuda that came of the
root of Dauid; the lambe of God, who was the
only in heauen and earth that could open the
book and loose the seales. Heerby we see that
Christ only openeth,<note place="margin">Apoc. 5. 5.</note> and no man shutteth; and
shutteth and no man openeth. It is plaine by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of scripture, that there is but one key to
open heauen to mankind, and that is Christ the
king of glory, who is entred in, and there is no
other door-keeper but he. Therfore wheras our
sauiour saith; I will giue thee the keies of the
kingdom of heauen: that is to say, the spirituall
knowledge, to preach my word, which thou didst
but now testifie, in these words; Thou art the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
the sonne of the liuing God. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
heerof is to the beleeuers a key of entrance
to life eternall: but to the wicked and reprobate
vnbeleeuers, a key of exclusion to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2602:61"/>
for euer; and such is the binding vp of the
faithfull as sheaues into the barne, and the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or vndoing of the wicked as the stubble to
be burnt in vnquenchable fire. Otherwise, if
Christ had giuen him his owne whole authority
on earth, or had made him porter of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heauen, no doubt he himselfe in a verse or
two after as it seemeth, might had lost his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in heauen: for if Peter had been able to
haue disswaded him, Christ had not gone to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
nor suffered much of the high priests
and elders, nor been slain, nor the third day risen
againe. Wherby it seemeth that he was as great
an enimy to saluation as might be, when he said;
Go not master, haue pity on thy self; it shall not
so com vnto thee. Heer fell he so extremely in
faith, that he receiued a greater rebuke for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,<note place="margin">Math. 16. 23.</note>
than euer Iudas did; Get thee behind me
sathan (for before it seemeth he made him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion)
thou art mine offence, thou sauorest not
of the wisedom of God, but of the wit of man:
wherfore now I am to thee as Isai prophesied,<note place="margin">Isai. 8. 14.</note> a
rock of offence,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 8.</note> a stone to stumble at. But admit


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2602:61"/>
he had been the iustest man that euer was, and so
liued vntill he should go the way of the fathers:
yet was not his righteousnes inheritance; for it
came from God, and he could leaue nothing to
his posterity that claimeth more than his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by succession: thus much concerning the
catholike church. THE COMMVNION OF
SAINTS. I beleeue that there is communion
of saints, and that I my selfe am one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
elected by the spirit through faith in
Christ. THE FORGIVENES OF SINNES.
I beleeue also that there shall be a forgiuenes of
sinnes through the passion of Christ, as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
shewed by his passion. THE RESVRREC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION
OF THE DEAD. I beleeue there shall
be a resurrection of the dead, and that I shall rise
againe with glory vnto life euerlasting. These last
articles I handle not in this place, bicause each of
them is already seuerally prooued in my treatise.
All that remaineth is to conclude my purpose,
which was to shew the nature of beleeuing: that
by the faith of his owne hart euery man is saued,
what he is to beleeue in, the cause why; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2602:62"/>
