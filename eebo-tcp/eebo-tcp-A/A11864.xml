            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When after the period of the Saxon time, <hi>Harold</hi> had lifted himselfe into the Royall Seat; the Great men, to whom but lately hee was no more then equall either in fortune or power, disdaining this Act, of arrogancy, called in <hi>William</hi> then Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> a Prince more active then any in these Westerne parts, and renowned for many victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he had fortunately atchieved against the French King, then the most potent Monarch in Europe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:21346:3"/>This Duke led along with him to this worke of glory, many of the younger sons of the best families of <hi>Normandy, Picardy</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> who as undertakers, accompanied the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of this fortunate man.</p>
            <p>The Usurper slaine, and the Crowne by warre gained, to secure certaine to his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, what he had so suddenly gotten, he shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his purchase retaining in each County a portion to support the Dignity Soveraigne, which was stiled <hi>Demenia Regni;</hi> now the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Demeanes, and assigning to others his adventurers such portions as suited to their quality and expence, retaining to himselfe dependancy of their personall seruice, except such Lands as in free Almes were the portion of the Church, these were stiled <hi>Barones Regis,</hi> the Kings immediate Freeholders, for the word Baro imported then no more.</p>
            <p>As the King to these, so these to their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers subdivided part of their shares into Knights fees, and their Tennants were called <hi>Barones Comites,</hi> or the like; for we finde, as in the Kings Writ in their Writs <hi>Baronibus suis &amp; Francois &amp; Anglois,</hi> the soveraigne gifts, for the most part extending to whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Hundreds, an Earle being Lord of the one, and a Baron of the inferiour donations to Lords of Towne-ships or Mannors.</p>
            <p>As thus the Land, so was all course of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature divided even from the meanest to the highest portion, each severall had his Court

of Law, preserving still the Mannor of our Ancestours the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who <hi>jura per pages red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debant;</hi> and these are still tearmed Court-Barons, or the Freeholders Court, twelue u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually in number, who with the <hi>Thame</hi> or chiefe Lord were Judges.</p>
            <p>The Hundred was next, where the <hi>Hundre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> or <hi>Aldermanus</hi> Lord of the Hundred, with the cheife Lord of each Townshippe within their lymits judged; Gods people observed this forme in the publike <hi>Centureonis &amp; decam Judicabant plebem omni tempore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The County or <hi>Generale placitum</hi> was the next, this was so to supply the defect, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the corruption of the inferior, <hi>Vbi Curiae Dominorum probantur defecisse, pertinet ad vice comitem Provinciarum;</hi> the Iudges here were Comites, <hi>vice comites &amp; Barones Comitatus qui liberas in hoterras habeant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last &amp; supreme, &amp; proper to our questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was <hi>generale placitum aupud London universalis Synodus</hi> in Charters of the Conquerour, <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis curia</hi> by <hi>Glanvile, Magnum &amp; Commune consilium coram Rege et magnatibus suis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Rolles of <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. It is not stative, but summoned by Proclamation, <hi>Edicitur generale placitum apud London,</hi> saith the Booke of <hi>Abingdon,</hi> whether <hi>Epium Duces principes, Satrapae Rectores, &amp; Causidici ex omni parte confluxerunt ad istam curiam,</hi> saith <hi>Glanvile:</hi> Causes were referred, <hi>Propter aliquam dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem quae Emergit in comitatu, cum Comitatus</hi>

            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:21346:4"/>
            <p>AS this great Court or Councell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the King and Barons, ruled the great affaires of State and controlled all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Courts, so were there certaine Officers, whose transcendent power seemed to bee set to bound in the execution of Princes wills, as the Steward, Constable, and Marshall fixed upon Families in fee for many ages: They as Tribunes of the people, or <hi>ex plori</hi> among the Athenians, growne by unmanly courage feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Monarchy, fell at the feete and mercy of the King, when the daring Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> was slaine at <hi>Evesham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This chance and the deare experience <hi>Hen.</hi> the 3. himselfe had made at the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the 40. yeare of his raigne, and the memory of the many straights his Father was driven unto, especially at <hi>Rumny-mead</hi> neare <hi>Stanes,</hi> brought this King wisely to beginne what his successour fortunately finished, in les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning the strength and power of his great Lords; and this was wrought by searching into the Regality they had usurped over their peculiar Soveraignes, wherby they were (as the Booke of Saint <hi>Albans</hi> termeth them.) <hi>Quot Dominum tot Tiranni.</hi>)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21346:5"/>
and by the weakning that hand of power which they carried in the Parliaments by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the service of many Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses to that great Councell.</p>
            <p>Now began the frequent sending of Writs to the Commons, their assent not onely used in money, charge, and making Lawes, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all ordinances passed by the King and Peeres, but their consent in judgements of all natures whether civill or criminall: In proofe whereof I will produce some few succeeding Presidents out of Record.</p>
