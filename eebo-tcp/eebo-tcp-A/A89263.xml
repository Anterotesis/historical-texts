            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

within her mouth of any nouriſhment, for her Jawes were almoſt cloſed: Phyſitians gave their advice, with other friends; and what could be had, was gotten for her: but her ſignes from the beginning were, away with theſe Doctors Drugs, God had layd it on her, and God would take it off her.</p>
               <p>She beg'd that Mr. BALSOM, Mr. STROTHER, and Mr. HUET, wou'd be her Doctors in their earneſt prayers to the Lord for her; for ſhe was confident there was no helpe for her, but from Heaven: yet her mother to her great expences neglected no lawfull meanes that could be uſed. About 12. a clock ſhe had a tormenting fit before all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but it was not above an houre: but from that time till Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Eve, being 16. weekes, ſhe ſlept as well in the nights, as any one, but as ſoone as ſhe awaked in the morning begun her torment: Firſt three or foure houres every day, encreaſing till it came to eight houres, every houre a ſeverall torment, ſuch ſtrong cruell ones that cannot be expreſt, as many with weping eyes beheld it, that Miniſters would pray by her till the ſad object would make them leave her to the Lord, expecting nothing but death. Sir WILLIAM SELBY his Lady, the Counteſſe LENDRIK, the Lady HAGGARSTON, with many others, would look, till ſorrow would mak them forbeare: Yet as ſoone as theſe torments were over, the child would inſtantly ſmile, and make ſignes ſhe felt no paine at all: ſolying quietly till the next morning, onely we wet her lips with a little milke and water; for nothing ſhe would let come within her jawes; but would ſmile and ſhew her Armes and breaſt, and ſay God fed her with Angels food: for truely all the 16. weekes faſt, did not appeare to diminiſh her fatneſſe or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any thing at all.</p>
               <p>On Whitſon Eve in the morning ſhe had eight hours bitter torment, in the afternoone her mother being abroad, left her Husbands Brothers Daughter Mrs ELIZABETH MUSCHAMP with her, who made ſignes to her to carry her into the Garden, in her mothers abſence; her Cozen caſting a mintle about her, gave her her deſire, and ſate in the Garden with her on her knee, who in the bringing downe had ſo little ſtrength in her neck, that her head hung wagging downe; but was not ſet a quarter of an houre, till ſhewing ſome ſignes to her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, bolted off her knce, ran thrice about the Garden, expreſſing a ſhrill voyce, but did not ſpeake preſently: ſhe that was brought down
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117759:5"/>
in this ſad condition came up ſtaires on her owne legs, in her Cozens hands: Captaine FALSET, his Wife and his Daughter being then in the houſe, did behold this miraculous mercy of the Lord done to this child: her mother being at Berwick, three miles off, was ſent for, and imparted her joyfulneſſe unto the Lady SELBY, and good Mr. BAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOME, whoſe prayers with the reſt (as the child ſayd) had prevailed with God for mercy. When her mother came home, her Daughter which ſhe left in ſo bad a condition, came with her cloathes on, down to the gate, calling Mother, Mother welcome home. Now the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers joy may be imagined, but not expreſſed; deſiring her mother pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to ſend many thanks to Mr. BALSOME, and Mr. STROTHER for that the Lord had anſwered their prayers for her. The next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath, ſhe beg'd on her mother to returne thanks to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God, who never failed any that truſted in him, and her ſelf would ride into the Holy Iland and joyne in thanks and prayers to the Lord, with Mr. HUET, Sir THOMAS TEMPEST, Captaine SHAFT, with the reſt of the pariſh that feared God; She by Gods power did it the next Thurſday, being a Lecture in Berwick, her ſelfe, and with Mr. BALSOME and Mr. STROTHER gave glory to the Lord for his never forgotten mercy to her; though her fleſh did not diminiſh, yet her ſtrength was but weake, and her ſtomack by degrees came to her again, and for ſeven or eight weeks was very well: then her mother removed to Berwick, where the Gariſon being kept, the diſcharge of a Musket would cauſe her to fall into very great extaſies, being there ſeverall times for 24 hours ſpace, ſhe would be ſuddenly taken with her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer torments. For three weeks ſpace ſhe loſt her ſtomack, and all her limbs, and of a ſudden recoverd all again, not remembring what ſhe had either done or ſuffered. To avoyd this inconvenience, her mother removed from Berwick, and carried her in one of theſe ſad conditions one mile off Berwick, where ſhe continued ſeven weekes more in theſe afflictions.</p>

neither eate nor drinke any thing, but a little milke or water, or ſowre milke. He conſumed away to nothing, yet not heart-ſicke; but would reaſon, talke and laugh with any friend as if nothing ayled him. His mother now being preſt downe with ſorrow, ſent to the Doctors both at Newcaſtle. Durham, and Edenborough, not doubting or ſuſpecting any unnaturall Diſeaſe; the Phyſitians all agreed by the courſe of nature he could not live a month to an end, which was ſad newes to his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull Mother, God knowes.</p>

               <p>But in her abſence her Daughter had beene quite diſtracted, run up and downe with a ſtaffe in her hand, ſaying ſhe would kill the Rogue: in this rage ſhe apprehended her good things (for ſo ſhe called them) in the likeneſſe of a Dove, and a Partridge, and begun and ſung, <hi>Judgo and revenge my cauſe O Lord:</hi> Next, <hi>How long wilt thou forget me Lord; ſhall I never be remembred?</hi> And concluded, <hi>Behold and have regard, ye ſervants of the Lord;</hi> and ſo came out of her fit, not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring any thing, either done or ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Divers of theſe fits ſhe had, in every one expreſſing their bloud would ſave her life; from ten dayes to ſix, from ſix to three, which was on a Saturday, being heavily tormented, her tongue taken from her, with her eyes fixt on her objects, wrote thus againe, JO.

               <p>As ſoone as her mother came from Newcaſtle, ſhe ſent (that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhe revealed her minde to at Newcaſtle) to one JOHN HUTTON, he was one it was ſuſpected that could do more then God allowed of; bidding him confeſſe who had wrong'd her child, or ſhe would appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him: her child in her extremity writing the two firſt Letters of his name, with anothers.</p>

WILLIAM HALL, and WILLIAM BARD, rid to Etherſton thinking Mr. WALTO<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>N to have beene a Juſtice of the Peace; but was not: then ſhe with her company went directly to Sunderland, where Jo.

               <p>She ſayd her eldeſt ſon was very ill too, the Lord bleſſe him, not thinking that he was wronged; but the Rogue anſwered, one was the cauſe of both: ſhe in a maze ſayd, I had a ſiſter that dyed in a reſtleſſe ſickneſſe, God grant ſhe was not wronged too: the Rogue ſayd, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, Miſtreſſe, one is the cauſe of all, envy nothing will ſatisfie, but death.

Miſtreſſe ſayd he my life is in your hand, but I'le maintaine DOROTHY SVVINOVV was the death of the Lady MARGERY HAMBLETON, the conſuming of your ſon, and the tormentor of your daughter, and the cauſe of all your evill; and if you would have my hearts bloud take it, for my life is in your power, none ſpeaking of bloud to him. She told him the child had wrote two drops of his or her bloud would ſave her life; and if the Devill had left ſo much in him, ſhe would (if it pleaſed the Lord) have it ere they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The wretch uſing ſtill Godly words and his prayers, deſired to take his bloud privately, that none ſhould ſee; ſo the child nickt him halfe a dozen times in the forehead, but no bloud appeared; then he put forth his right arme and that was not till her mother threatned his heart bloud ſhould goe before ſhe wanted it; then he layd his thumb on his arme, and two drops appeared, which ſhe wip'd off with a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the which ſhe had writ the words in, and bid him farewell: he bid them ride ſoftly, they had both tide and time enough, it being a fine quiet day; of a ſudden as ſoon as they were on horſe back it grew very boyſtrous, that they had much adoe to ſit on their horſes; riding faſt, at Sunderland Towns end, came two white Lambs to them, and kept cloſe with their horſes till they came to Bambrough, being two long miles, neither ſheep nor lambs neere them; the water was very deep, yet being venterous they rid it over.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:117759:7"/>
On Munday night ſhe fell into a heavenly Rapture, rejoycing that ever ſhe was borne, for theſe two drops of blood had ſaved her life, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhe had beene ſeaven yeares in torment without any eaſe, or death had come: behold her two Angels (which ſhe was bold to call them) on her right hand, and her Tormenters on her left, ſetting her ſelfe with a majeſtick carriage, her words ſo punctuall and diſcreet, that it was admirable to the beholders.</p>
               <p>Saying her Angels bid her now be bold to ſpeake out, looking on her left hand, ſaying, thy name is JOHN HUTTON, and hers is DOROTHY SVVINOVV, ſhe hath beene the death of my Aunt HAMBLETON, the conſumer of my Brother, and the tormenter of me; ſhe knowing my Aunts eſtate was but for life, and her onely ſonne had marryed FAUSETS daughter, who to enjoy the eſtate, he having but one ſonne, was the cauſe of yong JAMES FAUSETS unnaturall fits: But think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. FAUSET would follow her more ſtrictly there, then we could doe here, let him alone, to be the more vehement with us, every fit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing me caſe, if I would conſent to lay it on my mother; but I will never conſent, but if it were poſſible indure more torment; fince ſhe is all that the Lord of his goodneſſe hath left to take care of us five fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe children; except our Father in Heaven, which protects her for our ſakes.</p>
               <p>Thus for two houres together ſhe continued in a very heavenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Diſcourſe with theſe Angels, rejoycing that ſhe had got two drops of blood; ſaying, if her Brother had as much, it would ſave his life alſo; witneſſe to theſe words were Mr. MOORE of Spittle, his ſix Sonnes and a Daughter, Mr. ELIZABETH MUSCHAMP, Mrs. MARGARET SELBY, ANNE SELBY, and GEORGE LEE, who was almoſt caſt away comming into Barwick Harbour in a Ship by that fearfull tempeſt which HUTTON raiſed. GEORGE ARMORER, WILLIAM HALL, WILLIAM BEARD, HENRY ORDE, with divers Neighbours, all admiring the Lords great power expreſſed in that afflicted childe. Her mother being deſtrous to have ſome ſmall quantity of HUTTONS blood, rode the next day to him with two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who brought him to her ſonne, he not being able to goe to him. He acknowledged ſtill his life was in her hands, and came riding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde one of her ſervants home to the Spittle where ſhe dwelt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought before Mr. MOORE, confirmed all that he had formerly

               <p>He ſtayed there ſeven or eight dayes, and yet Mr. MOORE had never power to examine him any more, the wretch ſtill deſiring to be gone, the mother in the preſence of MARGARET SELBY, MARGARET ORDE, and WILLIAM BEARD, charged him, that although he had beene long the Devills ſervant, at laſt to be but a bridge for Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to goe over, in confeſſing the truth; who anſwered, Miſtris, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris. If I were a yong man, able to endure all the torments that ſhould be layed on me, I would take my death that Mrs. DOROTHY SVVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVV was the death of the Lady HAMBLETON, the confumer of your ſonne, and the Tormentor of your Daughter, and the cauſe of all your other troubles.</p>
               <p>Now whileſt he was there the Girle was never troubled, but he was not paſt the Townes end, till ſhe fell into a terrible fit; ſaying, DOROTHT SVVINOVV with two Witches more were come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her worſe then ever HUTTON did, and the one was a yong wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the other an old: So that till they had Juſtice of DOROTHY SVVINOVV, her mother and they ſhould never be at peace: Upon this her mother rid to Juſtice FOSTER of Nuham, and upon Oath gave Information againſt both HUTTON and Mrs. SVVINOVV, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, who after delayes apprehended him, and ſent him to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle Goale, but not her, though it will appeare ſhe was three ſeveral times in his company after he had the Information upon Oath, whereof he gave her a Coppy, with the Coppy of HUTTONS Examination, but would never let Mrs. MUSCHAMP ſee it; ſeeing that delay, ſhe ſpoke with a Durham Juſtice at Bellford, which not being in the County, and in haſte he could not grant her a Warrant to apprehend the ſayd Mrs. SVVINOVV; but bid Mr. FOSTER doe Juſtice, which is not yet done.</p>

The Girle having many tormenting fits, in the midſt of which her Angels alwayes appearing to her, baniſhing the Witches, which ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; the Girle would cry out and relate to her Angels how ſhe by the two Witches had been tormented, forcing her to get the information, whereof her mother kept a Coppy; ſo that let her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give the paper to whom ſhe would, or laye it any where, the child would goe to either place or party moſt ſtrangely. As ſoone as her Angels departed. her torments leaving her, ſhe told them that her enemies would have killed her: but juſtly might ſhe ſing the 35.

Witches; foretelling many ſtrange truths, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting divers meetings with her Angels, ſuch a day and ſuch an houre, to conſult with them what ſhould become of her brother, and what puniſhment her enemies ſhould have, bidding every one they ſhould not ſo much as looke after her, for if they did it would anger her Angels, and undoe her, for there were ſome ſtrange Angels beſides her owne to meet her; this being the fourth meeting with them, and it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare all, ſaying ſhe muſt have all cleane cloathes about her; for this day or to morrow ſhe muſt meet them under ſuch a tree in the Garden: After comming out of her fit, ſhe remembred not any thing what was done or ſayd.</p>
               <p>Her mother obſerving her words, which hitherto had beene ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, clothed her childe all in white, and freely commended her to the Lord, watching his glorious time in the afternoone, being in a walk under a tree with her Brothers and ſiſters; ſuddenly ſhe gave a great ſhrike, and skipt over a double ditch and another, and run to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den doore. Her eldeſt ſiſter came to her mother ſaying, MARGRET is gone to her Angels meeting, who with haſt ran with the key of the Garden doore, where her childe was ſtanding, beating at it, ſaying, I come, I come: ſhe opened the doore and left her to her protector, and haſtily went to the other ſide of the houſe to ſecure that part of the Garden: but (alas) ere ſhe came, a wicked creature ſet on by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies inſtigation, had been looking after her, and her childe wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her hands, weeping bitterly, as if ſhe could have torne her fleſh

from the bones, or haire off her head, ſaying who was here? what wicked creature had ſtayd her bleſſed Angels from her; and for three houres together tooke on grievouſly, her mother weeping with her, begging of the Lord not to puniſh the innocent for the wickeds fault. After ſome time the child went into the Garden againe, where finding one of her Angels, ſhe ſayd, Lord, it was not my fault: but well is me that you will come unto me! but (alas) where are the reſt? Her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being within, hearing theſe words. A quarter of a yeare (a long time to be without comfort) ſtill weeping: Then ſhe had this Anſwer from her Angels, that for twelve weeks they would not viſibly appeare to her. This she remembred for three dayes, and related to her brothers and ſiſters and the reſt of the houshold the shape of thoſe Angels: which were bodyed like Birds, as big as Turkies, and faces like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but the ſweeteſt creatures that ever eyes beheld: one of the ſtrange ones came flying over the trees with a ſweet voyce, and gave her notice the reſt were come; which ſhe found moſt true. Two or three lighted upon the ground, and the reſt with the heavenlieſt voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ever were heard, with a reſolution to declare the truth of all. And if the Juſtices, and Judges at the Aſſizes would not doe juſtice, her owne two Angels (who were alwayes to her like a Dove and a Partridge) would viſibly, to the admiration of all the beholders, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like a man and a woman, and juſtifie the truth, if the wicked wretch had not ſcared them away. But now the one of her Angels bid her have a care ſhe were neither frighted nor angred for twelve weeks, in which time they would not come to her; but in the meane time her enemy would make every third fit a terrible one, which was moſt true.</p>
               <p>In the meane time Colonel SVVINOVV dyed, and ſhe comes into the Countrey, and becauſe FOSTER would doe no juſtice, I got her apprehended in Berwick; ſhe made ſuch friends that it was a greater freedome to her then ſhe had formerly from all other Lawes, and went at pleaſure. The Girle with her mother being one Sabbath day at Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick Church, comming along the Bridge with her Husbands ſon, and daughter; DOROTRY SVVINOVV being at the farther end thereof, the Girle never ſeeing her but in her fits, knew her and was ready to fall downe in her mothers hand, crying yonder is the wofull thiefe; her mother knowing it true, ſayd now to the Girle it is not ſhe, who

anſwered, I have ſeen her a hundred times to my ſmart, it is ſhe: her mother troubled much at the ſight too, would have had the Girle back, but her deſire was to be at home, who was no ſooner come in, but ſhe fell inro a terrible fit, for two houres long; ſometimes her tongue drawne in within her throat, other whiles hanging over her chin on her breaſt. Sad and heavy ſights were ſeen in her afflictions, ſtill bidding all that were by her ſee the wicked Wretch DOROTHY SVVINOVV with the two Witches at her back, ſaying ſhe would not let her goe back to Berwick, leſt the Juſtices ſhould have been witneſſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but let her come home, where ſhe knew all their hearts were hardened: for alas, ſhe ſayd I have two weeks and two dayes yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Comforters come, which made her enemies thus cruell, that if it were in her power to take their lives ſhe would but the Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving power would never leave them who ſuffered theſe torments for his owne glory and their ſoules health ſaying, ours were but the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of a loving Father to ſhew his great power in his weakeſt children, rejoycing exceedingly that he thought her (a ſinfull creature) worthy ſo much happineſſe, accounting it more joy to ſee her bleſſed Angels then all the world could afford, thanking God eſpecially for making her a watch over her mother, brothers, and ſiſters, and would foretell ſtrange things before they happened.</p>
               <p>When her 12. weekes were paſt, the very day and houre came di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to ſee the Event, and waited with patience her appoynted time, which was the very minute of the houre of the day 12. weekes, they were ſcared from her, Mr. BROAD, Miniſter, Mr. STEVENS, Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Mrs. MUSCHAMP, and Mrs. HAGARSTON, beſides their owne Neighbours were Witneſſes, hearing her expreſſe much joy to meete with thoſe long abſent deare friends, relating the intention ſome had to looke after them againe; ſo apprehending them in the Chamber, where the Spectators heard her for two houres, moſt divinely and heavenly diſcourſe with them, anſwering and replying to that religious diſcourſe, praying for her enemy DOROTHY SVVINOVV, with the teares run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning downe her face, that if the Lord had mercy in ſtore to grant her it, lamenting the ſad condition ſhe had run her ſoule into, for ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her malice to leſſen her hope of eternity, making ſuch a deſcription betweene hell torments and heavenly joyes, as that no Divine on earth could have gone beyond her: Crying out for Juſtice, ſaying, if ſhe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117759:10"/>
were in hold as a Fellon ought to be, her power would be gone, and their torments eaſed; but now with much joy ſhe bleſt God her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels would never leave her againe, whilſt they were in affliction; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe would go to the Judges (and deſired to carry her brother there to) and begge for Juſtice; if ſhe got it, her brother ſhould come home as well as ever he was, ſhe no more tormented, and there ſhould be no more hard heartedneſſe againſt her mother, which the Lord knowes was ſuch without any juſt cauſe, that her paſſion is by Gods power beyond imagination: Every fit ſhe ſpake to this effect, till the Sizes came: in her fit her brother asked her if it were poſſible that he could ride that could neither go or ſtand; ſhe anſwered that the Lord would inable him, therefore he ſhould goe, and her Angels would goe along with them, and bring them ſafe back againe.</p>
               <p>So their Mother not daring to diſobey ſuch divine commands, whoſe confidence doth wholly depend upon Gods providence from Heaven, rid behinde her ſonne, and came to the Judge, relating her ſad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he heard her, but being falſely informed, did not reſent it: ſhe went to the Juſtices to remove DOROTHY SVVINOVVS body to the County where the act was committed: they pretended ignorance, the childrens mother went with them to a Counſellour to inſtruct them, whoſe anſwer was he would not meddle in it: Yet theſe dejectments did not drive her from an undoubted confidence in an all ſufficient God; the next day betweene one and two of the Clock in the afternoone the Girle ſuddainely had a fit and after her torments her Angels appeared unto her, to them ſhe complaines, ſaying, no Juſtice abroad, no Peace at home, what ſhould become of her mother? for that Godleſſe thiefe DOROTHY SVVINOVV, by the inſtigation of the Divell, had hardned the heart of both Judges and Juſtices againſt her, and now at this inſtant (ſayd ſhe) is uſing meanes to harden her husbands heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her too (which ſhe knowes will be cruelleſt to her of all) and withall begun to conſume her eldeſt ſiſter, and that ſhe would this night, or to morrow morning go to the Judge, begge once more for Juſtice; if ſhe got it, her Brother with the reſt ſhould be well, if not, worſe then ever; ſaying, if the Judge denyed her it, it would not be well with him; this was part of her two houres diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>BEfore ſhe was out of her fit came Dr. GENISON, who invited the mother with her children to his houſe, being the next houſe to the Judges Chamber, in regard the Girles firſt appoyntment was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes kept; ſo after her ſupper ſent to ſee if it were more convenient to waite upon the Judge that night, or the next morning: the anſwer was returned that night was fitteſt: So Dr. CLETHER and his wife, with Dr. GENISON and his, went along with the mother and their children thither, there was a great many ſpectators to ſee the Event.</p>
               <p>Thus being ſet downe in the chamber, her mother began her former ſuit, in begging Juſtice: his anſwer was, that that which belonged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the County Palatine of Durham, belonged not unto him: So ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him in his returne back, either to doe it, or elſe give order to the Juſtices in the County to apprehend her; of a ſuddaine the Girle fell into a fit, relating before them all DOROTHY SVVINOVVS ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice from the beginning, the cauſe of the troubles that broke Sir Ro. HAMBLETONS heart, the death of his Lady, and how ſhe ſought ſtill by evill meanes to take away her mothers life, when the Lord would not permit that, got leave firſt to torment her, then to conſume her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and now hath begun to conſume her eldeſt ſiſter, and harden her Father in Lawes heart, to make her mothers life more ſorrowfull, with her hands up, and eyes fixed upon her objects, begged Juſtice for the Lords ſake, for Jeſus Chriſts ſake; ſaying I ought to command Juſtice by the Lawes of the Realme, in the name of our Soveraigne Lord the King, but I beg not in the name of any mortal man, but in the name of the King of Kings, Juſtice for Chriſts ſake, Juſtice for his mercies ſake, it we have but ordinary Juſtice, which ought not to be denyed to the pooreſt creature who demands it, my brother that ſits there ſhall goe home as well as ever he did, I no more tormented, my mother no

more afflicted, and my ſiſters torments at an end: if we have no juſtice my torments ſhall be doubled, my brother worſe then ever he was, and my ſiſter (which ſhe hath this day begun to torment) worſe then any of us, and my mothers afflictions, by the hardning of folks hearts againſt her will be unſufferable; but the Lords preſerving mercy will never leave them who depend upon his providence; but it will be worſe for them who deny us juſtice then for us. Theſe words with many more ſignificant expreſſions, that the Judge thought she feigned: but as ſoon as she was out of her fit, did not know what was paſt, as all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders did ſee, onely an innocent bashfull Girle, without any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at all when she was out of her fits. So her mother returned home with them, where she found her other Girle began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume.</p>
               <p>That night she came home the Girle fell into a fit, preſſing to vomit, but nothing came up but a piece of Fir-ſtick full of crooked pinnes: after her Angels came, she cryed out of the Judges injuſtice, ſaying, now the enemy when she ſees she can have no juſtice, ſtrived to choake her with theſe things, being ſtones, coles, brick, Lead, ſtraw, quills full of pins, with ſtraw full of pins, tow, and Virginall wire, all full of pins; one great ſtone for three weekes together came alwayes to her throat and went back again, till at the laſt the Lord brought it up. She bid watch with her brother three weeks; for they would if they could either cut his throat in the night, or elſe burne him with fire; therefore let the Watchers be very wakefull, and carefull, ſo bleſſed be God they were, and did heare as it were knives sharpning on the ſtaires, and 3 ſeverall times fire was found in the roome one night, like to have burnt them, but by Gods mercyes were ſaved. She ſayd now DOROTHY SVVIHOVV was ſeeking a new way to take away her mothers life; for she was conſuming the child within her, and withall bad them watch with her brother and ſiſter that night twelve month they began to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him (which was Saint Johns day at night) betwixt the houres of 1. and 2. in the morning, and that very moment of the houre they would ſeek to take his life and the uſe of his ſiſters legs, if Chriſtians prayers and diligent watching did not prevent them; ſo it pleaſed the Lord to move the hearts of good friends to watch with them till the houre came.</p>

betwixt the houres of one and two the next day the glory of God should appeare, her mother being confident of the Lords mercy, gave notice to all that came nigh her; ſo ſome that feared God came to ſee the Event, which releaſement being writ from her owne mouth will confirme theſe warnings of her former trialls, which have all with much patience beene gone thorow, that the preſerving mercies of the moſt glorious God, who never failes thoſe that depend upon his moſt firme promiſes was never more declared on earth then in the weakeſt of his creatures, preſerved by a gratious God, to whom let all that read and heare theſe unexpreſſible mercies, give all Glory, Honour, Laud, and Praiſes.</p>

                           <p>Both my torments are at an end, and thoſe fearefull ſights I doe not now ſee, though it hath pleaſed God to ſuffer and let them have power to torment me, yet I was never without comfort.</p>
                           <p>My time was ſad when I had no comfort, but I thanke God who hath given me patience.</p>
                           <p>I bleſſe God who never ſuffered the Devill to have ſo much power, as to cauſe me blaſpheme his name, or to ſpeake words to offend him.</p>
                           <p>It is a great mercy that he granted me patience to endure my payne; if it had pleaſed God I ſhould have beene content as well with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as releaſement.</p>

he will ſend you to protect and watch over us.</p>
                              <p>I have endured my paines a great while, it is two yeares agoe yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; yet I bleſſe God for it, alwayes with much patience, my paine hath beene very vehement for the time, yet I bleſſe God I did never ſpeake wordes to offend him: I confeſſe I doe not deſerve it, I deſerve no ſuch thing, rather Judgement, not ſuch Godly Chaſticement: ſince he granted them power, he never left me to my ſelfe.</p>
                              <p>Is this the laſt farewell? If it had been Gods will, I had rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured all the to ments could be put to a creature.</p>
                              <p>But ſince it hath pleaſed God it ſhould be ſo, I am content, the thing that's his will, the Lord grant that it never be ſorrowfull to me, but make his will my will, that we may never repine.</p>
                              <p>He knowes the ſecrets of all hearts.</p>
                              <p>As for that wicked woman, if ſhe had had any fear of God, ſhe would have thought that though ſhe had done it never ſo ſecretly, yet God would finde it out: She ſhould have thought no ſuch thing; but where the Divell gets entrance, his temptations are very ſtrong.</p>
                              <p>Theſe torments are more welcome to me, then if I had been in my perfect health; if I had not knowne what torments had been, what pain had been, I ſhould never have ſeen ſuch joyfull ſights: theſe are more joyfull to me then all the paine.</p>
                              <p>Our paine, what's all our pain? what's all the pain on earth? Gods mercy is above the Divels power.</p>
                              <p>Their time is limited.</p>
                              <p>They ſought my mothers life, but could not get it.</p>
                              <p>Oh! to think of Hells torments which ſhe hath run her ſoule into, that's more torment then all ours. It's comfort for me, joy for me, that God hath ſhowne his power, that God hath given the Divell po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to torment, I care not what thc Divell can doe; I defie all the Divels in Hell, for where the Divell hath any power, he triumphs as much as he can, though he triumph and we are weake, God is ſtrong, his power is not leſſened.</p>
                              <p>That wicked woman DOROTHY SVVINOVV was the cauſe of the death of my Aunt MARGERY HAMBLETON, ſhe was the cauſe of thoſe troubles, which ſhe thought ſhould have broke my Aunts heart, but they broke Sir ROBERTS, that the eſtate might fall to her ſonne: She was the cauſe of JAMES FAUCETS unnaturall fits, but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117759:13"/>
ſhe let him alone, becauſe ſhe knew that if he came to London he would follow her more ſtrictly then we can here.</p>
                              <p>She ſet two Witches more to torment us: Jo. HUTTON, that dyed in priſon was my great tormenter, theſe Witches have begun my ſiſters torment, though our torments have been more long, yet her time hath been moſt ſad, becauſe ſhe wanted comfort: though I have had my paines, I never wanted comfort.</p>
                              <p>She hath entred into the Divels ſervice, ought ſhe not to think of the torment of her ſoule?</p>
                              <p>If it had not been thus with us, we ſhould have deſpiſed the mercyes of God, our comfort is for joy in heaven, thats more comfort for us, thats more happineſſe to thinke of, then all our paines and torments; if our bodyes were torne at horſe heeles, and dragged with wild Beares, yet all were nothing to heavens joyes.</p>
                              <p>Our ſouls are a precious jewell, we ought all to looke after them; our bodies are but duſt and aſhes: if our bodies were tortured with all torments, one blinke of heavens joyes will ſweeten all.</p>
                              <p>Now my torments are at an end, I care not though they were longer: the torment of my body is nothing, but to thinke of the torment ſhe hath hazarded her ſoule into, is the torment of Hell fire.</p>
                              <p>Wee confeſſe wee all deſerve that, but not by that meanes ſhe hath.</p>
                              <p>None will believe it, ſhe ſets ſuch a faire face upon it: where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell tempts, deluſions are ſtrong.</p>
                              <p>The Divell hath gotten power to harden all hearts.</p>
                              <p>Thoſe that are to do us juſtice, will not: though they deny us juſtice, yet God can and will in his due time, grant us juſtice over them all.</p>
                              <p>Though God hath ſuffered the Divell to have power to torment us; they now have their times: certainly our times are in a better life; we have no pleaſure here, all our pleaſure is in the world to come.</p>
                              <p>I have cauſe to bleſſe God, who doth ſend theſe bleſſed Angels to watch over me: my paynes were always with joy, never ſorrowfull, and when I had no comfort, yet I had hopes that God who layed them on me, would take them off me in his due time.</p>
                              <p>Have not I reaſon to bleſſe God? none hath reaſon more: the Lord
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117759:13"/>
grant I never forget his mercies: he hath been very mercifull to us, in granting us patience to endure more then wee could expect at his hands.</p>
                              <p>What is this they have run their ſoules into? the Lord grant them hearts to repent them of their ſinns; the Lord grant us penitent hearts to repent us of our ſinnes: we have all done as much as deſerves hell, where is gnaſhing of teeth, paines, fire and brimſtone for ever.</p>
                              <p>We have cauſe to bleſſe God that hath not ſuffered us to go neither to Witches, nor any of the divels ſervants, but to looke to God.</p>
                              <p>No creature thought we could have indured, what can we indure of our ſelves? No, without God we can doe nothing, what cannot God inable us to indure? There is nothing that can be done, but we can do it by Gods aſſiſtance, we cannot ſay we can doe any thing of our ſelves, no not the leaſt thing in the World, ſeeing our helpe is in an able God, we can do any thing.</p>
                              <p>I know the Lord will never ſuffer the divell to have any further pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over our bodies; though they hurt our bodies, they ſhall not hurt our ſoules, they ſhall not come neare our ſoules.</p>
                              <p>Our ſoules are all the comfort we can expect, what are our bodies? Our bodies are nothing; I bleſſe God that would have his glory tryed on our weake bodies, which no creature thought could have indured ſuch torment.</p>
                              <p>We have reaſon my brother, ſiſter, and all of us to bleſſe God; yea, all creatures that behold it have reaſon to bleſſe God, and to thinke that he is a mercifull God to us, it is his mercy we know, it is his promiſe that all thoſe that repent with penitent hearts, he is ſtill ready to forgive them, we acknowledge it is Gods mercy, not our deſerts.</p>
                              <p>They have tormented my brother a yeare a gone St. IOHNS day at night, and they have tormented me two yeares agone yeaſterday, my ſiſter is pined away, they began with her ſince Lammas, ſhe hath leſſe comfort then we have had.</p>
                              <p>She from the beginning hath had great paine without comfort, and though my paine have beene ſoreſt, yet I have had great comfort.</p>
                              <p>Since God hath granted this day to be my releaſement, have I not reaſon to bleſſe this God? My brother and ſiſter are ſtill under their burthen: Let them not thinke it a burthen, but rather beg patience to indure it.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="22" facs="tcp:117759:14"/>
If ever God give them health, we have all reaſon to have thoughts of eternity, and never to forget the word of God.</p>
                              <p>My ſiſter is worſe then my brother, or then ever I was, my torments were vehement, ſometimes a day, ſometimes eight houres, ſometimes ſhorter, ſometimes longer; and though my time was ſore and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet ſtill <hi>I</hi> had eaſe after it, but my ſiſter hath no eaſe.</p>
                              <p>Now when I am releaſed, what ſhall become of my brother and ſiſter, if it pleaſe God to give them ſo much power as to torment them? If that God make me a watch over them, that I may declare their grief, it is a great mercy.</p>
                              <p>They thought to have choaked me, once they made me caſt up pins, and ſtones, and things that creatures would not thinke poſſible ſhould have come out of my mouth, yet God inabled me to indure that not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature thought I could.</p>
                              <p>They thought to have done the like to my Brother, but God did not ſuffer the Divell to have ſo much power, but they have ſtriven ſo to do.</p>
                              <p>For my Brother GEORGE he had neede to have a care of himſelfe, he by the ſight of me I ſaw conſumed; we have reaſon to bleſſe God he is away.</p>
                              <p>If you love my ſiſter BETTYES life bring her not home, you may as well take a knife and cut her throat, as be the cauſe of her torments.</p>
                              <p>If they love my ſiſter and brothers life, bring them not in ſight one minute, by looking on them doth them more hurt then we thinke of.</p>
                              <p>If my ſiſter had gone away to and not looked ſo much on my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as ſhe hath done it had beene better for her.</p>
                              <p>She hath done her ſelfe more wrong then us, in ſetting theſe two more againſt us, though it hath pleaſed God to let them have ſo much power over our bodies, yet they never had power over our ſoules.</p>
                              <p>They are trying all ways in the world to have power to torment my Mother, they are ſeeking to torment her by an unnaturall way, if we have not a care of our ſelves, and one of another by Gods mercies.</p>
                              <p>Shall they never have more power to torment me?</p>
                              <p>They thought this laſt night to have made me more paſſionate then ever I was; I bleſſe God though they made me ſomewhat paſſionate, yet ſtil God inabled me with patience not to be much extravagant much after their deſires, thoſe Juſtices all of them have denyed us Juſtice: Let them take heede of themſelves: Let them take heede of a heavy

burthen that may fall upon themſelves: Though our Mother be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto us; yet let them take heede of a heavy burthen may fall on them: I wiſh to God it be not ſo, that the innocent doe not ſuffer, the Lord grant they may have a ſenſibleneſſe of the wrong they have done us, and ſuffer not the innocent to indure for them.</p>
                              <p>Now after this, when they cannot get power to torment me, will they ever be more vehement with my brothers and ſiſters?</p>
                              <p>Whenſoever ſhe is put in hold till ſhe come to her tryall ſhe ſhould not have her liberty; for if ſhe come abroad amongſt her company, ſhe will be as cruel as ever.</p>
                              <p>If theſe two Witches were catcht and in hold, ſhe would goe to death to the utmoſt to make them more vehement then ever: though they torment the reſt, yet they ſhall never have power to torment me.</p>
                              <p>It is ſayd in the word of God, you ſhall not ſuffer a Witch to live; yet ſhe conſults with Witches, and conſults with their wayes, which by the Lawe of God deſerves death.</p>

                              <p>God grant we never forget Gods mercies, to be impatient, ſeeing we have reſt in torment.</p>
                              <p>What mercies can be ſhowne unto a creature, but it hath pleaſed God to ſhew it to me? that it hath pleaſed him to grant mee ſo much patience, though of my ſelfe I was not ſenſible of my torments, that was a mercy and much comfort to my ſoule, that though they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented my body, they never had power to cauſe me ſpeake unbefitting words to hazzard my ſoule.</p>
                              <p>But had it not pleaſed God to have ſent you to me that time, what have would become of me? I had beene diſtracted and like a mad body.</p>
