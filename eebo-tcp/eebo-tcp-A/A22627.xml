            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a womans milk did then entertaine me: yet did neither my mother nor nurſes fill their own breſts; but thou, O Lord, didſt by them afford a nouriſhment fit for my infancy, even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thine owne inſtitution, and thoſe riches of thine, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to the root of all things. Thou alſo ingraftedſt in mee a deſire to ſucke no more than thou ſupplyedſt them withall; and in my Nurſes, to afford mee what thou gaveſt them: for they

2. And behold, by little and little I came on to perceive where I was; and I had the will to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie what I would have, to thoſe that ſhould helpe me to it: but I could not yet cleerely enough expreſſe my deſires to them; for theſe were within mee, and they without me; nor could the gheſſe of their ſenſes dive into my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Thereupon would I flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with my limbes, and ſputter out ſome words, making ſome other few ſignes; as well as I could; but could not get my ſelfe to be underſtood by them: and when people obeyed mee not, either for that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood me not; or leſt what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſhould hurt me; then how would I wrangle at thoſe elder ſervants that were to tend thee, and the children that did not aptly humour me, and I thought to revenge my ſelfe upon them all, with crying.

               <p n="3">3. What alſo paſſed before that age, O God my delight? Was I any where, or any body? for I have none to tell me thus much: neither could my Father and Mother, nor the experience of others, nor yet mine owne memory. Doeſt thou laugh at me for enquiring theſe things, who commandeſt me to praiſe and to confeſſe to thee for what I knew? I confeſſe unto thee, O Lord of heaven and earth, and I ſing praiſes unto thee for my firſt being and infancy, which I have no memory of: and thou haſt given leave to Man, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to conjecture of himſelfe, and upon the credit of women to beleeve many things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:402:18"/>
ſhould moſt juſtly be laugh'd at and reprehended for it. Even then therefore did I ſomething worthy to be blamed: but for that I could not underſtand ſuch as reprehended mee, therefore would neither cuſtome nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuffer me to bee corrected. For as we grow towards diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we root up and caſt out ſuch childiſhneſſe: nor have I ſeene any man (knowing what he doth) who purging out bad things, caſts the good away alſo. But whether may this paſſe for good, (conſidering the time) by crying to deſire, what would have hurt me being given; and by being ſo ſullenly froward at people that did not humour me; even at yong and old, and mine owne parents too; yea and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (as fiercely as I could) at diuers other diſcreeter perſons, that did not <hi>Cockney</hi> me in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing; and becauſe they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed not my commands, which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:402:18"/>
had beene hurtfull to me to have beene obeyed. So that it is not the minde of Infants that is harmeleſſe, but the weakneſſe of their childiſh members. I my ſelfe have ſeene and obſerved a little Baby to be already jealous; and before it could ſpeake, what <note place="margin">How early malicious envie comes to expreſſe it ſelfe.</note> an angry and a bitter looke it would caſt at another childe that ſuckt away it's milke from it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. GRowing on from the ſtate of Infancie, came I not into my Childehood; or rather came not that into mee, and ſucceeded unto my Infancy? nor yet did my Infancy depart: for whither went it? though now it were no more: for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant I was no longer, that could not ſpeake; ſeeing now I began to prove a pretty prating Boy. And this I well remember, and I afterwards obſerved how I firſt learn'd to ſpeake. For my elders did not teach me this abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by giving of mee words in any certaine order of teaching, (as they did letters afterwards) but by that minde which Thou my God gaveſt mee, I my ſelfe with gruntings, varieties of voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and various motions of my
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:402:20"/>
body, ſtrove to expreſſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of mine owne heart, that my deſire might be obeyed; but could not bring it out, either what I would have, or to whom I deſired. Then, I ſettled in my memory when they named any thing; and when at that name they moved their bodies toward that thing, I obſerved it, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thereby, that that word which they then pronounced, was the very name of the thing which they ſhewed me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that they meant this <hi>(or that)</hi> thing, was diſcovered to me by the motion of their bodies, even by that naturall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (as it were) of all nations; which expreſſed by the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and caſt of the eye, by the action of other parts, and the ſound of the voice; diſcovers the affections of the mind, either to deſire, enjoy, refuſe, or to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. And thus words in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſentences, ſet in their due
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:402:21"/>
places, and heard often over, I by little and little collected, of what things they were the ſignes; and having broken my mouth to the pronunciation of them, I by them expreſſed mine owne purpoſes. Thus (with thoſe whom I converſed withall) did I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the expreſſions of mine owne deſires; and ventured thereby upon the troubleſome ſociety of humane buſineſſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending all this while upon the authority of my parents, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the becke of my Elders.</p>

               <p n="1">1. O God, my God! what miſeries and what moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keries did I finde in that age; when as being yet a Boy, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to my Teachers was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:402:21"/>
unto me, as the meanes to live by another day; that in this world I might grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and prove excellent in <hi>Tongue-ſciences,</hi> which ſhould get me reputation amongſt men, and deceitfull riches? Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was I ſet to ſchoole, to get Learning; whereby little knew I (wretch that I was) what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit might be obtained; and yet if I proved trewantly at my Booke, I was preſently beaten. For this diſcipline was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by our Anceſtours; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers paſſing the ſame courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our times, had chalked theſe troubleſome waies out unto us, by which we were conſtrained to follow them; multiplying by this meanes both labour and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the ſonnes of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We (little ones) obſerved, O Lord, how certaine men would pray unto thee; and wee learnd of them; thinking thee (as farre as we could apprehend)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:402:22"/>
to be ſome great thing; who wert able, (and yet not appeare to our ſenſes) both to heare and helpe us. For being yet a Boy, I beganne to pray unto thee, (my ayd and refuge) and I even brake the ſtrings of my tongue in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee; &amp; being but yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle one, I prayed to thee with no ſmall devotion, that I might not be beaten at ſchoole. And when thou heardeſt not (which yet was not to bee accounted folly in me) my corrections (which I then eſteemed my greateſt and moſt grievous affliction) were made ſport at by my elders, yea and by mine owne parents, who wiſht no hurt at all unto me. Is there any man, O Lord, of ſo great a ſpirit, cleaving to thee with ſo ſtrong an affection; is there any man, I ſay, (for even a ſtupidity may other-whiles doe as much) who by devoutly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelfe unto thee, is ſo reſolutely affected, that hee can
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:402:22"/>
thinke ſo ſlightly of thoſe rackes and ſtrappadoes, and ſuch varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of torments, (for the avoiding whereof men pray unto thee with ſo much feare all the world over) that he can make ſport at thoſe who moſt bitterly feare them; as our parents laugh at thoſe torments, which wee ſchoole-boyes ſuffer from our Maſters? For we were no leſſe afraid of the Rod, nor did wee leſſe earneſtly pray to thee for the ſcaping of it, than others did of their tortures. And yet for all our feares, we too often played the Trewants; either in writing, or reading, or thinking upon our leſſons, leſſe than was required of us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For wee wanted not (O Lord) either memory or capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (of which, conſidering our age, thou pleaſedſt to beſtow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough upon us) but our minde was all upon playing; for which we were beaten, even by thoſe

Maſters, who had done as much themſelves. But elder folkes <hi>Idleneſſes,</hi> muſt (forſooth) bee called <hi>Buſineſſe,</hi> and when chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doe the like, the ſame men muſt puniſh them; and yet no man pitties, either childrens pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, or mens follies, or eyther. But perhaps ſome indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Iudge might account mee to be juſtly beaten, for playing at Ball, being yet a Boy, becauſe by that ſport I was hindred in my Learning, by which, when I came to be a man, I was to play the foole more unbeſeemingly: as my Maſter, who now beat me, often did; who if in any tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Queſtion he were foyled by another Schoolemaſter, he was preſently more rackt with cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and envy at him, than I was, when at a Match at Tennis-ball, I loſt the Game to my play-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I Had heard (being yet a Boy) of eternall life promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto us through the humility of thy Sonne our Lord God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending even to our pride: And I was then ſigned with the ſigne of his Croſſe <note n="*" place="margin">This was the practiſe of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times: by which religi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous parents devoted their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto Chriſt, long before their Baptiſme; which in thoſe dayes was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till they were able to anſwer for themſelves.</note>, and was ſeaſoned with his ſalt, ſo ſoone as I came out of my Mothers wombe, who greatly truſted in thee. Thou ſaweſt, O Lord, when being yet a Boy, and was one day taken with a paine in the ſtomacke, I ſuddenly fell into a Fit, very like to dye. Thou ſaweſt, O my God, (for thou wert my keeper) with what earneſtneſſe of mind, and with what faith, I importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the piety both of mine owne Mother, and of thy Church the Mother of us all; for the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:402:25"/>
of thy Chriſt, my Lord God. Whereupon the Mother of my fleſh being much porple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed, (for that in a chaſt heart, and faith in thee, ſhe moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note>

                     <hi>This was the reaſon why Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was deferred, which Saint</hi> Auguſtine <hi>here findes fault with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. God would not ſuffer our Father to be baptized in his ſickneſſe: for then bad the Church loſt a moſt glorious Miniſter; for by the Canons of the Church, no man could bee a Biſhop, who had beene baptiſed in his bed: becauſe ſuch an one ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be baptized rather out of neceſſity, than ſaith, which would be ſcandalous to a Biſhop.</hi>
                  </note> the guilt contracted by the filth of ſinne, were both greater and more dangerous after Baptiſme, than before.</p>

For when as one day, ſofe ſicke of his Feaver, hee lay ſenſeleſſe in a deadly ſweat, and all deſpairing of his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he was baptized unwitting to himſelfe; my ſelfe meane while little regarding, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming that his ſoule would have retained rather what it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of me, and not what was now wrought in the body of him that knew <note n="*" place="margin">The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Sacrament of Baptiſme.</note> nothing of it. But it fell out farre otherwiſe: for he became refreſhed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his health upon it: For when as ſoone as ever I could come to ſpeake with him; (and I could, ſo ſoone as he was able: for I had never yet gone from him, and we very neerely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one upon another) I offered to ſcoffe, as if he alſo would have
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:402:88"/>
ſcoffed with me for company, at that Baptiſme which he, being moſt abſent both in underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and feeling, had lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but had now underſtood that he had received. But hee lookt with as great indignation upon me, as I had beene his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall enemy; and with an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ſudden freedome of language, adviſed mee, that if I purpoſed to continue his friend, I ſhould forbeare ſuch talke to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But I all aſtonied and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, put off the diſcloſing of my private commotions, till hee ſhould grow well againe, and had recovered ſo much ſtrength of health, that hee were fit for me to deale with as I would my ſelfe. But he was taken away from my phrenzie, that with thee hee might bee preſerved for my future comfort; falling in my abſence a few dayes after into a relapſe of his Feaver, and was
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:402:89"/>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:402:101"/>
then I ſo much as knew not by face, but upon love to the man meerely for the fame of his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which was eminent in him, and ſome words of his that I had heard, which very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me? But rather did he pleaſe me, for that they pleaſed others, who highly extold him, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting much that a <hi>Syrian</hi> borne, brought up firſt in the <hi>Greeke</hi> Eloquence, ſhould afterwards prove ſo wonderfull a maſter in the <hi>Latine</hi> alſo: being above all this, a moſt knowing man in all the ſtudies that pertaine unto <hi>Wiſdome.</hi> A man is commended, and loved even when hee is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Doth then this love enter the heart of the hearer immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the mouth of the prayſer? Nothing ſo. But by one lover is another inflamed. Hence comes it that hee is oft loved, who is heard commended, when (namely) his worth is beleeved to be truely ſet forth by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feined
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:402:102"/>
heart of the commender; that is, when he that loves him, prayſes him. Thus then loved I men, upon the judgement of men, but not upon thine, O my God, in which no man is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But yet why not as that noble Chariotier or Huntſman, ſo famouſly ſpoken of by our vulgar affections? no, but farre otherwiſe and more ſeriouſly; and even ſo as I would deſire to be my ſelfe commended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For I would by no meanes have my ſelfe or commended or lov'd, in that kinde that <hi>Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>players</hi> are, (though I my ſelfe did ſometimes both commend and love them) but I would chooſe rather to have liv'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, than to be knowne that way; and to be hated, than in that kinde to be beloved. Where now are theſe overſwayings of ſuch various and divers kinds of loves diſtributed in one ſoule? what is it that I am in love with
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:402:102"/>
in another man? And what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine is it, that did I not hate him for, I ſhould not deteſt and keepe him out of my company, ſeeing wee are men either of us? For the compariſon holds not, that as a <hi>good horſe</hi> is loved by him, who would not yet be that horſe, no not though he might; the ſame ſhould likewiſe be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of a <hi>Stage-player,</hi> who is a fellow in nature with us. Doe I therefore love that in a man, which I hate to be, ſeeing I am a man? Man is a great deepe, whoſe very <hi>hayres thou numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi> O Lord, <hi>and they fall not</hi>

up and downe with every wind, but I was governed by thee very ſecretly. And how now ſhall I know, and how may I upon a ſure ground confeſſe unto thee, that I loved that man more for the love of them that commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, than for the good parts themſelves for which hee was commended? Becauſe if the ſelfe ſame men ſhould not have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayſed him whom they before had prayſed, and by diſprayſing and deſpiſing him had they not told the ſame things of him, I ſhould never have been ſo kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled and provoked to love him.</p>

any thing obſcurely, hee ſhould be put to it to expound it; or to diſcuſſe ſome of the harder que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; ſo that ſpending away his time about this worke, hee could not turne over ſo many Volumes as he deſired: although peradventure the preſerving of his voice (which a little ſpeaking would weaken) might bee a juſt reaſon for his reading to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

For when as one day I ſate in my accuſtomed place, with my ſchollers before me, in came he, ſaluted me, ſate him downe, and applyed his minde to what I then handled. I had by chance a paſſage then in hand, which that I might the better illuſtrate, it ſeemed very ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me to make uſe of a <hi>ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude</hi> borrowed from the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſian races;</hi> both to make that which I infinuated more pleaſant and more plaine, and to give a biting quippe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, at thoſe whom that madnes had enthralled.

that I little thought at that time of curing <hi>Alipius</hi> of that peſſilence. But hee tooke it to himſelfe; and conceived that I meerely intended it towards him. And what another man would have made an occaſion of being angry with mee, that good yong man made a reaſon of being offended at himſelfe, and to love me the more fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

That by no meanes could wee enjoy ſo much undiſtracted lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as to live together in the love of Wiſedome (as wee long ſince had deſired) ſhould I take that courſe. For he himſelfe was ſo chaſte that way, that it was a wonder to ſee: for he had made tryall of that Act in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his youth; but having not ingaged himſelfe by it, hee was ſorry for it rather, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed it; living from that time untill this preſent, moſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently.

For when as hee much admired at me, (whom he ſlightly eſteemed not of) for ſticking ſo faſt in the birdlime of that pleaſure, as reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to affirme, (ſo oft as wee had ſpeech about it) that I could by no meanes lead a ſingle life: and that I uſed this for an argument,

amazed at my thraldome; and out of that amazement, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to an itch of trying: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough to have come to the experience of it, and from the bare experience, to fall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance into that bondage hee in me ſo much admired at; ſeeing he was ſo willing to enter into <hi>a Covenant with death:</hi> for <hi>He that loves danger, ſhall fall into it.</hi> For the conjugall honour (if any there be) in the office of well ordering the duties of a married life, and of having of children, moved us but little.

yea, the houres; nay, the very leaſt particles of the houres, that both of them were brought to bed at the ſame inſtant; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that both of them were conſtrained to allow the very ſelfe-ſame conſtellations, even to the very ſame <hi>minutes,</hi> he for his ſonnes birth, and the other for his little ſervant.

Either therefore cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption does at all no hurt (which cannot be;) or, which is moſt certaine, all which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, is deptived of its good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:402:201"/>
For if they ſhall ſtill <hi>bee,</hi> and ſhall not bee at all corrupted, they ſhall thereby become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe they remaine ever incorruptibly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What more abſurd now, than to affirme thoſe things that have loſt all their goodneſſe, to be made the better by it? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whenever they ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all their <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> they ſhall alſo loſe all their <hi>being.</hi> So long therefore as they <hi>are,</hi> they are <hi>good:</hi> therefore whatſoever <hi>are,</hi> are <hi>good.</hi> That <hi>Evill</hi> then which I ſought, whence it ſhould be, is not any ſubſtance: for were it a ſubſtance, it ſhould be good. For either it ſhould be an <hi>incorruptible</hi> ſubſtance, that is to ſay, of the chiefe ſorts of <hi>good;</hi> or elſe ſhould it bee ſome <hi>corruptible</hi> ſubſtance; which unleſſe it were ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good, it could not be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:402:201"/>
that all things are good which thou haſt made: nor is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſubſtance at all, which thou haſt not made.

my intentions from behinde my back, where I had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore onely placed them, when as I had no liſt to obſerve mine owne ſelfe: and thou now ſetſt mee before mine owne face, that I might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne how filthy, and how crooked, and ſordide, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted, and ulcerous, I was. And I beheld and abhorred my ſelfe, nor could I finde any place whither to flee from my ſelfe. And if I went about to turne mine eye from off my ſelfe, yet did that tell mee as much, as <hi>Potitianus</hi> erſt had done; and thou thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on oppoſedſt my ſelfe unto my ſelfe, and thruſtedſt mee ever and anon into mine owne eyes, to make mee finde at laſt mine owne iniquity, and to loath it. I had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken notice of it; but I had againe diſſembled it, winckt at it, and forgotten it. But
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:402:235"/>
at this time, how much the more ardently I loved thoſe two, whoſe wholſome purpoſes I heard tell of, even for that they had reſigned up themſelves unto thee to be cured: ſo much the more deteſtably did I hate my ſelfe in compariſon of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had already loſt ſo many yeares, (twelve or thereabouts) ſince that <hi>nineteenth</hi> of mine age, when upon the reading of <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's Hortenſius,</hi> I was firſt ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to the ſtudy of <hi>Wiſdome;</hi> ſince when (having firſt deſpiſed all earthly felicity) I too long delaied to ſearch out that, whoſe not finding alone, but the bare ſeeking, ought to have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all the treaſures and Kingdomes of this world already found, and before all the pleaſures of the body, though in all abundance to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rais'd up againſt mine owne ſoule, in our Chamber, my heart; all over troubled both in minde and countenance, upon <hi>Alipius</hi> I ſet, with open mouth crying out, What tarry we any longer? what is this? what heardeſt thou even now? The unlearned of the world ſtart up and take the Kingdome by violence, and wee with all our learning wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heart, ſee how wee wallow us in fleſh and blood. Becauſe others are gone before, is it a ſhame for us to come after? or is it not rather a great ſhame not at all to goe after them? Some ſuch words as theſe I then utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but what I know not: and in that heate away I flung from him, while with ſilence and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment, hee wiſely lookt upon mee. For my ſpeeches ſounded not now, in the kay they were wont to doe: yea my forehead, my cheekes, my eies,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:402:237"/>
my colour, and the accent of my voyce, ſpake out my mind more emphatically, than the words did which I uttered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Garden there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to our lodging, which we had the liberty of, as well as of any other part of the houſe; for the maſter of the houſe our hoaſt, lived not there: Thither had the tempeſt within my breſt now hurried me, where no man might come to <hi>non-ſuit</hi> that firy action which I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered againſt my ſelfe, untill it came to a good <hi>iſſue;</hi> but which way, God thou knoweſt, I doe not. Onely I was for the time moſt ſoberly madde, and I dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vitally; ſenſible enough what piece of miſery for the preſent I now was, but utterly ignorant, how good I ſhortly was to grow. Into that Garden went I, and <hi>Alipius</hi> followed mee foot by foot: for I had no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret retiring place if hee were
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:402:238"/>
neere; or when did he ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, when he perceiv'd me to be ill diſpoſed. Downe wee ſate us; as farre yet from the houſe as poſſibly we could. I fretted in the ſpirit, angry at my ſelfe with a moſt tempeſtuous indignation for that I went not about to make my peace and league with thee my God, which all my bones cryed out upon me to doe, extolling it to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry skies. A buſineſſe it is which we goe not about, carried unto in Shippes, or Chariots, or upon our own legges, no not ſo ſmall a part of the way to it, as I had comen from the houſe, into that place, where wee were now ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For, not to goe towards onely, but to arrive fully at that place, required no more but the <hi>Will to goe</hi> to it, but yet to <hi>Will</hi> it reſolutely and throughly; not to ſtagger and tumble downe an halfe wounded <hi>Will,</hi> now on
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:402:238"/>
this ſide, and anon on that ſide; ſetting the part advancing it ſelfe, to ſtruggle with another part that is a falling. Finally, in theſe vehement paſſions of my delay, many of thoſe things performed I with my body, which men ſometimes would doe, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; if either they have not the limbs to doe them withall; or if thoſe limbs bee bound with cords, weakened with infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or be any other waies hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If I teare my ſelfe by the haire, beate my forehead, if loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my fingers one within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, I beclaſped my knee; all this I <hi>did</hi> becauſe I <hi>would.</hi> But I might have <hi>willed</hi> it, and yet not have <hi>done</hi> it, if ſo be the motion of my limbs, had not beene pliable enough to have performed it. So many things therefore I now did, at ſuch time as the <hi>Will</hi> was not all one with the <hi>Power;</hi> and ſomething on the other ſide I

then did not, which did incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more affect mee with pleaſure, which yet ſo ſoone as I had the <hi>Will</hi> to doe, I had the <hi>Power</hi> alſo; becauſe ſo ſoone as ever I <hi>willed,</hi> I <hi>willed</hi> it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for at ſuch a time the <hi>Power</hi> is all one with the <hi>Will;</hi> and the <hi>willing</hi> is now the <hi>doing:</hi> and yet was not the thing <hi>done.</hi> And more eaſily did my body obey the weakeſt <hi>willing</hi> of my ſoules in the moving of its limbs at her beck; then my ſoule had obeyed its ſelfe in this point of her great contentment, which was to receive perfection in the <hi>Will</hi> alone.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

converted to the truth, and no more deny, that in the Act of one mans deliberation, there is <hi>one ſoule</hi> deſtracted betweene <hi>two</hi> contrary <hi>Wills.</hi> Let them no more ſay therefore, that when as they perceive <hi>two wills</hi> to bee <hi>contrary</hi> one to another in the ſame party, that there bee <hi>two contrary ſoules,</hi> made of <hi>two contrary ſubſtances,</hi> from <hi>two contrary principles,</hi> one <hi>good,</hi> and the other <hi>bad, contending</hi> one with another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For thou, O true <hi>God,</hi> doeſt diſprove, check, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them; like as when both <hi>wills</hi> being <hi>bad,</hi> a man delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with himſelfe, whether he ſhould kill a man by poyſon, or by the Sword? whether hee ſhould <hi>take in</hi> this piece, or that, of another mans ground; when as he cannot doe both? whether hee ſhould purchaſe pleaſure, with prodigality, or keepe cloſe his money, by covetouſneſſe?
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:402:243"/>
whether hee ſhould goe to the <hi>Chariot-race,</hi> or to the <hi>Sword-playes,</hi> if they were both to be ſeene upon one day? I adde alſo a third inſtance; whether hee ſhould rob another mans houſe, had he the opportunity? and a fourth I add, or whether he ſhold commit adultery, had hee the meanes? it being preſuppoſed, that all theſe concurred in the ſame inſtant of time, and that all theſe acts bee equally deſired, which cannot poſſibly be all at one time acted.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

Thus alſo is it in ſuch <hi>Wils</hi> as are <hi>good.</hi> For I demand of <hi>them,</hi> whether it be a good thing to be delighted
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:402:243"/>
in reading of the <hi>Apoſtle?</hi> and, whether it be a good mind to be delighted in a ſober <hi>Pſalme?</hi> or, whether it be a good art to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the <hi>Goſpell?</hi> They will anſwere to each of theſe, <hi>That it is good.</hi> What now if all theſe equally delight us, and all together at the ſame time?

SO ſoone therefore as a deepe conſideration even from the ſecret bottome of my ſoule, had drawne together and laid all my miſery upon one heape before the eyes of my heart; there roſe up a mighty ſtorme, bringing as mighty a ſhowre of teares with it, which that I might powre forth with ſuch expreſſions as ſuted beſt with them, I roſe from <hi>Alipius:</hi> for I conceived that ſolitarineſſe was more fit for a buſineſſe of weeping. So farre off then I went, as that his preſence might not be troubleſome unto mee. Thus diſpoſed was I at that
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:402:247"/>
time, and he thought, I know not what, of it; ſomething I beleeve, I had ſaid before, which diſcovered the ſound of my voyce to be bigge with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and in that caſe I roſe from him. He thereupon ſtaid alone where wee ſate together moſt extremely aſtoniſhed. I ſlung downe my ſelfe I know not how, under a certaine Fig-tree, giving all liberty to my teares: whereupon the floods of mine eyes guſhed out, an acceptable acceptable ſacrifice to thee, O Lord. And though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance in theſe very words, yet much to this purpoſe, ſaid I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; And thou, O LORD, how long? how long Lord wilt thou bee angry, for ever? Remember not our former ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities: for I found my ſelfe to be ſtill enthralled by them. Yea, I ſent up theſe miſerable excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, How long? how long? ſtill to morrow, and to morrow?
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:402:248"/>
Why not now? wherefore even this very houre is there not an end put to my uncleanneſſe?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus much I uttered, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping among in the moſt bitter contrition of my heart: when as behold, I heard a voyce from ſome neighbour houſe, as it had beene of a Boy or Girle I know not whether, in a ſinging tune ſaying, and often repeating, TAKE VP AND READE, TAKE VP AND READE. <note place="margin">His conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by a voyce from Heaven.</note> Inſtantly changing my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thereupon, I beganne ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heedfully to bethinke my ſelfe, whether children were wont in any kinde of playing to ſing any ſuch words: nor could I remember my ſelfe ever to have heard the like. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon refraining the violent tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of my teares, up I gat mee; interpreting it no other way, but that I was from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe commanded, To open the booke, and to read that Chapter

which I ſhould firſt light upon.

I ſnatcht it up, I opened it, and in ſilence I read that Chapter which I firſt caſt mine eyes upon: <hi>Not in rioting and drunkenneſſe, not in chambering and wantonneſſe, not in ſtrife and envying: But put ye on the Lord Ieſus Christ; and make not proviſion for the</hi>

Shutting up the booke thereupon, and putting my finger betweene, or I know not what other marke, with a well quieted countenance I diſcovered all this unto <hi>Alipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And he againe in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner revealed unto me, what alſo was wrought in his heart, which I verily knew nothing of.

and unto that good reſolution and purpoſe (which was moſt agreeable to his diſpoſition, wherein he did alwaies very far differ from mee, to the better) without all turbulent delaying did he now apply himſelfe. From thence went we into the houſe unto my mother; we diſcover our ſelves, ſhe rejoyces for it: we declare in order how every thing was done: ſhe leapes for joy, and triumpheth, and bleſſeth thee, <hi>who art able to doe above that which wee aske or thinke;</hi> For that ſhe perceived thee to have given her more concerning me, than ſhe was wont to beg by her pittifull and moſt dolefull groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.

               <p n="1">1. VVHich is not to bee wondered at, if meant of the body; for the minde is one thing, and the body another. If I therefore with ioy remember ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed paine of body, 'tis not ſo ſtrange a thing. But now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Minde</hi> is the very ſame which the <hi>memory,</hi> (for that when we giue command to haue a thing kept in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we ſay; <hi>Looke to it, that you heare this well in mind:</hi> and ſo, when we forget a thing, wee ſay; <hi>It was in my mind euen now,</hi> and, <hi>'tis quite ſlipt out of my minde,</hi> calling the <hi>memory</hi> the <hi>minde:)</hi> ſeeing therefore ſo it is, how comes this to paſſe,
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:402:314"/>
that when in a cheerfull veyn I remember a ſad paſſage, my minde thinking vpon ioy, and my memory at the ſame time vpon ſadneſſe: my mind vpon the ioyfulneſſe it conceiues, is full of ioy, and yet my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory vpon the ſadneſſe that is in it, is not ſad; does not the memory perchance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto the minde? Who will ſay ſo? Doubtleſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>memory</hi> is as it were the <hi>belly</hi> of the <hi>mind;</hi> and <hi>ioy</hi> and <hi>ſadneſſe,</hi> like ſweete and ſowre <hi>meate,</hi> which when they are committed vnto the <hi>memory,</hi> bee as it were paſſed away into the <hi>belly;</hi> where ſtowage they may haue, but <hi>taſte</hi> none at all. Ridiculous it is to imagine theſe to be alike; and yet are they not vtterly vnlike.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But behold, this alſo bring I out of my memory. whenas I ſay there bee foure

perturbations of the minde, <hi>deſire, ioy, feare,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow:</hi> and how farre ſoeuer I am able to diſpute vpon theſe <hi>heads,</hi> both by <hi>deuiding</hi> the <hi>whole,</hi> each into his <hi>parts,</hi> and by <hi>defyning:</hi> in my memory finde I what to ſay, and out of my memory doe I bring it: yet am I not moued for all this, with any of theſe <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations,</hi> whenas by calling them to minde, I doe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them; yea, and before I recalled and meditated them ouer, n my memory they were, and therefore by calling to mind might they very well be fetcht from thence.

For I demand of euery man, whether they had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the truth, or in the falſehood? They will as little doubt to ſay, <hi>In the truth,</hi> as they would to ſay, <hi>that they deſire to be happy: For a happy life is a ioying in the truth:</hi> For this is a ioying in thee, who art the truth, O God my light, the health of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and my God.

that would deceiue, but not a man that would willingly be deceiued. Where therefore gaynd they the knowledge of this happy life, but euen there, where they learned the truth alſo? yea verily they loue this truth, for that they would not be deceiued: &amp; whenas they loue a happy life (which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a ioying in the truth) then alſo doe they loue the truth: which yet they would not loue, were there not ſome notice of it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their memory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherefore then ioy they not in it? why are they not bleſſed? euen becauſe they are more ſtrongly taken vp with other things which haue more power to make them miſerable, then that hath to make them happy, which they remember ſo little of. For there is a dimme glimmering of light yet vn-put-out, in

                  </q> who, becauſe they would not willingly bee deceiued, would not therefore be conuinced of a falſehood? Therefore doe they hate the truth, for the ſame reaſon, which they loue inſtead of the truth.</p>
               <p>They loue truth when it enlightens them, but they hate it when it reprehends them. For becauſe they would not willingly bee deceiued, and

For the
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:402:387"/>
paſſed, is not now; and the future, is not yet. Let vs not therefore ſay, It is long; but of the paſt time let vs ſay, It hath beene long; and of the time to come, It will bee long. O Lord my God, my light, ſhall not thy truth laugh at man for this? For what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed time hath beene long? when it was already paſſed, hath it beene long, or when it was yet preſent? For then was it in beſt poſſibility to be long, when that was in preſent being, which ſhould bee long. As for the paſſed time, it was now no longer; wherefore had that no poſſibility to bee long, which had at all no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Let vs not therefore ſay, Time paſſed hath beene long: for wee ſhall neuer finde, what hath beene long, ſeeing that euer ſince it was paſt, it is no more. But let vs ſay, That preſent time
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:402:387"/>
hath beene long: becauſe, when it was preſent, then was it long. For hauing not hitherto paſſed away, that ſo it could not bee; euen therefore had it ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent beeing, as was in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to haue beene long: whereas after it was once paſt, that terme at once ceaſed to be long, which ceaſed to be at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let vs ſee therfore, O thou ſoule of man, whether yet the <hi>preſent</hi> time may be long: For to thee it is giuen to be ſenſible of the diſtances of time, and to meaſure them. What now wilt thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me? Are an hundred yeeres in preſent, a long time? See firſt, whether an hundred yeeres may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or no. For if the firſt of theſe yeeres bee now a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; that one is preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, but the other nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:402:388"/>
and nine bee to come, and therefore are not yet. But if the ſecond yeere be now cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, then is one paſt already, another in preſent being, and all the reſt to come. And if we ſuppoſe, any middle yeere of this hundred to bee now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; all before it, are paſt, all after it, to come. Wherefore an hundred yeeres cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly bee preſent. See againe, whether that one which is now a running, bee now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; ſeeing that euen of that, if the firſt moneth bee now a running, then are all the reſt to come. If the ſecond, then is the firſt paſt, and the reſt not yet come on. Therefore, neyther is the yeere now a ſpending, all preſent together: and if it be not all preſent, then is not the yeere preſent. For twelue months are a yeere; of which that one now a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is preſent; all the reſt
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:402:388"/>
eyther paſt, or to come. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though neither is that moneth now a running, preſent; but one day of it onely: if the firſt, the reſt are to come; if the laſt, the reſt are paſt: if any of the middle, then is that betweene the paſt and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. See how the preſent time, (which onely we found meete to bee called long) is now abridged to the length ſcarce of one day. But let vs examine that alſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſo much as one day is wholy preſent. For foure and twenty houres of night and day, doe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make it vp: of which, the firſt hath the reſt to come; the laſt hath them paſſed: and any of the middle ones hath thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, already paſt, thoſe behinde it, yet to come; yea, that one houre is waſted out,
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:402:389"/>
in ſtill-vaniſhing minutes. How much ſoeuer of it is flowne away, is paſt; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer remaynes behinde, is to come. If any inſtant of time be conceiued, which cannot bee deuided eyther into none, or at moſt into the ſmalleſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of moments; that is the onely <hi>it,</hi> which may bee called preſent; which little yet flies with ſuch full ſpeede from the future to the paſſed; as that it is not lengthened out with the very leaſt ſtay. For leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened out if it bee, then is it deuided into the paſt and the future. As for the preſent, it takes not vp any ſpace: where then is the Time, which wee may call long? Is it to come? Surely we do not ſay, that that is long; becauſe that of it is not yet come which may be long: but ſay, <hi>It will be long.</hi> When therefore will it bee? For if euen then, ſeeing that is yet
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:402:389"/>
to come; it ſhall not euen then be long; becauſe that of it which may bee long, ſhall not be yet come. But if it ſhall onely then bee long, when from a time to come (which is not yet) it ſhall begin now to be; and ſhall be made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that ſo it may now bee, that which may be long; then does the preſent time cry out in the words aboue rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>That it ſelfe can neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come long.</hi>

Which way ſoeuer therefore this ſecrete <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceyuing</hi> of things to come be held to be; nothing ſurely can bee ſeene, but that which now is in being. As for that which now is, it is not future,
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:402:392"/>
but preſent. Wheneuer there fore things to come are ſayd to bee ſeene, tis not the things themſelues which as yet are not; that is, which are to come hereafter; but the cauſes per chance, or the fignes of them which are ſeene: and thoſe are indeede now in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Future</hi> therefore they are not but <hi>preſent</hi> vnto the Seers: out of which theſe Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things <hi>fore conceyued</hi> in the minde, are foretold.

               <p n="3">3. Let now the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous variety of things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce mee ſome example. I looke vpon the <hi>day breaking,</hi> and I fore ſhew vpon it, <hi>that the Sunne is about to riſe.</hi> That which I looke vpon,
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:402:393"/>
is preſent that which I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignifie, is to come: not the Sunne, I meane, which already is; but the Sunn-riſing which is not yet. And yet if I did not in my minde imagine the Sun-riſing it ſelfe, (as now I doe, whileſt I ſpeake of it) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer could I foretell it. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that <hi>Break of day</hi> which I diſcerne in the skie, the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſing, notwithſtanding it goes before it; no nor that Imagination of my minde ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which two are ſeene now in <hi>preſent,</hi> that the other may bee foretold to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hereafter. <hi>Future</hi> things therefore are not yet: and if yet they be not, at all they are not: and if ſo they bee not; poſſible to bee ſeene, they are not: yet foretold they may bee by ſomethings <note n="a" place="margin">Signes, Cauſes, or fore-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: as before hee ſayd.</note>

               <p n="1">1. I Heard a learned man once deliuer it, <hi>That the motions of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, and not the yeeres, were the very true Times.</hi> But why then ſhould not the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all bodies in generall rather be times? But what if the <hi>lights of heauen</hi> ſhould ceaſe, and the <hi>potters wheele</hi> run round; ſhould there bee no time by which wee might meaſure thoſe whirlings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: and might pronounce of it; that eyther it moued with equall pauſes: or, if it turn'd ſometimes flower, and other whiles quicker, that ſome rounds tooke vp longer time, and other ſhorter? or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen whileſt we were a ſaying
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:402:398"/>
this ſhould wee ſpeake in Time? or, ſhould there in our words be any ſyllables ſhort, and others long, but for this reaſon onely; that thoſe tooke vp a ſhorter time in founding, and theſe a longer. Graunt vnto vs men the skill; O God, in a little hint to deſcry thoſe notions, as be common to things both great and ſmall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſtarres and lights of heauen, 'tis true, bee appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note n="a" place="margin">Gen 1. 14 This hee tranſlates, <hi>There are alſo Starres and lights in ſignes &amp; in ſeaſons, and in yeeres, &amp;c</hi>

                  <hi>wheele</hi> to bee the day; nor though it were not, that therefore (on the other ſide) there were no time at all, let <hi>Him</hi> affirme eyther of theſe: I for my part, deſire to vnderſtand the force and nature of time, by which we
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:402:398"/>
are to meaſure the motions of bodies; as when wee ſay, (for example) this motion to bee twice longer then that. For I demand, Seing this is it w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is called the day; not the ſtay onely of the <hi>Sunne</hi> vpon the earth, (according to which account the day is one thing, and the night another;) but its whole circuit that it runnes from Eaſt to Eaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; according to which account wee ſay, <hi>There are ſo many dayes paſſed:</hi> becauſe that the dayes being reckoned with their nights, are vſually called <hi>So many dayes,</hi> and that the nights are not to be out of the reckoning. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a day is made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete by the motion of the Sunne, and by his circuit from Eaſt to Eaſt againe; I thereupon demaund, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee the motion that makes the day; or the ſtay
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:402:399"/>
in which that motion is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or both? For if the firſt be the day; then ſhould wee haue a day of it, although the Sunne ſhould finiſh that courſe of his in ſo ſmall a ſpace of time, as one houre comes to. If the ſecond, then ſhould not that make a day, if betweene one Sun-riſe and another, there were but ſo ſhort a ſtay, as one houre comes to; but the Sunne muſt goe foure and twenty times about, for the making vp of one day. If both, then could not this neyther bee called a day, if the Sunne ſhould runne this whole round in the ſpace of one houre: no nor that; if while the ſunne ſtood ſtill, ſo much time ſhould ouer paſſe, as the Sun vſually makes his whole courſe in, from morning to morning.</p>

                  <pb n="783" facs="tcp:402:399"/>
3. I will not therefore demand now, what that ſhould bee which is called day: but, what Time ſhould bee: by which wee meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the circuite of the Sunne, ſhould ſay that hee had then finiſht it in halfe the time hee was wont to doe; if ſo bee hee had gone it ouer in ſo ſmall a ſpace, as twelue houres come to: and when vpon comparing of both times together, wee ſhould ſay, that this is but a ſingle time, and that a double time; notwithſtanding that the Sun ſhould runne his round from eaſt to eaſt, ſometimes in that ſingle time, and other ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in that double time. Let no man therefore ſay vnto mee hereafter, That <hi>the motions of the celeſtiall bodies bee the Times;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that when at the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">Ioſua. 11.</note> of a certaine man, the

The Sunne ſtood ſtill indeede, but the time went on: for in a certaine ſpace of time of his owne, (enough to ſerue his turne) was that battell ſtrucken and gotten. I perceiue time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>to bee a certaine ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> But doe I perceiue it indeede, or doe I but ſeeme to my ſelfe to perceiue it?

No, thou doeſt not bid mee. For there is no body (that I heare of) moued, but in time. This thou ſayeſt: but that the motion of a body ſhould bee time, I neuer did heare: nor doeſt thou ſay it. For when a body is moued, I by Time then meaſure, How long it may haue moued, from the inſtant it firſt beganne to moue, vntill it left mouing? And if ſo bee I did not ſee the inſtant it beganne in; and if it continues to moue ſo long, as I cannot ſee when it ends; I am not then able to meaſure more of it, but onely perchance, from that inſtant I firſt ſaw it beginne, vntill I my ſelfe leaue meaſuring. And if I looke long vpon it; I can onely ſignifie it to bee a long time, but not how long: becauſe when wee
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:402:401"/>
pronounce how long, wee muſt doe it by compariſon; as for example, This is as long as that, or this twice ſo long as that, or the like. But were wee able to make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the diſtances of thoſe places, whence, and whither a body or his parts goe, which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; (as if ſuppoſe it were moued in a Turne) then might wee preciſely ſay, how much time the motion of that body or his part, from this place vnto that, was finiſhed in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seeing therefore the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a body is one thing, and that by which we meaſure how long it is, another thing; who cannot now iudge, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> of the two is rather to bee called <hi>time?</hi> For and if a body bee ſometimes moued vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, and ſtands ſtill other

This voyce, before it ſounded, was to come, and ſo could not then bee meaſured, becauſe as yet it was not, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iuſt now can it, becauſe

But yet euen then made it no ſtay; for onward ſtill it went, and paſt at length quite away. Might it then be meaſured the rather, for that? By this paſſing on therefore, was it ſtretched out into ſome ſpace of time, by which it might bee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured; becauſe the preſent hath no ſpace.

2. Let vs meaſure it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and tell how much it is. But it ſounds ſtill; nor can it be meaſured but from the inſtant it beganne in, vnto the end it left in. For the very <hi>ſpace betweene,</hi> is the thing wee meaſure, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from ſome beginning, vnto ſome end. For which reaſon, a voyce that is not yet ended, cannot be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as that it may bee ſayd how long, or ſhort it is; nor can it bee called equall to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or double to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, or the like: and ſo ſoone (againe) as it is en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, it ſhall bee no more. How may it then bee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured? Wee meaſure times, for all this; and yet neyther thoſe, which are not yet come; nor yet thoſe which are now no longer; nor yet thoſe, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are not lengthened out by ſome pawſe; nor yet

               <p n="3">3. O God All creator! this <hi>verſe</hi> of eyght ſyllables, interchangeably varies it ſelfe between ſhort and long ſyllables. Foure therefore be ſhort, namely the firſt, third, fifth, and ſeuenth: which bee but ſingle, in reſpect of the foure long, namely the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, fourth, ſixth, and eighth. Euery one of theſe, to euery one of thoſe, hath a double time: I pronounce them ouer and ouer; and euen ſo I finde it, as playnely as ſence can ſhew it. So farre as Sence can manifeſt it, I meaſure a long ſyllable by a ſhort, and I ſencibly finde it to haue twice ſo much: but now when one ſounds after
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:402:406"/>
another, if the former bee ſhort, and the latter long, how ſhall I then hold faſt the ſhort one; and how in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the long, ſhall I ſo lay them together, as that I may find this to haue twice ſo much as that; ſeeing the long cannot begin to ſound, vnleſſe the ſhort leaues ſounding? yea, that long one it ſelfe do I meaſure as not preſent, ſeeing I meaſure it not till it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Now his ending is his paſſing away. What is it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I meaſure? where is that ſhort ſyllable <note n="a" place="margin">I reade it <hi>quâ</hi> in ſteade of <hi>quam.</hi>
                  </note> by which I meaſure? where is that long one which I am to meaſure. They haue ſounded vp their ſound, they are both flowne, and gone; they are now no more, and yet doe I meaſure them? Yes; and confidently do I anſwer (ſo farre as a man may truſt a well-experienced <note n="b" place="margin">

               <p n="4">4 Tis not therefore theſe voyces (which now are not) that I meaſure: but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing it is euen in mine own memory, which there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes faſtned.
