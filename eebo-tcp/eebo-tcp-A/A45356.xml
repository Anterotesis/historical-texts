            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:42066:3"/>
yet by reaſon of that firm bold Sin and the Devil have upon his mind, he acts in Repugnancy to his Faith, and frames wrong notions of God and Religion, and if he may ſleep ſecurely in thoſe ſins he moſt delights in, he is well contented and at eaſe. And to reduce both theſe ſorts of Perſons to a ſober and fixed Love of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to the Proſecution of whatever is virtuous and excellent, that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity might not be an idle and fruitleſs Notion, but an inward Principle of Life, daily perfecting the Souls of Men, till it bring them to their higheſt and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Happineſs, is the Aim and only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this preſent Diſcourſe.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eligion in its uſual and obvious ſenſe is a Devoting ourſelves to the Worſhip and Service of the Deity. For God, when he firſt made Man, wrote this Truth on his heart, That he was a Creature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to ſomething without him for his Life and Being, and therefore ought to worſhip and adore God as his only Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and by whoſe ever-preſent Power he is as it were daily created anew, and kept and preſerved in Being. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42066:4"/>
there is no man who ſearches into the Perfections of Human Nature, that can find any Principle or Power in Man of conſerving and maintaining his own Exiſtence; wherefore his Exiſtence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn through all the parts of time (which have no Connexion or Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence one upon another) by ſome other more perfect Eſſence, he muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily acknowledge that to be ſelf-exiſtent and ſufficient, and conſequently adore it as the Author and Conſervator of his preſent and particular Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it is that Religion is not a thing which is merely inſtilled into us by Inſtruction and Education: For let us be never ſo impiouſly diligent in raſing the venerable Name of the Deity out of his Temple, and blotting his Inſcription out of our Souls, 'tis manifeſt to all, that we can never totally rid our Minds of the Apprehenſions and Fears of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <hi>Numen:</hi> And that ſome men have ſo far debauched their Minds, and ſtifled the Sentiments of Reaſon, that they can ſwallow down the groſſeſt Impieties, as Sacriledge, Rebellion, Murder, and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery without the leaſt Regret; proves no more that Religion is not a Principle of Nature, than it doth of the Non-exiſtence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42066:4"/>
of the Sun, that ſome men wilfully live in Darkneſs, and ſhut up themſelves, that they may not ſee his Beams; for 'tis evident, that ſuch Perſons have put themſelves into a preternatural State, and forced their Minds and Reaſons to a Conſtitution far different from the Univerſal Nature or Reaſon of Mankind. Nor can it be eluded by fancying Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be a piece of State-Policy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented only to keep People in awe, and for the better cementing Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments together, and ſo derived from one Generation to another by the Cuſtom and Example of their Progenitors. For if there were no ſuch Faculty inherent in us, and contemporary with our very Beings, which had a Natural Propenſity and Inclination to a Religious Veneration and Worſhip, it could not be but that in time Nature would return and caſt off whatever is contrary to it. As a Spring has always a <hi>Conatus</hi> to unbend it ſelf, and if at any time the Impediment be removed, will infallibly reduce itſelf to its proper ſtate; So our Faculties, though they may be long diſtorted and forced out of their due Poſition, yet they have ſtill an Endeavour to free themſelves and caſt off that uneaſie Load which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42066:5"/>
and oppreſſes them, and will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly upon any due occaſion offered return to their firſt and true ſtate. And if there were no ſuch Being as God, the wiſer Ages of the World would ſoon diſcover the Falſhood and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and chalk out a fair Way and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for the Natures of men to recover from that Error and Prejudice they lay under, and by their own genuine Effort and Strength reaſſert themſelves into their ancient Liberty. But beſides this, the Peace and Tranquillity of Kingdoms and States Politick might ſufficiently be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved without the invention of Religion, by ſevere Laws and Penalties. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were no immaterial Being in the World, yet every Perſon being ſo well ſatisfied with himſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the exerciſe of thoſe Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he finds in himſelf, no man would ſeek his own Ruine and Torment; and therefore there would be little or no need of inſtilling into the minds of men ſuch a Notion as Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the firſt Times and Ages of the World, the Law of Nature, which God hath equally implanted in all men (and by which I mean nothing but Reaſon, or that Power in man which teaches him
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42066:5"/>
to diſtinguiſh and put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Good and Evil, Beauty and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, Purity and Impurity) was the only Rule and Guide to direct them, and by the help of this they knew God and ſerved him. For God being in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an infinite Rectitude and Perfection, delineated himſelf and copied out his own Nature in all moral Agents ſo far as they were capable of receiving it. And herein God left not himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witneſs, in that all Mankind had Means and Helps ſufficient to come to the knowledge of a Deity by an inſpection into the Book of Nature, wherein God has diſplaid himſelf in plain and legible Characters, ſo that they were wholly without excuſe. For if the Law written in their hearts and diſcriminating between Good and Evil, together with the obvious Reflections from the Natures and Proprieties of things, had not been enough to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and point out the Exiſtence of a God, men could not have been account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, nor rendred obnoxious to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But although this Law ſealed on the Tables of mens Hearts were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to teach them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that which might be known of God, if they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42066:6"/>
would have given heed to it; yet in proceſs of time it ſo came to paſs, that through the Iniquity and Perverſneſs of mens minds, whereby they gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly up to their own Luſts and Paſſions, this Light of Nature became dull, faint, and obſcure, and men were governed only by the Dictates of their corrupt and lawleſs Wills, and the whole Earth was filled with Violence and Oppreſſion, and the greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind became ſo brutiſh in their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that they made themſelves Gods of Gold and Silver, Wood and Stone, and ſerved the Creature <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>beſide the Creator,</hi> who is God bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wherefore when this way proved unſerviceable and ineffectual for Mans Reſtauration, God entred upon a new Diſpenſation, and revealed himſelf more plainly to the Jews, chuſing <hi>Jacob</hi> for his Portion, and <hi>Iſrael for the Lot of his Inheritance,</hi> and communicated to them Laws and Statutes and Judgments, fencing and hedging in the impure Eruptions of their Natures by Judicial Decrees, and beſieging Vice and Iniquity by the actual Promulgation of a Law. But this Religion of the Jews lying altogether in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42066:6"/>
the Performance of external Duties, in Types and outward Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, was not able to perfect the Nature of Man, and bring him to that happy ſtate he was poſſeſſed of before his Fall, (for as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 17. the Kingdom of God conſiſts not in meat and drink, but (which is far more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) in true Righteouſneſs and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; and Man being a Man by his Soul, and not by his Body, it is plain, both that the Religion whoſe grand Purpoſe and Intent is to inſtruct and perfect the Mind, is much ſuperior to that which concerns the Body, and alſo that there is ſome degree of Perfection that the Nature of Man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of which is not attainable by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>) therefore it is neceſſary that there be ſome other way ſound out to recover all Mankind from that ſad and calamitous condition of Vice and Sin they now lie under. For we muſt know that the Soul of Man conſiſts of a perceptive and plaſtick Part, which is the ſame with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Wherefore when the fulneſs of time came, and mens minds were in ſome meaſure prepared for the reception of ſo heavenly a Doctrin, Almighty God reſolved to put in execution his laſt and moſt perfect Determination, which was to ſend down his beloved Son into the World, who ſhould by a plain and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar way teach and inſtruct Mankind, and recover the lapſed World to a ſtate of Righteouſneſs and Truth. Now then, God walks no more at a Diſtance, nor hides himſelf any longer under the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of Types and Shadows, but hath diſpelled the Clouds and Adumbrations of the legal Services, by the full and bright approach of the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who hath pitched his Tabernacle amongſt us, and teaches us his Will by a way of condeſcending Wiſdom, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and proportioning himſelf to the moſt ſhallow Capacities. This is that which the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 21. calls the <hi>Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of Preaching,</hi> wherein God hath ſtooped down to us, clothing himſelf in the frailties of human Nature, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42066:7"/>
adapting the reſults of his Will to our narrow and weak Apprehenſions. And this is that Oeconomy which in <hi>Dan.</hi> ix. 24. is called an <hi>everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> which the Meſſias ſhould bring into the world: For when the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="6">6.

               <p>THat the Goſpel is intelligible, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but appear to every one that is acquainted with it; for though there may be ſome things wrapped in Clouds and Difficulties, yet they are ſuch as do not ſo nearly relate to Practice, but are of a more ſpeculative Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But as for the whole Duty of Man in order to Holineſs, and a good and pious Life, it is laid down in ſuch eaſie and plain terms, that no man can have any reaſonable excuſe for himſelf, if he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42066:8"/>
do not know and practiſe the Will of God. For the Divine Wiſdom fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that the greater number of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers throughout the World would not be men of deep Reaſon, but rather of great Love and Faith, and ſuch as would cordially adhere to their Saviour againſt all Oppoſitions, though they could not ſyllogiſtically maintain the Reaſonableneſs of every part of the Doctrin they profeſſed; God, I ſay, foreſeeing this, hath ſuited the Goſpel to the meaneſt Capacity, and there needs no great Skill to be a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but rather an hearty and ſincere applying ourſelves to the Practice of what is ſo fully diſcovered to us. The Goodneſs of Almighty God is ſuch, that he conſiders the ſeveral States and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men in the World, and makes allowance for thoſe whom his Providence hath ſo placed, as that they are not in a capacity of attaining to any great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Knowledge, and accepts of the conſtant and ſincere Inclination and Bent of their Wills in practiſing what they know, and they ſhall never be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an account for what they had no opportunity of gaining. And although he that knows much and apprehends
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42066:9"/>
the Reaſons of things, and makes this Knowledge inſtrumental to the purifying and purging his Soul from Vice, be far more excellent than he whom Nature has made of a ſlower Apprehenſion, yet this man is in no wiſe contemptible, but dear and acceptable in the ſight of God, who never fails to reward honeſt Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Innocency, and to recompenſe every degree of hearty Love with a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proportion of Glory.</p>
               <p>But that we may ſee before our eyes the Plainneſs and Perſpicuity of the Goſpel in all matters that concern the Salvation and future Happineſs of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, we may take a brief Abſtract or Sum of our Duty, which is this;
<q>To love the Lord our God with all our hearts, and to have a firm and radica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Faith in his Goodneſs declared to the World by his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt; an univerſal Abſtinence from all Wrong and Injuſtice; a hearty Love and Good-will to all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; to hold faſt that which is Good, and to abſtain from all appearance of Evil; to be of a compaſſionate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Spirit, and if we have received an Injury, not to recompenſe it again in any kind; to abſtract and withdraw
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42066:9"/>
our hearts and minds from earthly Goods, and make Treaſures for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Heaven, and to be no more ſolicitous for worldly concernments than the Lilies of the field or the Fowls of the air, but that having food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therewith to be content; to keep ourſelves pure and undefiled, not only from outward and groſſer, but inward and more refined Pollutions; to be ready to do good and diſtribute to the Neceſſities of our Brethren; to live peaceably, if it be poſſible, with all men; In a word, whatever things are true, whatever things are honeſt, juſt, lovely, and of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any praiſe, to think on ſuch things.</q>
What can be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and eaſier than this? Nor is the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpel any derogation from it, though that impious Epicurean <hi>Celſus</hi> deride it upon that account, extolling the Writings of <hi>Plato</hi> above the Scriptures: For, as <hi>Origen</hi> acutely enough replies,<note place="margin">Lib. 7. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Celſum.</note> the Deſign of God in the Goſpel being to make men good and virtuous, it was neceſſary the Precepts tending to that end ſhould be delivered plainly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly, ſuitable to the Capacities of the illiterate Vulgar, who are better
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42066:10"/>
allured and won by a common and uſual form of Speech, than by the artificial Deckings and gay Schemes of Rhetorick: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And therefore Chriſt and his Apoſtles did much more advance that which was their chief aim, the Life and Nature of God in the World by that (as <hi>Celſus</hi> calls it) rude and ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal manner of ſpeaking, than all the elegant Writings of <hi>Plato,</hi> which if they ever were advantageous for the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and amending the Lives of men, it was only to ſuch whoſe Intellectual Faculties were raiſed and elevated above the Plebeian Strain. Therefore did the Holy Jeſus on purpoſe make choice of ignorant and illiterate Perſons, that it might appear that the things which they ſpake were not in the <hi>words which mans wiſdom teacheth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.13. &amp; 1.27.</note> but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, and that <hi>by the fooliſh things of the world God might confound the wiſe, and by the weak deſtroy the things that are mighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. But you will ſay, <hi>To what purpoſe is that Intricacy and Perplexity which is found in many Places of Holy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42066:10"/>
Scripture, and wherefore are many of the chiefeſt of its Doctrines involved in ſuch Darkneſs and Obſcurity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It was in ſome meaſure requiſite that the Scripture ſhould be obſcure to conciliate Reverence, and to beget a greater Eſteem of its Worth and Dignity. For the Goſpel is often called a Myſtery, which ſuppoſes ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing venerable and ſecret, and hidden from the eyes of vulgar Perſons. And God as in Nature, he hath hid many pretious things in the Bowels of the Earth, which cannot be obtained without great Labour and Diligence; in like manner hath he veiled many ineſtimable Treaſures in the Chriſtian Myſtery, which are only attainable by the diligent Search and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Endeavours of pious men: For ſhould the Divine Wiſdom have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played at once all the Glories and Beauty of this ſacred and recondite Method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Souls, it would appear contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible and worthleſs, as being the eaſie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of every profane and impious Perſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reaſon of the Obſcurity of Chriſtianity lies not ſo much in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing itſelf, as in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity of mens Minds and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings with ſo high and raiſed an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42066:11"/>
The Eye cannot behold the Sun unleſs it have ſome Reſemblance and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of it within itſelf; for like is known by its like, and if mens Minds be not purified and brought into ſome Cognation and Likeneſs with the Truths offered to them, it is impoſſible they ſhould ever have any true and genuine Apprehenſion of them. There is a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Knowing the Truth as it is in Jeſus, in that God-like, meek, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Spirit, and till mens Tempers be plain'd and ſmooth'd from the rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Paſſions, and the ſtubborn Aſperities of their Luſts, and won to the embracing of the Truth in the love of it, in that Chriſt-like Nature of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Self-Denial, they may fill their heads with ſapleſs and lean Notions, windy and turgent Fancies, but never nouriſh up their Souls with ſolid and ſubſtantial Knowledge. The true ſenſe of Religion and Chriſtianity ariſes out of a mind devoid of Paſſion, and in which the Life of God has taken deep root and flouriſhes and ſpreads itſelf throughout all the powers of the Soul, giving a tincture, reliſh and ſavour of itſelf to every Thought, Word, and Deed in the whole courſe of a mans Life. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42066:11"/>
this purified ſenſe, we feed upon nothing but the Husks and Shells of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and fall in love with Shadows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of laſting and durable Subſtances. And this is no more than what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks of itſelf. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> There is required a ſpiritual Senſe, a Life of Holineſs and Juſtice, of Benignity and Righteouſneſs, to the true diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Good and Evil. And further, to the Knowledge and Underſtanding of Divine Myſteries, there is neceſſarily required the Aid and Aſſiſtance of that Almighty and Omnipreſent Spirit, who by his foſtering Incubation brought into Being the goodly frame of Heaven and Earth, and that this Holy Spirit of Truth may begin the Efformation of the new and heavenly Nature (a conſiderable part of which is Divine and Spiritual Wiſdom) there muſt be ſome previous Preparations, and men muſt be morally good and virtuous, or elſe they will be perfectly incapable of the illapſe of his Celeſtial Influence. And therefore it is no marvel, if to brutiſh and immoral

Perſons the Myſtery of Godlineſs be hid and obſcure.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is certain that there was ſuch a Man as Jeſus in the World: And here I would deſire the Enemies of this Truth, whether Jews or Heathens, to give me liberty to make uſe of the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they themſelves do in proving the Truth of their Hiſtories; For how are they aſſured that there were any ſuch men in the World as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle?</hi> If they ſay they have it from a conſtant and unqueſtionable Tradition, we can bring

the ſame proof for the Chriſtian Religion, the Truth of which hath been delivered ſucceſſively from one Generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for above theſe ſixteen hundred years. If they appeal to the Writings of thoſe who were contemporary with them, the Chriſtians have the ſame Plea: For the very Enemies of Jeſus, ſuch as <hi>Celſus</hi> the Epicurean, and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver queſtioned his Exiſtence and Being upon Earth. The words of <hi>Celſus</hi> we have in the ſecond Book of <hi>Origen,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

It is likewiſe as unqueſtionable that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus wrought many notable Miracles while he converſed with men; and they are ſuch, as if we look into the Quality and Deſign of them, do evidently prove his Miſſion from Heaven, and therefore that all men ought to believe on him. And this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Power ought to have convinced the Jews by their own Law, for this was the Sign or Token left by <hi>Moſes</hi> to diſcern between the true and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. 21, 22. <hi>And if thou ſay in thine heart, How ſhall we know the word which the Lord hath not ſpoken? When a Prophet ſpeaks in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not nor come to paſs, i. e.</hi> if he do no Miracles, <hi>that is the thing which the Lord hath not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:</hi> And conſequently, if there ſhall come one whoſe Doctrine tends to the eſtabliſhing the pure Worſhip of the true God, and delivers nothing but what is for the promotion of Piety and Holineſs, and ſhall confirm this his Doctrine by Miracles, both Jews and Gentiles ought to believe in him. But if any one come and ſeek to draw men from real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Holineſs and the Worſhip of the true God, and to gain credit to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Deſign, ſhall work a Miracle, we

are not to believe him, becauſe God ſometimes permits ſuch things to be done to try the Conſtancy and Stedfaſtneſs of men. <hi>Deut.</hi> xiii. 1, 2, 3. To this the Jews object and ſay, that our bleſſed Saviour performed his Miracles by magical and diabolical Arts, for ſo they tell him, that <hi>he caſt out Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils.</hi> To this impious Cavil we may return (1.) the Anſwer which our Saviour made them, <hi>Mat.</hi> xii. 25, 26. <hi>Every king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom divided againſt itſelf is brought to deſolation; and if Satan caſt out Satan, he is divided againſt himſelf, how ſhall then his kingdom ſtand?</hi> For the Doctrin of Chriſt being ſo exactly oppoſite and deſtructive of the kingdom of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Darkneſs (as <hi>Porphyry</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acknowledged, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.<note place="margin">Euſeb. Praepar. lib. 5.</note>) If the Head and Prince of this wicked Polity ſhould abet the Lord Chriſt ſo far as to impower him to caſt out his aſſociates from their uſurped Habitations, it would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly beget an inteſtine War, and the Powers of Hell would be at an eternal Variance and Diſſenſion with one another, which at laſt would be the cauſe of the ruine of their Kingdom. (2.) This were an invincible Tentation put upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42066:15"/>
for there can be no ſurer manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Preſence and Approbation of the Deity, than when a man is inabled to work Miracles: And it were irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of Almighty God to ſuffer the moſt innocent and harmleſs Perſons in the world to be fatally and inevitably deluded. (3.) The great <hi>Synedrium</hi> conſiſting of the High-Prieſts, the Elders of the People, and the Scribes or Lawyers as their Aſſiſtants, whoſe Office and Right it was to try the Prophets, are ſaid by the Jews to be skilled in Magick Rites for the better and ſurer Exploration of thoſe who pretended to be true Prophets, but wrought their Wonders by the help of Apoſtate Spirits; which, if it were ſo, is a very pregnant Teſtimony that Jeſus performed his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles by the Divine Power and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; for otherwiſe his Fraud would ſoon have been detected by that great Council. (4.) That there are preſtigious and Satanical Miracles, is an Evidence that there are likewiſe True and Divine, as in Nature the being of Worſe argues the exiſtence of Better, Sophiſms and Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood the reality of Truth, and the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Second Cauſes lead us to the knowledge and being of a Firſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42066:15"/>
if it be granted that evil and lapſed <hi>Genii</hi> can work Miracles, it is apparent that the firſt and beſt Cauſe of all things may and does produce Effects of a Divine Power and Virtue; and that the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the bleſſed Jeſus were ſuch, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears partly from the Holineſs and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Life and Manners, in all parts of them blameleſs and irreprehenſible, and partly from the Deſign and Intention of his Miracles, namely to confirm and give credit to that ſublime and heavenly Doctrin he brought into the World, whoſe End was to correct and reform the Lives of men, and diſſeminate the bleſſed Life and Nature of God upon Earth; which Conſiderations are ſufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a firm and undoubted Perſwaſion that the immaculate Soul of Jeſus was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily aſſiſted and acted by a Divine Power and Efficacy which enabled him to perform thoſe ſtupendious Operations that are recorded in the Goſpels.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have reaſon to believe that there was a timely Hiſtory of the Life and Tranſactions of Jeſus compiled. For we can no ways doubt but that the Diſciples of our bleſſed Lord, bearing ſo tender and dear a Love to their Saviour, and being ſo fully convinced and ſatisfied in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42066:16"/>
their Minds that he was the promiſed Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, who ſhould regenerate and renew the World, did compoſe and draw up an Abſtract or Compendium of his Life: And if we conſider likewiſe how much it would conduce to the carrying on the Deſign they were ſetting on foot in the World, that all men ſhould believe in the Holy Jeſus, and imitate his immaculate and faultleſs Example, we cannot readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that they were ſo ſtupid as to neglect ſuch an effectual Inſtrument for the promoting their purpoſe, or ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable as to envy Mankind ſo great a Good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Hiſtories of the Goſpel were compiled by thoſe whoſe Names they bear in the forefront. And for this we have no greater Reaſon to doubt, than we have to queſtion whether the Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch or five firſt Books of the Bible were written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or whether thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which bear the Names of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> as their Authors, were ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by them. Suppoſe now we would know who was the Author of ſome very antient Writing; to prove this, one Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony muſt be taken from thoſe who were contemporary with the Author, or at leaſt very little diſtant from him, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42066:16"/>
from the perpetual Conſent of wiſe and learned men; and in this the ſacred Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes have infinitely the advantage above any other Writing whatever. <hi>Tertullian</hi> affirms that the Archetypal Copies writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the Apoſtles own hands were extant in ſeveral Churches in his time. <hi>Age jam, qui voles curioſitatem melius exercere in negotio ſalutis tuae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Praeſc. adv. Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticos.</note> 
                  <hi>percurre Eccleſias Apoſtolicas, apud quas ipſae adhuc Cathedrae Apoſtolorum ſuis locis praeſident, apud quas ipſae Authenticae Literae corum recitantur.</hi> And is it any more incredible that the very <hi>Autographa</hi> of the Apoſtler ſhould be ſeen in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, than that <hi>Cicero</hi>'s hand ſhould be ſhown in <hi>Quintilian</hi>'s or <hi>Virgil</hi>'s in <hi>Gellius</hi> his age? But beſide that, we have the concurrent Teſtimony of <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> all of which were the very next to the Apoſtolical Age, we never find any Controverſie moved either by Jews or Pagans whether thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were theirs whoſe Names they bear. <hi>Julian</hi> in <hi>Cyril</hi> acknowledges that the Epiſtles of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> the Goſpels of <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> are the very Writings of thoſe Perſons with whoſe Names they are adorned. Add to this further, that amidſt the early Differences

and Diſſenſions amongſt Chriſtians, we never find any ſober and grave Perſon queſtioning this Truth: Indeed we read of the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> a ſort of Judaizing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who rejected the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but yet they denied not that he was the Author of them, but refuſed them becauſe they thought St. <hi>Paul</hi> an Undervaluer of and Apoſtate from the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But ſuppoſe the Author of any of the Books of the New Teſtament be to us unknown, as it is of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> yet ought it not to be of any leſs Credit and Authority with us for either the Doctrin or Hiſtory contained in it, becauſe the Matter and Subſtance of the Book is more to be regarded than the Name of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; and therefore becauſe for example we find nothing in the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> which may rationally invalidate our Belief of the things contained in it, and over and above have ſufficient evidence that it was never repudiated by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who ſucceeded the Apoſtles, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly receive it as Canonical Scripture.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That we have all imaginable Reaſon to ground our Faith upon thoſe Hiſtories of the Goſpel delivered to us. And this appears, 1. Becauſe 'tis not likely thoſe who wrote them ſhould be deceived.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42066:17"/>
2. Neither is it probable they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others.</p>
               <p>There is no likelihood they ſhould be deceived, becauſe they were either Eye-witneſſes of the things they delivered to Poſterity, or elſe wrote them from the mouths of thoſe who were Spectators of them; and we never find a Miracle record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which Chriſt did alone, without the Company of two or three of his Diſciples; When he was transfigured, he took with him <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> when he raiſed the Ruler of the Synagogues Daughter, he carried the ſame three with him. <hi>Matthew</hi> was one of them who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually accompanied our bleſſed Lord, and ſaw the greateſt part of thoſe things which he wrote. <hi>Mark,</hi> it is thought, was an Aſſociate of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and wrote his Goſpel from his mouth. And <hi>Luke,</hi> beſide that he was one of thoſe who travelled about with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Revelation from Heaven, he alſo in his Dedicatory Preface to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, profeſſes himſelf to have had perfect Underſtanding of all things from the very firſt, as they were delivered to him from thoſe who were Eye-witneſſes of them. St. <hi>John</hi> was the beloved Diſciple, and always followed the Lord Chriſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42066:18"/>
he went, and ſetting aſide the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical Sermons recorded in his Goſpel, he relates very few miracles or new things, but what are confirmed by the Teſtimony of ſome one of the other three. As for that notable Miracle of raiſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead after four days burial, omitted by all the reſt, it is capable of this account; St. <hi>John</hi> lived long after all the reſt of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, even to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> being then alive when the others wrote their Goſpels, they purpoſely omitted it, leſt the reciting and recording ſo eximious and convictive a Miracle, might exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Jews againſt him, and bring him to ruine, but being dead, St. <hi>John</hi> might ſafely tranſmit it to Poſterity in his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Again, It is very improbable they would deceive others; For, <hi>Cui bono,</hi> to what end or purpoſe, or what Deſign could they aim at in deceiving the World? Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Preferments they could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, they being all in the hands of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans or of the Jews their bitter Enemies, who hated the holy Jeſus with an implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred, and for that very reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted all his Adherents; nor could they hope for Riches, when the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity expoſed them to the Loſs of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42066:18"/>
all temporal Goods, neither could the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel be preached without the neglect of mundane affairs. But perhaps ſome will ſay, they impoſed upon the World, that they might be the Authors of a new Sect; But (1.) either they believed the Doctrins which they taught to be true, or they did not; if they did not believe them, we cannot eaſily imagine they ſhould ſo far forth put off all Humanity and good Nature, which they ſo ſeriouſly and frequently inculcate in their Writings, as to expoſe ſo many thouſand innocent Perſons to Death upon their Aſſertion of a Falſhood: yet if they could be ſo prodigiouſly cruel to others, would they be ſo prodigal of their own Blood as to throw it away upon an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Deluſion? If they thought them to be true, as it is moſt likely they did, their Writings ſhewing that they were in good earneſt, then 'tis certain that it was not the poor and trifling Glory of being the Authors of a new and unheard of Sect, but the real Good and Advantage of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind which animated and encourag'd them to ſuch an Undertaking. (2.) It is not the manner of Cheaters to provoke to ſo many Witneſſes, as we find the Apoſtles did. St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerting the Reſurrection of our bleſſed Lord, beſide the Teſtimony of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42066:19"/>
twelve Apoſtles, brings in five hundred upon the Stage at once to confirm the ſame Truth, the major part of which were then alive when he wrote that Epiſtle. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. Add to this that a Lie is ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by their Writings, and thoſe that delight in it menaced with eternal Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8.3. (3.) Suppoſe men could be ſo wicked, yet would the Goodneſs of God ſuffer ſuch a Cheat to be put upon the World? If we look upon the whole frame of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, it is ſuch, that the more good any man is, the more likely to adhere to it, and the moſt harmleſs and innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the world are moſt apt to be charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and overcome by it: But ſurely to them that believe a juſt and righteous Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence governing the affairs of the World, it is apparent that God would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered an Error ſo univerſally to prevail, nor thoſe who moſt of all reſemble his bleſſed Nature in Juſtice, Mercy, and Compaſſion, to be involved in Obſcurity and Ignorance, and eternally to periſh in a Deluſion; ſince he may, and acting according to his Nature muſt, neceſſarily detect it.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the glorious Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, diſmant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42066:19"/>
the Priſons of Death, and freeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Chains and Fetters of the Grave, is the great Pillar and Foundation of the Chriſtian Doctrin; therefore it will be requiſite to wipe off thoſe Spots the mouth of Envy and Detraction hath caſt upon it. To this end I ſhall examine that Objection of the Jews, who ſeeing the clear and evident Proofs of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Jeſus, invented this Eluſion of it, <hi>That his Diſciples came by night, and ſtole him away while the watch ſlept.</hi> To which, the many improbable and unlikely Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances it is attended withal will be a ſufficient Anſwer and Reply: As (1.) how unlikely is it that his Diſciples, who juſt before fled every one from him, ſhould now reſume ſuch Courage as to venture to ſteal his Body from a Guard of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers? (2.) It is not likely that all the Watch ſhould be aſleep at one time. (3.) If they were, yet 'tis hard to imagine that his Diſciples ſhould come juſt at that time. (4.) How could they roll away the Stone and take out the Body (which ſurely would have made no ſmall noiſe) and yet none of the Guard hear them? (5.) Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they had taken away the Body, <hi>Quid ex cadavere emolumenti?</hi> what benefit could they have expected from a dead
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42066:20"/>
Carcaſe? would the dead and infamous Body of an Impoſtor be a ſufficient Motive to induce them to deny Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, worldly Intereſts and Profits, yea, Life itſelf to maintain his Credit by telling the World a fair Story of his Reſurrection, if indeed there were no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>This being then ſufficiently evidenced, that Chriſt roſe from the dead, it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Confirmation that all his other Miracles were true: And indeed it could not ſuit with the Juſtice of God to leave his Soul in Hell, or ſuffer his Fleſh to ſee Corruption: For the Innocence of the Lord Chriſt was bright as the noon-day, and all his Sufferings being undergone upon our account, and having made a full and perfect atonement for Sin, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Providence of God was engaged to raiſe him up, and inſtate him in that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs which he merited for himſelf by his voluntary Humiliation and Condeſcent. According to what the Apoſtle affirms of him, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 24. <hi>Whom God hath raiſed up, having looſed the pains of death, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, becauſe it was not poſſible,</hi> i.e. it was not meet, ſuitable or agreeable to the Juſtice of God, <hi>that he ſhould be holden of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have ſeen the Objection of the Jew,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42066:20"/>
and I ſhall now conclude this Particular by conſidering what the Heathen and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt hath to ſay againſt the Reſurrection of Jeſus; and he brings his Exception after this manner; <hi>If Jeſus did really riſe from the dead, why did he not then ſhew himſelf alive to all, or at leaſt to the chief Prieſts and Rulers of the Jews who condemned him to be crucified, and not only to his own company, and that not conſtantly to them, but like a Spectrum or Ghoſt appearing and then vaniſhing away?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is no wonder if impure and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical men do not apprehend the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Diſpenſation of Jeſus in the Fleſh, ſince there is a perpetual Antipathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their groſs and feculent Souls and the Holy Spirit of heavenly Wiſdom: but to them that are ſincere there is nothing in this inſtance but may admit of a fair Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy: We muſt know then that the Soul of the Holy Jeſus being vitally united to the eternal <hi>Logos,</hi> and never lapſed from the pure and immaculate Regions of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs with the reſt of Mankind, but ſo qualifying his Glory as to fit himſelf for an Union with a terreſtrial Body, muſt have even in theſe earthly Habitations a very efficacious Principle of Life and Virtue within him, which though ſhut up and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42066:21"/>
conſtrained by the encumbrances of Fleſh and Blood, yet ſhone through the Veil, and ſometimes broke forth into pure Light and Glory; wherefore through the Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Perfection of this high and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Life, it ſo came to paſs that in the time of his converſe with Mortals before his Death, he was not ſeen alike and after the ſame manner by all, but according to the Meaſure and Model of their frail Capacities: And ſome ſuch thing <hi>Judas,</hi> who betraid him, ſeems to intimate by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Sign to the Apprehenders of Jeſus to know him, when yet it was true what Chriſt ſaid, that he <hi>was daily with them teaching in the Temple.</hi> And certainly, we cannot but think ſomthing extraordinary to be in the bleſſed Jeſus, when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tells us that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not able to behold the glorious Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage even of <hi>Moſes</hi> when he deſcended from his converſe with God in the Mount. Although then in the frailties of his Fleſh, when he was a Man of Sorrows, and had not yet ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, nor died for Sin, he ſuffered himſelf to be ſeen of all, yet when he had broken the Powers of Hell, and roſe as a triumphant Conquerour from his Bed of Darkneſs, the Grave; he was not then the Object of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42066:21"/>
every mans ſight, his Divinity being more refulgent when the Oeconomy he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took in the Fleſh was finiſhed; but to thoſe who were capable of his Preſence he appeared and ſhewed himſelf alive to confirm and ſtrengthen their Faith, and yet ſpared their Imbecillity and Imperfection by ſtaying but a little with them at a time. For even his Apoſtles were not all capable of beholding him at all times, and therefore he ſelected <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who alone were able to bear that glorious Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of his Transfiguration, and behold <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in their celeſtial Robes, and hear not only their Diſcourſe, but the voice which came to them from the clouds. And hence we gather that he would not appear to thoſe who inſulted over him in his miſery, and were the Authors of his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious Death, out of compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, leſt they ſhould be ſtruck with Blindneſs, as the wicked <hi>Sodomites</hi> who ſought to abuſe thoſe Angelical Perſonages that were hoſpitably received into the Houſe of <hi>Lot:</hi> And thus we read that <hi>Saul</hi> in his Journey to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> was ſtruck blind by that excellent Glory, which yet became an innocuous and recreating Splendor to St. <hi>Stephen</hi> a little before his Death.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> That Chriſtianity contains nothing light and trivial, but grave and ſober Truths, delivered in that decorous and becoming Majeſty as well ſuited with that Bleſſed Spirit, which inſpired the Prophets and Apoſtles.</head>
               <p>THe third Particular to be proved in order to the Declaration of the Excellency of Chriſtianity is, that it treats of no ſmall and trifling things, but ſuch as are of the greateſt importance in the world. For what is more noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than that which concerns the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Welfare of the whole Creation? What more ſublime and excellent than that which tends to the unmasking the cloudy and obſcure face of Providence, and diſcovering the unſearchable Wiſdom of God in the harmonious Order and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of the World? But to deſcend more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Goſpel teaches us, that the true and genuine Felicity of Mankind is the Participation of the Nature of God. That the Souls of men are in an undue and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42066:22"/>
wrong eſtate in this World, that is, that their Natures are by ſome means or other corrupted and vitiated and forced from their proper Bent and Inclinations; needs no other confirmation than the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude and Diſſatisfaction they find in the beſt terreſtrial Joys and Delights, and their diligent and indefatigable Inquiſition after ſome noble and permanent Good, which may be commenſurate with the vaſtneſs of their Capacities and Deſires. And although as men come into the World, their Animal Powers and Faculties (whoſe proper Objects are the Reſults of Senſe and corporeal Motion) are fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and uſurp the Throne of Reaſon and Intellect, yet thoſe Lordly Powers like an oppreſſed Prince ſtill lay claim to the Soveraignty and Dominion, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any due occaſion is offered, give an evident proof of their heavenly Birth and Extraction, and ſtrive to free themſelves from their unjuſt Captivity, and regain their native Liberty and Command. And if by a favourable Aſſiſtance and timely Aid the Minds of men conquer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the rebellious Paſſions and Deſires of the mortal Body, and become in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure healthy and ſtrong to reliſh their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Food and Nouriſhment, and amidſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42066:23"/>
all the flattering Appearances and fine Shows preſented to them from this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward World, diſcriminate between real Good and Evil, and ſelect true and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial from falſe and adulterate Joys, they behold with Pleaſure and Enraviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a perfect Union and Harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whatever Truths ſhall duly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them and their rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For the Souls of men being in their general Strictures and Lineaments Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, it cannot be but that their higheſt Felicity and trueſt Accompliſhments muſt flow from the exerciſe of their higher and more immaterial Powers, and the more ſpiritualiz'd and refined they are from ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Alloy, the more tender and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive are they of whatever is Noble and Excellent, and agreeable to the Purity of their Natures. Albeit therefore our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties be depraved and debaſed as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon the Stage of this World, yet there being in us a ſtrong Propenſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our firſt and primitive ſtate, out of which we were forced by the unjuſt Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Iniquity and Sin, Truth and Goodneſs, and all thoſe beautiful Forms and Ideas which ſhone in our Souls before their unhappy Lapſe and Revolt from the bleſſed Laws and Government of Gods
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42066:23"/>
own Life, will upon a congruous Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal renew their antient League and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and conſpire the utter Subverſion of all irregular Appetites and Deſires, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the whole Man into a ſtrict Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Obſervance of the Dictates and Preſcriptions of that holy and exalted Principle of Life, which being once fully ſeated and radicated in our Minds and Spirits, is alone able to make us perfectly happy and bleſſed. For the Souls of men are not devoid of innate Knowledge, but are eſſentially ſtored through the gracious Bounty and Liberality of the firſt and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Author of all things, with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all manner of Science and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom whatever, and hence cannot but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and receive every thing that hath any Cognation and Affinity with thoſe firſt Inſcriptions on their Natures. Now the great Happineſs, Delight, and Satisfaction of every degree of Life in the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in and ariſing from the kindly and agreeable Actings of its chiefeſt and beſt Faculties and Capacities, and the Nature of Man ſo far forth as it is capable of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Good and Evil, being made up of ſuch Principles as are wholly Intellectual, he will not only eſteem the Effluxes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations of the Rational Life to be the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42066:24"/>
Foundations of his Felicity, but ſeek the Amplification and Diffuſion of it, and reduce all exorbitant Motions to its Rules and Determinations. And if we will not impoſe upon ourſelves, nor degrade our Minds below the Folly and Triflingneſs of Children, but act like Men who prefer Things before empty Sounds and Names, the eternal Rules of Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, and Goodneſs, will appear infinitely more eligible than any thing elſe in the World beſide; for let a man be poſſeſt of the moſt glorious and ſplendid Advantages and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions that poſſibly can grow out of the Earth, and let him extract the Flower and Quinteſſence of Sublunary Delights, and he will find them at the beſt very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and flaſhy, and too baſe and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate Objects of a pure, active and indefatigable Mind. And were it not that men are cheated into an Eſteem and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of them, partly from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others, who daily run the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Hazards and Labours in their Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and Purchaſe, and partly, from the innate Pravity and Iniquity of their own Spirits, which being preingag'd in an early Contention after the things of Senſe, are more forcibly ſtruck and moved by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and Radiations of the Corporeal
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42066:24"/>
World; it were exceeding improbable they ſhould forego ſuch valuable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Pleaſures as thoſe of Virtue and Holineſs, for the ſmall and inconſiderable, though the moſt refined Joys of this Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mutability, eſpecially when they are perpetually attended with ſuch inſtant Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieties and afflictive Circumſtances. That bleſſed Author of our Felicity the Lord Chriſt, who both knew the Soveraign Good of our Spirits, and deſigned the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and Reſtauration of the broken and diſtracted World by entring into it, makes it his firſt care and buſineſs to purge and refine our Minds from the Droſs and Pollution of material Concretions, by bringing down the Price of terreſtrial Love, and ſetting a low Eſtimate upon what the World calls Happineſs, Riches and Honours and all the choiceſt Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the inferior Life, and propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only ſuch Precepts as in their own nature tended to the raiſing and elevating the Powers and Faculties of our Souls to their higheſt and moſt enlarg'd Perfection, and which by our Conformity to them ſhould fully ſatisfie all our rational Thirſts and Appetites, but likewiſe revives our languiſhing Reſolutions, and reinſpirits our Minds with new Strength and Vigour
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42066:25"/>
by his own Example, as the moſt attractive and powerful Means that poſſibly can be offered to an ingenuous Nature. All the time that he converſed upon Earth, he went about doing good, tranſcribing the faireſt and moſt amiable Perfections and Attributes of the moral Eſſence of God for our Imitation, redreſſing and healing the Imperfections of Mankind, and caſting a benign and auſpicious Influence upon the diſtempered World, by propagating and diffuſing the holy Life of God into all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Receptacles. And that he might ſhew us what a ſmall and mean Valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he puts upon mundane and temporal Felicities, and how little they contribute to the Advancement of that which is the Flower and Summity of our Souls, he commands great Temperance and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration both in the Proſecution and Uſe of them, and declares a high Diſlike againſt all Exorbitancy and Exceſſe, condemning all anxious and ſolicitous Thoughts about theſe momentany Concernments as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and faulty. And what he enjoined upon his Diſciples and Followers, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf always obſerv'd and practis'd, never diſquieting his holy Breaſt with doubtful and corroding Cares, nor charging Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with Partiality and Unkindneſs, though
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42066:25"/>
he became ſo poor for our ſakes that he was forced by a Miracle to pay his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute-penny to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour. His blameleſs and immaculate Soul no impure touch of Pleaſure ever defiled, nor unjuſt and unhallowed Action ever ſtained and ſullied its native Brightneſs, but remained to his dying upon the Croſs a ſpotleſs Temple eternally conſecrated to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity reſiding in it. But that which did moſt of all allure and attract the Hearts and Spirits of men, was his exceeding and ſuperlative Charity, which not only burnt bright within its own Orb, but by a ſacred Influence and Communication melted and thaw'd the benum'd and frozen World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſoft, pliable, and ſequacious temper, and ſet abroad a Godlike Spirit of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Tenderneſs, Pity, and Compaſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth. And that ſo illuſtrious a Perſon might want nothing to recommend his Life to Mankind as the moſt complete Pattern of the Divine Nature, his Patience exhibited in a noble ſufferance of all thoſe Ignominies and Diſgraces put upon him, made him no leſs conſpicuous than thoſe other radiant Virtues rendred him accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God and Man. And if there be any thing more that is worthy and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and perfective of the Nature of Man,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42066:26"/>
it was eminently contained in the Lord Chriſt, whoſe glorious Mind was too large and great to bring forth any poor and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Deſign, but took the whole World into his Care, and folded the Creation within the Arms of dear Compaſſion. By all this and much more we are taught wherein conſiſts the greateſt Excellency, Beauty and Dignity of our Souls; namely, in the Acts of Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, and Mercy, in profound Humility, and Self-Denial, in Patience, Longanimity, and uncorrupted Purity of Body and Spirit. For theſe and ſuch like Heroical Exertions of our Minds bring not only a preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Gratefulneſs with them, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade by a ſecret and inſenſible Influence all our Animal Powers, and diffuſe a certain Savour and Reliſh of themſelves through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our inferior Faculties. As it is with Vice and Sin, every pitiful and degenerate Production of which ſpreads its contagious Nature, and leavens our whole Man with its poyſonous and infectious Inſpirations: ſo much more will Truth and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſſeminate a healthful Efflux, and hallow our vital Capacities, as being the moſt congenerous and agreeable Objects of our intellectual Parts. The Life of God which alone ought to have the Soveraign
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42066:26"/>
Command over the whole rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which will in due time conquer and triumph over the dark and apoſtate Principality; that Life, I ſay, of univerſal Sanctity and Righteouſneſs is an immortal thing like its great Source and Parent, and is always paſſing through the World, and will not reſt any where but in ſuch a fit and congruous Subject, as bears ſome Analogy and Similitude with itſelf: And being once ſeated there (unleſs it be forcibly driven out by rebellious Luſts, to which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims an irreconcileable War) it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſpread its lovely Nature, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large its Kingdom by the total Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or Converſion into its own Likeneſs and Quality, whatever reſiſts and hinders its Progreſs, and at laſt, when freed from the ſluggiſh weight of Mortality, like a quick and active Flame carry up the Soul with Joy and Triumph into Heaven, to which it always breaths and aſpires. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven itſelf is nothing but the bleſſed Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Righteouſneſs, a State of pure and undefiled Light, whoſe happy and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inhabitants are perfectly delivered from the Bondage and Servility of Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and Goodneſs, and Juſtice, and all the Moral Excellencies of Divinity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd within their ſacred Breaſts. And

every good Man does not only preſage, but really poſſeſſes in this Life a part of his future Happineſs, when the Divine Nature throughly informs, poſſeſſes, and actuates the Powers and Faculties of his Mind, and he faithfully attends to, and is guided and governed by its Laws and Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions. And he whoſe Soul and Spirit, thus becomes an Habitation of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is in a ſenſe Deified, and God dwells in him, and he is united to that Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Spirit of Love and Purity. For that Divine Nature, the Participation of which is the End and Deſign of the whole Goſpel, is not Power and Wiſdom, but ſomething more precious and ſoveraign: for if a man had all Power, that he could remove Mountains, and with his breath ſtop the conſtant Gyres and Circulations of the Earth; and if he had all Wiſdom and Knowledge, to underſtand the abſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Theory in Nature and Providence, and could perſwade with the Rhetorick and Oratory of an Angel; yet if he had not Charity, the Bond of Perfection which not only conſolidates and holds together the great Body Politick of Heaven and Earth, but is the Root and Center in which all the lines of Beauty and Excellence in Human Souls unite and meet; he would
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42066:27"/>
have no more of the true Life and Spirit of Chriſtianity in him, than a tinkling and ſounding Piece of Braſs. Love is the Joy of Men and Angels, the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the firſt pregnant Spring and Source from whence iſſued all the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Productions of the Spiritual and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Life. For God is Love, and Love is that (to ſpeak with Reverence) makes the Divinity a Uniform Being, all other Modes and Attributes being too fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, arbitrary, and unſetled to be the Baſis and Foundation of that ever-to-be-adored Author of all things. And as Goodneſs is the moſt pretious thing in the Deity, and for that reaſon alone obtains the firſt place in acting, ſo is it that which conſummates and completes all moral Agents that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from him; Power and Wiſdom and all other Modes being nothing but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Explications and Diffuſions of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Goodneſs. But that we may not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ourſelves, the Philoſopher tells us of a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Harlotry as well as a Heavenly <hi>Venus,</hi> whereby the Soul is enamour'd with theſe fading Beauties, and enſnared by the powerful Ineſcations of Senſe and Corporeity, and this weakens and deſtroys the Soul; but 'tis the celeſtial <hi>Venus</hi> that is the beautiful and perfective
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42066:28"/>
Object of Human Minds, and by its Union with it changes and transforms the Soul into its glorious Image. And what we have hitherto ſaid, is no more than what the natural Sentiments of our own Souls bear witneſs to, and all the moral part of Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Philoſophy atteſts, which was wholly employed in laying down Rules and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for the regulating mens Lives, and putting a ſtop to the bold Intruſion of Vice; and this was univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the only way to acquire a Cogna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Affinity with God: And what was judged laudable and decorous then, and approved as moſt excellent, is made much more ſo by the Chriſtian Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which ſets the Attainments of a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Soul at a higher pitch, than the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Wiſdom and Philoſophy of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles could arrive to. For what more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobles and inſpirits the Mind of Man with true Glory and Magnanimity, than the captivating his irrational Deſires, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing all inordinate Luſts and Appetites, and the introducing a Spirit of Love, Meekneſs, Temperance, and Sobriety? What more Divine and Godlike than Charity? to bind up an aking head, and dry up watry eyes, and relieve him who was fighting with the Preſſures of Want
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42066:28"/>
and Poverty? What greater Pleaſure can we reaſonably imagine, than that which reſults from an Act of Goodneſs and Bounty, whether it reſpect the Souls or Bodies of our fellow-Creatures; in extricating him who was involved in a Labyrinth of Miſery, and bringing the cheerful Day to him who ſate in a Night of Ignorance and Error? Which things, if duly conſidered, as they are very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and proportionate to our higher and rational Soul, ſo they depretiate the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Satisfactions of our viler parts, and make good this firſt Propoſition, <hi>That the true Felicity of Human Souls, reſults from their Participation of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

height above:</hi> for nothing is more ordinary in the World than that a young Woman ſhould bring forth a Child: Add to this, that the Jewiſh Rabbins teach, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Nativity of the Meſſias ſhall not be after the manner of other Creatures by carnal Copulation, but after an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner, and his Father ſhall be unknown till he himſelf reveal him.

And if it be ſaid, that it is impoſſible for a Star in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Regions, to deſign punctually ſo ſmall a place as a particular Houſe upon Earth; I anſwer, that the <hi>Magi</hi> found the Houſe wherein Jeſus was, not only by the diſappearing and vaniſhing of the Star o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, but <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>It remains now, that we Apologize for the other part of the Hiſtory, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the VViſe Men.</note> The coming of the Wiſe Men from the Eaſt to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to which purpoſe it will be requiſite to conſider the Quality of theſe <hi>Magi,</hi> who probably were none of theſe groſſer ſort of Sorcerers that make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Compact with the Devil, but ſuch as receiving from others certain forms and myſterious Conjurations, uſe them as they were delivered to them, without enquiring
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42066:32"/>
further into their Nature: And perhaps the black Society may oblige themſelves to attend ſuch dark and hidden Myſteries, whether the Tranſactors of them know them to be theirs or not. But whether theſe <hi>Magi</hi> were ſuch, or had a more open and viſible Commerce with evil Spirits, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not, ſince this is certain, that the airy Principality can act no further, where a more divine and excellent Power inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes. Wherefore through the mighty Virtue of the Divinity reſiding in the Soul of Jeſus, and the unexpected deſcent of a glorious Hoſt of Angels to theſe terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Regions, ſinging an Anthem of Praiſe at the Birth of Jeſus, it came to paſs that the Power of the airy Principality was on a ſudden reſtrained, and an univerſal Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Horror ran through the dark Kingdom, ſo that they were unable to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their own Helliſh Myſteries, which the <hi>Magi</hi> perceiving, their uſual Incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not ſucceeding, nor the accuſtomed Effects following their ſecret Rites and Ceremonies, they began to think the Cauſe of this unexpected Accident to be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and knowing the Prophecy of <hi>Balaam,</hi> that <hi>a ſtar ſhould come out of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and a ſcepter riſe out of Iſrael,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that the Man foretold to come

with the Apparition of a Star, was now born into the World, and believing him to have a tranſcendent Power over the aereal Agents, reſolved to come and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, preſenting him with the choiceſt Gifts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> Gold and Myrrh and Frankincenſe, as to a King, a Man, and a God. And if any man deſire a further Myſtery, he may take the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> his Obſervation, that by theſe three are denoted thoſe three Evangelical Sacrifices which through Chriſt we offer unto God, <hi>viz.</hi> Works of Charity and Mercy, <hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 18. Incorrupted Purity of Body, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 1. and Prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxli. 2.</p>
               <p>We that are Chriſtians are taught in the Goſpel, that Jeſus Chriſt, the Saviour of Mankind, is God as well as Man;<note place="margin">Chriſt God and Man.</note> and this Truth being of ſo high and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, we not only believe, but are ready to give all poſſible Satisfaction to the Jew and Heathen: To the Jew we ſay, that it was long ago declared by their own Prophets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> ix. 6. <hi>For unto us a child is born, unto us a ſon is given, and the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder; and his Name ſhall be called Wonderful, Counſeller, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi> This the more antient Rabbins al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways interpreted of the Meſſias, and 'tis
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42066:33"/>
but a groundleſs Conceit of <hi>R. Solomon</hi>'s to transfer it to <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> for who ſees not that theſe Appellations of the mighty God, and the everlaſting Father, cannot poſſibly agree to <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> Again <hi>Chap.</hi> vii. 14. <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a ſon, and ſhall call his name Immanuel:</hi> i. e. God with us, God dwelling and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in Human Nature. And by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens this Myſtery was not thought impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſince <hi>Julian</hi> believes that <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> the Son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> deſcended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and was incarnate, appearing firſt at <hi>Epidaurum,</hi> then in many other places, that he might cure the Bodies and reſtore the Souls of men to their priſtine Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Perfection. And is there any greater Difficulty in believing that the <hi>Word,</hi> the bleſſed Son of God, was once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate and dwelt among us? But further to make out this great Truth to thoſe that already believe the Hiſtories of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to be true: 1. We may take a view of thoſe many Operations Jeſus performed in the Nature he aſſumed, ſome of which were incommunicable and only proper to the Deity, ſuch are, to work a true and real Miracle, to forgive Sins, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute true and religious Worſhip. He was hungry, which ſhewed him to be a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42066:33"/>
man, and yet fed above five thouſand with five loaves and two fiſhes, whereby he manifeſted his Divinity. He thirſted, yet to others he gave rivers of living waters to fertilize their Souls, and quench and allay their Thirſt. He was weary, yet he calls to him all thoſe that are weary and heavy laden, and promiſes Refreſhment: though he were dumb and opened not his mouth, yet was he that <hi>Word</hi> by which all things were made: He lays down his Life, yet had he Power to take it up again. 2. There is nothing in the Divine Nature to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict or prejudice this Union, but very much to be drawn from thence for it. For Divine Goodneſs willing univerſally to communicate itſelf in meaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, aſſiſted by an eternal Wiſdom, found out this way of Union with Human Nature, as moſt fit for an Univerſal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, wherein the Divine Life is perfectly exhibited, and all Perfection is as it were epitomized. 3. There is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Congruity and Sutableneſs in this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery with the Deſign of perfecting and reſtoring lapſed Souls. For the eternal <hi>Logos</hi> bringing out of his Ideal Fecundity into actual Exiſtence the whole Rational Creation, it is highly agreeable with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, that by the ſame <hi>Word</hi> all
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42066:34"/>
fallen Beings ſhould be again reſtored; that the firſt and bleſſed Cauſe of their Exiſtence ſhould alſo be the Author of their Recovery and Return to the perfect Law of Gods own Nature. And if beſide we conſider that all the Creatures are but the Effects and Emanations of that mighty and potent <hi>Word,</hi> outwardly produced and brought into actual Life and Being; the Conjunction and Union of the eternal Mind with Human Nature will appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding congruous. 4. No Diſhonour can accrue to the bleſſed Nature of God by ſuch a ſtate in which there is no Evil, Turpitude, or Defilement. The Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Divine Sun is no whit obſcured by the adjunction of the Humanity, but the Humanity is made more glorious and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent by being exalted into the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Divinity. 5. The Obſcurity and Incomprehenſibleneſs of this Myſtery ought not to prejudice our Belief of it, ſince that many things in Nature are in the dark to us, and that faint and glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knowledge which we have of them is only cojnectural, not demonſtrative; we know there is an Union between Soul and Body, but the manner of it is unknown and hid from us, and if we believe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we can comprehend, we muſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42066:34"/>
be Scepticks in Religion as well as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. Yet ſomthing we may collect from the Union of Soul and Body, as alſo of other Natural Compoſitions, that foraſmuch as they are extremely diſtant and unlike in their Nature and Proprieties, and yet uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the making of one Compoſitum; therefore the Immenſity of the Divinity can be no hindrance from taking Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into an Union and Aſſociation with it. 6 We cannot doubt, but that God who is immenſe and omnipreſent, may manifeſt a peculiar Preſence in this or the other particular place, as ſeems beſt to himſelf. That infinite Nature which pervades and is extended through the vaſt Capacities of immenſe Space, can as eaſily actuate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit and fill a Human Soul and Body; nor is the Divinity contracted or diminiſhed by being united to a Creature, but being diffuſed through all places, manifeſts itſelf by a more ſpecial Inhabitation in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Temple of the Soul of Jeſus. We ſee the Soul of Man dilating itſelf through our corporeal Fabrick, expreſſing its Activity and Preſence by the exceeding quick Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of every part, and yet hath its peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Center and Reſidence in the Brain; and cannot God, in whom are found all poſſible Perfections, manifeſt his peculiar and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42066:35"/>
Preſence to the ever faithful and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Soul of the Meſſias?</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have declared the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Becomingneſs of the Truths of the Goſpel, and ſhall conclude this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Head with the Recitation of two or three Objections more, made by the Jews againſt our Saviour, and recorded in the Hiſtories of the Goſpel.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt came into the World, ſuch as he was foretold to be, that is, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meek, not with the Splendor and Glory of an earthly Prince, but poor and deſpicable, a man of ſorrows, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form and comlineſs; as it is predicted by <hi>Zechariah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Zech.</hi> ix. 9. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> liii. The End and Deſign of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to appeaſe the Anger of God, by devoting himſelf for the Sins of men; to deſtroy the Kingdom of the Devil, and to make one body of Jews and Gentiles, of which he himſelf ſhould be the Head.

And if he had otherwiſe deſcended from the celeſtial Manſions, than the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures relate, Man had entituled himſelf to part of the Glory of his Undertaking, and the more ſplendid the Divine Life had appeared to outward view, with the fainter Luſtre had it ſhone in itſelf.

               <p>TO this purpoſe we muſt conſider Man as a rational Being, endued with Liberty of Will, and a Lord of his own Actions, and conſequently muſt be treated according to thoſe Faculties and Qualifications beſtowed upon him by the gracious Bounty of his Creator. And this being the Nature of Man, he is not to be dealt withal like a Stock or Stone, that is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42066:37"/>
wholly inert and ſluggiſh; nor like a Beaſt that is acted and led only by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of Senſe; but as indued with Reaſon and Intellect, and capable of diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting between real Good and Evil; and this Principle in Man cannot be forced without the Deſtruction of his Nature, but is allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and drawn by moral Arguments. Wherefore the Deſign of God in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel being to wind men off from Sin to a ſerious purſuit of Virtue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he makes uſe of ſuch Arguments as are moſt powerful and efficacious for that end, and moſt ſutable to the Nature of Man: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. What can more deter men from Wickedneſs and Vice, than the ſober preſſing upon them the Conſideration of a future day of Judgment, wherein the juſt Judge of Heaven and Earth will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially look into their Lives, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them according to the moral Frame and Diſpoſition of their Spirits? To them who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for Glory, Honour and Immortality, eternal Life: But to them who do not obey the Goſpel, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe Tribulation and Wrath. He that is convinc'd that the Scriptures are the Word of God, muſt likewiſe believe, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42066:38"/>
though God be patient and long-ſuffering, not willing that any ſhould periſh; yet he is likewiſe juſt, and hates all Sin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and to convince all unbelieving and Atheiſtical Perſons of his Diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Wickedneſs and Vice, he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Day wherein he will judge the World; a Day wherein Jeſus Chriſt the bleſſed Son of God ſhall viſibly deſcend from Heaven, accompanied with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Legions of mighty Angels, before whoſe Throne all wicked Men and Devils ſhall ſtand with Paleneſs and Horror, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Pronuntiation of that dreadful Sentence, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire;</hi> which final Doom and Sentence ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be executed upon them; for through the ſtupendious Operation of the Son of God, the infernal Treaſures of Fire ſhall be opened, and an univerſal Deluge of Flame ſhall ſpread itſelf over the Face of the aged Earth, which ſhall be cleft and riven by terrible Eruptions of ſulphureous Matter, breaking forth with horrible Rage and Fury from the lower Regions, and this together with Showers of Fire rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down from thick and pitchy Clouds, ſhall wrap Univerſal Nature in a ſheet of Flame, and complete an external Hell, where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42066:38"/>
is not quenched. Tell me then, O Man, thou that thinkeſt Righteouſneſs but an idle Name, on whoſe hard and ſtubborn ſoul a Diſcourſe of another Life can make no Impreſſion; where will be the Objects of thy Love and Joy, when the Heavens ſhall be diſſolved, the Elements melt with fervent Heat, and the Earth with all the works therein be burnt up? What ſhall ſupport and bear up thy dying Hopes, when all ſenſible things ſhall periſh in this dreadful Conflagration? Thinkeſt thou that the Holes of the Rocks, or the ſecret Caverns of the Mountains can hide thee from his Eye which pierceth through Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity; who is every where preſent by his mighty Power, and to whom the Night is as bright as Noon-day? Or will that juſt Judge, who ſits upon the Life and Death of all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> be bribed with thy Gold and Silver, when the whole World is his, and the Fulneſs thereof? Surely nothing but Righteouſneſs will then deliver from Death, nothing but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Purity, white as the Beams of Light, can ſave the Souls of men from eternal Deſtruction: Wickedneſs and Sin like a Talent of Lead ſhall ſink down thoſe Souls that have delighted in it, into that ſulphureous Lake where a moſt acute
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42066:39"/>
and ſearching Pain ſhall ſtick cloſe to them, and unſpeakable Torments weary their reſtleſs Ghoſts for ever. A ſad and pitiable Calamity! but as juſt as great; for the bleſſed Author of all things does not make Laws to enſnare the Creation, nor does he directly and primarily intend Puniſhment, but has entailed that upon Diſobedience, that men might conſider and beware, and in time provide for their Reception into all that Happineſs God made them for, and which he by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Puniſhment, ſo affectionately deſires they ſhould enjoy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there might be nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enforce the foregoing Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Scripture manifeſtly reſolves our good or ill Being in the other Life to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon our Deportment in this. It is in this life that we lay the trains of our future Happineſs or Miſery, and every moral Action has an Influence either good or bad upon Eternity; and here it is that we have a vital Union and Conjunction either with Hell or Heaven. To be born into this World, is not only a Puniſhment, but a ſtate of Probation to us Mortals, wherein he that acquits himſelf generouſly and nobly, fighting manfully againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42066:39"/>
with the Spoils and Trophies of his conquered Enemies to his beloved Lord, ſhall be crowned with an eternal weight of Glory; but he that through faint-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and cowardice yields himſelf a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Captive to his Luſts and Corruptions, ſparing thoſe rebellious Sins and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with whom the Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation has ſworn War for ever, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines and unites himſelf to a living Hell; and no ſooner is his Soul diſlodg'd from its earthly Fabrick, but it deſcends into thoſe Regions of Bitterneſs and Sorrow, with which it ſo wilfully ſought a Cogna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Affinity in this Life. And he that will but patiently lend an ear to this, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo obſtinately forſake his own good, nor delay and put off his Repentance by imagining the day of Judgment a great way off, and not likely to overtake him: For no ſooner has Death diſſeized him of his terreſtrial Tenement, but that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>Nemeſis</hi> which pervades the whole World, will fatally convey him to ſuch a Place and Society, as he had prepared and accommodated himſelf for here on Earth. And he that obſtinately rejects the Counſel of God, and ſets at nought all his Reproofs, will find that the Wrath of the Lord can reach him, and he will have
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42066:40"/>
little or no Poſſibility left to better him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the other World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the more ingenuous ſort, who are rather attracted and won by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Kindneſs and Love, than the Fear of external Puniſhment; what can more prevail with them, than to behold the ever-bleſſed Son of God, who lived in the boundleſs Tracts of Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, forſake thoſe celeſtial Manſions, and come down and take a Body of Fleſh and Blood, and here lead an obſcure and evanid Life, perſecuted and afflicted, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeeing good days, but always carrying an heart full of Penſiveneſs and Sorrow, and at laſt die a painful and ignominious Death upon the Croſs; and all this to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and free the race of Mankind from the Tyranny and Slavery of Sin? What can this but beget a ſuitable return of Love in every ingenuous Soul? What kind heart is there that this Spectacle will not fill with Tears of Love and Joy, and with the moſt endearing Expreſſions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote itſelf to a faithful Obedience of ſo compaſſionate a Saviour?</p>

For he that conſiders how deeply Vice and Iniquity are radicated in our very Natures; and what great Diligence and Care is required to extirpate even a ſingle Habit, which of a long time hath gotten an entire and full poſſeſſion of our minds; and withal reflects on the crazy and ſickly ſtate of our moſt generous and manly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, how bedwarfed and unable they are to reſiſt, through a continued imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of a ſweet Poyſon from Senſe; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conclude the Evangelical Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would be very lame and imperfect, were it not inſtructed and furniſh'd with Arguments ſufficient to countermand and outbalance the importunate Solicitations of the degenerate Principles of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Sin. And indeed were not a Crown of Glory the great <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of our holy Faith, were not Virtue countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with an appendent Felicity, the Face of the World would now appear as ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and deformed, as in its firſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Brutiſhneſs and Barbarity: For who would ſeek the Renovation of decayed Righteouſneſs, or who would entertain afflicted and oppreſſed Holineſs, if its Reward did not fully anſwer and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate whatever Troubles, Difficulties, and Moleſtations do attend it? Who would
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42066:41"/>
buy Religion with the Expence of all his temporal Intereſts, nay of his Life itſelf, if he were not aſſured the Happineſs laid up for holy and incorrupt Souls, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely tranſcend and exceed the choiceſt Pleaſures and Gratifications that are to be met withal in this Region of Mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And that ſuch a Courſe and Order of things ſhould be taken, is not only a merciful Proviſion of the good and wiſe Creator of all things towards us Sons of Senſe, but gives us a full Evidence and Aſſurance that his Intentions for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the World are real and ſincere, and renders unſuſpected the grand Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Chriſtianity. For had the Goſpel propounded only intellectual No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſolicited our choice by things moſt remote from Senſe, while we were ſo fatally entangled and oppreſt with the Incumbrances of dull Mortality; ſuch a Deſign would rather confound and amaze the Faculties and Capacities of men, than prove any whit ſerviceable for the regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their antient Liberty and Command; like a potent and vigorous Light ſet before weak and diſtempered Eyes, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blinds than affords them a true and faithful diſcrimination of Objects. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Divine Wiſdom hath treated the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42066:41"/>
Sons of men after a ſenſible manner, and engaged them by Arguments that more forcibly ſtrike their Fancies and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and have a greater Influence for the promoting the indiſpenſable Duties of Sanctity and Truth, than any terreſtrial Pleaſure can poſſibly be allective to the contrary. 'Tis true, if Religion could conſiſt with Avarice, Vain-Glory, and Ambition, the covetous Miſer who rips up the Bowels of the Earth for Treaſure, and ſpins out his Life in a golden Thread, would become a Proſelyte; and he who ſeeks to ride upon the ſhoulders of the Multitude, and lives upon the Air and Breath of Popular Applauſe, would need no Inducements to turn Chriſtian: But when things go directly contrary, and he that will be a ſincere Diſciple of the Son of God, muſt crucifie his rebellious Luſts, and deſcend into the Grave of Mortification, and caſhier every inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Motion and Deſire that hinders or any way obſtructs his approach to ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable a good, as the Poſſeſſion of the bleſſed Life of God; and this not to be done without indefatigable Induſtry and Care, and as it were a Dilaceration of himſelf from himſelf, that is, a forcible Subjection of that grand Principle of our
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42066:42"/>
Apoſtaſie and Deviation from God, which is ſo miſchievouſly powerful, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Laws of our ſuperior Life; there is no man can doubt, but that the Promiſes of the Goſpel are infinitely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order to that weighty Deſign eternal Wiſdom ſeeks to carry on by the Promulgation of them to the World.</p>
               <p>Which Promiſes we may refer to theſe three general Heads, 1. Pardon of all our Sins upon a true Repentance and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Conformity of our Minds and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to the Will of God. And this was the great End of Chriſts coming into the World, that he might reconcile it unto God, and aſſure guilty Sinners who had made themſelves obnoxious to Divine Wrath and Diſpleaſure, that if they will return to their Loyalty and Obedience, and expreſs an unfeigned Repentance by ſincere Purpoſes and Reſolutions of a new Life, God will forgive their paſt Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and remember their Iniquities no more. The whole Goſpel, what elſe is it, but a free and gracious Declaration of Pardon and Forgiveneſs to the World? which, as it takes away all direful and jealous Thoughts, which criminal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons through a Conſcience of their own Guiltineſs and Sin, and frequent Preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42066:42"/>
of Divine Vengeance, are apt to retain of God; ſo it gives them a true and faithful Repreſentation of his Nature, that he is no dreadful and hurtful Being encircled with Tempeſts and devouring Flames, no Tyrant whoſe arbitrary Love or Hate are the Rules and Laws of his Government; but an Almighty Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whoſe pregnant Fecundity gave Life and Being to the whole Creation, and ſtudiouſly endeavours the Conſervation of all things in all that Happineſs their Natures are capable of. This was it to which the holy Jeſus bare witneſs, and publiſhed to the Sons of men by going about doing good, and diffuſing a Spirit of real Righteouſneſs throughout the World: He took it upon his Death that this was true, that God did infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire the Reconciliation of the World to himſelf, and that not for any Self-Ends or Deſigns (for what can accrue to him who is infinite Life, and eternally poſſeſſed of whatever ſpeaks Perfection?) but for the ſole Good and Welfare of things themſelves, that every Being might obtain that Place and Order in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and enjoy all that Felicity to which it was at firſt intended, and from which nothing but its own wilful Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42066:43"/>
could degrade it. For Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is nothing but his Goodneſs, Power, and Wiſdom imployed for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Conſervation of what is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally juſt and right; and if this may be done without Extremity and Rigour, his Goodneſs doth as much oblige him to take the gentleſt and mildeſt Courſe, as any man can pretend his Juſtice for exact Puniſhment and Severity. But that all the Attributes of the Deity might be at once ſecured, and fallen Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to a Capacity of being made happy again, Chriſt appearing in human Nature hath undertaken the Cauſe of Man, and given himſelf a Ranſom for all, the Puniſhment due to us being transferred on him, and through the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and Death of Jeſus, God is upon terms of Peace and Friendſhip with the World, and proclaims a free Indulgence to all who will lay down their Hoſtility and Rebellion, and become obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to his Kingdom. God takes no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt any man to deſtroy him, and 'tis a horrid Impiety in us, to ſuſpect him of Treachery and Deceit; and to repreſent God to our minds in ſuch a fearful Garb and Image, as eternally wiſhing the Deſtruction of the greateſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42066:43"/>
part of his Creatures, is no leſs Idolatry, than to fall down and worſhip the Works of our own hands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The powerful Aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit to enable us to perform his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. When the great Love the holy Apoſtles bare to the Lord Chriſt, made them ſorrowful for his Departure, they ſuppoſing he would then leave them to the Mercies of a faithleſs and perverſe Generation; he takes Compaſſion on his Charge, and aſſures them that when the time comes that his bodily Preſence ſhould be withdrawn from them, he would not leave them deſtitute and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken; but ſend the Comforter, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth unto them, who ſhould not only perform the Office of an Advocate, in pleading and maintaining the Juſtice of his Cauſe againſt the unrighteous World, but be a Principle of Love and Purity in their hearts, and conduct them through the various Windings and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquities of Error and Falſhood into the plain and eaſie Paths of Truth and Righteouſneſs. And for a Confirmation of this Promiſe, he appeals to common Senſe and the Evidence of all Mankind; <hi>If ye who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more ſhall
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42066:44"/>
your heavenly Father</hi> (from whom all Creatures proceed, and upon whom they depend more intimately, than Faculties and Actions upon the Principles from whence they flow) <hi>beſtow his Holy Spirit upon them that ask it of him?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that no man might deſpair, and count it an impoſſible thing to atchieve a perfect Victory and Conqueſt over his Luſts and Corruptions; God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that the Buſineſs ſhall not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by our own ſingle Effort and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Endeavours; but that we ſhall have the powerful Aid of his bleſſed Spirit, than which nothing can be a more vigorous Encouragement. For what can reſiſt his Almighty Energy and Virtue? or what can be ſo ſtubborn and refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he cannot render ſequacious and obedient, who at firſt brought all things out of nothing? Be our Luſts never ſo mighty and gigantick, and the Powers of Darkneſs never ſo reſolutely armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, yet the Strength and Aſſiſtance derived to us from Heaven, is able to put to flight all our Enemies, and make us perfectly victorious. The Spirit of God is no dull and ſluggiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, but a quick and active Life; and into whatever Soul it enters, it is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42066:44"/>
cleanſing, and purifying, and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, till it have wholly extirpated and deſtroyed whatever beats no ſimilitude with itſelf, and rendred the whole Man an immaculate Temple for the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its own glorious Preſence. Let no man then pretend an invincible Infirmity, or that he is fatally bound and enſlaved to Sin and Vice; for if we would but excite thoſe Powers God has given us, and by ardent Breathings invocate the gracious Auxiliaries of Heaven, there would be Wonders wrought upon our Souls, the Strength of our Corruptions would abate, and our furious Paſſions be reſtrained and reduced into Diſcipline and Order.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt general Head is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a future and bleſſed Immortality in Heaven, when this preſent Life is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The bleſſed Jeſus, while he lived upon Earth, did not wholly obſcure his Glory in the mantle of Fleſh and Blood, but gave a notable Specimen of that effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Life and Power, which as he himſelf was already poſſeſſed of, ſo all thoſe that believe in his Name ſhould hereafter be endued withal, which ſhould melt their Corruptible into Incorruption, and tranſlate them to the quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42066:45"/>
Regions of Immortality; in his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> which was enough to call off the Thoughts and Cares of men from the trifling Concerns of this World, and teach them, that there was a better Portion to be expected for all the Sons of God and Virtue in the pure and undefiled Manſions of Heaven, where dwells nothing but Truth and Goodneſs: But the moſt lively and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Evidence of the future Subſiſtence of our Souls, was his glorious Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the dead, whereby as he was declared to be the Son of God with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſo it gives us a full Aſſurance and convictive Demonſtration, even to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſe, that the comfortleſs Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Grave ſhall not for ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein us; but that when he who is our Life, ſhall appear and ſummon Earth and Sea to deliver up their dead, and open the ſecret Receptacles of Souls; then ſhall all holy and righteous Perſons appear with him in Glory, and take poſſeſſion of their long expected Joy, and receive the juſt Recompence of all their Pains and Labours; an Inheritance incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved by a gracious Providence in the Heavens for them. All Power is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42066:45"/>
committed into the hands of Chriſt, who hath vanquiſhed Death and Hell, and captivated all the Powers of Darkneſs, and begotten us to a lively Hope, that when we ſhall put off our Mortality, and be releaſed from all terreſtrial Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Incumbrances, he will cloth us with an heavenly Body like unto his own Body of Light and Glory. But leſt we ſhould undo ourſelves with fruitleſs Expectations, and flie to Heaven in our vain Dreams of Salvation, before our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Conformity to Gods bleſſed Will and Commands has rendred us capable of that pure and holy State, fancying we can read our Names written among the Stars, before we have learnt the Precepts of a holy Life, God hath annexed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Obedience to all his Promiſes, and reſolved that no man ſhall be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he that with Courage and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance maintains the War againſt Sin and Hell. And indeed the Reward that is promiſed to all virtuous Perſons in the Goſpel, hath ſo great Affinity and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Holineſs, the Condition of it, that in the Nature of the thing itſelf, he cannot be capable of the one, who is not aforehand inveſted with the other: For what is Heaven, but a ſtate of ſpotleſs
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42066:46"/>
Love and Purity, where no Envy nor Malice ſtraitens and contracts the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and enlarged, no clouds of Paſſion or diſordered Luſt obſcure the Brightneſs of that eternal Day, where the Sun of Righteouſneſs neither riſes nor ſets upon the Horizon of Time, but remains Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical for ever? And now what Concord can poſſibly be imagined between ſuch tranſcendent Beauty and Glory, and the Deformity and Uglineſs of the Frame and Temper of an unrighteous mans Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, where every thing lies croſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward; and his unruly Deſires, like the boiſterous Waves enraged by a ſudden Storm, ſweep the bottom of his polluted Soul, and throw up ſo much Mire and Dirt, that it defaces whatever is comely, and leaves not the leaſt Emblem of Heaven to be diſcerned in it?</p>
               <p>This is the grand importance of the Promiſes of the Goſpel, which is enough to demonſtrate the prudent Care and dear Affection of the Son of God to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, and a ſufficient Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great Ingratitude and Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of thoſe who do not believe in him, that it is not the Want of Reaſons or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive Arguments, but their own care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and wretchleſs Neglect of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42066:46"/>
that makes them deaf to ſuch Charms of Love, and ſtupid and unmindful of ſo important Intereſts.</p>
               <p>But men ſeldom want Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which they have no mind to believe; againſt this therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>That if the Promiſes of that eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Chriſt has made to us in the Goſpel, be ſo framed as to be inevident to men, and leave them place of doubting; it will be no ſuch great Crime in wicked Perſons, not to believe thoſe Promiſes, and ſo not to embrace them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I ſay, (1.) That the Goſpel leaves no ſuch place of doubting, as to make Infidelity or a Disbelief of it excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable. For Unbelief can then only be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, when there are really wanting ſuch Arguments, as may beget Faith in a rational and unprejudic'd Perſon: But the Goſpel and the Promiſes thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently confirmed by ſuch preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Reaſons, as are apt to acquire Belief and Credence from an unbias'd Nature, the pretended Inevidence, where there is no juſt Cauſe or Suſpicion of Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cannot at all patronize Infidelity, nor be a reaſonable ground to act contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what Belief would otherwiſe incite them. Its true, were the Arguments for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42066:47"/>
the Disbelief of the Promiſes of Life and Salvation equal to, and ſtrong as thoſe that perſwade us to the Belief of them, there would be ſome Colour and Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Reaſon for rejecting them; but when there can be no ſuch Doubting or Fluctuation of Judgment, as proceeds from an Equilibration of Arguments on both ſides, it is impoſſible that Infidelity ſhould have any rational Apology. For what can be more convictive, than to have ſome holy and divine Perſon come into the World, who ſhould by many infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Miracles, Wonders, and Signs, give an evident Proof that he came from God; and for a full Confirmation of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, riſe from the dead the third day after the ſuffering a painful and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Death; and to ſhew that he was no Spectrum or illuſive Phantaſm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with his Diſciples for the ſpace of forty days, and afterwards aſcending in their Preſence into the higheſt Heavens, there to rule and govern his Church till the End of the World; to teſtifie which his <hi>Apotheoſis,</hi> he ſends down his holy Spirit upon his Apoſtles, and enables them to ſpeak with Tongues and do Miracles: which Scheme of Providence doth ſo pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably evince the Interpoſition and Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42066:47"/>
of a Deity, and that all theſe things hapned by his actual concurrence, that he muſt on purpoſe blind his eyes, who will not ſee it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the place of doubting, which is left to us in the Belief of the Promiſes of the Goſpel, is no other than what may be in the higheſt moral Certainty imaginable. It only leaves a Poſſibility that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Arguments brought to confirm it, it may yet be otherwiſe. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is not capable of a Mathematical Demonſtration, but the ways of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are different according to the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Subjects. And certainly, he will be a very imprudent man, that will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect an important Affair, to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of which he hath highly probable Reaſons, only becauſe 'tis poſſible it may be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was a great piece of Divine Wiſdom, ſo to order the Goſpel that the Promiſes of Life and Salvation ſhould not be ſo evident, as thoſe things that are known by Senſe or Demonſtration; but only ſo far as might conciliate Faith in a rational Perſon, that thereby the wicked Tempers and Diſpoſitions of men might the more plainly be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. If the Goſpel had been ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42066:48"/>
certain, ſo as to exclude all Doubting, <hi>i. e.</hi> Poſſibility to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, all men would have been forced and neceſſarily good, and all that Praiſe which is due to the embracing of Virtue, would have been loſt; but now that men believe, when notwithſtanding there is a Poſſibility to the contrary, the Trial of their Faith will be found unto Praiſe and Honour and Glory at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt. For what Praiſe is due unto him, that believes not out of Choice, but from the neceſſary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative Truth of the Thing itſelf? Let not any man therefore flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with hopes, that this will patronize and defend his Infidelity, that it was poſſible the Evangelical Promiſes might be uncertain; but let him conſider, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what account his Faith induces him to act in the Affairs of the World. Will a human Faith be ſufficient to perſwade the Merchant to commit his Life and Fortunes to the flattering Waves, when he knows not but a mercileſs Pyrat or the next ſucceeding Storm may bereave him of both? Will the Souldier march all day ſcalded with Heat, or pinched with the Northern Cold, and expoſe his Body to a Storm of Bullets and Swords
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42066:48"/>
drunk with his Companions Blood, and all for the Spoils of an uncertain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt? Shall this be able to put us upon Action, and ſhall not the Belief of the Goſpel, which is not half ſo uncertain or inevident as this? We need no ſuch firm ground to build our Faith upon in matters of the World, and therefore we are utterly inexcuſable, if we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Son of God, who hath brought Life and Immortality to light.</p>
