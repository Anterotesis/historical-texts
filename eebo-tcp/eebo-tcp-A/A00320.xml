            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The loue and frendshyppe of a great man is swete to them that be not experte: he that hath had therof experience, is aferde. It semeth to be a gay and a glorious thynge, to iette vp and downe amonge the nobles of the courte, and to be occupied in the kynges busynes: but old men, to whom that thing by long experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is wel knowen, do gladly absteyne them selfe from suche felicitie. It semeth a pleasant thyng to be in loue with a yonge dammo sell: but that is vnto theym, that haue not yet perceyued howe moche grefe and bytternes is in suche loue. So after this maner of facion, this prouerbe may be applied to euerye busynes, that is adioyned with great peryll and with many euyls: the whiche no man wyl take on hande, but he that is yonge and wanteth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

And aboue al this, nature hath diuided among men by a merueylous va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rietie the gyftes, as wel of the soule as of the body, to thintent truly that euery man might fynde in euery synguler persone one thyng or other, whiche they shuld other loue or preise for the excellency therof: or els greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre and make moche of it, for the nede and profyte that cometh therof. Finally she hath indowed man with a sparke of a godly mind: so that though he see no rewarde, yet of his owne courage he delyteth to do euerye man good.

But they that are the moste fierse of all, as lyons, wolfes, and tygers: doo not make warre amonge theym selfe as we doo. One dogge eatethe not an nother.

For somtyme those men that were in the begynnynge of the worlde, ledde theyr lynes in wodes, they went naked, they had no walled townes, nor howses to put theyr heedes in: it happed other whyle that they were sore greued and distroyed with wylde beastis.

Yea and it semed to theym a thynge mooste egall, to strangle the stranglers, and to slee the sleers, namely whanne the wylde beaste, not prouoked by vs for any hurte to them done, wolde wylfully sette vppon vs. And so by reason that this was counted a thynge mooste worthy of preyse (for hereof
<pb facs="tcp:1808:12"/>
it rose that Hercules was made a god, the lufty stomacked yonge men, beganne all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute to hunte and chace the wylde beastes, and as a token of theyr valyant victorie, the skynnes of suche beastis as they slewe, were sette vp in suche places, as the people might beholde theym. Besydes this they were not contented to slee the wylde beastes, but they vsed to weare theyr skynnes to kepe theym from the colde in wynter. These were the fyrst slaughters that men vsed: These were theyr spoyles and robberies. After this, they went so ferforth, that they were bolde to do a thynge, whiche Pythagoras thoughte to be very wycked: and it myghte seeme to vs also a thynge monsterous, if custome were not, whiche hath so great strength in euerye place: that by custome it was reputed in som countreys a moche charitable dede, if a man wolde, whan his father were very olde, first sore beate hym, and after thruste hym heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe into a pytte, and so bereue hym of his lyfe, by whome it chaunced hym to haue the gyfte of lyfe. It was counted a holy thyng, a man to fede on the fleshe of his owne kyns men and frendes.

yet was there no great nombre of men, that fought to gether, but as it chanced one man ageynste an other. And besyde this, there was no smalle colour of equitie, if a manne slewe his ennemie: ye and shortely after, it was a great preyse to a man, so slee a viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and a mischeuous manne, and to rydde hym out of the worlde, suche dyuelysshe and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elle caytyues, as men saye Cacus and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siris were. For we see playnely, that for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che causes, Hercules was greatly preysed. And in proces of tyme, many assembled to take parte to gether, eyther as affinitie, or as neyghbourheed, or kynred bounde them. And that that is nowe robberye, was then warre. And they soughte then with stones, or with stakes, a lyttell burned at the endes. A lyttell ryuer, a rocke, or suche other lyke thynge, chaunsynge to be betwene theym, made an ende of theyr battayle.</p>
            <p>In the meane seson, whiles fiersnes by vse increaseth, whyles wrath is growen great, and ambition hotte and vehement: by inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious crafte, they arme theyr furious vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

and nowe armed they begyn to fighte. Nor to this manifeste madnes they forgette not to gyue honour. For they cal it <hi>Bellum,</hi> that is to sey, a fayre thyng: ye and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it a vertuous dede, if a man with the ieoperdie of his owne lyfe, manlye resiste and defende from the violence of his enmies, his wyfe, chyldren, beastis, and householde.

And in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taylle they vsed but homely weapons, nor they vsed neyther gyle nor disceyte, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strength. It was not lefull for a man to stryke his ennemie, tyll the signe of batayle was gyuen. Nor it was not lefull to fyghte after the sownynge of the retreate. And for

conclusion, they fought more to shewe theyr manlynes, and for preyse, than they coueted to slee. Nor all this whyle they armed them not, but ageynste straungers, the whiche they called <hi>hostes,</hi> as they had ben <hi>hospites,</hi> their guestis. Of this rose empires, of the whiche there was neuer none yet in any nation, but it was gotten with the greatte shedynge of mans bloudde. And sith that tyme there hath folowed continuall course of warre, whiles one eftesones laboureth to put an other out of his empire, and to set hym selfe in.</p>
            <p>After all this, when the empyres camme ones in to theyr handes, that were most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious of all other: they made warre vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon who so euer pleased theym: nor they were not in greattest peryll and daunger of warre, that had moste deserued to be punys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

What may be answered in this place, is lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than is conueniente to reply. But this moche wol I say, there is a great difference. For the yuel doer founde fauty and conuicte, is by auctoritie of the lawes put to deathe. In warre there is nother parte with out faute. Where as one singular man doothe offende, the punysheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t falleth only on hym selfe: &amp; the example of the punyshement doth good vnto all other. In warre the mooste parte of the punyshemente and harmes fall vpon them that leaste deserued to be puny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshed: that is vpon husband men, olde men, honest wyues, yonge chyldren, and virgins. But if there may any commodite at al be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of this moste myscheffull thyng, that all to gether goth to the behoue of a certeine mooste vengeable theues, hyred soudiours, and stronge robbers, &amp; parhappes to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let vs not make a shewe of our gay riches, nor of our great nombre of soudiours, nor of our great strengthe.

If our religion were fyrst stablis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the might and strengthe of men of warre, if hit were confyrmed by dente of sworde, if it were augmented by warre, then let vs maynteyne it by the same meanes and wayes.

Ambition causeth some, and some are stirred by fyrcenes of minde to make warre. For truly there is almoste nowe none other thynge in our cities and common weales, then is conteyned in Homers warke Ilias, The wrathe of vndiscrete princis &amp; people.</p>
            <p>¶There be whiche for none other cause moue Warre, but to thentent they may by that meane the more easily exercise tyranny on theyr subiectis. For in the tyme of peace, the auctorite of the counsaile, the dignite of the rulers, the vigor and strengthe of the lawes, do somwhat let, that a prince can not do all that hym listeth: But as soone as warre is ones begunne, now all the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge of matters resteth in the pleasure of a fewe persons. They that the prince fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth are lifted vp alofte: and they that be in his displeasure, go downe. They exacte as moche money as pleaseth them. What nede many wordes? Then they thynke theym selfe, that they be the greateste pryncis of the worlde. In the meane season the capy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes they sporte and playe to gether, tyl they haue gnawen the poore people to the harde boonis. And thynke ye that hit wyll greue them, that be of this mynde, to entre lyghtly in to warre, whan any cause is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered?
<pb facs="tcp:1808:37"/>
Besydes all this, it is a worlde to se by what meanes we colour our faute. I pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tende the defence of our religon, but my mynde is to gette the great riches that the Turke hath. Vnder colour to defende the churches ryght, I purpose to reuenge the hatred that I haue in my stomacke. I inclyne to ambition, I folowe my wrathe, my cruell fierce and vnbridled mynde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth me, and yet woll I fynde a cauilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and say, the leage is not kept, or frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe is broken, or some thynge (I wotte not what my selfe) concernynge the lawes of matrimony is omitted. And it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to speake, howe they neuer opteyne the selfe thynge, that they so greatly desyre. And whiles they folishely labour to eschue this michiefe, or that, they fall in to an other moch worse, orels into the same. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if desire of glory causeth them thus to do, it is a thynge moche more magnificent and glorious to saue then to destroy: moch more gay and goodly to builde a cite, than to ouer throwe and destroye a citie.</p>
            <p>¶Farthermore admitte that the victorie in batayle is gotte most prosperously, yet how small a porcion of the glorie shall go vnto the prince? The commons woll clayme a

If it come of a noble courage and stoute stomake, that you be moued to make warre: se I pray you, how farre wyde be ye from your purpose? For whyles ye woll not be seen to bowe to one man, as to a prince your neyghbour, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture of your alia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; which may fortune hath done you good: howe moche more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectly muste ye bowe your selfe, what tyme ye seke aide and helpe of barbarous people, ye and that is more vnworthye, of suche men as are defiled with all mischiuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, if we must nedes call suche kynde of monsters men? Whiles ye go about to allure vnto you with fayre wordes and promisses, rauyshers of virgines and of relygious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, menkyllers, stout robbers and rouers (for these be the speciall men of warre). And whyles you labour to be some what cruell and superiour ouer your equall, you are constrayned to submitte your selfe to

the very dregges of all men lyuynge. And whiles ye go aboute to dryue your neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour oute of his lande, ye muste nedes fyrste brynge into your owne lande the most pestilente puddell of vnthryftes that can be. You mistrust a prynce of your owne aliance, and wyll you committe your selfe holly to an armed multitude? Howe moche surer were it to committe your selfe to concorde?</p>
            <p>¶ If ye woll make war bycause of lucre, take your countours and caste: And I woll saye, it is better to haue warre than peace, if ye finde not, that not alonely lesse, but also vncertayne wynnynge is gotte with inesty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable costis.</p>
