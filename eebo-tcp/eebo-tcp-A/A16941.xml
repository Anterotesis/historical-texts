         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable, hauing vpon</hi> deligent search, apprehended within the compasse of my profession, and science of Heraldry, certaine errours in descentes and successions, such as may be scandolous to the gray heares of Antiquitie, and preiudiciall to the branches of our Nobilitie; I thought it my duetie to present them as Captiues at your Honors feete, being the vndoubted Champion of trueth, and the worthy Marshall of all Heroike magnanimitie and honour: vnto whom I humble my selfe for a fauourable censure, and protection of this my poore seruice. As no childe is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but the father commonly hath a naturall affection towardes it: so these errours will no doubt, be both fathered and fauoured of the Author; whose reputation for Learning is so great, and beard of Antiquitie lately growne so long, that the goodly Britannia, Mother of vs all, is become his

daughter, trayned vp, and taught to speake Latine in his Schoole; onely she lisps, and makes no good congruitie in these principles of Herauldy: For which I challendge him; not that my exception, and challendge, is about the wordes and tearmes of our Arte, (that is the least) but touching the falsifiyng of Noble discentes, depriuing some Nobles of issue to succeede them, who had issue, of whom are discended many worthie families. Naming others to haue but one sole Daughter and heyre, when they had diuers Sonnes and Daughters. Denying Barons, and Earles, that were: and making Barons and Earles of others, that were not: mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Father for the Sonne, and the Sonne for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: affirming legittimate children to be illigittimate, and illigittimate to be legittimate: those to be basely borne, who were in deede discended of very honourable Parentage: assigning Armes, and ensignes of Honour to others not their owne. Lastly, the framing incestious and vnnaturall mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, making the Father to marrie his Sonnes wife, and the Sonne his owne Mother. These, and such like matters of importaunce, are the errours that I haue examined, and attached, to abide your Honours censure and reformation: For whom, with bowed hart and knee, I pray to God, for all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of honor, harts content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and happie victorie.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here as You expect thankes at the handes of her Maiesties Heraults, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling so <hi>sparingly</hi> and <hi>gently</hi> with that, which appertaineth to their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Contrarie to your expectation, and answerable to your deserts, my selfe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most vnable) haue vndertaken to answere your vnkinde speeches: as also your vntrue, and erronious writing touching matters of our profession and science, published in your <hi>Britannia.</hi> In deede you dealt but <hi>sparingly,</hi> and after a sort <hi>gently</hi> (as you say) in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our misteries at the first: but in your fourth and last Edition (though your Preface spake as it did, <hi>sparingly still</hi>) yet your Booke hath swelled with large additions of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauldrie: in which you haue (by your patience) been too busie, and venterous; except your proceedinges, in those poyntes, had been more firmely grounded vpon experience. And I doubt not, but the grouth and encrease of your Booke hath sprung from some of those Heraults labours, which you so much holde in scorne. Nay, it can not be denyed, but since the death of <hi>Glouer,</hi> late Somerset Herault. 1588. you haue gleaned not onely handfuls, but whole sheaues, out of his industrious collections, being reserued in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie of that Honorable Lord Treasurer deceased, and by that meanes incommoned to your vse, and free recourse. I would his Gloues might haue fitted your handes in such sort, as you might haue smoothly carried them away: his Notes (I meane) I wish you had neither misunderstood,
<pb facs="tcp:9:4"/>
nor misreported; as contrariwise you haue, in such palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maner, that (me thinks) euer hereafter you should distrust your selfe in the search of such mysticall poyntes, without the aduice of an Herault better experimented then your selfe. I prognosticate alreadie, what entertainement in these mine aduertisementes, I shall haue: It will be obiected from your selfe, that I vnderstande not your Booke. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse mine intelligence not so great, but my feare is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and my care the more, to vnderstande you by helpes; so that the trust in my selfe is the lesse: And this suspition (I hope) will force me to make sure worke in that I vndertake. Valure (they say) may be too bolde, and Learning too full of quillities: the one standing more vpon the brauerie of his fyght, then the goodnes of the quarrell: the other, more vpon the generalitie of his knowledge, then the trueth of his cause. The mother tongue of euery Nation (as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme) is the best conseruer of Originall names: And your selfe endeuour to get a more ample credite in Historie, by auouching that you haue read ouer many home-bredd Historinas. By your example therefore, I am induced to beleeue that English Authors, and English Heraults (though they haue concealed their trauayles from the worlde, and not published a <hi>Rapiamus</hi> generall vpon euerie light occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) are to be credited for the trueth of English successions, discentes, and reportes, of all honorable designementes. Againe, who is more vnfit to describe the trueth of actions in their proper nature, then such affectate Nouices, as haue their mouthes and pennes running ouer with the foaming Muste of vn-refined Eloquence? who chouse rather to let the trueth of the matter slip, then to abate one title of their selfe-pleasing phrase. Therefore, I haue heard meny great statsmen affirme, that the Court hath affourded more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Wisemen for any actiue employment in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, then the Schooles: which falleth out especially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to these proceedinges of the one in Arte, there hath
<pb facs="tcp:9:4"/>
not been added some lecture of discretion to qualifie the same withall; which is to be had dayly by examples, and practise in the other. And doubtles for a meere Scholler to be an Historian, that must take vp all by hearesay, and vncertaine rumors, not being acquainted with the secretes, and occurrences of state matters, I take it (as many others affirme with me) verie vnfit, and dangerous. I hope you will (in some sort) acknowledge this to be true, if indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently you take a viewe of these errours by your selfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; a man of so rare knowledge, and singular industrie. Yet no one man so generally well seene in all thinges, but an inferior person in some one speciall matter, may goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde him. In regarde whereof, contemne not these few Collections of mine (wherein I haue not vaunted my Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but cleared the trueth, according to the oth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of an Herault) vnlesse learnedly with trueth you confute the same: Vntill then, I bid you farewell.</p>

Onlie the disgrace of auncient Herauldie: (wherwith England hath much flourished in former age,) the empeachment of manie

illustrious families, the misreport of many honorable discents, and the daungerous errors auouched by your lowd-sounding pen, I must repeale and reuerse with a writ of <hi>Quo warranto,</hi> least in time, the countenance of your world-wondred and selfe-conceited knowledge, cause naked truth to be helde in scorne of others, as it is in captiuitie by your selfe. My hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble requestis, that the honourable beholders of our combat blush not, nor the scholasticall Readers bite the lippe, to see an English Herauld encounter with an antique Hercules. Let not the fore-running breath of deepe renowmed science blow vp the weight of long experience: you may enioy the reputation of Artes, but in Armes and Herauldie we except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your skill. And because I intend onely a freedome of truth in matter of mine own profession, you shal vnderstand, that I wil not intermeddle with any other the commendable discoueries of Antiquitie, (beeing without the lists and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of mine exception) but onelie where the auncient pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degrees of honourable families are either clipped, or strange feathers imped into their traines: there am I bold to note the defects, and to declare the excesse that may make a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie progenie seeme some monstrous ofspring, if the truth bee not vnfolded. What cause I haue to vndertake this charge, may appeare by these fewe erronious slippes (gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of manie) in your <hi>Britannia.</hi> In the detection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I haue not followed your Methode, a long by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers side, from shire to shire, and towne to towne (for that were a iourney too tedious, and out of my way) but I haue fastened first vppon that noble Ferrarian line, whose present issue, so glorious at this time, seemeth to commaund a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse of that iniurious obscuritie, wherewith your superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all skill, or rather ignorance, hath somewhat eclipsed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer excellencie thereof.</p>
            <p>First therefore, I am prest to encounter you at the castle of Tutburie, in the honour of whose founders, I am to spend my first breath and valour: to the ende I may reuiue the race of

them which you haue ouerthrowne, by falsifying and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing foure discents in seuen. If you demaund how? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, in making Robert Earle Ferrars, grand-childe of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Lord Ferrars the Norman, to bee that Robert which did forfait all his landes to king Henrie the third: when in truth, it was the said Roberts great great grand-child. And therefore, to build vp againe this honourable discent and succession of the Earles Ferrars, (which you haue ruinated) I will first begin with Henry Lord Ferrars the Norman, vnto whom (by the booke of Domesday) William the Conquerour gaue manie large possessions in the counties of Stafford, Leicester, Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Glocester, Oxford, Bucking and Barkshire. He had issue Robert Earle Ferrars, who founded the Abbay of Muriuall, in king Henrie the first his time, and died the 19. of king Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen: whose eldest sonne William Earle Ferrars, and Lord of Tutburie being slaine in his lodging in Lumbards streete in London, without issue, Robert his second son succeeded, and was Earle Ferrars Lord of Tutburie and Oucam. He kept the towne of Leicester for king Henrie the second against the yong king, and had issue William Earle Ferrars, and first earle of Derbie, who maried Margaret, daughter and heire of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Peuerell Lord of Nottingham, and died the 12. of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the thirde, leauing issue William the second Earle Ferrars and Derbie his sonne: who tooke to wife Agnes, the third si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and coheire of Ranulph Earle of Chester and Lincolne: and died 1242. vnto whome succeeded the thirde William Earle Ferrars, and Derbie, who maried Margaret daughter and coheire of Roger Quincy earle of Winchester. On whom he be got Robert Earle Ferrars, and Derbie, who in the fiftie yeare of king Henrie the third, was taken prisoner at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of Chesterfield, and imprisoned in the castle of Chipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: where he for the obtaining of his liberty made assurance before Iohn Chishall then Lord Chancelor of England, of all his lands (except Chartley and Bolbroke) to Lorde Henrie sonne of the king of Romanes, William Valence Earle of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9:7"/>
Penbroke, Iohn earle Warren &amp; Surry, William Beauchamp earle of Warwicke, Roger Somery, Thomas Clare, R. Walle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Roger Clifford, Hamon le Strange, Bartholomew de Sudley, &amp; Robert Bruse, Barons, his suerties, for the paiment of 50000. poundes on a day, at one entire paiment, to Lord Edmond the Kings sonne. Which day &amp; paiment being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and not performed, the said Lord Edmond, by the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the sureties aforesaid, tooke possession of those his lands, and enioyed the same during his life: and after left them to his heires, the same being then valued at two thousand pounds by the yeare. And this is that Robert, whom you verie vntruly haue set downe to be grand-child to Henrie Lorde Ferrars that liued in the time of the Norman conquest, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the seuenth in line all discent from him: (as by your owne words in the title of Derby. pag. 430. it may appeare) where you confesse William to be the father, &amp; William the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of this Robert, that forfeited his lands in king Henrie the third his time. Now, to let you knowe the inconuenience arising hereby: It is the concealment and losse of three most notable inheritrices, that were married vnto three of these Ferrarian Earles. The first was the daughter and sole heire of William Peuerell, Lord of Nottingham (whose sonne was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the title of earle of Notingham.) The second was the sister, and coheire of Ranulph Earle of Chester and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne, who inriched this familie with the Castle and honour of Chartley. The third being the daughter and coheire of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Quincy Earle of Winchester, who brought with her the honor and barony of Grooby. Of which fruitfull mariages, if you make a fained nullitie, or deuorce, you intercept those noble plants, from whence sprung sundry the most famous branches of our nobilitie, florishing in this our declining age.</p>
            <q>CHartley Castle builded by Ranulph earle of Chester, came to<note place="margin">Chartley.</note> the Ferrars by Agnes his daughter, whom Robert earle Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rars and Derby maried: of whose progeny issued seuen barons Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rars
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9:7"/>
of Chartley: Anne daughter of the last of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, brought this title and honor by mariage, to Walter Deuereux her husband, who was the great-great-great grand-father of the right honorable Robert Earle of Essex that now is. <bibl>Pag. 449.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>WHere you affirme in this place, Ranulph Earle of Chester to haue builded the Castle of Chartley, which after came to be the possession of Robert earle Ferrars and Derby, by marying Agnes the daughter of the foresaide Ranulph: and that there did discend of the said Robert &amp; Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes seuen barons in direct line successiuely: hereto I answere, that Ranulph Earle of Chester builded indeed the castle of Chartley, in the fourth yeare of king Henry the third, &amp; died An. 1236. But that he was father to the said Agnes, I vtterlie denie: affirming him to die without any issue at all. And for proofe hereof, I appeale to your self, in perfect remembrance, testifying the same against your selfe, in the title of Earles of Chester, Pag. 471. And for the foresaid Robert Earle Ferrars, he neuer maried any such woman. So that by this your not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, you haue obscured and made vnperfect that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble line of the Earle Ferrars. Nay you haue done them a farre greater wrong, for hereby haue you (contrarie to all law and reason) made the said Agnes to be daughter to her owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the said Robert to be husband vnto her that was his grandfathers wife. By which vntrue wresting, you haue thrust out of their places, not only two of the greatest Earles of their time, but also the coheire of Quincy, who (as before I saide) brought into that family the barony of Grooby. Therfore that you may reforme this your error, I will here set you down the truth of this discent, prooued by good authoritie, beginning first with William Earle Ferrars and Derby, grandfather of the said Earle Robert, who maried the forenamed Agnes, the third sister, and coheire of the forenamed Ranulph Earle of Chester and Lincolne, (and not his daughter, as you haue written.) This saide William died in the 27. yeare of king Henrie the thirde, and left issue William Earle Ferrars,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9:8"/>
and Derbie, his sonne, Lord of Chartley, who maryed with Margaret Ladye of Grooby, daughter and coheire of Roger Quincy Earle of Winchester, on whome he begot Robert Earle Ferrars and Derby, and after died in the 38. yeare of king Henry the third. Which Robert was he that you would haue to mary Agnes the daughter of Ranulph Earle of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who was in trueth his grandmother. But for your further satisfaction, vnderstand, that the said Robert maryed to his wife the daughter of the Lord Basset, and was taken prisoner soone after by King Henry the third, in the Barrons warres, and forced to paye at one entyre payment for his ransome, &amp; deliuery, to Lord Edmond the Kings sonne, the summe of fiftie thousand poundes: for the assurance of which payment he bound ouer all his landes: as before in the title of <hi>Tutbury</hi> I haue set downe. He died in the seuenth yeare of king Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the first, 1278. leauing issue by his said wife, Iohn Lord Ferrars of Chartley, auncester to the Earle of Essex now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
            <q>REignald, base sonne to king Henry the first, was made Earle<note place="margin">Reignald earle of Cornewall.</note> of Cornewall, and after dyed without issue. <bibl>Pag. 130.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>IN making Reignald Earle of Cornewall to dye without is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, you offer great iniurie to diuers worshipfull families, depriuing them of their Auncestor from whome they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended. For the said Reignald had issue three daughters, his heires: one maryed to Baldwin Riduerse Earle of Deuon, of whome discended the honorable families of Courtneys: and an other to Valitort, of whose issue many remaine at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <q>KIng Richard the second honored William le Scroope, first,<note place="margin">Earles of Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</note> with the Earledome of Wiltshire. But the felicitie of this man did both stand, and fall with his Prince, &amp;c. Not many yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this dignitie came vnto Iames Butler Earle of Ormond. From
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9:8"/>
thence (the familie of Lancaster decaying) it went vnto Iohn Stafford, second sonne to Humfrey Duke of Buckingham, by the gift of king Edward the fourth: of which stocke, one or two succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. At last, a grand-childe of the forenamed Iames Butler, by his sonne, caryed this title into the familie of Bullens: for Thomas Bullen, in right of his mother, was created Earle of Wiltshire: whose eldest daughter Anne was maryed vnto king Henry the eight, and by him had issue, our soueraigne Lady Elizabeth: <bibl>Pag. 187.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>ALthough your rash, and ouer hastie penne, haue seemed vnto you so priuileged, as that thereby you durst aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the preiudice of many honorable persons in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents and ensignes of honor (as you haue done) yet me thinkes that her Maiesties sacred name might iustly haue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited your writings within such boundes of loyall duetie, as that your hand should haue trembled to endite, or your hart once to admitte the publishing any vntrueth, whereby her honor might in any part be eclipsed. Heere you say, that Iames Butler Earle of Wiltshire had a grand-childe (by his namelesse sonne) which was mother vnto Thomas Bullen Earle of Wiltshire, graund-father to the Queenes most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maiestie that now is: in which you greatly wrong her, she being not discended of the said Iames, but of Thomas Butler Earle of Ormond his brother. And the better to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the same, the said Iames was atteinted by Acte of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for high treason, &amp; suffered for the same at New-castle, in the first yeare of king Edward the fourth, without any issue of his body at all to beget such a grand-child, as you say, was the mother to Sir Thomas Bullen. Which being true (as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed) I admire that a man of your learning, and professing such skill in Heraldy, would so vnaduisedly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish in print, to the view of the whole worlde, so great an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth, you hauing neither proofe, nor warrant for the same. And not contented herewith, after, for maintenance and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of these your errors, you further affirme, that the said Sir
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9:9"/>
Thomas Bullen was created Earle of Wiltshire in right of Margaret his mother, graund-childe (as you say) of the said Iames. In which so saying, you shewe your selfe very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the discents of dignities. And for answere hereunto: First I say, that Margaret the mother of Sir Thomas Bullen was second daughter and coheire of Thomas Butler Earle of Ormond, brother of Iames Earle of Wiltshire, and not the saide Iames his grand-childe: and so in that poynt, haue you falsified this discent. Secondly, where you would haue this dignitie of Wiltshire to discend to Thomas Bullen in right of his mother, that doe I also denye: and for proofe thereof say, that the said Iames, being both the first and last Earle of Wiltshire of that surname, did by his attainture forfaite the same to king Edward the fourth: by reason whereof, the said honor reuerted to the crowne, and there remained vntill king Henry the eight, of his meere grace and great fauour, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe the same vpon Sir Thomas Bullen, grandfather to our most gracious soueraigne lady Queene Elizabeth. And thus was Sir Thomas Bullen aduaunced to this dignitie, and not as in any right discended to him from Iames Butler Earle of Wiltshire, from whome he did not discend.</p>

            <p>TO that part where you affirme, George Lord Cantelup of Abergaueny to haue issue a daughter and heire mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the Baron Zouch: I answere, that the said George had no daughter at all, but dyed without issue: as by his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice taken after his death, in the first yeare of king Edward the

            </q>
            <p>HAccombe was neuer the Mansion or possession of Fitz-Stephens: but alwayes the seate and inheritance of the familie of Haccombs, and did continewe in that surname vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till their heire generall was maryed to Archdeacon.

            </q>
            <p>IN this place haue you committed a dangerous error, to the hazard of disinheriting many honorable families, by publishing in print, that Henry Holland duke of Exceter, had issue one sole daughter and heire, maryed to the familie of Neuills: when as it is manifest, that after his depriuation by Act of Parliament, the first of Edw. the fourth, he was found drowned in the sea, the 12. yeare of the said kings reigne, without any issue: and therefore, no such daughter of his could be maryed to Neuil (as you affirme.) And that you may the better knowe the said Henry Holland, as also his coate of armes, I wish you to see his tumbe, where he lyeth buryed in the South-side of Saint Peters Church at Westminster, which you haue heretofore auouched to be the tumbe of Iohn of Eltham Earle of Cornewall.

            <p>HEre doe you wrong this discent of the Earles of Deuon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, making Baldwin Ryuers to be the first Earle of Deuonshire, and Lord of Twyfferton and Plympton, in king Henry the first his time: when as it is very manifest, that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Ryuers, father of this Baldwin was the same person vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome king Henry the first gaue Twifferton, Plimpton, and the yle of Wight, with the Earledome of Deuonshire, and not to Baldwin his sonne (whome you name:) as is very well prooued by the booke of Brightley and Forde, where those of that familie doe lye buryed, as also by your owne Testimonie against your selfe, in the tittle of Iles, in your booke, Pag. 710. Secondly, to your affirmation, that Baldwin the third Earle of Deuon did change his Auncestors Escucheon gules a griffon gold, vnto a shield golde a Lyon azure: I answere, it is a fault in a meane person to be founde vntrue in his reportes, much more in you to publish in print such an vntrueth as this: for you can not euer prooue the said shielde gules with the griffon golde to haue bene borne or vsed by any of the said familie: or any other Armes at all of theirs can you shewe, vntill that Baldwin the third did vse for his Armes the foresaid Lyon azure vpon golde. Thirdly, because in the beginnning of this succession of Earles of Deuon you abridged vs of the first, now to make amendes for the same, and to fill vp the number againe, you doe here name for an Earle of Deuon, William de Fortibus, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer as yet attayned vnto that dignitie.

Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, you say, the said Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de Curcy had a grand-childe by his sonne William, called Auice, maryed to Warrin Fitz-Gerald, who had issue a daughter and heire ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to Baldwin Earle of Deuon. In which you are also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: For, the first William (as I saide before) had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny issue at all, and therefore no such grand-childe. And where you affirme the said Warin Fitz-Gerald to haue issue by Auice his wife but one onely daughter: it is manifest that he had issue a sonne named Warin Fitz-Gerald, who had is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the third Warin Fitz-Gerald.

Edward aforesaide liued in the twentith yeare of William the Conquerour. Walter his sonne buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Monasterie at Bradenstocke, wherein he became a Monke: yet hee first left issue a sonne called Patrike, (By Sybill de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth his wife) which Patrike was the first Earle of Salisburie, and was slaine comming out of the holie lande (by Guy de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signan:) to whome succeded William his sonne, which died at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris in the time of King Richarde the first.

            </q>
            <p>THe more plainlie to decipher your errours in this title of Salisburie, I will first beginne with Edwarde d'Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux, whom I finde to liue in the 21. yeare of King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the Conquerour, and to bee a witnesse to the said kings Charter touching the foundation of the Abbay of Selbie, by the name of Edward Earle of Salisburie. Which proueth, that Patrike his grand-childe was not then the first Earle of Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie, of that familie (as you affirme.) Secondly, where you hold for a certaintie, that Walter the sonne of Edward afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said (before his monasticall profession) left issue to succeede him, Patrike his sonne. To that I answere, that Sybill his wife, after the death of the said Walter her husband, took vpon her the habit of a Nunne, and hauing continued in that estate but one moneth, &amp; perceiuing her selfe to be with child, forsooke that order again, and afterwards was deliuered of a son, which was named Patrike, who was after steward to Maude the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse: by whose meanes king Henry the second, in the 28. yeare of his reigne, confirmed vnto the said Patrike the earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Salisburie. Thirdly, concerning your affirmation, that William sonne of the said Patrike had but one only daughter named Ella, maried to William Longa-Spatha, who in her right was Earle of Salisbury, and did beare her Armes. To this I say, you do hereby greatly preiudice the honorable familie of Howards: for, the said William had not onely two sonnes, but also two daughters (as appeareth by the booke of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondsey in Southwarke) viz. Patrike, William, Mabell, and Ella. Mabell was maried to Nigell Lord Mowbray, of whom all the Howards, with many others are discended: Ella was maried vnto William Longa-Spatha, base sonne to Henrie the second, who afterward by the speciall fauour of King Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard the first, in the 9. yeare of his reigne, was made Earle of Salisburie: and not in right of his wife (as you would haue
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9:15"/>
it.) And where you say, the said <hi>William Longa-Spatha and Ella had issue William, who succeeded his father in that dignitie, and left issue the third William, which lost that Earledome through displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of King Henrie the third.</hi> I answere, that I maruaile howe you can inuent two so great vntruths, as, first to affirme these two last Williams to be Earles of Salisburie, when neither of them both were euer Earles, either of that or anie other place. And that the saide William did vse or beare the Armes of his wife, I take it, you haue no other proofe for the same then your owne bare imagination: which with you is verie great. Lastly, where you affirme Henrie Lacie to bee Earle of Salisburie, in right of his wife, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and heire of the last William Longa-Spatha: I say that neither hee the saide Henrie, nor any other of his Surname were euer at anie time honoured with that title or Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And nowe, to manifest the mariage of the Lorde Nigell de Mowbray with Mabell daughter of William Fitz-Patrike, I will set you downe for proofe, the said Nigels deed, which is as followeth.</p>

After that, by the bountie of king Edward the fourth, Lewis of Bruges, a Belgian, Baron of Gruthuse, and Prince of Stenhuse, enioyed this title, with the Armes of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: Which title, after the death of King Edwarde aforesaide, he surrendered againe to King Henrie the seuenth. <bibl>Pag. 197.</bibl>

            <p>VVHom you vnderstand by the terme of our Heralds, I knowe not: my selfe being one of her Maiesties Heralds, do approue for truth that Seer de Quincy was Earle of Winchester, and did vse in his shield for his Armes, a Fesse, and a Labell of 13. points, and not of 5. (as you misreport to haue seene in his seales. And, to proue my assertion true, I haue diuerse deedes with the Seales of the saide Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in my custody, made aswell in the reigne of king Richard the first, as in the times of king Iohn, and Henry the third. As for Hugh Spencer, he was made Earle of Winchester, &amp; high Treasurer of England in the 15. yeare of King Edwarde the second, and in the 19. yeare of the said kings reigne hee was executed at Bristow by Queene Isabell: so that the dignitie ceased in himselfe, and not in his sonne (as you affirme) who neuer had, or was possessed of that dignitie. Lastly, where you say, that King Edward the fourth did giue to Lewes of Bruges the Earledome of Winchester, with the Armes of Quincies: I answere, you haue not onelie misreported the same: but also shewed your selfe to be very ignorant in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Armes, for those Armes giuen by Edward the fourth to Lewes of Bruges, were neither the armes of Quincies, nor any thing at all resembling the same. And for proofe hereof, I pray you let vs a little compare them both togither: first the armes giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by K. Ed. 4. to the said Lewes were, Azur ten mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles gold: the armes of Quincies were, Gules 7. masclesgold: Bruges did beare in his armes a canton Gules charged with a Lion passant gardant of the second: Quincy had neither Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton nor Lion in his Armes. So that here is neither colour nor
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9:16"/>
charge, to induce a man of any iudgement or knowledge, to thinke or say, that this gift of Edward the fourth was the Armes of Quincy. And for better proofe hereof, I will here insert the wordes of king Edwardes graunt, concerning the gift of the said Armes.</p>

            <p>THe great trouble, and late suite in the Starre-chamber, for setting downe in Pedigree a forged heire generall of Anthony Lord Grey of Ruthin, to the great danger of of disinheriting an honorable person now liuing, might be a warning both to you, &amp; others, how they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the like fault hereafter. Which notwithstanding, I see it is not regarded, for that not long since I haue seene a petigree made by your selfe, more faultie then that before spoken of: which to let passe, I will come to answere this title of Wallingford. Here you affirme, Robert d' Oyley to haue issue a daughter and heire named Maude, maryed to Miles Crispine: by which imagined heire, you wrong most of the honorable families of this Realme now liuing, discended of the said d'Oylye. And to redresse this, I will heere set you downe the true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the said Robert d'Oylye: in which it shal appeare, no such daughter euer to haue bene (as you affirme.) First by the booke of Domesday it is set downe, that William the Conqueror did giue vnto Robert d'Oylye these landes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: Watelinton, Garinges, Bernecester, Hochenorton, Chedelinton, Eton, and Braiton, with many other goodly possessions in the countie of Oxford. Likewise in the booke of Osney I finde, that in the time of the Norman conquest, there liued two brothers of the familie of d'Oyleys, Robert, and Nigell: and that Robert dyed without issue, leauing Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert (his nephew by his brother Nigel) to succeede him in his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9:17"/>
possessions. Also by diuers euidences in my custodie, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that the foresaid Robert the nephew, founded the Abbey of Osney in the time of king Henry the first, and had issue Henry d' Oyley Constable to king Henry the second: to whome succeeded the second Henry d' Oylye his sonne, that was likewise Constable to king Richard the first, and died without issue, leauing Margaret his sister and coheire, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to Henry Newborough Earle of Warwicke: of whome that great and honorable familie of Beauchamps Earles of Warwicke did discend. So that hereby you may see the true line of heires males continued from the first Robert, in William the Conquerors time, vnto Richard the first, very apparantly prooued: to the ouerthrow and auoyding of your feigned heire generall. Whereby also you may take a caueat, to alter &amp; recall in againe your late coyned pettigree, being of the same stampe. For proofe, read these deedes following.</p>

To the first I answere, the said Thomas Beauford was neuer dignified with the title of Duke of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey, by K. Henry the fourth, or any other king.

From this William discended successiuely eleuen Barons all called Williams, except the third, and seuenth, which were called Reignalds. Margaret the sole daughter of the last of them, maried Robert Hungerford: by whose posteritie that inheritaunce came to the familie of Hastings.

            </q>
            <p>FIrst, in making Botreaux and Boterell to be all one family, and name, you do much erre: they being seuerall, and not one: as may be proued by William Botreaux Sherif of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, who liued in the ninth yeare of king Iohn, and bare for his Armes (as you fay) three Todes Sable: and William Bote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, that liued in the fift yeare of king Edward the first, (and was summoned amongst other Barons, for the leuying of an armie against Llewellin Prince of Wales) did beare for his Armes, checkie gold and Gules a cheueron Azur. By which two great differences, both of the name, and Armes, it doth euidently appeare, that they were not one, but two seuerall families. Secondly, in affirming that William Botreaux maried Alice the daughter of Richard Corbet, sister to her that was Paramour to king Henrie the first, and mother to Reignald Earle of Cornwall, you are also greatly deceiued: for the mother of the said Reignald, was daughter and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heire of Robert Corbet, and not of Richard: as by the gift of king Henrie the first, to the saide Robert his Concubines fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the borough of Alencester, in the Countie of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke, it is manifested. But I need not striue much against you for this point, seeing I may oppose your owne narration, pag. 438. of your booke, against your selfe: and therefore I leaue
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9:20"/>
you to quarell with your owne memorie, not doubting, but you can take it best, to bee controller to your selfe. Thirdly, your Arithmeticall pen, can as well multiplie, for a neede, as detract when it list, hauing as quicke a slight to make Barons, as the heathens had to make gods, which were something in name, but manie times nothing in nature: for here you make eleuen Barons of the familie of Botreaux, one to succeede the other, after the first William. Whereas you are able to proue but foure. And to make your computation aright, you must begin first with William Botreaux, who began his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronie, at a Parliament holden at Westminster the first day of May, in the 24. yeare of king Edward the third: which Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam had issue William, that was the second Baron: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat William the third, father of William the fourth, and last Baron of that familie. Of which second, and third Barons, you haue made the father to marry his sonnes wife, and the sonne to marry his own mother. To which most vnnatural matches I wonder how you could euer giue your consent, you being the onely parent of seuen of those eleuen Barons, who had all their conceptions and births in the wombe of your pregnant braine. Lastly, I denie that any of the saide Williams, Lordes Botreaux, did marie with anie Katherine that was coheire to Katherin Twenge, as you vntruly haue set downe.</p>

Which foresaid honours the said Stephen enioyed, and afterward gaue the same to Henrie of Bloys his sonne: who enioied the same, vntil he resigned them vnto Richard his sonne, and became Abbot of Glastenburie, and after Bishop of Winchester. This Richard being Earle of the Eagle, and Lord of Pemsey, liued in King Stephens time, and was a witnesse to the couenants of peace betwixt him and Henrie Duke of Normandie, by the name of Richard Earle of the Eagle. He gaue his said Earledome, and honour of Pemsey, to William Earle of Morton his Cosen germane, sonne to King Stephen. Which gift, with the said titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, King Henrie the second did confirme: but not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he constrained the said William to surrender vnto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, aswel those honours, as also all other lands that he had, both in Normandie, and in England, vpon condition, that the said king should re-assure vnto him al those lands which king Stephen his father was possessed of, at the death of king Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the first. And how truly you affirme, the honour of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey to haue belonged to any Earle Morton before the reigne of King Stephen (William sonne to king Stephen being the first Earle Morton which enioyed the same) it is thought as vnworthie of credit, as that before, where you alledge, Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey castle to haue taken his first honour from Gilbert Lord of the Eagle, in the reigne of King Henrie the second when it is trulie proued, to bee an honour at such time as William the Conquerour gaue the same in marriage with his daughter.</p>

            <p>IN this succession of Albeneys, Earles of Sussex, you haue taken great paines, making fiue of that surname, to haue beene Earles both of Sussex and Arundell: when as you can prooue but foure in all to haue beene Earles of that familie, and but two of them Earles of Sussex, viz. William, whom king Henrie the second made the first Earle of Sussex, and Hugh his sonne, who died without issue, in the 27. yeare of king Henrie the third: for that VVilliam whom you call the fourth Earle of Arundell, I deeme as yet neuer borne. And the first VVilliam, which married Queene Aelidise, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of King Henrie the first, who you say was both earle of Sussex and Arundell, I make great doubt of, thinking you not able to make proofe he was Earle of either.

Which fault (notwithstanding) I woulde wish you to amende in your next edition: and also to take away from this Richard (his grandchilde) the title of Earle, vntill such time as you haue a better commission for making of Earles.

            <q>THe Creuecueurs, (so named de crepito-corde) builded the<note place="margin">Leeds castle.</note> Castell of Leedes: of which familie, the first was Robert, who had issue Daniell, that was father to Robert, who had issue Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which married the daughter and heire of the Baron of

            </q>
            <p>TO reconcile your contradictions, in these two titles of Leedes Castle, and Folkestone, I thinke it a verie harde matter: for in the first you say, <hi>That Hamon Creuecueur (who marryed the daughter and heire of the Baron of Folkestone (had issue Hamon, that succeeded him: which Hamon had issue Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, who dying without issue, gaue his patrimonie to king Edwarde the first.</hi> And after, in the title of Folkestone you affirme the contrarie: saying, <hi>That the same Hamon had issue a daughter that carried Folkestone, by her marriage, to Iohn of Sandwich.</hi> By which thus still ouermuch busying your selfe in matters passing your skill, it maketh you so forgetfull, that oftentimes you are faine to vtter matters incoherent, and much contradictorie. Wherefore vnderstande, that Hamon Creuecueur, (who you say married the daughter and heire of the Baron of Folkestone) had issue Hamon, who succeeded his father: and he had issue Robert, (which died without issue) and foure daughters: Eleonor married to Bertram Criell, Agnes to Iohn of Sandwich, Isolde to Nicholas Lenham, and Isabell to Henrie Hawt. Of which foure daughters you haue left out the first, and two last, naming but onely the second, married to Iohn of Sandwich: who was not the daughter of the first Hamon (as you affirme) but of the second, whom you haue casscered out of this discent. And whereas, in the title of Leedes castle, you say, that the last Robert Creuecueur, dying without issue, gaue his patrimonie to K. Edward the first. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9:23"/>
I answer there unto, I first demaund of you, how that may be? When your selfe, in the title of Folkstone, haue set downe the said Roberts sister to carie Folkestone by her marriage to Iohn of Sandwich: which was a part of the said Roberts patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And for direct proofe, that the said Robert did not giue his patrimony to king Edward the first (as you haue said:) it appeareth by an inquisition taken after the death of the saide Robert, in the thirtieth yeare of King Edward the first, that his foresaide foure sisters were his heires, and that Eleonore the eldest had for her part of her brothers inheritance, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Estwell in Kent, and Agnes the second sister had Folkestone: the other two had other landes that descended to the said Robert from his auncestors, which I take to be his patrimonie.</p>
            <q>HVbert de Burgo, was made Earle of Kent by king Henry the<note place="margin">Earles of Kent.</note> third, and died without issue, <bibl>Pag. 262.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>IF this be true, that Hubert de Burgo Earle of Kent dyed without issue (as you here report hee did) then doth the now Lord de La-ware wrong, to quarter the said Huberts Coate of Armes, pretending thereby to bee his heire. But whether the said honourable person doth wrong therein, or you wrong him in so saying? Let vs examine this matter a little better. First it doth appeare in a summons of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of this realme, for the leuying of an army against Llewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin Prince of Wales, in the fift yeare of king Edward the first, that Iohn de Burgo, Baron of Lammale, grandchilde to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert by his sonne Iohn, was by the name of Iohn, sonne of Iohn de Burgo, called thereunto. Also by an inquisition taken after the death of the said Iohn, in the same kings reign, it was found, that Deruergulda the wife of of Robert Fitz-Walter Lord of Woodham, and Hawise the wife of Robert Greylie of Manchester, were the daughters and heires of the said Iohn de Burgo, and that the foresaide Hawise did holde
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9:23"/>
of the inheritance of Hubert de Burgo her great grandfather, the Mannor of Werkerley in Northamptonshire, and the Mannor of Portland in Essex. Which discent being thus farre prooued to Greyley, I doubt not but you will confesse, that Ioan the onelie daughter of the saide Robert Lord Greyley was married to Iohn Lord de La-ware. Which done, I hope you will yeeld your selfe to haue erred herein, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the said noble person now to be right heire, and that the said Hubert died not without issue, as you very daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously haue affirmed he did.</p>

I haue read in the historie of Teukesbury, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the time of the Conquest, Bithricke a Saxon was Lorde of Glocester, who was much hated of Maude the Conquerors wife, because he before that despised to take her to his wife. In reuenge of which disgrace, she caused him to be imprisoned, and dispossessed of all his honors and landes. Whose titles and possessions were after giuen to Robert Fitz-Hamon, the son of Hamon of Corbule: whose onely daughter and heire, named Sibill, was marryed to Robert Fitz-Roy, base sonne to king Henry the first: Who was made the first Earle of Glocester, commonly called the Consull of Glocester.

            <p>YOu heere charge the Heraldes with thrusting vpon you one Earle that you cannot finde, nor thinke as yet euer to haue bene borne.

Wherefore, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to satisfie you, and those that haue written Peter Gaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston to be Earle of Glocester, and to haue succeeded Raphe Mont-Hermerye.

Earle of Clare in William the Conquerors time: and now here, you affirme that Gilbert his sonne was the first Earle of Clare, of that familie. And againe, in the title of Dunmowe, there haue you set downe this Robert the third sonne of Earle Richard, truely, to be the sonne of the first Richard that came into this land with William the Conqueror: but here will you haue him to be great grand-child to the same Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard. Which by no meanes, the now Earle of Sussex will consent vnto, because thereby he shall loose two of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test auncestors, with their wiues, they being the daughters and heires of Saint-Lyce Earle of Northampton, and the Lord Lucy: which were both marryed, the one to the said Robert, and the other to Walter his sonne: as more plainely doth appeare by the true discent here following. Richard sonne of Gilbert Earle of Angy in Normandye, was Lorde of Tunbridge and Clare in England, by the gift of William the Conqueror, and had issue Gilbert Earle of Clare, Roger that dyed without issue, 1173. and Robert who was Sewer to king Henry the first, and Lord of Dunmow, by the said kings gift.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9:29"/>
or escucheon, a bend fuzulie. Also I shewed a transcript of an other deed of the said Iohn, in which was written: Iohn, sonne of Iohn the Kinges Marshall, with the same Armes, of a bend fuzulie, testified vnder the hand of an Officer of armes, long before that time deceased. Lastly, I shewed an old roll of Armes, wrought in colorus, in Henrie the thirds time: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the same coate, viz. Gules a bende fuzulie golde, and ouer the heade thereof written the name of Marshall.

For further maintaining of which your speach, you then shewed two newe petegrees, lately contriued and made by your consent, declaring the saide two Marshals to bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall families, and not one. Since which time (perusing well your Britannia (fol. 360,) I finde the same there auouched by yourselfe for truth, which at that time you so confidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied before the said Earle Marshall: viz. That Iohn Marshall Baron of Rhia, was nephew to William Marshall Earle of Penbroke by his brother: which is quite contrarie to your speeches before vsed. By this your information of these Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals to be seuerall families (without which you had no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to maintaine your errour: for that the Barons of Rhia alwayes vsed for their coate of Armes the said bend fuzulie) the right coate of Marshall, is like now to bee neglected, and the Lion in the parted field vsed in stead thereof, the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peculiar coate borne by Marshall and Bygot, when they were Marshals of Englnd, and not belonging to anie one priuate name: as by many other good proofes it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.

            <p>IF your wordes here had beene but coniecturall, or gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by reports, as in many other places they are, you should haue lesse discredited your selfe, then by affirming you had seene that, which in truth you did neuer see: for where you say: <hi>We thinke that the Bygots builded this Castle, because wee haue there seene Lions saliant in the same forme engrauen in stone as the Bygots vsed in their seales before they obtained the honour and office of Marshall:</hi> certaine it is, that on the said Castle there are no Lions saliant, nor any such Ensigne or token as the Bygots did beare in seale or shield, or any Armes at all. And, for that you did of late, (as before) vpon conference had before the now Earle Marshall of England, affirme the saide Lious saliant vpon the Castle walles of Norwich, to bee the true Armes of the Bygots, before they came to bee Marshals of England, my selfe hauing seene diuerse deedes of the said Bygots to prooue the contrarie, the Seales whereof were, Shieldes charged onelie with a plaine Crosse, (which coate you then auouched to be the Armes of Vlster) whervpon, I for my better satisfaction therein, did ride to Norwich for to search the truth of your speach: and going into the said castle, I founde ouer the first gate, two great stones fixed, of some yarde square, and vppon each of them a Lyon pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant cowardie, their tayles turning vnder their bellies, and comming ouer their backes, but in no Shielde or Escu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon. And seeking more diligentlie all other places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the saide Castle, I did finde ouer the hall doore, other two like stones, with a Lyon also vppon each of them, but contrarie to the former, for these were passant, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants with their tayles ouer their backes, and the endes in their mouthes: yet neither in Shielde, nor Escucheon.

            </q>
            <p>THe errors herein are these: first you say, that <hi>Hugh Bygot was Earle of Norfolke, and had the third pennie of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (as appeareth by his Charter of creation, giuen him by king H. the first.</hi> For answere I say: you haue not seene, nor can proue any such Charter as you here auouch: neither was he the said Hugh, or any of that familie Earle before the first yeare of king Stephen, who then made him Earle of Norfolke: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he being present at the death of king Henrie the first,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9:32"/>
testifie before the Archbishop of Canterburie and other the Barons of this realme, that hee heard king Henry vpon his death bed say, his will was, that his Nephew Stephen, and not Maude his daughter, should succeede him in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of England.</p>
            <p>Secondly, where you reckon a confused succession of these Earles: saying, <hi>That from the first Hugh in Henry the first time, succeeded in direct line from father to sonne, Hugh that tooke parte against king Henry the second, &amp;c.</hi> To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that you were in a Labyrinth, not able to finde out what issue there was betwixt the first and second Hugh. And to vnfolde this your error: I affirme, that the first Hugh, and those that you say succeeded betweene from father to sonne, to that Hugh, whome you name the second, were all but one person: for he that was Steward to king Henry the first, and was after made Earle of Norffolke by king Stephen, was the same person that liued in the time of king Henry the second, and that tooke part with the yong king against his father.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, where you affirme, that the last Earle Roger sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred all his honors, and almost all his inheritance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to king Edward the second, it seemeth a matter vnto me very vnlike, that the said Roger dying in the life of king Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the first, could in the reigne of king Edward the second make any such surrender. But here haue you done very wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in leauing out the cause of the kings displeasure against the said Roger: for therein would you haue disclosed your owne error. But, because I would not haue you ignorant of the same, king Edward the first in the fifteenth or sixteenth yeare of his reigne, required this Roger Bygot Eerle of Norf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, Gilbert de Clare Earle of Glocester, and Humfrey de Bohun then Earle of Hereford, to goe with him into France: whose request these three noble persons refused, whereupon, at the said kings returne againe into England, he forced Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert de Clare, and Humfrey de Bohun the yonger sonne of the soresaid Humfrey, to marrye with two of his daughters,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9:32"/>
without either land or money, and the said Roger Bygot (to appease the kings indignation) did make ouer vnto him most part of his landes, with the office of Marshall of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

            <p>BEfore I enter to open your errors in this succession of the Earles of Huntingdon, I would entreate you, of this number of eleuen Earles, to put out fiue of them at the least. And because you shall take them right, I will first nominate vnto you those which ought to stand, beginning with Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the of Earle of Northumberland, vnto whome William the Conqueror gaue in mariage with Iudith his neece the Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Huntingdon, &amp; Northampton. This Walthe of had issue Maude, who was giuen in marriage vnto Dauid, brother to Alexander king of Scots: which Dauid was after a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the Charter of king Henry the first, touching landes and liberties that the said king gaue vnto the Cittie of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by the name of Dauid Earle of Huntingdon. After the death of Dauid, the foresaid Maude was marryed againe to Simon Sant-lize a Norman gentleman, who had with her the Earledome of Northampton. Dauid before named, had issue Henry, who in the life of his father was Earle of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon, and dyed in the 18. yeare of king Stephen, leauing issue three sonnes, Malcolme, William, and Dauid. Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colme being king of Scottes, rebelled against king Henry the second: for which cause, the king seised into his handes the Earledome of Huntingdon. After the said Malcolmes death, William his brother succeeded him in the kingdome of Scotland. He likewise rebelled against his Lorde king Henry the second, and being taken prisoner, was caryed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Normandie, <hi>Anno 1174.</hi> Where he compounded to pay for his raunsome ten thowsand markes, and to release all his title and interest of the Earledomes, both of Huntingdon, and Northumberland. After which, king Henry gaue the Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Huntingdon to Dauid, the third sonne of Dauid Earle of Huntingdon before mentioned. Which Dauid was a witnesse to the Charter of king Richard the first, of landes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9:33"/>
that he gaue to the Abbey of Peterborough, <hi>Anno 1189.</hi> by the name of Dauid Earle of Huntingdon. He dyed in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeare of king Henry the third, and left issue Iohn his sonne, surnamed Scotte, who succeeded him: which dyed without issue in the 22. yeare of king Henry the third. Thus haue I rightly set downe the succession of the Earles of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon, vnto Iohn surnamed Scotte: which vnlesse you can by good authorities disproue (as I assure my selfe you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not) I hope you will not onely confesse your error: but will abate in your next impression those fiue, which in deede were neuer Earles of Huntingdon: vidz. Syward who was but Earle of Northumberland: then the three Simons Sant-lizes, that were Earles of Northampton onely, and lastly, William king of Scottes.</p>

And to the other, <hi>That Ralph Neuell Earle of Westmerland, did purchase the said inheritance and honour, of Iohn Lord Latymer of Danby, for his younger sonne George:</hi> I graunt for true, that he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Landes, but not the dignitie: for Iohn Neuill that solde the said landes, had no fee simple in the dignitie to sell but onely an estate for tearme of life: therefore can you
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9:42"/>
not rightly say that Ralph Neuill Earle of Westmerland, did purchase the dignitie which George his sonne enioyed. But more agreeable to the trueth had it been, if you had said, that George sonne of Ralph Neuill in regarde that he had the Landes whereof the dignitie of Latymer was erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, obtained the honour by the Kinges free gyft and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, otherwise that title and dignitie had been extinct: for seldome shall you finde, that the Kinges of this Realme did euer create or inuest any into a Baronie, which tooke the name of dignitie from an others peculiar place of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance or possession.</p>

            <p>I Doe much pittie you, that in such high sayles of learning, you should haue so little ballace of discretion: You haue a great facilitie, and a rare gift in the creating and making of Barons with the dash of your penne: But it argueth how shallow you are in the true definition of a Baron, in that you will publish in print that the familie of Cornwalles were Barons of Burford; you being not able euer to make proofe of any one of them, to haue had that dignitie. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, diuers of that surname haue been Knightes: of which number, king Henrie the sixt did erect Sir Iohn Cornwall to be a Baron, and Peere of this Realme, by the name and title of Lord Fanhope: which Iohn, was both the first and last Baron of that familie; and therefore it standeth now with your credite, to make proofe of these your Barons of Burford: which, I thinke, wilbe too hard and difficult a matter for you to doe.</p>

            <p>IS it possible? or, do you thinke to perswade any senscible man to beleeue, that this late borne Britannia was of your owne collection? (you as it seemeth, not vnderstanding the same.) No, assure yourselfe: for who knoweth not, that the contentes thereof are neither taught, nor learned amongst children in Schooles, and your selfe neuer employed els where to attaine the knowledge thereof. Many learned, thinke it more fitter you had waded within the compasse of your owne profession and knowledge, in which your errours would not so apparently haue been descried, as heere they are. In this Title of Earles of Worcester, you make <hi>Walleron to be the first Earle of Worcester: and that his issue did depart this Realme to their auncient patrimonie in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie:</hi> By which, if it were true, then were there none of that progenie to be looked for heere in this Realme of England (to the great preiudice of many honorable Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies descended of the said Walleron.) But to reforme this your errour, I wish you to vnderstande that the foresaid Walleron, had issue Robert Earle of Millent, Worcester, and Lord of Ponttadomara: which Robert did remaine heere in England, and maried an English woman named Mauld, Lady of Estrumenister, Moreys, and Rydlestone; And by her had issue Henrie, Peter, Mabell, and Mary: the two sonnes, and the youngest daughter, dying without issue; Mabell the eldest daughter, was married to William de Vernon, <hi>alias</hi> Ryduers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Earle of Deuonshire; and had issue Bauldwyn Earle of Deuonshire, and Mary, first mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9:43"/>
vnto Sir Robert Courteney, by whom she had issue: (of whom all the Courteneys are descended:) After she married Peter de Prouz, a noble Gentleman of Deuon: to which Peter, the said Robert Earle of Millent and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, did by his deede giue in franke marriage with the said Marie his grand-child, the third part of all his Land in England; and vnto Bauldwin his gran-child (by his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mabell) all his Land in Normandie, with the Mannors of Estrumenister, Moreyes, and Riddleston in England. So that heere you are not onely found to faile in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, that there was not any Earle of Worcester be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the said Walleron in King Stephens time, and Thomas Percy, who had that dignitie of Richard the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: But also, in saying his issue returned to their auncient Patrimonie in Normandie; when it is manifest that his sole heire continued here, and left issue: of whom are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended many of our noble Families at this present.</p>

            <head>An inforced Conclusion.</head>
            <p>WHen as I had collected readie for the Presse, so many of your defectes and errors, (published in your so highly commended <hi>Britannia</hi>) as might well haue satisfied the worlde, that I vndertooke not this worke in vaine, nor yet without good cause me moouing thereunto. Then was I stayed in the printing thereof, by the disturbance and indirect dealing of your friendes the Stationers, (who heretofore haue made no small gaine of your foure former Impressions) and thereby constrayned abruptly heere to make an ende, suppressing a great part of my first pretended purpose: yet before I doe ende, I thinke it my duetie, heere to put the Nobilitie in minde, that your Booke now going in hand, may be both seene, and alowed, before it goe to the Presse, by such as haue both skill, and authoritie so to doe: (I meane the Earle Marshall) and not to passe as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath done, to the preiudice of so many honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Families. And to the ende the worlde may know with whose plumes you haue heretofore fethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your nest (besides the Heraults) I haue hereunto annexed a New-yeeres gyft, dedicated to king Henrie the eight in the. 37. yeere of his reigne, by that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and learned Englishe Antiquarie Maister Iohn Leyland, concerning his sixe yeeres trauayle, and

laborious Iourney for the search of Englandes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, vpon the sayd Kinges commission and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: by which it may appeare vnto the indifferent Reader, who was the first Author and contriuer of this late borne <hi>Britannia,</hi> either he whose name is cleane razed and blotted out, or you that haue both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the tytle and whole credite thereof to your selfe. Also, I may not heere let passe the wordes of Maister Iohn Bale in his declarations vpon the same worke, dedicated to King Edward the sixt: which are these following. <hi>Blessed be the man which shall set this worthy worke abrode: and contrarywise, Cursed be he for euer and euer, that shall in spight of his Nation, seeke thereof the distruction.</hi>

            <p>WHere as it pleased your Highnesse, vpon very iust considerations, to encorage me, by the authoritie<note place="margin">Studium anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatis in principe.</note> of your most gratious Commission, in the XXXV. yeere of your prosperous reigne, to peruse, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to search all the Libraries of Monasteries and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of this your noble Realme, to the intent that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of auncient Writers, as well of other Nations as of your owne Prouince, might be brought out of deadly dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to liuely light, and to receiue like thankes of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, as they hoped for at such time, as they employed their long and great studies to the publique wealth.</p>
            <p>Yea, and furthermore, that the holy Scripture of God might both be sinceerely taught and learned, all maner of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,<note place="margin">Cura religionis in principe.</note> &amp; craftie coloured doctrine of a route of Romane Byshops, totally expelled out of this your most catholique Realme. I thinke it now no lesse then my very duetie, briefly to declare to your Maiestie, what fruite haue sprung of my laborious iourney and costly enterprise, both rooted vpon your infinite goodnesse &amp; liberalitie: qualities right highly to be esteemed in all Princes, and most specially in you, as naturally your owne well knowne proprieties.</p>
            <p>First, I haue conserued many good Authors, the which<note place="margin">Exemplaria veterum autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum conseruata<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> otherwise had bin like to haue perished, to no small incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
<pb facs="tcp:9:46"/>
of good Letters. Of the which part remaine in the<note place="margin">Auctae Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecae palatinae.</note> most magnificent Libraries of your royall Palaces. Part also remaine in my custodie; whereby I trust right shortly, so to describe your most noble Realme, and to publish the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of the excellent actes of your progenitours, hitherto sore obscured, both for lacke of imprinting of such works as lay secretly in corners.</p>
            <p>And also, because men of eloquence hath not enterprised to set them foorth in a flourishing stile, in some times past,<note place="margin">Stylus agrestis veterum scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum.</note> not commonly vsed in England of Writers, otherwise well learned, and now in such estimation, that except trueth be delicately cloathed in Purpure, her written verities can scant finde a reader. That all the worlde shall euidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that no particular Region may iustly be more extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led then yours, for true Nobilitie and Vertues at all poyntes renowmed.</p>
            <p>Farthermore, part of the exemplaries, curiously sought by me, and fortunately found in sundry places of this your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, hath been imprinted in <hi>Germanie,</hi> and now be in the<note place="margin">Exemplaria praelis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missa.</note> Presses chiefly of <hi>Frobenius;</hi> that not alonely the <hi>Germanes,</hi> but also the <hi>Italians</hi> themselues, that count (as the <hi>Greekes</hi> did full arrogantly) all other Nations to be barbarous and vnlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, sauing their owne, shall haue a direct occasion, openly of force to say: That <hi>Britannia prima fuit parens, altrix (addo hoc etiam, &amp; iure quidem optimo) conseruatrix cum virorum mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum, tum maxime ingeniorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, that profite hath risen by the aforesaid iourney, in bringing full many thinges to light, as concerning the vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped<note place="margin">Antiphilarchia repellens am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiosum Ro. Epi. Imperiu.</note> authoritie of the Byshop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his complices, to the manifest and violent derogation of kingly dignitie. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre my selfe most humbly to your most prudent, learned, and high iudgement, to discerne my diligence in the long volume, wherein I haue made answere for the defence of your supreme dignitie, alonely leaning to the strong pillor of holy Scripture, against the whole Colledge of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes,
<pb facs="tcp:9:46"/>
cloaking their craftie assercions and arguments, vnder the name of one poore <hi>Pighius</hi> of <hi>Vltraiecte</hi> in Germanie; and<note place="margin">Albertus Pighius.</note> standing to them as to their onely anker holde, against tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestes that they know will arise, if trueth may be by lisence let in, to haue a voyce in the generall counsell.</p>
            <p>Yet herein onely, I haue not pitched the supreame worke of my labour, whereunto your Grace, most like a kingly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone<note place="margin">Affectus auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris erga patria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of all good Learning, did animate me. But also consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and expending with my selfe, how great a number of excellent godly Wits and Writers, learned with the best, as the times serued, hath been in this your Region: Not onely at such times as the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours had recourse to it, but also in those dayes that the <hi>Saxons</hi> preuayled of the <hi>Brytaines,</hi> and the <hi>Normannes</hi> of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> could not but with a feruent zeale, and an honest courage, commend them to memorie. Els alas, like to haue bin perpetually obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or to haue bin lightly remembred, as vncertaine shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I knowing by infinite varietie of Bookes, and assyduous reading of them, who hath bin learned, and who<note place="margin">Libri quatuor de viris illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, siue de scriptoribus Britannicis.</note> hath written from time to time in this Realme; haue digested into iiij. Bookes the names of them, with their lyues and monuments of learning: And to them, added this litle, <hi>De viris illustribus,</hi> folowing the profitable example of <hi>Hierome, Gennadie, Cassiodore, Seueryane,</hi> and <hi>Trittemie</hi> a late writer: But alway so handling the matter, that I haue more exspaciated in this campe, then they did, as in a thing that desired to be somewhat at large, and to haue or nature. The first Booke beginning at the <hi>Druides,</hi> is deducted vnto the time of the comming of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> into England. The seconde, is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time of <hi>Augustine,</hi> vnto the aduente of the <hi>Normanes.</hi> The thirde, from the <hi>Normanes,</hi> to the ende of the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable reigne of the mightie, famous, and prudent Prince, <hi>Henrie</hi> the. vij. your Father. The fourth, beginneth with the name of, Your Maiestie: whose glorie in Learning, is to
<pb facs="tcp:9:47"/>
the worlde so cleerely knowne, that though among the liues of other learned men I haue accurately celebrated the names of <hi>Bladudus, Molmutius, Constantinus magnus, Sigeberius, Alfri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Principes eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti.</note> 
               <hi>Alfridus magnus, Athelstanus,</hi> and <hi>Henrie</hi> the first, Kinges and your progenitours. And also <hi>Ethelward,</hi> second sonne to <hi>Alfride</hi> the great, <hi>Hunfryde</hi> Duke of Glocester, and <hi>Tipetote</hi> Earle of Worcester: yet conferred with your Grace, they seeme as small lightes (if I may freely say my iudgment, your high modestie not offended) in respect of the day starre.</p>
            <p>Now, farther to insinuate to your Grace, of what matters the Writers, whose liues I haue congested into foure Bookes,<note place="margin">Ingenia scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicorum omni genere eruditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis exercitata.</note> hath treated of. I may right boldly say, that beside the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicion of the. iiij. tongues, in the which part of them hath excelled; that there is no kinde of liberall science, or any feate concerning learning, in the which they haue not shewed certaine argumentes of great felicitie of witte. Yea and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the interpretacion of holy Scripture, both after the auncient forme and sence, the scholasticall trade, they haue reigned as in a certaine excellencie.</p>
            <p>And, as touching Historicall knowledge, there hath bin to the number of a full hundreth or moe, that from time to<note place="margin">Ingens nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus scriptorum rerum Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicarum.</note> time hath with great deligence, and no lesse fayth (would to God with like eloquence) perscribed the actes of your most noble predecessours: and the fortunes of this your Realme, so incrediblie great, that he that hath not seene, and throughly read their workes, can litle pronounce in this part.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, after that I had perpended the honest and profitable studies of these Historiographers, I was totallie enflamed with a loue, to see throughly all those partes of this your opulent and ample Realme, that I had read of in<note place="margin">Perogralio la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriosa totius Britanniae pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae.</note> the aforesayd Writers: In so much that all my other occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations intermitted, I haue so trauayled in your Dominions both by the Sea coastes, and the middle partes, sparing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther labour nor costes, by the space of these sixe yeeres past, that there is almost neither Cape nor Bay, Hauen, Creeke
<pb facs="tcp:9:47"/>
or Pere, Riuer, or confluence of Riuers, Breaches, Washes, Lakes, Meeres, Fennie waters, Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines, Vallies, Moores, Heathes, Forrestes, Woodes, Cities, Burges, Castles, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall manour Places, Monasteries, and Colledges; but I haue seene them, and noted in so doing: a whole worlde of things verie memorable.</p>
            <p>Thus instructed, I trust shortly to see the time, that like<note place="margin">Descriptio to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Britanniae primae in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drata argenti tabula.</note> as <hi>Carolus magnus</hi> had among his treasures, three large and notable tables of Siluer richly enamiled: one of the syte and description of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> an other of the syte and figure of the magnificent Citie of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the thirde of the description of the Worlde. So shall your Maiestie haue this your Worlde and Emperie of <hi>Englande</hi> so set foorth in a quadrate table of Siluer, if God sende me life to accomplysh my beginning, that your Grace shall haue readie know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at the first sight, of many right delectable, fruitefull, and necessarie pleasures, by contemplation thereof, as often as occasion shall mooue you to the sight of it.</p>
            <p>And because that it may be more permanent, and farther<note place="margin">Liber de Topo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphia Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae primae.</note> knowne, then to haue it engraued in Siluer or Brasse, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende by the leaue of God, within the space of. xij. moneths folowing, such a description to make of your Realme in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that it shall be no masterie after, for the Grauer or Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to make the like, by a perfect example.</p>
            <p>Yea, and to wade further in this matter, where as now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most no man can well gesse at the shaddow of the auncient<note place="margin">Restituta ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra locorum in Britannia no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina.</note> names of Hauens, Riuers, Promontories, Hilles, Woodes, Cities, Townes, Castles, and varietie of kindes of people: that <hi>Cesar, Liui, Strabo, Diodorus, Fabius Pictor, Pomponius Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Plinius, Cornelius Tacitus, Ptolomeus, Sextus Rufus, Ammia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Marcellinus, Solinus, Antoninus,</hi> and diuers other, make mention of. I trust so to open this window, that the light shal be seene so long: that is to say, by the space of a whole thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres stopped vp, and the old glory of your renowned Britaine to reflorish through the worlde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9:48"/>This done, I haue matter at plentie alreadie prepared to this purpose: that is to say, to write an Historie, to the which<note place="margin">De Antiquitate Britannica siue de Ciuili histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, libri quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaginta.</note> I intende to adscribe this title, <hi>De Antiquitate Britannica:</hi> or els, <hi>Ciuilis historia.</hi> And this worke I intende to deuide into so many Bookes, as there be Shires in England, and Shires and great dominions in Wales: So that I esteeme that this Volume will include a fiftie Bookes; whereof each one, seuerally shall containe the beginninges, encreases, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable actes of the chiefe Townes and Castles of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince allotted to it.</p>
            <p>Then, I intende to distribute into sixe Bookes, such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Libri sex de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulis Britanniae adiacentibus.</note> as I haue already collected concerning the Isles adiacent to your noble Realme, and vnder your subiection.

            <p>And, to superadde a worke as an ornament and a right comely garlande, to the enterprises aforesayd, I haue selected stuffe to be destributed into three Bookes: the which I purpose thus to entitle, <hi>De nobilitate Britannica:</hi> Whereof, the<note place="margin">De nobilitate Britannica li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri tres.</note> first shall declare the names of Kinges and Queenes, with their chyldren, Dukes, Earles, Lordes, Captaines, and Rulers, in this Realme, to the comming of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and their conquest.
