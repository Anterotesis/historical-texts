            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that I may joy in this, not dye for love. <hi>Hofman,</hi> her looks are heaven;
her eyes are <hi>Cupids</hi> darts; Go bring her to me: Art not gone yet

Pleasure, Majesty: Ungentle still? Then get thee from my sight: Go

               <l>The richest Subject in the Land.</l>
               <p>O fortune, how hast thou favoured a poor Merchant stranger? I have all
this wealth in conceit already, and all this have I got of cunning man,
for two poor Millan Needles, and one of 'em lacks an eye too. No
matter. Hope keeps the heart whole, and I shall be rich, that's certain;
but how I know not<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nor care not, so I come in any likeness; my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
says, I must get a service here in <hi>Newcastle,</hi> but ere I enter I must
count the wealth I have now, and that's soon reckoned, one poor half
penny and a Lambs-skin, is all the wealth I have yfaith and yet for all
this my state must stand the richest Subject in the Land; 'tis certain, my
mind gives me it, and I am assur'd on't, yet I must put my self in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of my poverty, lest I should forget my self when I am grown
so rich, I will write a note on't ere I enter the Town<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and hang it here
upon some tree, to keep it in mind, as long as the River of <hi>Tine</hi> runs
<pb facs="tcp:47897:8"/>
under it. Let me see, instead of paper this Tile-stone shall serve, and
here's and Ink-horn I stole from my Hostis, a scurvy Quean, if I had not
given her money for my Ale, she would have chaulked me presently,
this shall serve the turn. Ile sit down and write, sweet <hi>Hellicon</hi> inspire me
with thy Castalian lucke.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wife.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, I think a Widow sir, you may imagine, I may speak
somewhat inmine own Flattery; but alas, 'tis a state I shall not change!</p>
               <l>'Tis for your good, I speak in love, no hate,</l>
               <l>A Widow sir, will best secure your state.</l>

               <p>The sooner the better too, I can assure you; you'l find much
comfort in't, you may elect some young green thing out of a Mayden
choyce, that may be fury and froward, she may please your eye a little,
and other parts about you, but vex your heart, and be a gulph to swallow
your estate; If you'l deal wisely (as I hope you will) take me a Widow,
that knows how and what to do, that has been season'd in a husbands
usage, and one that will obey as you shall honor:</p>
               <l>He that will quietly lay down his head,</l>
               <l>Let him contract a Widow to his bed.</l>

               <p>My first fear is, the marriage of so much wealth as ours

all to cares.</p>
