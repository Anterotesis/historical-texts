            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Sir JOHN PAKINGTON's
Caſe at Droytwich.</head>
            <p>KING <hi>John</hi> granted to the Burgeſſes of <hi>Droytwich,</hi> and their Heirs, the Salt-ſprings there, with divers priviledges and
franchizes, rendring the yearly fee farm rent of 100. <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, and the Salt water hath ever ſince been divided into four
hundred and four Shares called Bulleries, which Bulleries have ever been bought, Sold and Deſcended as other inheritances
at the Common Law,</p>
            <p>The grantees of King <hi>John</hi> and their Heires have long ſince aliened and ſold their whole inheritance in the Salt-ſprings to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Perſons, who at this day ſtand ſeiſed in fee of the ſame and pay their proportions of the fee farm Rent reſerv'd on the firſt grant:
And from the time of King <hi>Johns</hi> grant to the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> the firſt, the Inheritors of the Salt-ſprings were deemed
Burgeſſes of <hi>Droytwich,</hi> and whoever ſold his Inheritance ceaſed to be a Burgeſs.</p>

               </gap>porated the Burgeſſes of <hi>Droytwich,</hi> by the name of Bayliffs and Burgeſſes, and granted them divers fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizes

number, to govern the ſaid Burrough or Salt-works, or any power to Elect new Burgeſſes, or to exclude any who in Right of
their Eſtates ought to act as Burgeſſes.</p>
            <p>But of Late years the greateſt part of thoſe ancient Inheritances coming into the hands of Gentlemen of Quality, and perſons who
lived remote, the Bayliffs and Burgeſſes inhabiting in the Corporation, taking advantage thereof, ſet up ſeveral contrivances whereby they
aſſumed to themſelves, not only the Governing and taxing the Salt-works at pleaſure, but of excluding the greater number of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors
(by a ſingle negative voyce) from acting as Burgeſſes of the ſaid Burrough, either in giving their votes in Electing their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
in Parliament, or Governing their own Eſtates. and at the ſame time admitting meer ſtrangers into the Corporation
to ſtrengthen their own party, by which undue practices in leſs then twenty years, they impoſed above twenty thouſand pounds,
upon the Inheritors Eſtates in the Salt-ſpring without their conſents, wherefore for prevention of the like oppreſſions for the future,
the Principal Proprietors did obtain an Act of Parliament in the firſt Seſſions of their preſent Majeſties Reign, but did not then at all
inſiſt on their Right of Electing their Repreſentatives in Parliament.</p>
            <p>That the Inheritors of the Salt Springs
are the undoubted Burgeſſes of <hi>Droyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>

is reſerved from the Burgeſſes's of <hi>Droyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
and to this day charged on, and
paid by the Inheritors of the Salt-Springs.</p>
