            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou haſt in this Treatiſe, the Deſcription and Uſes of three ſeveral Quadrants, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to thy View and Acceptance; and here I am to give thee an account of their Occaſion and Original.</p>
                  <p>Being in conference with my loving friend M. <hi>Thomas Harvie,</hi> he told me, that he had often drawn a Quadrant upon Paper paſtboard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> derived by himſelf, and never done by any man before, as to his knowledge, from the Stereographick Projection, which for a particular Latitude, would give the Hour in the equal Limb, and would alſo perform the Azimuth very well; and but that it was ſo particular, was very deſirous to have one made in Braſs for his own uſe by an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Maker: whereto replying, that with the acceſs of ſome other Lines to be uſed with Compaſſes, it might be rendred general for finding both the Hour and the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth in the equal Limb: He thereupon intimated his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to M. <hi>Sutton,</hi> promiſing within a fortnight after their conference, to draw up full directions for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof. But M. <hi>Sutton</hi> having very good practiſe and experience in drawing Projections, ſpeedily found out the drawing of that Projection, either in a Quadrant or a Semicircle, without the aſſiſtance of the promiſed directions, and accordingly, hath drawn the ſhape of it
<pb facs="tcp:66044:3"/>
for all Latitudes, and alſo found how the Horizontal Projection might be inverted and contrived into a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant without any confuſion, by reaſon of a reverted tail, and let me further add, that he hath taken much pains in calculating Tables for the accurate making of theſe and other Inſtruments, in their conſtruction more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult then any that ever were before; and the ſaid M. <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> conceiving that it would be an advancement to their Trade in general, beſides ſatisfactory to the deſires of the ſtudious in the Mathematiques, to have the uſes of a good Quadrant publiſhed, prevailed with me, in regard M. <hi>Harvey</hi> was not at leiſure (though willing his Quadrant ſhould be made publique) to write two or three ſheets of the uſe of it, which I intended to have given M. <hi>Sutton</hi> (who very well underſtood the uſe as well as the making) to be publiſhed in his own name; whereto he being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, and finding that therein many of the uſes of one Quadrant, much leſs of more could not be comprized, at his earneſt requeſt, I wrote what is here digeſted, <hi>ſucciſivè &amp; horis Antelucanis,</hi> having little leiſure for that purpoſe, and all this performed before the Inſtruments were cut, wherefore the deſcription given of them, may not ſo nearly agree with the Inſtruments, as if they had been firſt made, nor poſſibly ſome of the examples about finding the hour of the night by the Stars; which exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were fitted from Tables of preſent right Aſcenſion, whereas the Quadrant is fitted to ſerve the better for the future, the difference notwithſtanding will be but ſmall. And thus hoping thou wilt cover my failings with the mantle of love, and kindly accept of my endeavours, tending to the publique advancement and increaſe of knowledge, I ſtill remain a Wellwiller deſirous thereof.</p>

                  <head>How the Projections on both the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants may be Demonſtrated.</head>
                  <p>TO ſatisfie the inquiſitive Reader herein, I ſhall only in this Edition quote ſuch Latine Authors and Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as will evince the truth thereof, the performance whereof in Engliſh, is hereafter intended by my loving friend M. <hi>Thomas Harvie,</hi> in an elaborate Treatiſe, concerning all the Projections, with their Demonſtration and Application, who is accompliſhed with ſingular knowledge in that kind, as in general in the Mathematiques.</p>
                  <p>Now the Demonſtration of theſe two Projections is as much included in the Demonſtration of the Stereographick Projection, which by <hi>Aguilonius</hi> in his 6 Book is largely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, as a peculiar queſtion in Trigonometry, is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a general Caſe, and both the Projections on theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants being derived from the grounds of the ſaid general Projection, are neceſſarily involved in one and the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stofler</hi> in his Aſtrolabe ſuppoſeth the eye in the South Pole Stereographically projecting upon the Plain of the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor thoſe Circles between the North Pole Horizon and Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> neglecting that part under the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.</p>
                  <p>But the Projection on the Quadrant, conſidered as it may be derived from his Aſtrolabe, ſuppoſeth the eye in the ſame Poſition, and makes uſe of one half of the Projection of the other part of the Circles intercepted between the Horizon and Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> namely, of that ſpace between the Tropick below our Horizon, only changing the names of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> for <hi>Capricorn</hi> in their uſe, and uſing the depreſſed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels
<pb facs="tcp:66044:6"/>
to the Horizon, instead of the Parallels of Altitude; ſo that the Azimuths of the Quadrant made by this inverſion, are no other then the Azimuths of <hi>Stoflers</hi> Projection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued below the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Capricorn</hi> where he breaks them off, and the rule he preſcribes to draw the parallel of <hi>18<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
                     </hi> of <hi>Depreſſion</hi> for the <hi>Twylight</hi> ſerves to draw that, and all the other parallels of <hi>Altitude</hi> in this Quadrant.</p>
                  <p>In like manner the Horizontal Projection ſuppoſeth the eye in the <hi>Nadir</hi> projecting upon the Plain of the Horizon.</p>
                  <p>That part of the Sphere intercepted between the two Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, neglecting that part thereof under the Horizon.</p>
                  <p>But the Projection on the other great Quadrant, conſidered as derived therefrom, ſuppoſeth the eye there projecting that part of the Sphere which is there neglected with the like change of denomination; and the Parallels of Declination are no other then the continuance of the ſaid Parallels of the Horizontal Projection round to the Midnight Meridian, and the Hour circles the continuance of the ſaid hours, only the Index of Altitudes is fitted to the Depreſſed Parallels of the Horizon, in ſtead of the Parallels of Altitude.</p>
                  <p>Now it is evident, either from the Sphere or Analemma, that that part of either of theſe Projections which falls under the Horizon, will ſupply the uſe of that which hapned above, admitting only a change of denomination; for in the Horizontal Projection, that Parallel of Declination which was called the Winter Tropick, being no other then the ſame Circle continued about, now in its uſe and denomination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Summer Tropick; and the reaſon is, becauſe what ever Altitude the Sun hath in any Sign upon any Hour or Azimuth reckoned from the Noon Meridian, he hath the like Depreſſion on the like Hour and Azimuth in the oppoſite Signe counted from the Midnight meridian.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:66044:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>The terms of Noon and Midnight Meridian are afterwards uſed in relation to ſome general Proportions: By the Hour in general is meant the Angle between the Meridian of the Sun or Stars, and the Meridian of the place: By the Hour count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Noon Meridian, is meant the ſaid Angle counted from that part of the Meridian of the place which falls above the Elevated Pole, continued towards the Depreſsed Pole: and by the Midnight Meridian, the oppoſite thereto under the Elevated Pole, continued as before.</p>
                  <p>By the Azimuth counted from the Midnight Meridian, is meant an Angle at the Zenith between the Suns Vertical or Azimuthal circle, and the Meridian of the place, meaſured by the Horizon, counted from the Interſection of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon with the Meridian under the Elevated Pole; and by the Azimuth counted from the Noon Meridian, is meant the Complement of the ſaid Angle to a Semicircle, counted from the oppoſite Interſection of the Horizon with the former Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian continued above the Elevated, and towards the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Pole, according to which acceptions, the general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions are fitted for finding it either way in both Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres, without any reſtriction to North or South.</p>

                  <head>A more immediate account of theſe Projections.</head>
                  <p>HItherto we have accommodated our Diſcourſe, to ſhew how theſe Projections are derived from <hi>Stoflers</hi> Aſtrolabe, and from the Horizontal Projection, of which neither <hi>Stofler</hi> (as to my knowledge) for I have only ſeen his 8 Book) nor the learned M. <hi>Oughtred,</hi> give no pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Demonſtration, as being particular examples of a general caſe, largely (as ſuch) inſiſted on; and this we have done for the accommodation of Inſtrument makers, to whom this Derivation may ſeem moſt ſuitable; whereas ſuch a deduction is not at all neceſſary to the Demonſtration of the Projections ſo derived.</p>
                  <p>For in the Projection derived from the Inverſion of <hi>Stofler,</hi> let the eye be ſuppoſed to be placed in the North Pole, projecting upon the Plain of the Equinoctial, ſuch Circles in the Sphere, as are deſcribed in the Quadrant between the two Tropicks, a quarter of which Projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be the ſame with that on the Quadrant, namely, one of thoſe quarters between the South part of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian and hour of ſix, which will leave out all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the Almicanters between it and the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and in ſtead thereof, there is taken in ſuch a like part of the depreſſed Parallels to the Horizon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſame Hour of ſix, and Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> which is the reverted tail; for the Parallels of Depreſſion have the ſame reſpect to the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> that the Parallels of Altitude have to the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and will work the ſame in effect.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, the Eye in the other Projection may
<pb facs="tcp:66044:7"/>
be ſuppoſed in the Zenith, Stereographically Projecting upon the Plain of the Horizon, that part only of the ſpace between the Tropicks, which falls without the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Horizontal Circle, ſave only the reverted tail, which is the Projection of ſo much of the Parallels of South Declination, as is intercepted between the prime Vertical Circle and the Horizon, and is taken in to ſerve in ſtead of that part of the Parallels of North Declination, which will fall without the Quadrant.</p>
                  <p>In any of theſe Poſitions of the Eye, all Circles paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the ſame, will be projected in right lines by 91 Prop. 6 Book of <hi>Aguilonius,</hi> ſuch are the Azimuths on the Horizontal Quadrant, and the Hours on the other Quadrant, repreſented by the thred lying over any Ark in the Limb, ſo alſo in this latter Quadrant is the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel of Altitude equal to the Latitude of the place, a right line.</p>
                  <p>All Circles parallel to the Horizon and Equinoctial, will be projected in concentrick Circles by 94 Prop. 6. <hi>Aguilonius,</hi> ſuch are the Parallels of Altitude in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal Quadrant, and the Parallels of Declination in the other Quadrants, repreſented by the Bead, when it is rectified to the Index of Altitudes in the one, and to the Ecliptick in the other, carried in a circular trace from one ſide of the Quadrant to the other.</p>
                  <p>All other Circles in the Sphere, whatſoever and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſcituated, being projected according to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed poſition of the Plain and Eye, will be repreſented by Excentrick Circles. by 96 Prop. 6. <hi>Aguilonius,</hi> and the hours in the Horizontal Projection will (if they be produced) meet with the projected Pole points, ſo alſo the Azimuths in the other Projection, which by the like pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb facs="tcp:66044:8"/>
of Reaſon may be denominated <hi>The Equinoctial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> will (being produced) meet with the projected points of the Zenith and Nadir; and how in particular to project and divide any Circle however ſcituated in the Sphere, is abundantly ſhewn in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Author, and amplified with many examples, though none of them agreeing with the particular Draughts of theſe Quadrants, yet if put in practiſe according to the propoſed Scituation of the Eye, will be found to agree with the preſcribed Directions for the making of theſe Quadrants. See alſo <hi>Clavius</hi> his Book of the Aſtrolabe, <hi>Guido Ubaldus</hi> his Theorick of the general Planiſpheres, and M. <hi>Oughtreds</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Scheme B in his late Trigonometry in Engliſh.</p>

                  <p>SInce the Printing of the ſheet <hi>B,</hi> we have thought fit to vary a little from the Deſcription there given of the Small Quadrant.</p>
                  <p>The Dyalling Scale of Hours deſcribed in page <hi>9,</hi> near the beginning, which I ſay in Page <hi>191</hi> may be omitted, is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly left out, and inſtead of it, a line of Verſed Sines of <hi>90<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
                     </hi> put on, the uſes whereof are handled in the great Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial Quadrant.</p>
                  <p>Alſo there is two Scales added to the ſmall Quadrant more then was deſcribed; namely, the Scale of Entrance, the ſame that was placed upon the Horizontal Quadrant, with a Sine of <hi>51<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 32′</hi> put through the whole Limb ſerving to give the
<pb facs="tcp:66044:8"/>
Altitude at ſix, which the thred will interſect, if it be laid over the Declination in the Limb; but enough of the uſes of theſe Scales is ſaid in the Horizontal Quadrant.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Thoſe that like it beſt, inſtead of having on the Small Quadrant one looſe fitted Scale for the Hour, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for the Azimuth, may have the Hour-Scale only divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two parts, ſerving to give the Hour and Azimuth for the Sun, and all the Stars in the Hemiſphere, the one part for South Declinations, the other for North Declinations, in imitation of the Diagonal Scale.</p>

                     <p>One Caution in rectifying the Bead is to be given; and that is in Summer time if it be required to find the hour and Azimuth of the Sun by the Projection, before the hour of 6 in the morning, or after it in the evening, or which is all one, when the Sun hath leſs Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude then he hath at 6 of the clock; then muſt the Bead be rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Winter Ecliptick, and the Parralels above the Horizon in the Reverted Tail, are thoſe which will come in vſe.</p>

                        <p>A Semi-Circle is an Inſtrument commonly uſed in Surveigh, and then it requires a large Center-hole; however this Projection may be drawn on a Semi-Circle for Surveigh, but when uſed at home there muſt a moveable round Bit of braſs be contrived to ſtop up that great Center-hole, in which muſt be a ſmall Center-hole for a Thread and Plummet to be faſtned, as for a Quadrant and ſome have been ſo fitted.</p>
                        <p>The Reader will meet with variety of Lines and furniture in this Book to be put in the Limb, or on other parts of the Semicircle, as he beſt liketh.

                        <p>To do this with Compaſſes, take the diſtance between the Star and the Suns Aſcenſion, and ſet the Suns foot to the obſerved hour of the Star from the Meridian it was laſt upon, letting the other foot fall the ſame way it ſtood before, and it ſheweth the time ſought, if it doth not fall off the Quadrant.</p>
                        <p>If it doth, the work will be to finde how much it doth excur, and this may be done by bringing it to the end beyond which it falleth, letting the other foot fall inward, the diſtance then between the place where it now falleth, and where it ſtood before, which was at the Stars hour, is equal to the ſaid excurſion, which being taken, and meaſured on the other end of the Scale, ſhews the time ſought.</p>

                        <p>In every right angled Spherical Triangle all the three angles are leſs then 4 right angles, that is the two Oblique angles are leſs then 3 right angles, or 270<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</p>

                  <head>Of the Line of Verſed Sines, on the left Edge, iſſuing from the Center.</head>
                  <p>THis Line, and the uſes of it, were invented by the learned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician, M. <hi>Samuel Foſter,</hi> of <hi>Greſham</hi> Colledge, deceaſed, from whom I received the uſes of it, applyed to a Sector; I ſhall, and have added the Proportions to be wrought upon it, and in that, and other reſpects, diverſifie from what I received; wherein I ſhall not be tedious, becauſe there are other ways to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſince found out by my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The chief uſes of it are, to reſolve the two caſes of the fourth Axiom of Spherical Trigonometry; as, when three ſides are given to find an Angle, or two ſides with the Angle comprehended, to find the third ſide, which are the caſes that find the Hour and Azimuth generally, and the Suns Altitudes on all hours. For the Hour, the learned Author thought meet to add a Zodiaque of the Suns-place annexed to it, both in the uſe of his Sector, as alſo in the uſe of his Scale, publiſhed ſince his death, entituled <hi>Poſthuma Foſteri,</hi> that the Suns place being given, which for Inſtrumental uſe might be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by knowing on what day of each moneth the Sun enters into any Signe, and allowing a degree for every days motion, come by it <hi>prope verum,</hi> and being ſought in the annexed Zodiaque (which is no other then two lines of 90<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Sines, each made equal to the Sine of 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 31′ the Suns greateſt Declination) juſt againſt it ſtands the Suns Declination, if accounted in the Verſed Sine, from 90<hi rend="sup">d</hi> each way; but this for want of room, and becauſe the Declination is more eaſily given by help of the day of the moneth, I thought fit to omit, the rather, becauſe it may alſo be taken from the Table of Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>But from hence I firſt obſerved, that if the two firſt terms of a Proportion were fixed, if two natural Lines proper to thoſe terms,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66044:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were fitted of an equal length, and poſited together, if any third term be given, to find a fourth in the ſame proportion, it would be given by inſpection, as ſtanding againſt the third; but if the Lines ſtand aſunder, or a difference be the third term, application muſt be made from one Line to the other with Compaſſes, as in the ſame Scale there is alſo fitted a Line of 60 parts, equal in length to the Radius of a ſmall Sine, ſerving to give the Miles in every ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Latitude, anſwerable to one degree of Longitude.</p>

The firſt Work would be to proportion out a Sine to a leſſer Radius, which would find the point of Entrance, the next would be to finde the Altitude, or Depreſſion, at 6. the third would be to enter the ſum, or difference of the Sines of the Altitude, or depreſſion at 6 at the point of Entrance, and to lay the thred to the other foot; but I ſhall demonſtrate it from other grounds.</p>

                     <p>Upon the Center H deſcribe a circle, and draw the Diameter A C, paſſing through the Center, and perpendicularly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, upon the point C, erect a Line of Sines C I, whoſe Radius ſhall be equal to the Diameter A C, let 90<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of the Sine end at I; I ſay then, if from the point A, through each degree of that Line of Sines, there be ſtreight lines drawn, interſecting the Quadrant of the circle C G, as a line from the point D doth interſect it at B the Quadrant C G, which the Author calls the upper Quadrant, or Quadrant of Latitudes ſhall be conſtituted, and if C I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as a Secant, by the ſame reaſon the whole Semicircle C G A may be occupied; hence it will be neceſſary to educe a ground of calculation for the accurate dividing of the ſaid Quadrant, and that will be eaſie; for A C being Radius, the Sine C D doth alſo repreſent the Tangent of the Angle at A, therefore ſeek the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sine of the Ark C D in the Table of Natural Tangents, and the Ark correſponding thereto, will give the quantity of the Angle D A C, then becauſe the point A falls in the circumference of the Circle, where an Angle is but half ſo much as it is at the Center, by 31 Prop. 3. <hi>Euc.</hi> double the Angle found, and from a Quadrant divided into 90 equal parts, and their ſubdiviſions, by help of a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo made, may the Quadrant of Latitudes be accurately divided: but the Author made his Table in page 5. without doubling, to be graduated from a Quadrant divided into 45 equal parts.</p>
                     <p>Again, If upon the Center C, with a pair of Compaſſes, each degree of the line of Sines be transferred into the Semicircle C G A it ſhall divide it into 90 equal parts; the reaſon whereof is plain,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:66044:142"/>
becauſe the Sine of an Arch is half the chord of twice that Arch, and therefore the Sines being made to twice the Radius of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſhall being transferred into it, become chords of the like Arch, to divide a Semicircle into 90 equal parts.</p>
                     <p>Again, upon the point A, erect a line of Tangents of the ſame Radius with the former Sine, which we may ſuppoſe to be infinitely continued, here we uſe a portion of it A E.</p>
                     <p>If from the point C, the other extremity of the Diameter lines be drawn, cutting the lower Semicircle (as a line drawn from E interſects it at F) through each degree of the ſaid Tangent, the ſaid lower Semicircle ſhall be divided into 90 equal parts; the reaſon is evident a line of Tangents from the Center ſhall divide a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant into 90 equal parts, and becauſe an Angle in the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is but half ſo much as it is in the Center, being transferred thither, a whole Semicircle ſhall be filled with no more parts.</p>
                     <p>The chief uſe of this Circle, is to operate Proportions in Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents alone, or in Sines and Tangents joyntly, built upon this foundation, that equiangled plain Triangles have their ſides Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional.</p>
                     <p>In ſtreight lines, it will be evident from the point D to E, draw a ſtreight line interſecting the Diameter at L, and then it lies as C L to C D; ſo is A L to A E: it is alſo true in a Circle, provided it be evinced, that the points B L F fall in a ſtreight line.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, find the vertical Altitude as is ſhewed in page 174. Then for Latitudes under 45 d.</p>
                        <p>Enter in Summer Declinations the difference, but in Winter Declinations the ſum, of the ſines of the vertical Altitude, and of the propoſed Altitude once done the line of ſines from the Center, and laying the thread over the Tangent of the Latitude take the neareſt diſtance to it, then enter that Extent at the complement of the Altitude in the Sines, and lay the thread to the other foot, and in the limb it ſhewes the Azimuth from the Eaſt or Weſt.</p>

                           </gap>e 40 d. the Azimuth of the Sun will be 17 d. 33 m. to the Southward of the Weſt. If his declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were as much South and his propoſed Altitude 18 d. his Azimuth would be 41 d. 10 m. to the Southwards of the Eaſt or Weſt. For Latitudes above 45.</p>
                        <p>If we aſſume the Rad. of the quadrant to be the tangent of the Latit. the Rad. to that Tang. ſhall be the co-tangent of the Latit. wherefore lay the thread to the complement of the Latitude in the line of Tangents in the limb, and from the complement of the Altitude in the Sines take the neareſt diſtance to it, I ſay
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66044:159"/>
that extent ſhall be coſine of the Altitude to the leſſer Radius which meaſure from the Center, and it finds the Point of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance whereon enter the former Sum or difference of ſines as before directed, and you will find the Azimuth in the equal limb.</p>
                        <p>Or if you would find the anſwer in the ſines, enter the firſt extent at 90 d. laying the thread to the other foot, then enter the Sum or difference of the Sines of the vertical and given Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſo between the ſcale and the thread, that one foot turned about may but juſt touch the thread, the other reſting on the ſines, and you will find the ſine of the Azimuth ſought.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Example.</hi> For the Latitude of <hi>Edinburg</hi> 55 d. 56 m. If the Sun have 15 d. of Declination, his vertical Altitude or depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is 18 d. 14 m. the Declination being North, if his propoſed Altitude were 35 d. the Azimuth of the Sun would be 28 d. to the South-wards of the Eaſt or Weſt.</p>
                        <p>But if the Declination were as much South, and the Altitude 10 d. the Azimuth thereto would be 46 d. 58 m. to the South-wards of the Eaſt or Weſt.</p>

                        <p>But as the rectangle of the co-tangent of the Latitude and of the coſine of the Altitude is to the ſquare of the Radius, So is the coſine of the Altitude is to the tangent of the Latitude, or which is all one, So is the co-tangent of the Latitude, To the ſecant of the Altitude, as may be found by a common diviſion of the rectangle, and ſquare of the Radius by either of the terms of the ſaid rectangle, by help of which notion I firſt found out the particular ſcales upon this quadrant.</p>

                        <p>Becauſe the Projection is not fitted for finding the Azimuth there are added two particular ſcales to this quadrant, namely, the particular ſine in the limb, and the ſcale of entrance abutting on the ſines fitted for the Latitude of <hi>London.</hi>

                     <p>OBſerve that the left edge of the quadrant is called the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian Line, and that every Degree or Parallel of the Suns Declination if continued about would croſſe the Meridian in two oppoſite points, the one below the Center towards the Limbe, and the other above, and beyond the Center of the quadrant, the diſtance between theſe two points is the Diameter of the ſaid Parallel, and the Semidiameters would be the Center points.</p>
                     <p>It will be neceſſary in the firſt place, to limit the outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Parallel of Declination, which may be done in the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Line at any point aſſumed.</p>
                     <p>The diſtance of this aſſumed point from the Center in any La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, muſt repreſent the Tangent of a compound Arke, made by adding halfe the greateſt Meridian Altitude to 45 Deg. which for <hi>London</hi> muſt be the Tangent of 76 Degr.</p>
                     <p>And to the Radius of this Tangent muſt the following work be fitted.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, the Semidiameters of all other Parallels that fall below the Center, are limited by pricking downe the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of Arkes, framed by adding halfe the Meridian Altitude ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to each Declination continually to 45 Degr.</p>
                     <p>Now to limit the Semidiameters above or beyond the Center onely prick off the reſpective Tangents of half the Suns mid-night Depreſſion from the Center the other way, retaining the former Radius, by this meanes there will be found two reſpective points limiting the Diameters of each Parallel, which had, the Centers will be eaſily found falling in the middle of each Diameter.</p>
                     <p>But to doe this Arithmetically, firſt, find the Arke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of halfe the Suns meridian Altitude, and 45 Degr. as before, and to the Tangent thereof, adde the Tangent of halfe the Suns mid-night depreſſion, obſerving that the Suns mid-night depreſſion in Winter-Summer, is equal to his Meridian Altitude in Summer-Winter, his declination being alike in quantity, though in different Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheres, the halfe ſumme of theſe two Tangents are the reſpective Semidiameters ſought, and being prickt in the meridian line

Then take the thread whoſe end is fixed in a point in the direct Axis, and move it to and fro, until the ſaid thread doth interpoſe between your eye, and the hour-line on the ſaid Horizontal Dial which you intend to draw, and then keeping your eye at that ſcituation, make a point or mark in any place where you pleaſe, or under the window, ſo that the ſaid thread or ſtring may interpoſe between that point or mark ſo made, and your eye, as aforeſaid; which ſaid point ſo ſound will ſhew the true time of the day at that hour all the year long, the Sun ſhining thereon, ſo will that point, together with the ſaid thread, ſerve to ſhew the hour, inſtead of an hour-line.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, the ſaid thread fixed in the Axis may be again moved to and fro, until the ſaid thread doth interpoſe between the

                     <p>In like manner may be proceeded (by help of that thread, and the ſeveral hour-lines on the ſaid Horizontal Dial) to finde the other hour-points which muſt have the ſame numbers ſet to them as have the hour-lines on the ſaid Horizontal Dial.</p>
                     <p>Otherwiſe to make a Dial from a hole in any pane of glaſſe in a window, and to graduate the hour-lines below on the Sell, or Beam, or on the ground, that hole is ſuppoſed to be the center of the Horizontal Dial, and being true placed, the ſtile thereof, if ſuppoſed continued, will run into the point in the Meridian of the Cieling before found, where a thread is to be fixed; then let one extend a thread faſtned in the center of the Horizontal Dial pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelly to the Horizon, over each reſpective hour-line, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſteady, let another extend the thread faſtened in the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, in the Cieling along by the edges of the former Horizontal thread, and ſo this latter thread will finde divers points on the ground, through which if hour-lines be drawn, and the Sun ſhine through the hole in the pane of Glaſſe before made, the ſpot of the Sun on the ground ſhall ſhew the time of the day.</p>
                     <p>For the points that will be thus found on the Beam or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, the thread fixed in the Cieling, or inſtead of it a piece of tape there fixed muſt be moved ſo up and down, that the ſpot of the Sun may ſhine upon it, and being extended to the Tranſome or Beam graduated with the hour-lines, as before directed, it there ſhews the time of the day.

                     <p>In like manner may a Dial be made from a nail head, a knot in a ſtring tied any where a croſſe, or from any point driven into the

                     <p>To make a Reflected Dial on the Ceiling of the Room is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the contrary of this, by ſuppoſing the Horizontal Diall with its ſtile to be turned downwards, and run into the true meridian on the ground, where the thread is to be fixed, and to be extended along by the former Horizontal thread (held over the reſpective hours as before) upward, to find divers points in the Cieling, as ſhall afterwards be ſhewed.</p>

                     <p>And in regard the reflected Axis for the moſt part will fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Horizon of the Glaſſe without the window, ſo that no point there can be fixed, therefore a point muſt be found in the ſaid Reflected Axis continued below the Horizontal of the ſaid Glaſſe, until it touch the ground or floor of the Room in ſome part of the Meridian formerly drawn, which point will be the point in the reverſed Axis deſired, and may be found, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>One end of the thread, being fixed at or in the center of the ſaid Glaſſe, move the other end thereof in the meridian formerly drawn below the ſaid Glaſſe, until the ſaid reverſed Axis be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed below the Horizon, as the direct Axis was elevated above the Horizon, which may be done by applying the ſide or edge of a Quadrant to the ſaid thread, and moving the end thereof to and fro in the ſaid meridian, until the thread with a plummet cut the ſame degree as the Pole is above the Horizontal Glaſſe, and then that point where the end of the thread toucheth the Meridian ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the floor or wall of the room, is the point in the reflected reverſed Axis ſought for.</p>

Then (as before) take the thread faſtened in the point on the reflected Axis, and bring it to touch the thread of the hour-line in any part thereof, and mark where the end of that thread toucheth the ſaid Wall or Cieling: Then again (as before) move the ſaid thread ſo, as that it only touch the ſaid thread of the hour-line in any other part thereof, and alſo mark where the end of that thread toucheth the ſaid Wall or Cieling: So is there found two points on the Wall or Cieling, being in the reflected hour-line deſired, by help of which two points the whole hour-line may be drawn; for if (as before) a thread be ſo ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, that it may interpoſe between the eye and the ſaid two points found, you may make many points at pleaſure, whereunto the ſaid thread may alſo interpoſe, which for more conveniency may be made at every angle or bending of the Wall or Cieling, be they never ſo many: So that if lines be drawn from point to point, that ſaid reflected hour-line will be alſo exactly drawn.</p>
                     <p>In like manner may the other hour-lines be drawn ſo, that the Reflex or ſpot of the Sun from the ſaid Horizontal Glaſſe ſcituated in the ſaid window (as before) ſhining amongſt the ſaid reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hour-lines drawn on the wall or Cieling, will exactly ſhew the hour of the day deſired.</p>

Then being careful to keep the knot in that poſition, faſten one end of a thread in the place of the center of the reclining reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſſe, and bring that thread ſo, as juſt to touch the aforeſaid knot, augmenting that thread, until the end thereof touch the wall or Cieling, and there make a mark or point, ſo is there one point found on the Wall or Cieling in the Reflected Horizon of the World. Then I begin again, and remove the poſition of that thread (which went overthwart the Room) either higher or low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at pleaſure, ſtill having regard that I may from the moſt part of the ſaid thread ſee the Reflecting Glaſſe, and therein the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal thread without the room.

By which ſaid two points, if a thread (as before) be ſo ſcituated, that it may interpoſe between the eye and the ſaid two points, there may be many points made to be in the ſame interpoſition of the thread, which (as before) may be made at every bending or angle of the Wall or Cieling, whereby the reflected Horizon deſired may be drawn, by drawing a line from point to point round about the Room; Which wil be the true reflected Horizon according to the ſituation of the glaſſe.</p>

Then (as before) tie a thread croſſe the room, in ſuch ſort that from or by ſome part of the ſaid thread both the Reclining glaſſe and the thread to which the plummet is faſtened may be ſeen at one time. Then (as before) on the ſaid thread, which croſſes the room, I tie a ſlipping knot, which I move to and fro on the ſaid ſtring, until by looking in the ſaid Glaſſe I find from my eye the ſaid knot and ſome part of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular thread without, all as it were in one right line, the one ſhadowing or interpoſing the ſight of the other, being then very careful to keep that knot in the ſame poſition, then take the thread (whoſe end whereof being faſtened in the ſaid center of the Glaſſe) and bringing it juſt to touch the ſaid knot, I augment that thread, until the end thereof touch the ſaid wall or Cieling, and the ſaid thread alſo touch the knot, as before: then in that place where the end of the ſaid thread toucheth the wall or Cie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I make a mark, which mark or point will be directly in the reflected meridian of the world, according to the ſituation of that Glaſſe.

In like manner may the Cuſpis of any other Houſe above the Horizon, as the 9<hi>th.</hi> or 10<hi>th.</hi> which is the Meridian (or <hi>Medium Coell</hi>) or 11<hi>th.</hi> or 12<hi>th.</hi> be drawn alſo.

the tenth houſe or <hi>Medium Coeli:</hi> wherein generally it is to be noted, That in all planes which cut the common Interſection of the meridian and Horizon, (as doth the Horizontal, and alſo all meridian planes both Direct and Reclining) theſe Circles of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition are all parallel to the meridian, and therefore parallel each to other. For look what reſpect the hour-lines in all Direct or Reclining Polar Planes, or Direct meridian Planes have to the Axis of the World: Such reſpect have the Circles of Poſition, in all Horizontal, or Direct meridian or Reclining meridian Planes, to the Axis of the Prime vertical: For as the hour-lines in the firſt are all parallel to the Axis of the Equinoctial, in whoſe Poles they meet: So the Circles of Poſition in the ſecond are all parallel to the Axis of the Prime Vertical, in whoſe Poles they alſo meet.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why Glaſſes reflect a double Spot, is becauſe they are poliſht on both ſides, which may be remedied with a <hi>Pumex</hi>-ſtone.
