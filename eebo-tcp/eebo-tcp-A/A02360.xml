         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:3702:3"/>
perswaded by his friends

to be framed &amp; made by <hi>Polycle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
(an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t grauer of Images
in those times) but he greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assenting
from their opinion, and
reiecting their importunate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
answered them; that in
doing so, he should exhibit to the
eyes of <hi>Athens,</hi> an image or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation,
rather of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Art of <hi>Polycletus,</hi> the Image

the image &amp; manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his owne loue, regard, and

bee that <hi>Athens</hi> so should rather
respect the one, then perceiue so

therefore hee had decreed, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
his own affection or heart,
by his owne hand, perswading
<pb facs="tcp:3702:3"/>
himselfe, that the whole, to wit,
the manifestation howsoeuer, as
his loue manifested, proceeding
both from himselfe, would bee
more acceptable to his Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
then the exact arte of expert
<hi>Polycletus;</hi> and that not hauing
great occasion to fixe their eyes
onely vpon the exquisite worke
of the image or representation, to
say, who wrought it? they would
onely behold the ardent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
represented of him who dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
the same: So likewise with
<hi>Hipponicus,</hi> after long and earnest
wishing of an occasion, whereby
I might in some sort also, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
and testifie my dutifull affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
regard, remembrance, and
gratitude; which I owe to the
<hi>Athens</hi> of my birth &amp; education,
as a small riuer returning to his

image and plainer manifestation
of my loue, (being a young man
my selfe) this image and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation

whereof this wildernesse is so ful,
he may vnto this image, erected
in Gods word, lift vp his eyes,
thereby &amp; therein beholding his

which (with <hi>Hipponicus</hi>) I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade

yet with him, without

doe assure and perswade my selfe,

Psalm. 53. vnexpressed by

the reason of the intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

this; that in the same great matter
of praising Gods holy name, is set
before our eyes, who in his loue to
man, hath manifested his will in his

whereof, and walking in the same,
we are made truly happy &amp; perfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>The Doctrine contained in this
Psalme or matter, is morall, which
as it is aboue all other most pleasant
and delectable; so this Psalme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the same, as in length, so in
excellencie it surpasseth the rest, as
the Sunne doth the small glistering
starres in glory and brightnesse of
light, shewing and setting forth to
the eyes of all men, the inestimable
worth and rare vertue of GODS
word, with the most blessed &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
estate of all those whose delight
is therein, and who maketh it a rule
to conforme all their actions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and their way wherein they wil
walke.</p>
            <p>The Psalme it selfe, according to
the forme therof, is of a mixed kind
of stile, containing diuers exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to all men, who would attaine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3702:11"/>
vnto true happinesse to seeke after
Gods word, and embrace the same
with their whole heart, walking
therein, and practising the same in
their life and conuersation, with
sundry and sweete comforts to
the godly that are afflicted any
way; also confessions of his owne
delight, earnest desire, estimation,
ardent loue, and carefull obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods precepts and word,
fearefull threatnings to the wicked,
who despiseth the same, and many
earnest prayers to God to confirme
him in his trueth, to establish his
feete in his waies, and to take away
all impediments whatsoeuer might
hinder his course in this path of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <p>The diuision of the Psalme is in
22. sections called octonaries, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the number of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Hebrew Alphabet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so many. Euerie section or octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
containing 8. seuerall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
verses, beginning all in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
Hebrew text, with one se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3702:12"/>
letter, wherein some will
haue a mysterie included. But there
are three chiefe reasons rendred
thereof: the first is, that it is done
and composed so, for the greater
ornament of the Psalme, the matter
thereof being so excellent. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is, that the excellent doctrine
and matter of the Psalme may bee
the more diligently noted, &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
delight &amp; estimation had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And thirdly, that these excellent
doctrines abounding so in euerie
part and verse of the Psalme, being
many, diuers, and so necessarie by
this forme of composition and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they may more easily be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
in our memory. But <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
vpon this same Psalme, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a fourth reason &amp; vse, diuerse
from the former of the notation of
this Psalm so, which is thus; <hi>Vt paruu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum
Ingenia primis literarum elementis
legendi vsum addiscunt: ita nos buiusmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
elementis vsum viuendi:</hi> As the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
or wits of little children (saith
he) by the first elements of letters
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3702:12"/>
learneth the vse of reading, so let
vs by these Elementes learne the
vse of liuing.</p>
            <p>The full Alphabet whereby this
Psalme is noted, noteth to vs the
fulnes of the matter therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and that wee with our whole
affections should fully embrace the
same, and with all our heart and
soule desire it, and delight therein.</p>
            <p>The diuersitie of the letters shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the diuersitie and plentie of
matter, that is set before our eies; as
so many pleasant &amp; holesome deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
dishes, at a bountifull ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet.</p>
            <p>The vnitie of all the verses in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
octonarie beginning with one
letter, doth demonstrate the vnitie
of the matter therein contained, to
the delight whereof, if wee will v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
our hearts, it is able to vnite vs
with God our Father in loue.</p>
            <p>By the octonar number in euery
section is declared,<note place="margin">Leuit. 12.</note> that as the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of vncleannesse, and the
celebration of <hi>Circumcision</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the fore-skin of the flesh was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3702:13"/>
taken away) by Gods law, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
the eight day; euen so by the
embracing of these doctrines and
obseruing of Gods holy Lawe
(whose excellencie and powrefull
effects are set downe in these octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries)
our hearts shall be purified,
and made cleane before God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thereby the fore-skin of our
heart, which barreth out Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that king of glory from entring
into it, and our carnall affections ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, our drossie &amp; vncleane
corruption, by the fire of that
word and spirit burned vp, and
consumed, and the Image of God,
Iesus Christ, that second <hi>Adam</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to vs; with whom wee must
rise in righteousnesse, as by sinne
in that first <hi>Adam,</hi> we al did fall and
lost that glorious Image of our
Creator, and God.</p>
            <p>As for the Argument of the
whole Psalme: In the same the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prophet of God exhorteth all
the faithfull, and members of the
true Church of Christ, carefully to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3702:13"/>
retaine, keepe and obserue the
word of God in all sinceritie &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of truth, eschewing all additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or mixture of mans wisedome
(which is foolishnesse) thereunto,
and worshipping God, as hee hath
commanded and warranted vs, in
his word onely. As also that not
onely wee retaine the same in the
sinceritie thereof, worship GOD
onely according thereunto, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
we make it a rule to all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
practising the same dayly:
night and day delighting and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
therein: laying and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it vp in our hearts: and by the
sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our life, to shew the
pietie of our heart, thought, word,
and deed agreeing therevnto. And
because to vnderstand Gods word
(in respect of our naturall igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
and in our life to practise
the same (in respect of the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sinne, that he hath gotten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vs) is not of the strength of man,
but must be the power, &amp; worke of
Gods holy spirit, therefore he mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3702:14"/>

dutie. There are ioyned also
thanksgiuings of the Prophet, that
already (as he confesseth to Gods
glory &amp; the incouragement of the
faithfull) hee had found and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in his heart, the beginnings
of true faith, comfort, and new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to be kindled, which ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
he craues to bee augmented
and confirmed in him, thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in his person teaching vs our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to enquire if wee can, or haue
found Gods graces begun, sowed
or rooted in our hearts; if not as yet
to desire the same earnestly, if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
to craue the increasing and
confirmation further thereof, and
be truely thankfull for that we haue
receiued.<note place="margin">Vers. 25. 28. 81. &amp; 120.</note> Hee complaineth also,
shewing the heauinesse, faintnesse,
griefe, and feare that he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
for the horror of his sinnes:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3702:14"/>
notwithstanding comforting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and all the godly, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
or outwardly afflicted, by
relying in faith vpon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and saluation reuealed and
made to him, and to all those that
beleeue in his name; which is, and
must be, the onely ease and comfort
to any afflicted soule. As also of the
multitude,<note place="margin">Vers. 157. 161. 93.</note> greatnesse, and crueltie
of his enemies, that despising Gods
lawe themselues, did seeke like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to hinder him from walking
therein, for whom his eyes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
did gush out with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of water, because they kept
not the same, desiring God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to represse their crueltie, and
wicked enterprise, and the more
they did seeke to drawe him away
from his law and obedience, that
hee would in his mercie the more
confirme and establish him in his
statutes; shewing thereby the many
hinderances, that the godly hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
had, and shall continually haue
cast in their way by Sathan, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3702:15"/>
their iourney to that spirituall
<hi>Canaan,</hi> with their <hi>Ioshua, Iesus:</hi> and
our dutie therein, to bee sorie for
their aberring, and desire our owne
confirmation; likewise, as hee did
shew that they were blessed who
walked in Gods law, so to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
hee sheweth their condition,
and that their portion is shame and
confusion, if they will not returne
and walke also therein: so setting
before euery mans eies, with <hi>Moses,</hi>
life and death to choose.</p>
            <p>The diuision of the Psalme (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the matter therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained)
may be in foure parts.</p>
            <p>In the first whereof, he sheweth
the true felicitie and happinesse of
the godly, to be placed and consist
in the studie, beliefe, and obedience
of the will of God reuealed &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
vnto vs in his word, which
(in respect of the excellencie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the desire and estimation wee
should also haue of the same in our
heart) is adorned with many titles
proper thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:3702:15"/>In the second part, the Prophet
(for an example to the faithfull)
earnestly desireth God, to informe
and confirme him in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
studie, beleefe &amp; obedience
of his reuealed will, by the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his powerfull spirit, who may
inlighten his vnderstanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
and conforme his will to his
owne, sanctifie his affections and all
the members of his body, seeing the
same is not in the power of man to
doe, <hi>neither can flesh and blood reueale
the same to vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third part, he desireth God
to deliuer him from all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whether of his owne flesh, of
sinne, the world, Satan, or his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enemies, which might hinder
or stay him any waies from wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
more freely in the paths of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
and his word.</p>
            <p>And in the last and fourth part,
being priuie to his own conscience,
of the institution of his former life,
and equitie of his cause, hee implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
Gods constant assisting grace,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3702:16"/>
in the administration of the rest of
his life, committing and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his eternall protection, for
euer, himselfe and his cause.</p>
            <p>So farre in generall, concerning
the Author, Intitulation, Notation,
Argument, and Diuision of this
Psalme, for an Induction to the
specials following.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the speciall
notation, argument, and diuision
of this second octonarie, or section.
The first verse whereof, by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
grace of Gods spirit, shall
be by vs handled.</p>
            <p>The notation of this second octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
is by the second letter of the
Hebrew Alphabet, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Beth:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
euery verse in the originall,
contained in this section is noted,
and beginneth.</p>
            <p>The signification thereof (as all
Hebrew letters signifie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
excelleth all other letters) is
double, for it is either <hi>Confusio,</hi> as
<hi>Ambrose</hi> turneth it, and so, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why this octonarie is noted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3702:16"/>
therewith, is thus; that whosoeuer
redresseth his way by Gods word,
seeketh him with his whole heart,
wandereth not from his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
hideth his promise in his
heart, that he sinne not against him,
declareth the iudgements of his
mouth, delighteth in the way of his
testimonies, meditateth in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps,
and forgetteth not his word:
whosoeuer (I say) obserueth these
eight things, contained in this octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
of eight Verses, shall neuer
see <hi>Confusion.</hi> This same reason and
promise is set downe more briefly
in the 5. &amp; 6. verses of this Psalme,

by God in his iustice, for

there is <hi>confusio contritionis,</hi> a confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>The other signification of this
Letter <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Beth,</hi> is <hi>Domus;</hi> a house
(whose figure it representeth) and
so the reason is thus, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
would bee counted as one of
Gods house, and so bee saued; As
God (the Master of the house) is
pure and cleane; his house and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
cleane likewise: so thou who
would adioyne thy selfe in thy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3702:17"/>
youth to their societie, and eate at
his table: thou must be cleane also;
<hi>Cleansing thy waies according to his word:</hi>
putting on that white cleane robe
of the righteousnesse of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
that wedding garment, &amp; seruing
him in his Family, in purity &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of life, by obseruing these
doctrines which are here set down
in this section to doe the same.</p>
            <p>The Argument of this Section
is this, as in the former generally to
all men hee commended the desire
of godlinesse, and keeping of Gods
word, shewing the estate of such
to be blessed, and that to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way to attaine to true &amp; perfect
happines for euer: so now in this
octonarie, and first verse thereof:
particularly hee commendeth the
same desire of pietie, and obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods word, vnto young
men first, and that for two chiefe
causes moouing him. Whereof the
first is, because that age, placeth a
man vncertaine, betweene two
wayes, what course of life to chuse,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3702:18"/>
(as <hi>Xenophon</hi> reporteth of <hi>Hercules</hi>
out of <hi>Prodicus;</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> in the
first of his <hi>Offices</hi> saith, <hi>Imprimis au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
constituendum est qui nos, &amp; quales
esse velimus, quae deliberatio est omnium
diffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>na.</hi> Wee must first appoint
what men, and of what sort or
calling wee would bee, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisement
of all other is hardest
and most difficult, in such an hard
&amp; doubtfull deliberation: therfore
the Prophet here sheweth that no
better nor surer counsell can bee,
then to follow Gods word,<note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note> as our
counsellor which may both direct
and retaine vs in a good course of
life, and therefore not to delay time
till olde age: but to beginne in our
youth, which whosoeuer neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and therein hardens his heart
in sinne, that man hardly is, or can
be recalled and brought (except it
be by the extraordinarie mercie of
God) to repentance and a good life
hereafter.</p>
            <p>The second reason is, because
youth is carried with a more head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3702:18"/>
force vnto vice, lust, and vaine
pleasures of the flesh: Therefore it
hath neede of straiter discipline,
more carefull watching, and harder
brydling, and more diligent instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by the word of God, which
except it be adhibited timely, there
is great perill, and it is to be feared,
lest head-longs in the vehemencie
of their course, they bee carryed
suddenly into vtter destruction,
which lamentable experience hath
too often taught to be true.</p>
            <p>The diuisio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of this octonar is in
three chiefe parts. The first where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is contained in this first Verse,
which God willing shall be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of; wherein (being to shew the
excellent effects of Gods word, in
this whole Psalme) is, that it keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from sinne, it quickneth, it
bringeth peace, and gladnesse to
the heart, it giueth vnderstanding
&amp;c. (thereby the more to induce
and mrue euery man, to a greater
desire and loue thereof) He setteth
downe heere the first particular
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3702:19"/>
and cheife effect of Gods word, as
to all ages and men, so chiefly and
more particularly, commending
and commanding the study, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
and desire thereof; to youth
(the firstage, capable of the same)
for the reasons and causes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
            <p>The second part of this octona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
is from the 1. Verse thereof to
the 15. wherein hee setteth downe
his owne example, for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and further moouing of yong
men, to embrace his former exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and it containeth foure seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
confessions made vnto God.
The first, of his great desire to
Gods word,<note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> in <hi>seeking him with his
whole heart;</hi> with a prayer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
him the more therein. The
second, of his great care and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
he had thereof,<note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note> 
               <hi>in hiding it
in his heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the end, that hee should not
sinne against him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 13.</note> The third of the
<hi>declaring of the iudgements of his mouth
with his lippes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and the fourth, <hi>of the
great delight he had therein, as in all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:3702:19"/>
In the middest of his confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
vers. 12. interponing a thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing
and prayer. <hi>Blessed art thou
O Lord, teach me thy statutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third part, is in the 15. and
16. Verses, containing a foure-fold
promise further, according to his
foure-folde former Confession,
which are; first,<note place="margin">Vers. 15.</note> Meditation in his
preceps: secondly, consideration
of his wayes:<note place="margin">Vers. 16.</note> thirdly, delight in
his statutes: and fourthly, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his word.</p>
            <p>The first part of the octonarie
contained in this first Verse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is diuided againe in two parts, a
question, and answere made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
(albeit there bee some who
make all the Verse a question one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
thereby denoting the difficultie
(chiefly in yong men) to liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Gods law, &amp; framing it so,
according to the Hebrew: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
shall a yong man cleanse his way, that
he may keepe the same, according to thy
word?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:3702:20"/>The Question.<q>Wherewith shall a yong man redresse his
way?</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this question there are foure
things to be considered. First, the
person concerning whom this
question is mooued, described by
his age; <hi>A yong man.</hi> Secondly, the
matter of the question; <hi>A yong mans
way.</hi> Thirdly, an action is set down;
<hi>Redressing, or cleansing thereof; in futuro,</hi>
of the contrary, thereby signifying,
the present estate thereof to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
and vnredressed in it selfe.
And the fourth meanes; <hi>Wherein?
or wherewith?</hi> this action should bee
performed, by way of interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
denoting the difficultie thereof.</p>
            <p>The answere hath reference vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the question propounded so:
<hi>Wherewith shall a yong man redresse his
way? In taking heed thereto,</hi> where the
actions of <hi>redressing,</hi> and <hi>taking heede</hi>
hath their reference: the rule of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3702:20"/>
both is, <hi>according to thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The translation of the question,
according to the originall in the
Hebrew is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>in quo munda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
&amp;c. Wherein shall a young man
cleanse his way?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> as if hee would say;
seeing the way of all men is defiled
with many enormities, and much
filthinesse of sinne in all ages, but
chiefly youth is polluted with
great iniquitie, and vncleannesse of
the burning lustes of the carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
therefore (sinne in them
being most strongest, and so most
seuerely and soonest to bee repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
wherein or in what manner
shall a young man purge the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes
of his youth, and redresse
these strong enormities of his life?
The vulgar translation is <hi>wherewith,</hi>
or by what way or meanes may, or
shall a <hi>yong man redresse</hi> and rectifie
his way and course of liuing? All to
the same sense and meaning.</p>
            <p>First, that this admonition and
exhortation of young men in this
verse is propounded question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3702:21"/>
               <hi>Wherewith? &amp;c,</hi> It teacheth vs,
first the difficultie of the redressing
the way of our youth, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the peruerse and aduerse
nature thereof, from hearing good
counsell and the godly graue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
of our elders, as also of
the vnaptnes of this age, to follow
or to embrace the same, except by
Gods speciall grace it be assisted &amp;
seconded, which is plainely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
in the examples of those in
the primitiue world, that despised
old Noahs instructions, of the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi>
and chiefly the two sonnes
in law of old <hi>Lot,</hi> to whom hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
to mocke when wisely and
louingly hee warned them to flee
Gods iudgementes, of the two
sonnes of olde <hi>Eli,</hi> who despised
their fathers reproofe and warning
to abstaine from the filthy lustes
and sinnes, with sundry others,
whose ende was euer fearefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and ouerthrow, for youth
like an vntamed or wild colt, can
hardly heare or will obey, the strait
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3702:21"/>
bridle that restraineth libertie, it
cannot away with graue counsell
of his Elders: but as foolish <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
despised his fathers olde coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors,
and heard the furious and
hote yong men that were brought
vp with him. So they thinke olde
age, doting, and willingly hath a
ready eare open to the intising Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
of their owne affections and
youthly lusts, who are their young
counsellors, and <hi>Placebos,</hi> hearing
and beeing seduced by them: till
many of them haue lost a greater
kingdom then <hi>Salomon</hi> could leaue
to his sonne, euen that kingdome of
heauen, which Christ hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by his blood; they will followe
whether they draw them, and saile
as they blow in their sailes, till on
the pernitious rockes of fearefull
destruction, many of them make
ship-wracke, they will not be recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
nor awake, but lye asleepe vpon
the deceitfull knees, of the delaying
and dallying <hi>Dalilah,</hi> of the filthy
lustes and vaine poysonable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3702:22"/>
vntill they haue lost their
strength, Gods graces and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
bestowed vpon them, become
a mocking stocke for their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and a ready prey for Sathan,
that greedie deuouring Lyon.
Therefore let all yong men, (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the difficultie of youth
is such, to heare or obey good and
graue instructions, whereby their
wayes may bee redressed,) desire
and entreat earnestly of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,
to giue them his grace
and the assistance of his spirit, that
their eares may bee willingly and
readily open to heare his word, and
the godly admonitions of their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to giue them hearts to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
aright, that it is for their great
&amp; only good, to follow the same, to
shut their eares and hearts, to all
entising of sin or vice, &amp; to direct
their foot-steps into his holy way:
that by his grace they may the
more easily walke from grace to
grace: &amp; truly such difficulty resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
&amp; ouercome, maketh a greater
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3702:22"/>
and more glorious victorie to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
yong man, who hath Gods feare
before his eyes.</p>
            <p>The second thing which wee
note, by the interrogatiue setting
down, of this exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of youth,
is, not onely the fore-named na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
difficultie, in them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
of their wayes: but also
the dutie of all Youth, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
here in the person of a yong
man plainly sheweth: which is that
euery one should enter into a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
examination &amp; inquisition of
his wayes, and that, not consulting
with flesh and blood, for then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
excuses and delayes shall bee,
but with the Prophet heere, with
and before God alone, enquiring
of his waies according to his word.
The further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of this duty,
beside the prophets example here,
is plainly set downe in the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament:
<hi>Lam. 3. 40. Let vs search and
trie our wayes and turne againe vnto the
Lord:</hi> the neglect and incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
whereof, the same Prophet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3702:23"/>
complaineth greatly vpon: <hi>Iere. 8.
6. I hearkned, &amp; heard, but none spake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
no man repented him of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
saying, What haue I done?</hi> (the
incommoditie followeth) <hi>euery one
therefore turned to his race, as a horse rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
into the battell.</hi> In the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
also the Apostle comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the same dutie: 2. <hi>Cor. 13. 5.
Prooue your selues whether you are in the
faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 28.</note> 
               <hi>examine your selues; know you not
your owne selues? how that Iesus</hi> Christ
<hi>is in you, except you bee reprobates.</hi> So
that this triall and diligent exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
must be in the heart of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true Christian, yong and olde;
and indeed it is the very first step
to saluation: <hi>Marie Magdalen,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euer she could come neere to
Christ, or found any comfort in
him, she tryed and with mourning
considered; <hi>What are my wayes? what
haue I done? Peter,</hi> ere euer Christ
looked comfortably vpon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
after his deniall, with bitter
teares he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered; <hi>what haue I done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prodigall child, and true
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3702:23"/>
paterne of a conuerted sinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euer he saw his fathers face or
house: his first step, was, he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with sorrow and tryed; <hi>What
haue</hi> I <hi>done? Paul,</hi> before his co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
heard from heauen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in his heart; <hi>What hee had
done, before he said, Lord, what shall</hi> I
<hi>doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Iewes at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon were
pricked in their consciences, and
with griefe of minde considered;
<hi>What they had done,</hi> before they
could say: <hi>Men and brethren, what
shall we doe?</hi> For this triall is the first
step and embracing of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
For from serious tryall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
true acknowledging, from
true acknowledging, commeth
humble confession, and from hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
confession proceedeth the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of absolution, and comfort of
Gods spirit: if we iudge our selues,
we shall not bee iudged (saith the
trueth) and how can we iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
triall and knowledge? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let euery yong man learne to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3702:24"/>
trie himself and his wayes: <hi>What he
hath done,</hi> according to Gods word:
For without this first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nquisition
to find out the errour &amp; impuritie
of our waies, we shal neuer attaine
to the second, to enquire <hi>Wherewith</hi>
they shal be cleansed, redressed, or
rectified,</p>
            <p>The 3. thing which is to be noted
by this inquisitiue manner of the
Prophets speach, and which may
be called the second step to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, that after such diligent and
earnest enquirie of our wayes,
<hi>What wee haue done,</hi> wee must also
ioyne a true acknowledging and
humble confession of our errour
&amp; transgression, proceeding from
an inward griefe, with an heartie
desire of redressing; for how can
a yong man inquire and desire of
God, that his waies may be redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
or cleansed, except hee first
try them and acknowledge the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and vncleanes thereof? Can a
man turne to walke in the right
way, except first, hee find and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3702:24"/>
himselfe to bee in the
wrong? Can a man seck for a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian
except first he finde and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
himself to be diseased?
Therefore if we would returne or
be conuerted, we must first by try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
acknowledge and confesse with
<hi>Isaiah, 53. 6. All wee like sheepe haue
gone astray: we haue turned euery one to
his owne way.</hi> And except with the
Prodigall sonne we acknowledge,
first, that wee haue gone in a farre
countrie from our father, wee can
neuer resolue to draw nere againe,
except we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse humbly, first vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the knees of a sorrowfull soule,
that wee haue sinned against hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and before him, not being any
more worthy to be called his sons.
Verily, we shal neuer be imbraced
in the armes of his mercie, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the comfortable kisse of his
loue: thou must say, Lord, forgiue
me the sinnes and rebellions of my
youth, before he say to thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that they are pardoned: thou
must first acknowledge thy wayes,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3702:25"/>
to be polluted with the filth of sin,
and lusts of thy youth, before thou
can inquire, <hi>Wherewith they may be
redressed,</hi> or obtaine that the Lord
would cleanse and purge them in
his mercie, the poore Publican ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
first that hee was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie
to lift vp his eyes to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in respect of his offences, before he
went home iustified before God,
the theefe vpon the crosse confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that he dyed and suffered iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his sinnes, before he receiued
that comfortable promise and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
from Christ, to bee with
him that same night in Paradise.
<hi>Dauid</hi> first confessed to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Nathan,</hi> that hee had sinned
indeede, before he receiued the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that his sinnes were forgiuen
him. With many such examples,
shewing that young and olde, wee
must al confesse our guiltinesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that great Iudge and King of
all Kings, before wee receiue our
pardon: before earthly Kings and
Iudges, confession &amp; acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3702:25"/>
of the fault maketh present
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation; before God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
confession and acknowledging
of our sinnes with sorrow, maketh
present absolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, &amp; chiefly youth (whose er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly are greatest (professe
&amp; confesse in all submissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hart
before God the enormities, vnclean<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,
&amp; iniquitie of their waies, that
the God of all mercy &amp; loue, may
at his good will and pleasure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
redresse, and purge the
same, to his glory and our eternall
comfort.</p>
            <p>The fourth &amp; last obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
may be gathered by this interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
proposition of the Prophet in
person of a young man, and which
may be truely called the third step
to saluation, is not onely to try our
waies, and to acknowledge the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
course thereof with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
but to make a further and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
inquisition of the right way
with a harty desire to walk therin,
I must not only examine my waies
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3702:26"/>
and course of life hitherto, nor
thinke it enough to bee sorrowfull
and grieued for the erronious go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
astray therein, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and acknowledge, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
I must ioyne this inquirie &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to know, <hi>Whereby shall a yong
man redresse or purge his way?</hi> It is not
enough to know that I am out of
the way, except I labor to know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
how I may come into the same
again. It is not enough for a man to
know that he is sick, except he stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
also, to know whereby hee may
attaine to his perfect health againe.
When a man is in a great danger or
peril, his chiefe deuising is how to
come out of it. It is not enough to
know that I am in prison, except I
labor how to be freed: Youth for
the most part walketh &amp; loueth to
walke in that broad &amp; by-way of
liberty, where there is no restraint
or curbing of the affections, and
lusts of the flesh for a time delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in vaine and transitorie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
which carieth a momentary
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3702:26"/>
sweetnesse with them to the flesh,
but leaueth behind them eternall
bitternes to the soule, this way is a
strait and darke prison in the end.
It is a by-way that bringeth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse
to the soule, the walking
therein, is in great perill, and the
foote-steps thereof woundeth the
conscience, therefore it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to know &amp; see that it is euil,
erronious and vncleane, but they
must also earnestly seeke after the
right way and follow it, <hi>Whereby
they may redresse and purge their wayes.</hi>
The Prophet of God, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 6. 16.
commandeth and sheweth this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to old and yong, in these words:
<hi>Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the wayes
and behold, and aske for the olde way,
which is the good way, and walke therein,
and ye shall find rest for your soules. Paul</hi>
obserued this, when hee said, <hi>Lord,
What shall I doe?</hi> The yong man in
the Gospell that came to <hi>Christ,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
this also, when he said; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
What shall I doe to obtaine eternall
life?</hi> The Iewes that were pricked in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3702:27"/>
conscience at <hi>Peters</hi> sermon obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
this, when they inquired one
another; <hi>Men and brethren what shall
we doe?</hi> The Iailer, Act. 16. 30. obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
this, when he fel downe before
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> and asked them; <hi>Sirs,
what must I doe to be saued.</hi> And Christ
Iesus the way it self, teacheth vs the
same duty, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth; <hi>Search
the Scriptures, for it is they that testifie of
me.</hi> Let all young men therefore,
who desire to bee esteemed true
Christians, and hauing a name to
be alive in Christ, not to bee dead,
inquire of their owne waies, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
narrowly, &amp; vnpartially, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
truely and in most
submissiue manner confessing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the throne of almighiy God,
their errors and manifold enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
with an earnest and hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to know and practise, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with</hi>
they may redresse and purge
their waies, and walke in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
and holy waies of God
and his commandements, and for
all, propone and set before their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3702:27"/>
eyes the example of that forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
young man onely in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
that imitating him they may
addresse themselues in prayer and
meditation to Iesus Christ and his
word, making it their chiefe care
and inquirie to know and practise,
how they may attaine vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life. Blessed is the condition
of such a young man who doth so,
and who in all humilitie doth daily
prostrate himselfe vpon the knees
of his heart before the throne of
the maiestie of God, earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
and wishing with the same
Prophet in the 5. verse, <hi>O that my
waies were directed to keepe thy statutes
O Lord.</hi> Happy is the estate of such
a young man, and farre happy shal
it be hereafter, whose delight is in
Gods word, &amp; care to reforme and
conform his waies according ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.
As woful &amp; dangerous is the
conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the contrary of all such
who like vnbridled horses, vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
colts, &amp; swine wallowing in
the mire &amp; puddle of vncleannes,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3702:28"/>
onely rauished in the hote furie of
the lustes of their affections, and
led by the fearefull hand of sinne,
and vaine pleasures of the flesh:
vntill blindlings (as the Oxe is led
to the slaughter, or the foole to the

therefore &amp; indefinitely, without
limitation or exemption of any,
that the person concerning whom
this question is propounded, is
saide, to bee a <hi>yong man,</hi> whither
poore or rich, noble or ignoble,
mightie or impotent, the princes
or the beggers sonne, or what
soeuer he be, we learne; First, that
this exhortation (as al Gods word)
is indifferently spoken to all yong
men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>For with God there is no respect of
persons:</hi> and therefore that all yong
men, great or smal, should hearken
thereunto, and apply the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to their owne consciences.
For from the kings sonne to the
poore beggers, all are his creatures
alike, and God their only Creator,
their beginning is all one, for out
of the dust were they taken, and
their end equally, shal be al one, for
to dust they shall returne: all came
equally, naked out of the wombe,
and all shall goe the same way, to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3702:29"/>
the graue and corruption. Sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

cutteth downe both as grasse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually:
all liue one naturall life vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth, and draw their breath
equally; and all liue one supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life in Iesus Christ equally, the
naturall food of the mortall bodies
of both, is the same, to wit, meate
and drinke; the supernaturall food
of the immortall soules of both, is
likewise the same, euen the body
and blood of Iesus Christ, who hath
redeemed both alike by his death,
and sanctifieth both alike by his
viuificating spirit, vnto the life of
righteousnesse: one Iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth
both, without respect, and
one reward is to both, the pledges
of the kingdome of God, which
are his Word and Sacraments, are
alike offered, and should be alike
administrated to both: the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Monarch as the poorest beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
boh are equally the sonnes of
the first <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; the poorest beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
aswell as the mightiest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3702:29"/>
is equally the sonne and
member of the second <hi>Adam</hi> Iesus
Christ, if in him he obey Gods wil,
and apply to his soule his promises
by faith; as in the first <hi>Adam</hi> he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed
Gods wil, by misbeleeuing
of his threatnings; yea, as <hi>Lazarus</hi>
was preferred before <hi>Diues,</hi> so are
many outcasts of the world, before
the mightiest Powers and Princes
thereof, Gods law equally bindeth
both great &amp; small, his threatnings
for sin, appertaine equally to both,
and are alike executed vpon them
without any exception or exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of persons, as his sweet promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of mercy belongeth also and are
equally offered to both. All are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
admonished in his woorde
taught, and rebuked by the same,
and before all mens eies indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
is set downe therein life and
death to choose. Therefore let no
man, rich or poore, exempt himself
from the exhortations, admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
reprehensions, or any part of
the word of God, but as they are
spoken to all, so particularly let
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3702:30"/>
euery one apply them to his owne
soule and conscience, they are the
King of kings statutes, binding
and pertaining to all his subiects,
as well of highest as of lowest place
and degre; and especially let euery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>yong man</hi> (whatsoeuer he be, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

            </p>
            <p>The second obseruation, and Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
here-upon,<note place="margin">The 2. vse.</note> which the Prophet
would haue euery one to marke
and consider, is this: That in our
youth and first age, we must begin
then to serue God, in vprightnes
and holines of life, without any
further delay or procrastination of
time; not sacrificing our childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
or youth to the idoll of our
owne affections, and the deuill (as
these Idolaters did their children
to <hi>Molech</hi>) and thinking that God
will accept of our decrepite, cold
old age, when coldly we shall offer
the same vnto him: but as hee will
haue the euening sacrifice of age,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3702:30"/>
so wil he haue the morning oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of youth, as he hath giuen life to
al ages, so by all ages he wil be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and being all to all, by all, in all
he wil be worshipped. The Lord is
<hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the first and the
last, the beginning and the end: he
will be honored therfore as well in
the <hi>Alpha</hi> or the beginning of our
youth and first age, as hee will in
the <hi>Omega,</hi> or end of our last olde
age: hee is strength, and giueth
strength to all; in this our strength
then of youth, we must not rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, and runne with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
but as <hi>Gideon</hi> in his strength
was commanded by Gods angel to
rise against the <hi>Midianites,</hi> &amp; fight
against his enemies: so by Gods
owne word, and the holy messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his spirit, euery yong man is
commanded in the strength of his
youth to rise against, fight and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
his owne corrupt affections,
which are enemies to God and his
own saluation, so that in our youth
we must begin and serue God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3702:31"/>
and redresse our waies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his word, not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but in euery age wee haue
neede and must doe so, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(seeing <hi>a maiori ad minus</hi>) if
Gods word serue to redresse a <hi>yong
mans way,</hi> who burneth in his lusts
and affections, much more serueth
it to redresse a man in ripe age, his
affections being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more cooled:
but chiefly in youth we haue most
neede by Gods word to cleanse
and redresse our waies, for sundry
reasons.</p>
            <p>First, because our nature
then (which contraries grace) is
strongest; and so wee are more apt
and readie to bee led away by our
lustes, and to bee drawne in the
chaine of our affections by Sathan
into a farre countrie of sinne, from
our owne fathers house with that
prodigall sonne, to abuse and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otously
to consume Gods liberall
giftes and manifolde graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
vppon vs in pouertie, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3702:31"/>
and famine of all
goodnesse, feeding our filthy
vncleane lustes of the flesh, and
greedily feeding and eating with
them. Therefore in most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
estate wee must take the
best and straitest heede, when
our enemie is within walls, then
most strongly and couragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
must hee bee resisted, when
wee finde our nature most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to obey sinne, then must
wee striue and wrestle with
GOD in most earnest pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and hold him fast, vntill hee
giue vs his blessing, and the
strength of his Spirite to striue
also and preuaile with sinne, that
our nature by his grace may bee
reformed, our will made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable,
and inclining to his, and
that in soule and bodie wee may
bow in obeying his Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, our youth is the
beginning of our pilgrimage,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3702:32"/>
and in it, we must enter in, either at
the broad way which leadeth vnto
euerlasting destruction, or at the
narrow way which leadeth vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
ioy and saluation. The
true way is <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and his
righteousnes: (I <hi>am the way, the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and life</hi>) who as he is the way, so
he is the end of the way, <hi>eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation;</hi>
as he is <hi>God,</hi> so he leadeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>God,</hi> and to the kingdome of <hi>God,
his father:</hi> and is the ease and rest of
all that commeth loaden or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vnto him. Therefore in thy
youth, and entring in thy pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
see thou enter in this way,
and if thou wouldst finde this way
to walke therein, desire <hi>God</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thy eies, that thou mayst see this
narrow way: <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi>
(saith the <hi>way</hi> it selfe) <hi>for they are
that testifie of me.</hi> When thou hast
found him in his word, and known
him by his word, (as the sheepe
doth the true sheep-heard) apply
him then by a liuely faith to thy
soule, and take hold of the way.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3702:32"/>
and hauing found, knowne, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and taken hold of him, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
thy whole course of life, in
thought, word and deede vnto this
way, euer walking therin, <hi>Be you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as I am holy</hi> (saith he;) <hi>Learne of me,
for I am humble and meeke. Moses</hi> was
commanded to pull off his shooes,
because the ground hee did stand
vpon was holy. If thou stand t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n
vpon that holy ground, &amp; ground-stone
Iesus Christ, &amp; walke in that
sacred pure way, thou must sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and cast from thee all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of sinne and corruption. If
thou wouldst walke with that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
Lambe, thou must walke
clothed with that white long robe
of sanctitie &amp; righteousnesse, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
and washed in his blood:
beleeue Christ Iesus in thy heart,
confesse Christ Iesus with thy
mouth, and shew Christ Iesus and
him image in thy life and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
so hast thou enterd, so doost
thou walke, &amp; so shalt thou attaine
to the end of this true and ioyfull
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3702:33"/>
way. All other waies are by-waies,
the leader and ladder Sathan, a
manslaier, a lyer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and the end of al such is Gods
fierce wrath and eternall perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hee leadeth thee from the true
Citie of Ierusalem in his deceitfull
by-waies, to rob thee of the good
gifts of God bestowed vpon thee,
and to kill body &amp; soule, and cast
it into vtter darkenesse: like a wise
<hi>Vlisses</hi> harken not to this <hi>Syren,</hi> who
would allure and draw thee so, to
no sweete harmony, but to destroy
the ship of the body, and precious
loading of thy soule, (for which
christ shed his precious blood) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the rocks of eternal destruction, to
be his pray. Auoide this <hi>Scylla</hi> and
<hi>Carybdis,</hi> and hold constantly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the true way Christ, enter
and perseuere in it in thy youth, &amp;
when thou art aged thou shalt bee
at the end thereof, that thou maiest
see with the holy Apostle,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 7.</note> when
the time of thy departing is at
hand, <hi>I haue sought a good fight, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3702:33"/>
haue finished my course. I haue kept the
faith: for henceforth is laid vp for mee the
crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord
the righteous Iudge shall giue mee at that
day; and not vnto me onely, but vnto a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l
them that loue his appearing.</hi> Lorde
grant that euery one of vs may in
our youth enter in this course, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
continue therein t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll our

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ues end, and at our last dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we may haue this sure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
perswasion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we should serue God in
our youth, chiefly obeying his wil,
and abstaining from sinne, because
our youth is as the fat, most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
vnto God, not sinning in it
when we may sinne, and therefore
let vs sacrifice the same vnto him,
not offering vp the fat morning
sacrifice of our youth to <hi>Molech,</hi> the
diuell and our sinfull corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and thinking that the God
of <hi>Israel</hi> wil accept of our leane and
lame colde euening sacrifice of
weake olde age, and so bee serued
with the worst after his enemie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3702:34"/>
In our youth wee must not
runne with the diuell, and in age
thinke to returne vnto God, neuer
forsaking our lusts, nor ceasing to
fulfill them in our youth, till then
in age they forsake vs, with the
strength to accomplish them; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we are strongest wee are weake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to follow Christ: much
more vnable when wee are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest.
Therefore as <hi>Dauid</hi> killed <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi>
in his youth, so let vs seeke to
slay that manslayer Sathan, in resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
him, and kill that <hi>Goliah</hi> of sin
and our corrupt affections, which
hee vseth as weapons against vs,
putting off all fleshly armour, and
arming body and soule with the
strength of Gods Spirit, putting
our trust and sure confidence in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, (who as by former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience)
he did ouercome his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in his owne person, and in
the persons of all the Saints, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
members, so likewise of his
constant loue, vnfallible trueth,
and vnfaileable strength, hee will
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3702:34"/>
assist and persist with vs, vntill wee
haue likewise troden him vnder
foote. As <hi>Dauid</hi> being young, did
pull out a Lambe out of the mouth
of the Lyon and the Beare, so by
resisting that cruell raging Lyon
Sathan, who daily seeketh how to
deuoure our soules and bodies,
which the Lambe of GOD hath
bought to himselfe. Let vs by the
strength of Gods Spirit, redeeme
our selues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his destroying iawes,
and in our youth shewe Gods
strength in vs, and while wee are
young men, let vs cast off the olde
man of sinne, and concupiscence of
the flesh, and put on Iesus Christ
the new man, walking with him in
righteousnesse &amp; holinesse of life,
a glorious garment, and blessed
companion. As <hi>Sampson</hi> being a
young man, killed the Philistims,
the enemies of God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
so in our youth, let vs ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
by the speciall assistance of
Gods grace, &amp; strength of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
Spirit, to kill, ouercome, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3702:35"/>
subdue the cruell enemies of God,
and our owne soules saluation, sin
and our corrupt affections, whom
we beare about in our mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and who dippeth in the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with vs, yet like so many Iuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
seeking to betray vs in the
hands and power of our malitious
and cruel enemie Sathan: they giue
vs their sweete milke to drinke, but
for our destruction: they make vs
sleepe vpon their knees, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
our strength, and to make
God abrace our name out of the
booke of life, to betray vs treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
into the hands of our perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
enemie, and to cut off our
heads in the midst of our drunken
sleepe of sinne, yea they sleep with
vs, as a snake in our bosom to sting
vs to eternall death: suspect then
their venome, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Saul, Dauid, Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> with many others

<hi>Salomon</hi> in his greatest glory, was
not so gloriously clothed, as one of

            <p>To such I answere, that such

heede also that they beginne well
the fable of their life: if they bee
all vppon their pleasures in the

to prooue a Tragedie, with a

as in al the rest; seeing as in heauen

It is said, that <hi>Alexander</hi> had
children borne and brought vp in
military discipline and exercise,
from their infancie in his Campes,
which made him so victorious and

that his sonnes in their banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3702:48"/>

God in their hearts. Therefore let

giue them againe vnto the Lord
and his seruice, in bringing them

of his holy name: season their

the liquor of godlinesse, and the
true knowledge of the blood of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, which must be their life:
print them with the glorious
image of Christ, which is true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that as he was the resemblance

him also in purenes &amp; sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
of life, while they are as yong

bow them that way as you
would haue them stand, when they

God sent wilde Beares out of
the wildernes (to teach them more
humanitie) and at the Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
whom they so mocked and

to their destruction. There are too

conuert their hearts to him againe,
that they may preuent his fierce

The right blessing, which Parents
should bestow vpon their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
is, when bringing them vp in the
feare of GOD, they make God
blesse them also; for if thou blesse
thy child, &amp; God curse him, what
auayleth thy blessing? but, if thou
bring him vp in the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and obedience of Iesus
Christ, to thy blessing, God and
Angels shall say, <hi>Amen,</hi> and hee
shall heape, both vpon thee, and

with a double promise, of this life,
and the life to come: then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

and as they did dwell together on

they desire together to remayne.
This, I say, is the wish, care, and
note of all godly and true parents,
and which euery one should haue
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3702:54"/>
or be knowne by; and truely, wee
see oftentimes, that children take
example of their parents, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in their footsteps, pressing to
imitate them, that they may the
more be loued by them: so that if
the father bee carefully and godly
disposed, his sonne will feare, lest
the contrary disposition be depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in him, (at least by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;)
if he see, that his father hate
and detest drunkennesse, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
swearing, or such sinnes, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if hee bee a naturall sonne, and
not a castaway, hee will bee loth to
commit any such, or at least to his
fathers knowledge or face; and, if
he haue grace in him, hee will doe
that rather, which hee knoweth to
be liking and acceptable in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sight: the example whereof,
first consider, in a truly godly &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
sonne <hi>Iacob,</hi> who knowing
that the daughters of <hi>Canaan</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased

to his parents, and that his

<hi>Ishmaels</hi> daughter to wife, of his

such was the care (albeit

to please his parents. <hi>Elies</hi>
wicked sonnes also, seeing their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
godly disposition, durst not
before him commit such enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as they did, or to his owne
knowledge, vntill by the people, it
was reported so vnto him; so that
the good inclination of the father,
is a great awe band vnto the sonne,
as of the contrary, the nature of
the sonne, is more apt to follow a
lasciuious and impious father to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3702:55"/>
wickednesse and vanitie, then a
godly graue father to piety and
true wisedome. Concerning this
aptnesse of children, to imitate
their parents example, in good or
euill, Christ himselfe also saith to
the Iewes;<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 39. 44.</note> 
               <hi>If ye were the sonnes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
ye would doe the workes of your
father Abraham, but ye are of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
the diuell, and the lusts of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye will doe:</hi> therefore let all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in the good education of
their children, be as lampes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in their life, that they may be
followed by them; and doe such
things, that therein, they would
desire their childrens imitation. It
is a great delight to parents, to
heare, that their children are like
vnto them, but if they be like them
in godlinesse, it is a great ioy and
comfort to others also. For then
they represent and resemble the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of Iesus Christ, the common
Sauiour and Father of all men, as
he was the character and expresse
Image of his Father, in Iustice,

            <p>In the 127. Psalme, <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth
children by three titles; First, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
(saith he) <hi>children are the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Lord;</hi> to shew, that they
should bee educated and brought
vp by their parents with such care,
as though they were not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men, but of God; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
what care a man hath and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
vnto his inheritance, that it
be not abused any way, or spoyled;
the like, &amp; greater care, hath God
our heauenly Father, that our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which are his inheritance,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3702:56"/>
(for of these is the kingdome of
heauen) be not negligently or euil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought vp, to dishonour his
name, who should honour him.
The heyre of a king and kingdom,
must be so educated, that hee may
be found worthy of the crowne.
The children of the faithfull, are
heyres to the King and kingdome
of Heauen. Therefore their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
as tutors, to whom they are
concredit for a time, must trayne
them vp so carefully, in pietie, and
and the obedience of God their
heauenly father, that they may bee
found worthy of the inheritance,
of that Kingdom, and Crowne of
glory, purchased by the blood of
Iesus Christ our Lord, &amp; their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
may bee found faithfull, so in
discharging their dutie therein, to
God and them. Secondly, <hi>Dauid</hi>
calleth children the Lords <hi>Reward,</hi>
shewing, that as God of his grace,
doth giue to parents children, as a
testimony of his loue, to their
earthly pleasure, comfort and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3702:56"/>
so they should (as it were) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God, by giuing and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them againe, with <hi>Hannah,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his seruice, and pleasing of him,
by an immaculate and pure life, as
a token and testimony of their loue
to God againe.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, Children are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to <hi>arrowes</hi> in the hand of the
strong man; who, if they bee well
and godly brought vp &amp; framed,
they wil shoot at their parents ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and be a griefe to their heart,
to see them prosper so, in the feare
of God, by his blessings; <hi>and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
is the man that hath his quiuer full of
them:</hi> but, if they be carelesly and
too indulgently broght vp, as <hi>Elies</hi>
sonnes, and <hi>Absolon,</hi> they will be the
darts to pearce their fathers heart,
with griefe and bitter sorrow to
them.</p>

they are the pledges of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to the parents, as also naturall
pledges of the mutuall loue of the

parents betwixt themselues, (bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the surest bond in marriage, to

<hi>Leah</hi> well did know, when beeing
conceyued, shee said, <hi>Now my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

be the pledges of Gods loue, to
their parents, in giuing them of his
grace, for their worldly pleasure;
then, by their good education, let
them be the pledges of the parents
loue to God likewise, in giuing and
dedicating them againe, vnto his
heauenly pleasure and seruice, as an
vnspotted and cleane sacrifice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

meane time, let parents be aware,
to esteeme or loue the pledge or
gift, more then God, the giuer
thereof: for if they loue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
too much, dallying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
onely with the gift, God
the giuer, will eyther make them of
a blessing in his loue, turne to a
curse in his anger, or else separate
them one from another, in making
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3702:57"/>
eyther the father childlesse shortly,
or the child fatherlesse, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
oftentimes proueth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly:
let children therfore be only
as cords, to draw the parents hearts
more and neerer vnto God, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of loue and thankefulnesse
to him, and God wil heape his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
more abundantly on them
both, &amp; also let their parents chiefe
care bee, to trim and adorne their
hearts and minds so with pietie and
vertue, as becommeth a gift or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which is to bee presented to
the King of al kings before whose
eyes, no vncleane thing can stand:
therefore Christ, once beeing to
shewe, who should inherite the
kingdome of heauen, tooke for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
a little childe, and set him in

               <note place="margin">Luke 18. 17.</note> 
               <hi>he shal not enter therein:</hi>
thereby shewing, that our children
should be so innocent, so humble,
and voyd of all euill, that they may
be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for example of the sonnes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3702:58"/>
and heires of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not as many are

sweare, before they can well speak
or aske their parents blessing, and
full of euill, before they haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to discerne good or euill: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
set tender and wise parents not
excuse their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their faults:
saying, They are tender, or haue no
wit to doe otherwise; if they bee
tender, let not the worme of sinne
so sticke vpon them, for the danger
is the greater, lest the sooner it eate
thorow their heart; and it is feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
when they haue wit to doe or
speake euill, and goe in the wrong
way, before they haue wit, or are
taught to speake or doe well, and
enter in the right way. As they
were before compared to <hi>arrowes,</hi>
we know, as the arrow is directed
at the first, so it flyeth all the way,
ouer, or vnder, or beside, but it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
commeth vnto the right marke
or butte vnlesse it be directed right
at the first, in the letting foorth out

the first comming forth out of the

which is true happinesse in Iesus

we neuer expect that they will bee

when a yong Plant sprouteth vp,
if there bee a worme, that lyeth at

teach their children to flie to

who, if they starue or die, we

of our owne children and

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3702:59"/>

is, <hi>a yong mans way,</hi> that

end, to wit, destruction; but one
onely true way, which leadeth to
the right ende, to wit, Saluation,
which is Christ Iesus, and a young
man beeing the pilgrime, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or hauing newly begun his
way, hee must diligently take heed
and trie, in what way hee insisteth,
and whether he treadeth the right
or the wrong path; and seeing in a
yong mans way, Sathan the leader
and way to perdition, on the one
side, is busiest to cast before him
many lets and hinderances of the
affections, and alluring lusts of the
flesh, with the pleasures of youth,
thereby to hinder his course, or
draw him backe from the right
way, (as the <hi>Syrens</hi> would <hi>Vlisses</hi>)
and to precipitate him headlong
from the high rockes of sinne and
despaire, in the fearefull and deepe
gulfe of vtter destruction: and on
the other side, of all ages, Youth,
(hauing newly begun, and vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

being easiest by nature to be drawn

away, and perswaded to the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
&amp; sweet pleasures of the flesh,
the world, and of sinne, and so in

enquire and desire of God, (the
way it selfe, the leader, and ende
thereof) that of his grace, he would
so direct and confirme him in his

            <p>The reason, why a yong man, in
his youth, and first steps of his wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
should examine and redresse
his wayes, is this; we know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
in a iourney, that the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wee are gone from the right
path, which leadeth to such a
place, it is the harder and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3702:62"/>
eyther by comming backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
to find the right high way,
which we foolishly lost, or to come
neere the place, which wee wish to
bee at; and thererefore that it is
best, at the beginning of our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to enquire, and bee instructed,
what way to keepe, by them who
know, and haue tread the fame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs, and by their directions in
walking forward, to trie and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our selues, if we hold likewise
in the right way or no; or if not, in
time to returne, while wee are not
farre off. So, in the iourney of this
life, we haue a place which we aime
at, to wit, Heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we haue but one
true way to it, which is Iesus Christ
and his righteousnesse, out youth
is the beginning, or first step of our
iourney, therefore in it, wee must
know and be instructed what way
to keepe, and how to walke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
by the example of Iesus Christ,
and the faithfull, who know and
haue tread the same before vs, and
by the directions and touchstone of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3702:62"/>
Gods word, we must euer bee try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and examining our selues, if we
hold in the right way, or no? and
if not, in time shortly to returne,
while we are not farre gone astray
in age, not running in the by-waies
of iniquitie in a strange countrie,
farre from our fathers house, while
wee are yong, and in feeble age,
thinking wee can returne and find
the right way againe, to walke
therein, let no man presume so, that
in the day of his youth, while he is
able, he may runne halfe way with
the diuell to hell, and in the night
of his age, when he is vnable, that
hee may returne easily from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
hold, and the slymie pits of
sin, to walke the whole way with
Christ to heauen.</p>
            <p>The second reason, why a yong
man thus, in the first steppes of his
way, must so take heed thereto, and
redresse the same, is, because the
time, of the walking in the way of
this life, is so short and vncertaine,
and therefore that wee should not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3702:63"/>
trust thereto; for wee see some die
in the bud of infancie, some in the
flower of youth, some in the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of mid-age and strength, and
some in the fall of weake rotten old
age. The sunne of the life of some
goeth too shortly, as in the winter
day; and of others, it maketh lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
delay, as in the summer. Our
life is compared to a shaddow, and
we know, at mid-day, when the
Sunne is verticall, and in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
strength to vs, the shaddow v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to be least, so, oftentimes when
we are in the greatest strength and
vigour of youth, the shaddow of
our vnconstant &amp; short life is least,
and when wee thinke vpon many
yeeres to come, as the rich Glutton
did, commonly the sentence of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
death commeth, &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to remoue. Therefore in
youth, and euery age, yea, euery
day and houre thereof, wee haue
need to suspect the vncertaine and
short way of life, and therein care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and strictly examine and trie
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3702:63"/>
if our wayes and walkings bee in
the way of the Lorde, the ende
whereof, is eternall saluation, and
if not, to day, while wee heare his
voyce, and the acceptable time of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
it selfe, to redresse &amp; cleanse
our paths and walkings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
them vnto his. For as all
riuers and springs, that come from
the sea, returne againe; so all men
that are made of the dust of the
earth, shall thither also returne, but
of the time, who can say? this drop
of the riuer, at such a time or houre,
shal returne into the Ocean? or the
returning of such a man vnto the
earth, shal be at such a determinate
speciall time or age? No, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
is vncertaine, onely then,
being as a drop of a great Riuer,
let euery man commit the same to
God, and endeuour, as he came salt
with originall corruption from the
earth or Ocean, so to walke in
Gods wayes, and the way of this
life, that hee may returne fresh and
purged by Christs blood, to the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3702:64"/>
Ocean of the graue, and so drinke
of that fresh springing riuer which
proceedeth from the midst of the
throne of God, in that heauenly
new Ierusalem for euer.</p>
            <p>Our whole life is limitted but to
80. yeares, and in one of these, as in
a poisonable cup, or dish of meate,
death surely lurketh: of all then if
thou shouldest taste and drinke,
knowing this, wouldst thou not
suspect euery one? diuide againe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
yeare in 12. moneths, thou
knowest not in what month or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of meate the poison of death
lieth, euery moneth againe in so
many weekes, and euery weeke in
so many daies, yea euery day also
in so many houres, in which houre
or moment thereof, sleeping or
waking, canst thou secure thy selfe
from this secret &amp; vncertaine poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
suspect then all, and liue so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
as to die alwaies, night or
day, being prouided, and being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so yong, remember thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not but the poison may bee in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3702:64"/>
the first drop of the cup, and yeare
of thy youth, as well as in the dreg
or last dish of olde age, when thou
art first set at the table of the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
banquet of life, the sword of
death is so soone hanged in a small
haire aboue thy neck, suspect then
the same at euery morsell, that it
fall not heauily vnawares vpon
thee, but euer haue an eye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
thou knowest not if it will
fall at thy first sitting downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more
then at thy last rising vp; as it euer
threatneth then, so bee thou euer
prepared, and in time seeke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
thy waies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Mans breath is in
his nosthrels;</hi> which is the life or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of soule and body, whose
dissolution is death. Be thou neuer
so young then, nor so strong, when
thou letteth out the same, thou
knowest not certainely if euer thou
shalt draw it in againe. Let therfore
thy soule breath vnto God, and thy
desire be, to walke in his waies, and
to redresse thine owne. <hi>All flesh is as
the grasse of the field;</hi> now greene, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3702:65"/>
presently blasted: whilest thou art
then as the greene plant in thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
youth, expect euer, and suspect
this withering blast of Death,
whose sythe shall send thee with
withered age alike, to the graue;
and in the short inconstant way of
this life, walke in his way who is
true and eternall life.</p>
            <p>This life is a swift post, running
fast vnto death, whose certaine
steps thou canst not marke nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue.
Let thy soule then begin
with him in thy first youth, and of
the contrary run swiftly vnto life,
and in the way of life, which is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. Our life is a dreame,
now present, and presently gone,
wherein who lieth longest, and is
most pleased, commonly (being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked)
riseth faintest and most
sorrowful. Doe not assure thy selfe
therefore of the length thereof, but
suspect the shortnesse: in it there is
no solide trueth nor rest; appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
therefore in the beginning
thereof, and in thy youth: let thy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3702:65"/>
soule wake and walke in the way
of trueth, Iesus Christ, in whom
true rest is onely to be found. <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
the Philosopher, did set out
the double course of this our life
by the letter Y. expressing thereby
with Christ the double way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
the one whereof hath a straight
passage &amp; narrow gate at the first,
and fewe they are that enter in
thereat: but in the end, there is
great comfort and rest, for it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vnto eternall happinesse and
saluation. The other, wide &amp; large
at the beginning, whereat many
doe enter; but in the end, they finde
great trouble and straightnesse, for
it leadeth vnto eternall miserie
and destruction. Both these waies
are set before the eyes of euery
young man, as <hi>Biuium Herculis,</hi> or as
life and death to choose.</p>
            <p>This narrow way which leadeth
vnto eternall life and saluation, (in
the which euery yong man should
walke in the pilgrimage of this life,
&amp; redresse his own waies of youth,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3702:66"/>
according therunto) is Iesus Christ
himselfe. <hi>I am the way, the veritie and
life, aad no man commeth to the Father
but by me.</hi> Our walking in him and
with him, must be in righteousnesse
and holinesse of life, being holy as
he is holy. The gate of this way is
narrow, and the passage straight;
for the liberties of flesh and blood
must bee restrained, our affections
bridled, and the whole man capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated
vnder the yoake of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Iesus Christ. And as
through many tentations hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the kingdome of heauen;
so wee must the same way follow
him, denying our selues, with our
crosses taken vp, till wee come to
the end of our way, which is true
life, and eternall saluation.</p>
            <p>The other broad way which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to destruction, and whereat
many doe enter, is sinne and Satan,
who is that deceiuing way vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
death (&amp; which euery yong
man should abhorre and flie, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thereat neuer so little, or walke
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3702:66"/>
therein neuer so few footesteps in
youth). The walking in him, and
with him, as hee is an vncleane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
must be in the impurity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie
of all sinne and filthinesse.
The gate of this damnable way, in
the beginning is broad, &amp; the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
easie, but the end is vtter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and straightnesse. Where in
following Christ, wee must subiect
the flesh vnto the Spirit; they who
follow him, must abandon, subiect,
and banish Gods cleane Spirit out
of their hearts, and be subiects and
slaues themselues, to the libertine
concupiscence of the flesh, and the
vncleane licentious lusts and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof. They must refuse the
light yoake of the obedience of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, to follow him to life, &amp;
take on the heauy yoake of al kind
of sinne, that may presse downe
their soules to the lowest hells, and
follow Sathan their way and guide
vnto eternall torments of fire and
brimstone; for as hee is a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
spirit himselfe, so the end of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3702:67"/>
the way wherein he leadeth capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated
soules, vnder his heauy yoake
of slauerie and sinne, is death and
eternal condemnation; <hi>for the reward
of sinne is death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore let euery young man,
beholding these two waies, choose
that which leadeth vnto a glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
eternall life in heauen, by a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
life for a time on earth, and
walke with, and in him, who is the
resurrection and the life, to all them
that are saued. If thy walking here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
hath beene in the by-waies
of sinne, and that broad way of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
giuing liberty and full head
to thy youthly affections, and lusts
of the flesh. <hi>Seeke how</hi> to redresse
these thy waies, &amp; hereafter striue
violently to enter in at that straight
way, which leadeth to saluation;
presse hardly to thrust in at that
narrow gate, lay off, and cast away
far from thee, all the impediments
of sinne, and the intising vanities
and pleasures of youth, and let thy
onely care be with thee, first to see
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3702:67"/>
thy Sauiour, the way is narrow that
leadeth to him; delay not then till
it be full, but striue to be foremost;
the way is narrow that leadeth to
life, therefore not soone found: in
the beginning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thy life, time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begin, and search carefully and
narrowly for it; the true way is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and straight, therefore thy
steppes therein (when thou hast
found it) must be strait and narrow,
thou must make a couenant with
thy eye, that it behold no vanitie,
thou must shut the gates of thy
eares, that thou heare no vaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
or idle speeches, offensiue
to God, thou must not harken to
them; but let the sound of Gods
word, and healthfull admonitions,
be pleasant only vnto thy hearing:
thou must haue a watch-man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy lips, and Gods feare a bar
vnto thy heart &amp; tongue, that thou
vtter nothing, but may be to Gods
glorie, thy owne comfort, and the
edification of those that doe heare
thee, abstaining from swearing,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3702:68"/>
cursing, lying, backebiting, slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
iudgeing, idle or corrupt spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and from all things that hath
but the appearance of euill: thou
must exercise thy handes to doe
good only, thy feet to prosecute the
same, thy will must be made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to thy Sauiours, thy vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to perceiue and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
vertue, and Gods mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thee, thy memorie to thinke
vpon his iudgements, to thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement,
vpon his mercy, to thy
comfort, and his manifolde bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
and vndeserued benefites, for
encrease of thankfulnesse in thee.
Thy whole body and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof, which is a member of
Iesus Christ, must no wise be made
a member of Sathan by sinne, or
polluted, to bee the member of an
harlot, thy soule and heart, with all
the powers and faculties thereof,
must be the temple and tabernacle
of Gods sanctifying and holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
&amp; not a lodge for that vncleane
spirit of sinne, and his fellowes of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3702:68"/>
thy filthy lusts and carnall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
in body and soule thou must
walke so warily and narrowly, in
feare and trembling working out
thy saluation. The way is narrow,
feare then, neuer so little, to depart
from the paths of the Lord; this
straight passage and path to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is soone lost by negligence,
but not so easily found out againe,
without great diligence: care not
for the scornefull and diuelish slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the world, to bee called pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
but daily more and more, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
so to be indeede; striue to liue
a pure and vnspotted life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an hypocriticall and externall
shew onely thereof. It is saide in a
diuelish prouerbe, <hi>A young Saint, an
olde diuell:</hi> but endeuour thou, being
young, to be a Saint of God, and to
dedicate thy youth to him, and his
seruice onely, walking in this strict
and narrow path, &amp; the same God
who hath giuen thee beginning,
shall also giue thee constancie and
a ioyfull end, that thou maiest liue
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3702:69"/>
an old Saint also (as well as young)
on earth, and in heauen he shal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
thee a blessed Saint for euer
with himselfe. It is saide, and that
most truely; <hi>Temporis praeteriti, bene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensi
suauis est memoria:</hi> The memorie
of time by-past, which was well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed,
is sweete and ioyfull to the
minde of man. And let any young
man consider with himselfe, if God
bring him to age, what greater ioy
and comfort hee can haue, then to
remember that hee hath borne the
yoake in his youth, (as the Prophet
saith) that hee entred, and walked
then in the narrow &amp; straight way,
and now is come to the easie pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
and out-going thereof, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
that promised reward of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
ioyes, and euerlasting life:
where hee seeth others, who then
entred a contrarie course, giuing
loose liberty to their flesh, fulfilling
their lusts, and neuer caring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
their waies, in their olde age
to bee punished with pouertie, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with infamie and disgrace,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3702:69"/>
ouercome with sicknesse, humbled
greatly, despised, expelled out of
all good companie, a patterne of
all miserie, in great straightnesse
(the end of the way) and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the prodigall Sonne, after
they haue spent all, &amp; abused Gods
gifts, to liue in a lamentable estate,
and to flie from Citie to City, from
Countrey to countrey, wrestling, if
they may to come out of their
straightnes, but falling from pit to
pit, from <hi>Scylla</hi> to <hi>Charybdis.</hi> And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
God their father giue them a
minde at last to returne to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and halfe way run and meete
them; that is to be feared, they bee
cast into an euerlasting straightnes
of eternall death and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which by their walking in that
broad way of carnall libertie, they
iustly haue promerited. What ioy
(I say) shall this be to an aged man,
to remember his happy estate he is
in? And this wofull condition hee
hath by Gods grace escaped, when
for age hee cannot so well eate his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3702:70"/>
meate, this remembrance, that hee
remembred his Creatour in the
daies of his youth, and redressed
his waies according to his word,
shall be a continuall banquet vnto
him; this peace of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and ioy of an vpright heart,
shal be a staffe to vphold his soule,
when hee beholdeth the greene
field, and pleasant fruites and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of his well spent youth, greater
solace shall bee to his minde, then
the pleasure of the finest decked
garden of the world could bee to
the eye, his soule shall flow with
comfort, and his heart pant and
leape with ioy; an infinite treasure
shall he possesse &amp; see continually,
which shall neuer make him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
or the feare of the losing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
put sleepe from his eyes: but
from death to life it shall passe with
him, and leaue a perpetuall fame
thereof in the world, when he shall
die in the Lord, his works shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him. Let euery yong man then
spend and bestow his youth so, in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3702:70"/>
walking in this narrowe way and
straight passage, circumspectly,
precisely, and as purely as hee can,
redressing his waies according to
Gods word, that in the haruest of
old age, he may pull and eate of the
fruit of his youth, and find refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after wearinesse, rest after la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
victorie after the battel, easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
after straightnesse, and infinit
eternall ioy, after momentaneall
mourning and teares for a season:
assuring himselfe, that his fasting
from sinne in youth, shall be a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of comfort in age, his sowing
in teares, shall bee a reaping of ioy.
And Christ, the way, the truth, and
the life, who hath promised the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
is faithfull, willing, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to performe:<note place="margin">Reu. 2.</note> hee saith; <hi>To him

to loose the same: this narrow
and strait gate of grace is opened
before thy eyes, then striue that
thou maist enter in thereat, bee not
slow then, but make speede in thy
way here, lest hereafter, with the
foolish Virgins, thou call and
knocke, at the gate of glorie,
but bee not admitted to that Ioy:
say not in thy youth, with slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 6. 10. Yet a slumber, and
vnfolding of hands, but vp, and
walke with Iesus Christ in the way
of godlinesse, at the first call, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3702:72"/>
to the rule of Gods word,
purge &amp; redresse thy wayes: when
that cloudy pillar warneth thee, to
goe forward, goe and walke, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
it before thy eyes, in the way
of holinesse; and when it warneth
thee to stay, then stay thy course,
in repressing thy affections, bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
thy lusts and their precipitate
course, redressing thy wayes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayning
the liberties of the flesh,
conforming thy will to Gods will,
and walking in a strait and narrow
way of life: follow young <hi>Abell,</hi>
who walked innocently and holily
before God, offering the first fruits
of his flocke, as thou must of thy
youth, to the Lord; and not the
broad way of <hi>Cain,</hi> in murther,
wrath, and despising of God; or of
<hi>Lamech,</hi> in vaunting and bragging
of thy strength in youth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
sinne, (as many yong men do.)
Follow godly <hi>Noah</hi> in the strait
way of holines, and of curbing the
liberties of the flesh, who in that
generall corruption of time, was
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3702:73"/>
onely found iust, and found fauour
in Gods eyes, when the rest drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and eating, taking of those
whom they liked best, reioycing
and walking in the broad way of
iniquitie and libertie of the flesh,
were destroyed with all flesh, in
that generall Deluge. Follow iust
<hi>Lot</hi> in this true way, who remained
onely vndefiled with the filthie
lusts of the Sodomites, and in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse
of conuersation, walked
onely before GOD, afflicting his
soule euery day, for their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and eschued the broad way
of their vncleannesse, whoring, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
drunkennesse, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
yong &amp; old was infected, and
cryed downe from heauen feareful
destruction vpon them. Follow
<hi>Abraham,</hi> who obeyed and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
God: godly <hi>Izaak,</hi> who in his
youth was diligently occupied in
prayer in the field, and liued chast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the feare of God, vntil a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
wife was prouided for him. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
plaine <hi>Iacob,</hi> who esteemed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3702:73"/>
Gods blessing better then all the
world, and did cast all his care vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God (as the Apostle comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth)
and serued in a painefull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
long and truely, without sleep
in the cold frost of the night, and
burning heat of the day; also suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
many iniuries, and euer rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
good for euill. Follow yong
vpright <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who beeing greatly
tempted, to enter in that broad way
of liberty and lust, by his mistresse,
refused to commit that vild sinne
of adultery with her, and chose to
walke on in the strait path of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
he walked so wisely, that he
found fauour in all mens eyes, and
was loued greatly for his gentle
and courteous behauiour, and at
last was promoted, by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
to be the second person in
all Egypt, after his straitnesse in
prison there. Follow faithfull <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
&amp; enter in at this strait gate with
him, who chose rather to suffer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
with the people of God,
(walking in the narrow way) then
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3702:74"/>
to enioy the pleasures of sinne for
a season, (walking in the broad
way) esteeming the rebuke of
Christ greater riches, then the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Egypt, (the reason is) for
hee had respect vnto the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the reward, (the end of
this narrow way.) <hi>Israel</hi> whom hee
did leade, went out of Egypt to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan
the land of their rest, thorow
much straitnesse, and a narrow pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage;
as the true Israel of God must
go out &amp; from the Egypt of this
world, to that spirituall Canaan,
the land of their eternal rest. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
couragious <hi>Ioshua,</hi> who went
thorow a narrow passage ouer
Iorden, vnto the land of Canaan,
with Gods Arke before him, &amp; by
many battels ouercame and obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the same; as thou must by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
battels, betwixt the flesh &amp; the
spirit, obtaine that eternal Canaan,
walking towards it in a narrowe
passage, and hauing Gods worde
continually before the eyes of thy
heart, to redresse and conforme thy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3702:74"/>
wayes according thereunto. Yong
<hi>Dauid,</hi> after he was elected king of
Israel, hee walked in this narrow
path, thorow many tentations, to
draw him from Gods feare and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
and thorow much straitnesse,
before he came to the possession of
the kingdome; as after thy electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that euerlasting kingdome of
heauen, in this world, during that
Prince of darkenesse raigne, thou
must passe and ouercome many
temptations of Sathan &amp; the flesh
likewise, &amp; walke in the strait and
narrow way of holinesse &amp; sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
before thou come to the
easie and spacious end of thy way,
to the full possession of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
kingdome, and eternall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification
through Christ Iesus:
thou must bee in labours, before
thou rest from labours; thou must
liue in the Lord, before thou canst
die in the Lord; thou must liue the
life of the righteous, if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
wish to die the death of the
righteous, and thy last end to bee
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3702:75"/>
like theirs. All the holy Patriarks,
Prophets, Saints, and Martyrs of
God, haue trode this narrow way,
before they obtayned the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of their reward, vnto which
they had respect: if therefore thou
haue any respect vnto the same,
and by hope looke for that, which
they fully now possesse, follow and
insist in their footsteps; if thou
wouldest tryumph and glory with
them, thou must also couragiously
fight with them, against the diuell
and thine owne corrupt affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and concupiscence of the flesh,
which fayne would haue libertie,
and draw thee in that broad way
of destruction; but assure thy selfe
in thy youth, and in the way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that the greater liberty of thy
flesh and affections here, maketh
the most strait incarceration, and
feareful plunging of soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in endlesse and easelesse tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of hell hereafter: which
thou mayest plainely behold and
learne, by the example of <hi>Diues</hi> &amp;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3702:75"/>
               <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whereof the one, in the
broad way, had his pleasures in
this life, but not a drop of water to
coole his tongue after death, (the
strait ende of his way:) the other
had his miseries here, without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
scarce for the flesh, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death, (which opened the large
end of his way) he was carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, in eternall
ioyes for euer to remaine; in their
life, <hi>Lazarus</hi> was compelled to beg,
from <hi>Diues,</hi> crumbes of his bread;
at their death, <hi>Diues</hi> was compelled
to beg from <hi>Lazarus,</hi> a drop of cold
water, there did straitnesse follow
after ease, and ease after straitnesse,
in their seuerall wayes. Albeit the
rich man in the Gospell, walking in
the broad way, did bid his soule,
Eate, drinke, and take it ease, for it
had much laid vp for many yeeres,
yet God from heauen had decreed,
that the strait end of his way shold
be neerer then he thought, &amp; they
should fetch his soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him that
same night. Albeit <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:3702:76"/>
(walking in the broad way also) in
the pride of his heart said, <hi>Is not this
great Babel that I haue built, for the house
of my kingdome, by the might of my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and for the honour of my Maiestie?</hi>
glorying so in the flesh; yet he was
cast into a great and wonderfull
straitnesse, while the word was in
his mouth, and driuen from men, as
a beast to eate the grasse of the
fields. Albeit <hi>Bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hazzar</hi> likewise,
(walking in the same large way) in
the exaltation of his heart against
God, proclaimed a banquet, sitting
with his Princes, wiues and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,
pampring &amp; giuing all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to the flesh, drinking wine in
the vessels, consecrated onely to
Gods seruice, which were brought
out of Ierusalem, not glorifying
GOD, but praysing his Idols of
gold, siluer and stone, yet the end
of his way was this; the Hand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
on the wall, that hee was
weighed, and found too light, his
kingdome was ended, and giuen to
others, and that same night he was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3702:76"/>
slayne presently; so when he was
highest, vpon the top of his reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
hill, most suddenly he did fall
lowest, in the valley of mourning,
and pit of teares, by lamentable
destruction, the vnexpected strait
end of his broad former way. The
Sodomites knew little how neere
fire and brimstone was neere them;
the primitiue world, how neere
them was the Deluge; and all such
that walke in this way of libertie of
the flesh, how neere, subuersion of
soule and bodie is at hand. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs walke in the right way,
if wee would sitte at Christs right
hand; let vs be sanctified here, if we
would be glorified hereafter; let vs
walke in the true path, if we would
attaine to the true end thereof; and
subdue the slesh with the affections
thereof, to the spirit and yoake of
Christs obedience, if in body and
spirit for euer, wee would raigne
with him. Let vs <hi>redresse our owne
wayes,</hi> and <hi>let euery one that calleth on
the name of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 19.</note> 
               <hi>depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:3702:77"/>
as the Apostle commandeth
<hi>Timothie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 22.</note> and in his person all yong
men, <hi>Flie from the lusts of youth, &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after righteousnesse, faith, loue, and
peace, with them that call on the name of
the Lord, for if any man purge himselfe
from these, hee shall bee a vessell vnto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
sanctified and meet for the Lord, &amp;
prepared vnto euery good worke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing also, our course of life
here, is compared to a <hi>Way,</hi> which
wee must redresse according to
Gods word, therefore let vs walke
in this life, as in a way, warily, and
working out our saluation in feare
and trembling. Considering with
ourselues; 1. First, as in a way or
iourney, no rest is to be expected,
that is permanent, vntill wee come
to the end thereof; so neither must
wee looke for any permanent citie,
or solide rest, in the way or course
of this life, vntill we come to Iesus
Christ, being dissolued, to be with
him, who is the true end and rest,
of the true and narrow way, the
temple of that spirituall Ierusalem,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3702:77"/>
and Citie of all perfect light and
ioy. For the estate of his Church
here, is, as the Boat, wherein vpon
the sea hee was with his Disciples,
euer tossed vp and downe, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
labour; so that, except hee
were our stay, our rest, and refuge,
wee should surely perish. Our life
here is a Warfare, our enemie is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
pursuing, as a raging Lyon, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to deuoure vs, therefore wee
must be in continual defence of the
life of our soules, by his strength
being armed, who gaue his life for
our soules, vntill vnder his defence,
hauing fought a good fight, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
our course, we be victorious
and tryumph with him, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
that immortall and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
crowne of glory, which is
layd vp for vs, and for all them that
loue the comming of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
in glorie, to glorifie vs with
himselfe. 2. Secondly, in a way,
we euer goe forward, and one step
followeth another, <hi>sicut vnda impelli,
tur vnda,</hi> as one waue is enforced by
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3702:78"/>
another; so also in the way of this
our life, wee poast to our end, and
our dayes passe more swiftly then a
weauers shittle; our life is as a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that now springeth vp, and with
a blast fadeth; as a water bubble,
now vp, and now downe with an
aire of wind; as a smoake, seene,
and gone presently; as the fat of
Lambes, which suddenly is drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
away: so that whether wee
sleepe or wake, whether we eate or
drinke, whether we go or sit still, as
in a ship wee are caried speedily,
with full sailes, thorow the sea of
this turbulent world, to the port
and hauen of our graue, and our
refluxe is to that Ocean. Let vs
watch then carefully, and haue the
houre-glasse of the number of our
dayes, euer before our eies, that we
may apply our hearts to wisedom;
let vs looke diligently to the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and most deere loading of our
soules, once purchased by Christs
blood, suspect our weake vessels,
and clay tabernacles, acknowledge
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3702:78"/>
that we are euer in danger of death,
and that there is little betwixt
vs and him: foresee carefully the
rockes and daungers before vs,
haue euer the Compasse of Gods
word before our eyes, to direct our
course and way according there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Behold still the Mappe and
Carde of that heauenly coast of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> towards the which wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and attend our course, try and
spy out the markes, whereby wee
may know that wee are neere the
same, or in the right way thereto;
forget the things that are behinde,
and haue our eyes forward, still on
the further banke; and by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and earnest praiers, desire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God to saue vs, lest we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
to giue vs his spirit to bee our
guide and pilot, and by his infinite
mercy &amp; grace, to bring vs at last,
to that wished Land of our blessed
<hi>Canaan,</hi> with <hi>Ioshua</hi> our Iudge and
Captaine, through all the perills
and daungers of this darke desart.
And chiefly, let vs daily striue, as
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3702:79"/>
in the way of our naturall life: so
likewise, that in the way of our su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
&amp; true life, Iesus Christ,
and his righteousnes, we may make
some progresse, &amp; so step forward
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life to life, forgetting the world
and her whorish intisements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
vs, and bending our forces
directly to follow him onely.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in a way also, we haue
euer certaine limitted bounds,<note place="margin">3. We are limitted.</note>
which wee must not transgresse
nor goe ouer. In the way of
this life likewise, wee haue Gods
word and Commaundements, as
walles on each side to enclose vs,
which wee must striue to containe
our selues within, and to redresse
our waies according therevnto.
Christs voice is the walls &amp; hedge
of his sheepfold, ouer which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
passeth, wandreth astray in
the fearefull and darke desart of
sinne, a readie prey to that cruell
deuouring beare, and raging Lyon
Sathan: for God, as hee is iust and
mercifull, so hee hath declared and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3702:79"/>
manifested the same plainely in his
sacred word, his iustice chiefly in
the olde testament, his mercy in the
new; his iustice he hath set vp as a
wall on our right hand, that wee
may feare to sinne; his mercy as a
wall on our left hand, that if wee
sinne, we may know that wee haue
a Mediatour &amp; Sauiour, euen Iesus
Christ the man: therefore, seeing
we are set betwixt these two walls,
let vs walke warily, that on the one
side beholding Gods iustice, wee
despaire not, nor on the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
his mercy, wee presume
not, but with an equall eye behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
both, and with an equall pace
walking betwixt both, in feare and
loue of him, wee may goe on our
way to our iournies end, and so
worke out the great worke of our
saluation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in a iourney way, or
race to bee runne,<note place="margin">4. We take no burdens</note> euery man, who
desireth to bee at the end thereof
soonest, wil make himselfe lightest,
and not take vp heauie burdens to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3702:80"/>
hinder and wearie him: So in this
way and race of our life, if we haue
eyes to see the reward, (being a
crowne of immortall glory) if wee
haue hearts to consider or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the preciousnes thereof, or a
desire to attaine, or obtaine the
same, we must not take on, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
and hindering burdens of this
world, and the wearisome vanities
thereof, to bee impediments in our
course, but cast off and disburden
our selues of these dangerous loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
vsing the thinges of this
world, as though wee vsed them
not: and in our youth begin &amp; take
vp the light and easie yoake of
Christs obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; with our cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
follow him: in our hand wee
must take the staffe of his worde;
wee must gird our loynes with his
sanctitie and righteousnes, and in
the footesteps of pure vnspotted
innocencie, must wee follow him,
being holy as hee is holy: this is the
way, <hi>Sic itur ad astra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">1. We desire not our way to be long.</note> no pilgrime also will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3702:80"/>
his way to be long and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
but the sooner he may come
to the end of his iourney, the more
he will reioyce. In this way and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
likewise of our life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let vs
not desire so much to liue long till
age, that our way may be prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but to liue well while wee are
young, that we may insist constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in the true way, and desire with
the Apostle, rather to bee dissolued
and be with Christ: and with olde
<hi>Simeon,</hi> after our eyes by faith haue
seene our saluation, &amp; in the armes
of our heart wee haue embraced
him, to desire to departe in his
peace, and enioy the reward &amp; ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of our hope.</p>
            <p>And in the meane time,<note place="margin">6. Our way dangerous.</note> seeing
in our way chiefly of youth, wee
haue many impediments cast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs, many fetters and nets for
our feete, laide to insnare vs, manie
outward and inward enemies see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to destroy vs; and no wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
nor strength in our selues to
preuent or auoid them: therefore
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3702:81"/>
let our continuall and humble pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
bee to that Lord of strength,
and wisedome of the Father, <hi>Leade
vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from
all euill:</hi> and so in a way of this
life, let vs walke as in the way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the word and way of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, redressing our bywaies.
And hauing these considerations,
before our eyes, vntill by that true
and liuely way Christ, wee attaine
to the end thereof, eternall life and
endlesse rest for euer.</p>
            <p>The action set downe in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, <hi>Whereby shall a young man</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
<hi>his way?</hi> according to the
vulgar translation, but according
to the originall and Hebrew text,
it is, <hi>Whereby shall a young man</hi> cleanse
<hi>or</hi> purge <hi>his way?</hi> The first, to wit,
<hi>redressing,</hi> is a metaphore taken
from a house, which being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
or out of order, vseth to bee
redressed and trimmed vp for the
guests it should receiue, according
vnto the Parable and wordes of
Christ, concerning the vncleane
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3702:81"/>
spirit, who departed out of the
man whom he possessed, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in dry places, seeking rest, and
finding none: therefore he decreed
with himselfe, to returne backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to his former lodging, and
tooke with him other seauen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
spirits worse then himselfe;
who returning, found the house
<hi>dressed</hi> and wel garnished for them,
and there they aboade; so that the
last conditio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of that man, was
worse then the first. And so truely
it is in all ages, but chiefly in youth,
that our soules and bodies, (which
should be the temple and taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Gods holy and cleane Spirit,
who can abide no impuritie) is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
daily with the vncleannes of
sinne, and defiled with the filthie
Harpies of our lusts and carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and so we harbour in our
heart (as it were) that vncleane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and dresseth vp the same as a
house or chamber for him to rest in
with his fellowes. Therefore in our
youth &amp; tender yeares, if we would
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3702:82"/>
bee accounted, or any way estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to bee the children of God, to
be the members of Iesus Christ, to
be temples of Gods Spirit, to haue
our names written in that booke of
life, or euer to exspect participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or enioying of the endlesse and
infinite ioyes of heauen: then let vs
by the assistance and strength of
that stronger man Iesus Christ,
who hath ouercome and subdued
all, and by the speciall grace of his
blessed and powerfull spirit, striue
to binde &amp; expel that vsurping ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
out of the precious house of
our soule, and to shut him out of
the gates and doores of our hearts,
that we be none of his possessions,
or vessells in his house, and with all
our strength, diligence and power,
seeke to <hi>redresse</hi> our soule and heart
againe, and make it fit and meete
for the habitation &amp; abiding place,
of that cleane and holy spirit of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

to Christs words, Matth. 23. 25. in
reprehending of the hypocriticall
Scribes &amp; Pharises, who did make
cleane the outter side of the cup &amp;
platter, but within were full of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
and iniquitie. So indeede,
all men, young and olde, wee are

there is no day also, but we are pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted

with some vncleannes of sinne, and
our filthy lusts and affections euer

wee must endeuour, and seeke
with earnest praiers, that wee may

Christs commandement) first,<note place="margin">Matt. 23. 26.</note> the
inside of the cup and platter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
the outside of them may be cleane
also. In our youth, wee are as new
vessells in Gods house, if at any

in our youth let vs chiefly trie

if we be, surely then we must

our selues polluted with filthines in
our youth and newnes, &amp; our soule
made the receptacle of stinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
lustes, and of all impuritie of
sinne, let vs feare and suspect that,
except God of his free mercy and
grace, create and frame vs of a new
againe, and purge vs from all our
iniquities, that wee can iudge our
selues to be no other but vessells of
reiection, impurity, and dishonour.
Therefore in youth, while the filth
of sin sticketh not so fast vpon the
vessels of our souls, nor the old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of iniquitie hath not taken so long
&amp; strong possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the house of

or defend it) let vs purge by
the teares of true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance our fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
blots, &amp; vncleannes of sin, and
desire that vnspotted Lambe by his
precious bloodshed, to purge vs
likewise from the guilt thereof: let
vs by the strength of his gracious
Spirit, expell that vncleane spirit of
sinne, and pleasures of the flesh,
and redresse the roome and house
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3702:84"/>
of our soule, with open gates to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
retaine, and entertaine with
ioy, that spirit of all cleannes, of
ioy, and endlesse comfort. As Iesus
Christ our Sauiour hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
let vs first purge &amp; make clean
the inside of the cup &amp; platter, that
the outside may be cleane also, that
is, let vs begin &amp; purge the worme
of sinne and corruption from the
roote of our hearts and the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
with the fruite of word and
deede, shall prosper the better; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
and purifie the spring, and the
streames that runneth therefrom
shall be the clearer: <hi>Out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the heart the mouth speaketh:</hi>
and according as the affection of
the heart is, so the workes proceed,
and the members executeth their
command. This purifying is by true
repentance, with <hi>Marie Magdalen,</hi> in
sorrowing truly for our sinnes, and
in all humilitie washing his feete
with the teares of deepe remorse,
constantly endeauouring neuer to
sinne no more, and by a liuely faith

in the armes of our soule, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and apprehending the blood
of Iesus Christ and his death, as our
onely righteousnes, obedience, and
propitiatorie sacrifice before the
Father, and by good workes and a
sanctified holy life, shewing our
faith and Gods mercy manifested
in vs, to our liues end, to the good
example of others, and our owne
soules saluation.</p>
            <p>This action of <hi>cleansing</hi> or <hi>redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi>
is set downe in the future time,
<hi>Qui nam mundabit, &amp;c. Wherewith shal
a young man cleanse his way.</hi> Noting
thereby the present estate thereof
to bee vnredressed and vncleane.
Whereby wee learne and may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
first, that howsoeuer we flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or excuse our selues in any age,
but chiefly in our youth, that our
waies nor course of life is not so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
nor worthy of reproofe, but
may be easily borne with, &amp; soone
redressed oramended, yet the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God in this place of his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
word dooth by the mouth of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3702:85"/>
his holy Prophet, shew vnto vs
that our waies are so vncleane and
filthy, that it is a very hard &amp; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
thing to redresse or cleanse
them, their pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being so great:
which he would signifie by asking
interrogatiuely, how they shall bee
redressed? And therefore, that in all
humilitie and lowest submission of
heart in our youth, and in all ages,
wee should acknowledge the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
greatnes of our transgressions
and filthy vncleannesse of sinne,
which cannot bee cleansed but by
an infinite purgation, euen by the
blood of Iesus Christ, in his infinite
and vnsearcheable mercy shed for
mankinde, which wee should daily
begge, and continually thirst after
the same greedily, walking wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
hereafter, as those who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
with so precious a price.
Secondly, wee may obserue here,
the markes and difference betwixt
a godly and vngodly young man,
the one consulteth and asketh at
God, <hi>Whereby he may redresse and purge
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3702:85"/>
his waies?</hi> the other consulteth with
flesh and blood, and asketh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
at Sathan and his owne filthy
lusts and affections, <hi>whereby hee may
defile</hi> and <hi>pollute his waies?</hi> The onely
care and vigilant studie of the one
is, how to redresse vice, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
sinne in his mortal members,
that Gods free Spirit may make
his aboad and comfortable habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his soule. The diligent care
of the other is, how to represse and
oppresse vertue and godlines, that
it take no roote in his soule, nor
bring forth no acceptable &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
fruit before God, but that as a
sinke of iniquitie, it may abound
and yeelde forth out of the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
thereof, rotten and vnsauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
smells, in thought, word, and
action. The one seeketh to purge
himselfe from the least spot of sin,
that might make him displeasing
in his fathers sight, yea hee abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
from the very appearance of
euill, or the least meane that might
draw or perswade him any way
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3702:86"/>
thereunto. The other seeketh the
foulest puddle or mire of sin, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in body and soule, not caring to
tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble &amp; pollute himselfe as a filthy
swine thereinto, and as a dogge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
sinne griedily, (which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth
his soule) and returning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to his vomit, he embraceth all
occasions of sinne, hee headlong
runneth vnto the brinke of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
&amp; as it were with cart-ropes
of iniquitie, he is swiftly carried, as
the oxe to the slaughter, or the
foole to the blocke, vnto the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomles
pit of perdition. The one,
for the least sinne he committeth,
that stayneth his soule, hee heapeth
and powreth out tears vpon tears,
as a treasure to be laid vp in a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
before God, that thereafter hee
may reape the fruite of his seed so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
in tears, in the ioyful and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
haruest of the Lord, when he
shall find true rest and comfort to
his soule. The other, in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
sinnes hee most reioyceth, and
with <hi>Lamech,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> vaunteth of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3702:86"/>
furie and crueltie, of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
inferred to his owne soule, hee
heapeth sinne vpon sinne, vntill the
day of wrath, as a treasure, and
with all griedines filleth the cup of
iniquitie to the full, til God in his
iust iugment giue to him also the
full cup of his fierce wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
and make him drinke
out the very dregs thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as
he soweth, so he shall reape. The
one sort, being the children of the
light and the day, they walke in the
light, and doe the workes thereof,
therfore they shall enioy the cleare
and endlesse light of that heauenly
new Ierusalem, which is the bright
countenance of the Lambe. The
other being the children of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and the night, they delight to
walke in the wayes of darknes, and
to doe the workes thereof; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with the prince of darkenesse,
they shall bee at last cast into vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
darkenesse, where is weeping
and gnashing of teeth. Finally, as
<hi>euerie tree is knowne by his fruite,</hi> so by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3702:87"/>
their works you shal know and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,
betwixt godly, and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
yong men; as a good yong tree
bringeth foorth best fruite in the
spring, while it is yong; so, a godly
yong man bringeth forth best fruits
of vertue and pietie, in his tender
yeeres, and spring of his youth, not
delaying, till the cold winter of old
age come, wherein eyther no fruit
at all, or if any, nothing but sowre
grapes are to be expected: but as
no man can gather figs of thornes,
nor seeke for honie out of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
so, from those that consume
their best age and prime of youth,
in all lustfull licentiousnesse, &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law
liuing in sinne, and slauish li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of iniquitie, nothing can be
expected, but that the haruest shall
be like the spring, wherin they shal
reape the fruit of their labours, and
their seed time of wickednes shall
bee rewarded, with the measure of
bitter &amp; seuere punishment; when
the axe shall bee put to the root of
the tree, and euery tree that brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3702:87"/>
not forth good fruit, shall bee
cut downe, &amp; cast into vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
fire. The examples of both
these sorts of yong men, we haue
in the Scripture, set before the eyes
of all youthes in this age, to learne
by, and behold. Of the one, whom
they should follow, the examples,
of yong <hi>Abel,</hi> vprightly sacrificing
vnto God, the first fruits and fat of
the flocke; as they should the first
fruits and fat of their youth, in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse

the good counsell of his

<hi>Ioseph,</hi> refusing the way of sinne and
adulterous lust, suffering patiently,
rewarding good for euill, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a comfort and reliefe to his old

<hi>Moses,</hi> refusing to bee counted the
sonne of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, to bee

esteemed the sonne of God, and a

of yong <hi>Dauid,</hi> in trusting euer

aduersitie, and still sticking fast vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, who deliuered his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
so oftentimes in his handes,
and his life out of theirs: of yong
<hi>Salomon,</hi> in seeking the true wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, before honour or
riches: of yong <hi>Samuel,</hi> zealous and
faithfull in Gods sanctuarie in his
youth, there seruing him: of yong
<hi>Daniel,</hi> in walking with an holy and
vpright heart, before the almighty:
of yong <hi>Timothie,</hi> brought vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an
infantin the true knowledg &amp; feare
of God, a glorious starre &amp; painfull
instrument in his Church: of the
children of the elect Ladie, 2. <hi>epist.
Ioh.</hi> 1. 4. who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beloued Apostle
of Iesus Christ found walking in
the trueth, as God had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and therefore reioyced: with

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
themselues in all things, that
they may obtaine that rich reward
of eternall life, whereof they are
already in possession. Of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort, which wee should eschue
and abhorre, is malicious murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and hypocriticall <hi>Cain,</hi> who
was accursed of God: vaunting
<hi>Lamech</hi> bragging of his strength &amp;
furie to commit sinne in his youth:
<hi>Ham</hi> dishonouring &amp; contemning
<hi>Noah</hi> his father: <hi>Esau,</hi> in being a

A theist and persecutor of his

doe euill, wee haue, for it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our nature, <hi>for by nature wee
are the children of wrath, and all the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations
of our heart are onely euill
continually from our very infancie:</hi> and
it is the worke of our flesh, for <hi>the
flesh coueteth against the spirit:</hi> but to

no power at all, but it is Gods san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
Spirit, who giueth both,
and it is aboue nature, yea, it is the
worke of the Spirit, against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Therefore let vs not trust to
our owne knowledge or wisedom,
for it is darkenesse &amp; foolishnesse,
nor thinke of our owne will or
strength, that we can doe, or truely
desire or know, that which is good,
being so peruerse and wicked, but
with the Prophet, after his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
acknowledg al our knowledge
of his will, or of the right way to
saluation, to proceed onely from
the illumination of his good spirit,
and that the will or strength to doe
and performe the same, is onely his
owne free worke in mercie also,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3702:92"/>
and let vs by earnest prayers (as in
all ages, so chiefly in our youth) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
his holy helpe, to teach vs,
according to his word, how to
walke in his wayes, and to take
heed to our owne, in greatest diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
consult with him, who is
true light and wisedome, and in
whom is no changing; in greatest
tentations, by continuall prayer, let
vs flie to him, that with his all-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
grace, he may euer assist vs,
when Sathan would not only buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet,
but kill &amp; deuoure our soules,
with the poyson of sinne, and our
owne lusts, and in all things let him
be our onely refuge, resolution and
comfort continually.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In taking heed thereto, &amp;c.</hi> this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of taking heed to our wayes, in
the answere, hath reference to the
action of redressing or cleansing
the same in the question, as if hee
would say, by taking heed to his

the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:3702:93"/>The purging therefore or redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the waies of youth, whereby
euery yong man may insist &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in the right way of holinesse to
saluation, must bee in marking
straightly, and in taking heed care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to the whole course of his
life, in thought, word, and deede,
directing and instituting the same
according to the rule and expresse
direction of the word of God, in
the which, night and day he should
meditate &amp; exercise himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
that therby his whole life,
and all the waies thereof, may bee
kept spotlesse and cleane from all
corruption of sinne, and the filthy
lusts of the flesh.<note place="margin">Vse.</note> Therefore, let all
young men apply all the actions &amp;
waies of their life to this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of Gods word: let them take
diligent heede to thought, word,
and deede, marke them narrowly,
examine and iudge them diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and vnpartially, according to
this rule and square, that by God
himselfe, they bee not strictly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3702:93"/>
here, and seuerely examined,
iudged and rewarded in the world
to come. If they finde their waies
to bee in some measure conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Gods word (for none are
perfite) desire Christ to helpe their
imperfection, praise God for his
mercy and this measure of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
desiring increase thereof
and confirmation. If by taking
heede vnto their waies, and due
examination thereof, they finde
them disagreeable vnto the word
of God, then humbly prostrate
themselues in true repentance and
contritenesse of a broken and rent
heart, before the tribunall of that
great King and Iudge whom they
haue offended; desire earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and cleansing of their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
waies by the precious blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
of Iesus Christ; vow and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
reformation and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to Gods word, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed

that poor widow, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iust Iudge
of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his holy sanctifying spirit
to be their directer &amp; leader in that
way of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the end thereof.
This way of yong men, vnto which
they shold take heed according to
Gods word so diligently, is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.
1. Their way of particular and
lawful vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2. Their way of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
&amp; ciuill manners. And 3. their
way of true godlines, the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of all. According to this rule of the
word of God, let euery young man
therfore (I say) take heed &amp; examin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
First, his way of the ordinarie and
particular vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God hath called
him to, if in the same he hath beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
himselfe vprightly, &amp; vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
the talent that God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him for that effect: for to none of
his seruants, but God hath allotted
&amp; giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some special tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; gift, fit
to be vsed in a special &amp; particular
vocation; wherby in some measure
they may be profitable to church &amp;
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, from the Son of the
Prince that sitteth on his throne, to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3702:94"/>
the sonne of the poorest begger by
the hie way side: to some hee hath
giuen a quicke wit and diuerse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to diuers kindes of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as Diuinitie, the Lawes, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
&amp;c. wherein seuerally by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one, his glory may bee aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and the Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
in some measure profited:
to others hee hath giuen of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
in wisedome, vnderstanding,
and knowledge to worke in all
manner of workemanship, as hee
did to <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 31. 3.</note> fitting
them for seuerall mechanicall and

of these two kindes of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that God hath giuen euerie
one from his cradle, a naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and speciall gift therfore,
(if education bee ioyned) it doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently
appeare by experience.
Let euery young man then, noble
or ignoble, consider &amp; take heede
vnto this way of vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according
to Gods word, that if God hath fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him by some speciall gift and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3702:95"/>
inclination, he loose not, spend, nor
hide his talent by idlenes, for feare
of the punishment that Christ hath
mentioned in his worde therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
for idlenesse and delicacie was
the sin of the primitiue world that
drew downe that fearefull deluge

Not like the Grashopper, who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
all the sommer, but starueth
in winter: as many Gentlemens
sonnes in their youth are idlely
brought vp by their parents, but in
the winter of olde age must beg, or
try many vnlawfull shifts, because
they cannot frame themselues to
worke, nor were not in their youth
trained vp to vertue. It is a pittie
that such should liue in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or commonwealth, but haue
the Apostles Law; <hi>He that laboureth
not, let him not eate.</hi> And a greater pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it is to see or suffer such idle brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
vp, or rather bringing downe
to pouertie and destruction, in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
or well instituted kingdome or
commonwealth. God our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

conseruing, and gouerning

As God then is euer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
in doing of good, so should
we be; and in so farre as we are idle,
so farre wee depart from likenesse
to God, and our owne soule. The
blessed and holy Angels also are
euer occupied, either in continuall
praising of God their Creator, or
in doing his message, for preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; ministring to the godly, and
punishing of the wicked, whereof
many examples are in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
the glorious Sunne in his swift

and assure thy selfe, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3702:96"/>
too and fro, to intice thy minde to

and a shameful end. Neither think,
albeit thou be a Noble or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

therefore thou needest not, nor
should apply thy minde to vertue,
or thy hand to worke: the truely

such a race, which is by thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
but a vertuous one, of such a
race which is by selfe. By trusting
to lands or possessions, oft times
vertue is neglected, and infamie or
no fame followeth: when poore
mens sonnes, not hauing lands to
trust to, but leaning only to vertue
and Gods grace, come to great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
riches, and renowne: both
which, experience teacheth to all

so many Noblemen or Gentlemen
make away with their lands, which
their antecessours by their vertue

left to them, they by vertue got it,
they by idlenesse &amp; vice consume

vitiorum est, otia mentem ad mala
multa trahunt:</hi> all kinde of sinne ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from idlenesse (as <hi>Adams</hi> fall
did from idlenesse in his charge,
Gen. 2. 15.) all kinde of sinne is
nourished by idlenesse, and idlenes
bringeth (as sinne to perfection):
so man to the end of sinne, which
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3702:101"/>
is finall and fearefull destruction.
For God decreed &amp; appointed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to labor from the beginning, both
in his innocencie, as in the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
place, and after his fall. <hi>Gen. 3.
19.</hi> In the sweate of his face that he
should eate bread, till hee returned
to the earth. Therefore, let euerie
young man examine and redresse
this his way, in the ordinarie voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that God with his special gifts
hath fitted him for, <hi>In taking heede
thereto,</hi> without idlenesse, or iniust
dealing therein, <hi>according to Gods
word,</hi> that the necessities of life may
be supplied, and hee be found ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
helpefull then chargeable to
any.</p>
            <p>Secondly, according to the rule
of Gods word, let euery yong man
take heed vnto the way of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
to redresse the same in a godly
and comely forme, reuerencing &amp;
honouring, first, his superiours any
way, and elders: secondly, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls:
and thirdly, his inferiours.
Concerning the honouring of our
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3702:101"/>
superiours &amp; elders, according to
Gods word; the first precept of our
dutie towards our neighbour, in
Gods Law, commandeth all yong
men, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother,</hi>
where not onely our naturall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
but our superiours, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
Pastours, &amp;c. and our El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are vnderstood also, Leuit. 19.
32. <hi>Thou shalt rise vp before the hoare-head,
and honour the person of the olde
man, and feare thy God, I am the Lord:</hi>
likewise, 1. Tim. 5. 1. &amp; 17. where
the Apostle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth yong <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,</hi>
to exhort elders as fathers, and
elder women as mothers, &amp; saith,
that Elders which rule well, are
worthy of double honour: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of this, wee haue many
in the holy &amp; sacred scripture also:
The prophane Hittites, did know
&amp; acknowledge this dutie to olde
<hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 23. 6. <hi>Iacob</hi> to his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
brother <hi>Esau,</hi> Gen. 33. 3. when
he bowed himselfe 7. times to the
ground, till he came neere his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>Hannah</hi> to old <hi>Eli,</hi> 1. Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1. 15.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3702:102"/>
The children of the Prophets to
<hi>Elisha,</hi> 2. King. 2. 15. with many
such: the precept also of the Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks
was, <hi>Seniores reuerere:</hi> for if our
Superiours and elders bee not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
and duely reuerenced by
youth, they shall not be regarded,
if not regarded, not obeyed, if not
obeyed, wicked libertie, rebellion
and oppression shall arise, as the
Prophet sheweth, Isai 3. 5. <hi>The people
shall be oppressed one of another, and euery
one by his neighbour, the children shall
presume against the ancient, and the vile
against the honourable;</hi> and so, all shal
come vnto miserable confusion,
and at last to lamentable destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Concerning the mutuall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of our equals, let vs take
heed thereto, according to Gods
word. Rom. 12. 10. The Apostle of
Iesus Christ saith, <hi>Be affectionated to
loue one another with brotherly loue: In
giuing honour, goe one before another;</hi> so
that honour amongst equals, is as
the daughter of loue, and likewise
the mother that begetteth &amp; nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3702:102"/>
loue amongst neighbours,
whereof, some examples there are
also, and experience sufficiently
proueth the same, &amp; truely, where
there is not such mutuall honour
and louing salutations amongst e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals
and friends, by this rudenesse
(as of beastes) there proceedeth
mistrust and suspicion, from suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
dislike, from dislike hatred,
from hatred, vnchristian breaking
forth in open dissention vpon the
least occasion offred, and so the
bond of peace and christian loue,
which is the life of Religion, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
broken, and cast off, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so, not as Christians, but as
rude, sauage, and cruel wild beasts,
maligning, detracting, despising,
and seeking the mutual destruction
of one another, which all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
should abhorre and studie to
preuent. And lastly, of the honor
and reuerence wee owe also to our
inferiours, according to Gods
word; the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> in his 1. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
2. 17. commandeth vs to <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3702:103"/>
all men,</hi> for in the meanest man
that is, the Image of God is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
before our eyes, yea, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the true Image of Iesus
Christ, which is holinesse and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
is most seene in such,
which with all reuerence, loue and
humilitie, we should honour in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and in others also, knowing that
we honour God chiefely in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as by contemning such, wee
contemne and despise God and his
image, with the humble and low
estate of Iesus Christ in them, and
are a discouragement and scandall
vnto such, mouing God thereby to
despise and refuse vs likewise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we contemne so his best me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
whom the world fauoureth
not, because hee hath selected and
separate them from the world, and
the condemnation therof, abiding
it. Let all yong men therefore, so
humbly and courteously behaue
themselues to all persons, and of al
conditions or estates, hie or low,
that in taking heed so vnto their
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3702:103"/>
wayes according to Gods worde,
they may first purchase and obtain
Gods fauour and loue, <hi>who resisteth
the proud, and giueth grace vnto the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
who are vile in their owne sight,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
they may gayne the loue and
good will of all men, of meane or
great condition whatsoeuer, whom
they in humilitie and dutie so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
and honour, and so they
may grow in grace and fauour (as
Christ did) with God and man. In
conference, gesture, &amp;c. let euery
yong man also take heed vnto his
way of manners, to redresse the
same according to Gods word: In
conference, 1. speake aduisedly,
and that very sparingly, as <hi>Salomon</hi>
teacheth, Pro. 17. 27. <hi>Hee that hath
knowledge, spareth bis words:</hi> and as the
Ethnicks command was,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>Audito multa, loquere pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi>
Heare many things, but speake
few. God hath giuen two eares, as
receiuers in; but one tongue onely,
to dispence moderately out againe,
and by much babling, a foole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3702:104"/>
and betrayeth himselfe.
2. Speake not commonly, (chiefly
amongst thy betters or elders) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thou bee asked or spoken to,
for <hi>Salomon</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Iob. 32. 7.</note> Pro. 17. 28. <hi>that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a foole, when hee holdeth his peace, is
counted wise, and he that stoppeth his lips
prudent:</hi> therefore the wise man of
this age is pictured with a padlock
vpon his lips, for as of an arrow
vnshot, so of a word vnspoken (as
wee say) proceeded neuer harme.
3. Speake not before thy elders or
betters, but patiently wait, without
interruption or carping at their
speech, till they haue fully spoken,
according to the example of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi>
Iob. 32. 46. (<hi>now</hi> Elihu <hi>had wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
till</hi> Iob <hi>had spoken, for they were
more ancient in yeeres then he.) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
Elihu <hi>the sonne of Barachel, the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zite
answered, and said, I am yong in
yeeres, and yee are ancient, therefore I
doubted and was afraid to shew you mine
opinion,</hi> (suspecting and fearing his
owne wisedome, in humilitie, and
giuing place vnto his Elders, as all
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3702:104"/>
yong men should) <hi>for I said, the daies
shall speake, and the multitude of yeeres
shall teach wisedome.</hi> The contempt
of this, when young men would
take vpon them to giue better cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> being wise in their
owne conceit, then the old beaten
counsellers of <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1. Kin. 12.
and the forsaking of the experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
wisedome of these ancient and
graue men, for the rash vnexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
foolishnesse of these young
giddy heads, that were brought
vp with him, made him to loose
the kingdome of Israel to him and
his posteritie thereafter. Not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding,
but sometimes more wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
may bee learned from the
mouth of a yong man, then of the
most ancient, as it pleaseth God to
distribute his gifts, extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or in greater mesure; as he did to
yong <hi>Dauid, Salomon, Daniel, &amp;c.</hi> and
sometimes, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe,
<hi>Qui plus menti, non etiam plus
mentis habet;</hi> hee that hath the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
beard, hath not euer the ripest
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3702:105"/>
wit, nor soundest iudgement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
let none that is ancient, bee
therefore despised, nor none that
is yong, so presume. 4. Speake, as
moderately, so modestly, and bee
not hastie or sudden therein, for of
them that bee hasty, <hi>Salomon</hi> saith,
Pro. 29. 20. <hi>that there is m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re hope of a
foole then of such;</hi> and as the wise man
hath commaunded, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>ne lingua pracurrat
menti,</hi> let not thy tongue runne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy minde, seeing it should be
the minds interpreter onely, and
the mind should speake inwardly
to an ende, before the voyce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
outwardly the sense &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereof, not setting the cart
before the horses, or the plough to
runne before the oxen. <hi>Periculosa te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritas,</hi>
rashnesse or hastinesse in
word or deed is perilous. And in
all thy speech or conference take
heed, according to Gods word, to
speake the trueth onely, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from lying, as from Sathan
the father thereof: to speake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3702:105"/>
of no man, albeit thou mayst
truely, and to abstaine not onely
from euill words, <hi>which corrupteth
good manners,</hi> as the Apostle saith,
but also from ieasting, which is not
comely, and all idle words, of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one whereof, <hi>wee must render ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
at the day of Iudgement</hi> as Christ
the trueth testifyeth: speake all to
edification in knowledge or godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
giue to none the least offence
iustly by thy speech, and desire to
profite all men thereby, and so as
euery one is knowne to be such a
Countrie man or of such a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
by his tongue or speech, so
by thy good speech and language
thou shalt be knowne to belong to
God the wel-spring of goodnesse,
and to the kingdome of Heauen,
the land and countrie of that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Canaan. To this effect desire
God by his holy Spirit, to purge
and sanctifie thy heart first, which
is the root, and <hi>out of the abundance
whereof the mouth speaketh,</hi> and then
with the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> to <hi>set a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3702:106"/>
watch before thy lips, and a barre before
thy tongue: that</hi> as wel in thy speech
as actions, <hi>his will may bee done in
earth, as it is in heauen.</hi> In thy gesture
also take heed to behaue thy selfe
dutifully &amp; comely towards al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
according to Gods word, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all rudenesse on the one part, or
curious affectation of apish nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
on the other part, rather to bee
contemned, then any way imitated
by any ingenious young man or
person whatsoeuer. 1. As thou art
commanded. Leuit. 19. 32. <hi>thou shalt
rise vp before the hoare-head, and honour
the person of the old man,</hi> not rudely
sitting, or not giuing place to them
whom God hath blessed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and good yeeres, but so doing
to them, and honouring such, as
thou wouldst be of thy yongers, if
God so long prolong thy life, and
respecting their infirmitie by weak
old age, with consideration of thy
better abilitie in thy yong &amp; stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
yeeres, who may better stand then
they, as also before thy betters
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3702:106"/>
thou shalt rise, or them, to whom
thou art bound in dutie, according
to <hi>Salomons</hi> example, 1. King. 2. 19.
2. Stand, where thy beters sit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the example of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
Gen. 18. 8. <hi>And he tooke butter
and milke and the calfe which he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
&amp; set before them, and stood him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by them, vnder the tree while they did

had pleased, hee might haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a seat for himselfe.</p>
            <p>3. When thou commest to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before thy betters or elders,
in a comely fashion shew the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of thy heart towards them,
by bowing the knee of thy bodie
before them, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of sundry in the Scripture,
as <hi>Abraham,</hi> Genes. 18. 2. when hee
saw the Angels a farre off, he came
to them, and bowed himselfe to the
ground: also Gen. 23. 7. &amp; 12. <hi>And
he bowed himselfe before the people of the
land of the Hittites:</hi> so <hi>Lot</hi> to the two
Angels, Gen. 19. 1. <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Esau,</hi>
Gen. 33. 3. <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren to him,

               </gap>efly, that example of the
yong man, who came to Christ,
Mark. 10. 17. <hi>And when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out on the way, there came one running,
and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good
Master, what shall I doe, that I may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
eternall life?</hi> shewing so the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his heart to Christ, by this
outward gesture of his body, and
reuerent speech of his mouth, in
calling him Good Master. 4. Set
not thy selfe downe in the chiefest
place any where, but rather take
the lowest roome, that those that
haue authoritie, may rather set thee
vp with honour, and thou be called
humble, then displace and set thee
downe with dishonour and shame,
and thou bee called proud: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Parable of Christ, to
the guestes in the Pharises house,
Luke 14. 8. <hi>When thou sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when thou art bidden, goe and sit downe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3702:107"/>
in the lowest roome, &amp;c. for whosoeuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth
himselfe shal be brought low, and he
that humbleh himselfe shall be exalted.</hi>
Fiftly and lastly, as for the vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
of the head, and all other
points of good manners in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and ciuill societie, according
to the rule of the Apostle general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;

Thirdly and last of all, let euerie
young man, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
rule of Gods worde, take
heede vnto his way of godlinesse
and religion, to redresse &amp; cleanse
the same, which indeed is the most
profitable vocation of all others:
for as the Apostle saith; <hi>Godlinesse is
great gaine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4 8.</note> 
               <hi>and for bodily exercise it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth
little: but godlinesse is profitable
vnto all things, which hath the promise of
the life present, and of that that is to come.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3702:108"/>
Salomon</hi> also, Prou. 14. 27. saith; that
<hi>The feare of the Lord is a well-spring of
life, to auoid all the snares of death:</hi> it is a
most precious jewell, the comfort,
glory, and value whereof, surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
all vnderstanding: the straight
way whereof, albeit displeasant &amp;
hard to the flesh for a time, yet it is
most delectable &amp; pleasant to the

            <p>We must redres our waies the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

according to Gods word.</hi> We must not
then read, heare, or know onely the
word of God, but practise &amp; do the
same, in purging &amp; taking heed to
our waies according thereunto. It is
that good seed that Christ speakes
of, which must not only be receiued
with ioy, but must be retained and
laid vp in a good and honest heart,
to bring forth good fruite, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the measure of Gods grace.
We must doe as <hi>Israel</hi> did, Exo. 19.

The condition also that God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by <hi>Moses,</hi> that hee will exalt &amp;
blesse them is, chap. 28. 1. <hi>If thou shalt
obey diligently the voyce of the Lord thy

which I command thee, then
the Lord thy God will set thee on high, and
all these blessings shall come vnto thee,

of this couenant, and</hi> doe <hi>them, that yee
may prosper in all other thinges that yee

Matth. 3. 8. said vnto the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies
that which all men shoulde

saith, Matt. 7. 17. <hi>Euery tree is knowne
by his fruites, for euery good tree bringeth
forth good fruit: and a corrupt tree brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
forth euill fruits. A good tree cannot
bring forth euill fruit: neither can a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
tree bring forth good fruit. For doe
men gather grapes of thornes, or figges of
thistles? Therefore, so let our light shine
before men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> 
               <hi>that they may see our good
workes, and glorifie God our heauenly
father.</hi> For as in Morall Philosophie
it is said; <hi>Omnis virtus in actione consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit;</hi>
all vertue consisteth in action:
so truely in diuine and true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie,
it may be likewise said, that
all Religion and Christian vertues
consisteth in practise, and not in
pratling of them onely. The figge-tree
that Christ accursed, had a
faire shew by his leaues a farre off,
that he was like to haue fruit also,
but because he had none, therefore
by Christs curse hee withered pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.
It is not a faire shew like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3702:110"/>
or pretence, and profession of
religion that God doth accept; but
wee must with our outward shew,
haue the inward substance and life
of Religion, good workes procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of true faith and loue. Wee
must not onely professe in word,
but in deede and action also, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
not onely Christs sayings,
but his holy life and doings. Luke,
6. 46. hee saith, <hi>But why call you mee
Master, Master, and doe not these thinges
which I speake.</hi> A seruant not onely
acknowledgeth his Maister in
word, but must also in deede; hee
must not onely heare and know his
Masters will, but except hee doe it
also, hee shall be beaten with many
stripes. Luk. 12. Mat. 7. 21. <hi>Not euery
one that saith vnto me Lord, Lord,</hi> (saith
our Sauiour) <hi>shall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen, but hee that doth my
Fathers will which is in heauen. Many
will say vnto me in that day, Lord, Lord,
haue we not by thy name prophesied? and
by thy name cast out diuells? and by thy
name done many great workes? And then
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3702:111"/>
will I professe to them I neuer knew you:
depart from mee yee that worke iniquitie.
Whosoeuer then</hi> heareth <hi>my words, and</hi>
doth <hi>the same, is like the wise man that
buildeth his house vpon a rocke, &amp;c.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Christ, he looketh that in him wee
should bring forth sweete grapes,
and shew that wee liue in him, by
bringing forth good and pleasant
fruit in him. Gal. 5. 25. <hi>If we liue in the
spirit, let vs walke also in the spirit.</hi> Wee
must not like that barren and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
fig-tree, Luk. 13. 7. <hi>delay</hi>
to giue fruite to our Maister from
yeare to yeare, lest we be cut down
and throwne ouer the hedge for
euer, in his fierce wrath; but in our
youth and tender age, we must bud
and bring forth sweete &amp; pleasant
fruits, such as he expecteth. Christ
Iesus abolished the curse of the
Law by his comming; but hee <hi>came
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3702:111"/>
not to take away the Law it selfe, and the
Prophets, but to fulfill them.</hi> As hee
therefore perfitly obeyed Gods
Lawe, so that <hi>there was no sinne at all
found in him:</hi> so must his members
here on earth, striue in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to obey Gods Lawe, and to
come to that perfection that is here
permitted by Gods Spirit to the
elect to attaine vnto, and that there
be no sin found raigning in them.
For there is none, no not one man
in this world, but sinne is found in
him: neither was there euer any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
waies, (except Iesus Christ,
God and man) but wee must striue
and endeuour, by the powerfull
operation of Gods sanctifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
assisting vs, euery one of vs, that
if sinne abide in vs, and the law of
sin bee in our flesh, yet that it beare
not dominion or ouer-rule ouer

by grace, both soule and body bee

captiuated vnto Christs obedience,
and take on his yoake, that both
likewise hereafter may bee in and

               <hi>Blessed are they

not to bee sheepe of another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour

            <p>Concerning the first, Christs

to all Ministers, that they should
make their flockes heare their

as the Apostle saith, <hi>Iam. 2. 24. Wee

enter into the heart, to perceiue
and behold the inward faith: but
by the fruits wee see it onely, and
that a man by such a fruitfull, true,

workes (which alas in these daies
are rare, as faith &amp; loue their roote
is colde, and almost none left vpon
the earth) are the way wherein wee
must walke, to iustification, albeit
not the matter or cause thereof:
they are not the euidence of our
faith, as saith the Apostle, <hi>Iames, 2.
18. Shew me thy faith out of thy workes,
and I will shew thee my faith by my
workes.</hi> There is their nature &amp; vse,
they are the assurance to vs of our

which, we may take heed vnto our

word of God; It is a rule, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnto the which, wee may and
should redresse, purge and rectifie
our sinfull, vncleane and erronious
wayes: It is that breath of God,
which breatheth life in the face of
the soule of man, as by the word of
God in the first creation, was man
raysed out of the earth and placed
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3702:123"/>
in the garden of Paradise, so by this
word of God, (which is neere vs in
our mouth and heart) is the new
creation and regeneration of the
heart of man, whereby his soule is
raysed from earthly and carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and placed in the pleasant
garden of Christs church, to eate
of the tree of life, and liue with him
for euer. It is the voyce of God,
that is dayly heard in the garden
of his Church, not onely asking e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<hi>Adamite</hi> and sinner, but shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him also, where and in what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
he is by sinne and Sathan, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him not to a curse for sinne,

come to the seed of the woman,
to that tree of life, and second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
Father and Sauiour of our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
Gods word is a Lampe, that

sowed and layd vp in a good and
honest heart, maketh euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to bring foorth acceptable
fruit vnto Gods glory, and their
owne soules comfort. It is the
Power of God to saluation, to all
them who beleeue the same. It is

we shall see the worldlings &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ouerwhelmed, and altogether
drowned. It is the Arke and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of God, at which we only must
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3702:126"/>
aske counsell, and it must diuide
the Iorden of death to vs, making
a way, whereby wee must follow
our <hi>Ioshua</hi> Iesus, to the land of rest,
and our promised inheritance. It is
true Riches, and seuen times more
pure then the refined gold of <hi>Ophir;</hi>
It cannot corrupt, for heauen and
earth shall perish, before one iotte
of Gods worde perish. It is the
Keyes of the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
whereby the gates thereof are
opened to euery penitent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
soule, and shut to euery ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
and indured wicked heart.
It is the Sauour of life, vnto all
those that are appointed for life,
and hath the life of Iesus Christ to
righteousnesse in them. It is the
chiefe Shepheards Hooke, that
pulleth backe our straying soules
in the by-wayes of iniquitie, and
bringeth vs in the right way again,
subjecting vs to the obedience and
light yoake of Iesus Christ, in the
sheepefold of his Church. By it
wee are fished and drawne out of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3702:127"/>
the salt and stincking sea of this
world, to Iesus Christ. It is the
Sword, wherewith wee must fight
valiantly the Lordes battels: A
Trumpet, to encourage vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
at whose sound, the walls of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
proud Iericho shall fall, and
which subdueth powers and scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to it selfe. It is our Pilgrims
staffe, which must vphold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
vs in our iourney. It is a most
bright Starre, which leadeth not
onely wise men, but fooles also to
Christ, where now he lyeth, not in
a kribbe, but sitteth on a Throne,
and happy are those starres or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
whom Christ holdeth in his
right hand, whose onely care is, by
preaching and practising this Star,
to shine before the flocke. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
the Word of God is the
sound of that Trumpet, blowen by
the Angels of his Church, which
giueth vertue and power, quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and resurrection, to euery
dead soule in sinne, to rise out of
the graue of securitie, &amp; put on a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:3702:127"/>
sanctified bodie, that in bodie and
soule at the last resurrection of all
flesh to iudgement, they may passe
with Christ to eternall glory. It is
that Finger, which pointeth out
the Lambe of God, which taketh
away the sinnes of the world: and
as <hi>Andrew,</hi> brought <hi>Simon</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
&amp; <hi>Philip, Nathaniel;</hi> to Christ:
so the word of God bringeth and
leadeth vs by the hand, to him on
earth, and shall bring vs to eternal
glory with him in heauen for euer,
if we beleeue the same, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereunto, take heede to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
our wayes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, seeing the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of Gods Word, is such of it
selfe, wee may learne what great
estimation and value it should bee
of, with euery Christian, as we see
the value thereof in it selfe, so our
estimation should bee corespon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
wee should desire nothing so
much, esteeme nothing so much,
loue nothing so much, nor hunger
or thirst after nothing so much.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:3702:128"/>
This estimation we may see in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>

me. O how I loue thy law? it is my
meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> continually How sweet are thy
promises vnto my mouth? yea, more then
honie vnto my mouth.</hi> The Marchant
in the Gospell, when he had found
the Iewell in the field, he went and
sold all that he had, that hee might
buy that piece of ground, wherein
that Iewell was. Of all Iewels
that euer man could thinke vpon,
this of Gods word, is the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;
in it, is eternall light, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life, continuall ioy, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
contentment, &amp; infinite true
riches: Let vs therefore follow the
example of this wise Marchant, so
that we may haue it, and enioy the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:3702:128"/>
comfort therein contayned, care
not what wee loose, if wee haue it,
we haue all things; if wee haue all
things, and want it, wee haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
It is not like other Iewels,
for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly a man that possesseth
them not, can oftentimes know the
value of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better then they who
possesse them, but with this Iewell
it is not so; the Marchant was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
in loue with it, vntill hee found
it; wee can neuer, nor will euer
know the estimation of it, vntil we
haue it in our hearts. <hi>Peter,</hi> when
Christ before his last Supper, came
to him to wash his feet, he refused;
no, Lord, thou shalt neuer wash my
feet: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ told him, that
otherwise, he shold haue no porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him, and had washed his
feet, then <hi>Peter,</hi> who refused before,
now beggeth, Lord, not onely my
feet, but my head and hands also:
so it is with vs, before wee taste of
the sweetnesse and refreshment of
Gods word, to our wearied soules,
and the ioy thereof to our woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:3702:129"/>
and sorrowful consciences, we
esteeme of it, as <hi>Aesops</hi> Cocke did
of the Iewell, hee found in the
doung-hill, wee had rather haue a
grayne of Barley, or any thing that
testeth to the flesh, or is agreeable
to please our affections. Gods
word, is as it were pearles, cast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
swine, wee are rather ready to
turne backe, and teare them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that offered them vnto vs, then
to giue them any thanks: we refuse
then with <hi>Peter,</hi> the water of life,
but as soone as it hath touched our
hearts, and our soules haue found
the refreshing sweetnesse thereof,
then wee will begge and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
intreat, Lord, not onely this
measure, but a greater dayly of the
knowledge and comfort of thy
word, fill my whole soule with the
power thereof, and stuffe all the
corners of my heart, with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
of the same, let it not
onely be in my head, to talke of it,
but in my hands to doe it, and in
my feet also, in thy way to walke
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3702:129"/>
according thereunto. This should
bee our desire and estimation of
Gods word: for if wee be sicke to
death (as it were) wee would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
much of that Doctour, that
could tell and shew vs, what, and
from what cause our sicknes came,
and could giue vs a present reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to restore vs, to the perfect
health of our bodies, that wee
should liue long; but wee haue the
infectious and deadly sicknesse of
sinne, euery one of vs, in our soules.
Gods holy Word doth shew vs,
what our sicknesse is, and by what
way or meanes we came by it, it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
to vs present remedie, not
to restore the bodie to a kind of
health, that it may liue a miserable
momentaneall life, for a while, but
to restore the soule to perfect and
true health, that it may liue a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
ioyfull, and eternall ioy in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
with God and his blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
how then should we esteeme
of this Physition &amp; Physicke? To
such a Physition of the body, wee
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3702:130"/>
would thinke that we did owe our
life, who restored vs to the same: to
such a Physition of the soule then,
how much more do we owe this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
miserable life for the defence
thereof? and how can we sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
value or loue the same; we wold
account of him much, who would
giue vs such a right, whereby we
should possesse the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the earth peaceably, yea,
or to be heire to any one kingdom:
but so it is, that Gods word, if wee
beleeue the same, maketh vs heires
to the eternall Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and giueth vs sufficient right
and title, that wee shal bee peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
possessours thereof, in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Ioy, and Glory infinite. In a
darke perilous way, wee esteeme
much of a Lanterne; such is Gods
word, to our wayes of this life: in
a dange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous long iourney, wee
would esteeme much of a faithfull
skilfull, vnburdenable and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
guide, readie to ouercome and
encounter all perils or enemies of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3702:130"/>
ours; such is Gods word, in the
long, wearisome, and dangerous
iourney of this life, where, when
we meet with any temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if we
answere, <hi>It is written,</hi> and firmely
beleeue the same, in so resisting Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
we shal ouercome his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and at last make him depart,
at least for a while, from vs, by the
strength of this our Guide. In a
great and doubtfull matter, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our owne simplicitie and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse,
we would much esteeme
of a faithfull and wise counseller:
two wayes are set before our eyes,
one leading to death, another to
life, to the wrong we more natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encline, then to the other: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this great matter of life and
death eternall, and the doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of these two waies, at one of
which enter wee must, wee haue
most great neede of this wise and
faithfull Counseller, whom wee
should much esteeme and follow
in all things. <hi>Moses</hi> sheweth <hi>Israel,</hi>
what the value of this worde of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3702:131"/>
God is, &amp; what value they should
esteeme it of, when hee saith, <hi>It is
your life and your wisedome,</hi> whereby
you excel all other Nations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee exhorteth them, neuer to
let it depart out of their mouh nor
heart, but continually to talk of it,
going in, and comming out, at
home and in the fields, night and
day to meditate thereon, to make
it a signet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their finger, a front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
betweene their eyes, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
nothing neere vnto it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
equiualent to it, nor nothing
aboue it. Of the great estimation
of the word and trueth of God, we
haue one notable example in the
Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the good and godly
king <hi>Iosiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. King. 24.</note> who, when the booke
of the Law of God, being found
by <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the Priest, and presented
to the King by <hi>Shaphan</hi> the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celler,
hee hauing heard the words
thereof, rent his clothes, and went
to the house of God, with all the
people of <hi>Iudah</hi> &amp; Ierusalem, small
and great, the Priests and Leuites,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3702:131"/>
and there, in audience of the whole
people, did reade the law himselfe
in their eares, shewing what esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and reuerence euery King
and people shold haue to the word
of God, we must heare and reade it
with great reuerence, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the word of the King of all
kings, and Lord of all lords to bee
heard, with the hand of faith wee
must receyue it, and with all esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
wee must lay it vp in the
chest and coffer of our hearts, to
bring forth the fruit of obedience
thereunto, as becommeth good
subjects, naturall children, &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
seruants, in our life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation.
It is the most precious
Iewell that a yong man can weare;
the greatest riches that he can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse;
a chayne of gold about his
necke; true wisedome to his heart;
the faithfullest tutor to direct and
gouerne him; and the most delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pleasure &amp; greatest profit that
euer he could wish; for godlines
is profitable vnto all things, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3702:132"/>
hath a promise of this life, and of
the life to come. It is to the aged,
their greatest honour, their truest
wisedome and grauitie, when sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and age oppresseth them: it is
a comfortable salue to their soules,
and the best company they can
seeke to, or desire: it is the skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Doctor, that can best ease the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
and it is the strong hand, that brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
them safe and sound thorow
all griefe, dolours, temptations,
sicknesses, and the passeouer of
death it selfe, vnto the kingdom of
God, &amp; the eternal ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Therefore let yong and old e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
of it greatly, and of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
thereof highly, as of the ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
&amp; ambassadours of the Prince
of all Princes, and Lord eternall,
ouer all Lordes and Potentates in
this temporall and momentaneall
world, that receiuing it, and them,
with reuerent and dutifull estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
laying it vp in their hearts, &amp;
practising the same in their life and
conuersation, by redressing their
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3702:132"/>
wais according therunto; they may
be crowned immortall and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Kings in the world to come,
and raigne with Christ Iesus eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
world without end. For who
esteemeth of it, esteemeth of God,
(his worde and himselfe being all
one) as who contemneth it to heare
or doe the same, contemneth God
to heare or obey him: who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
it and the Preachers thereof,
receiueth Christ, as himselfe testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth:
and who reiecteth it or them,
reiecteth Iesus Christ, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
benefites and loue of the Father
offered in him, willingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
giuing ouer themselues to
darkenes, to the Prince of darknes,
and to the condemnation of, and
with, the Prince of darkenesse for
euer.</p>
            <p>Finally to conclude, seeing the
excellencie of Gods word is such,
and the estimation thereof and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
in our hearts should bee
such, wee may perceiue the great
iniquity and fearefull offence of all
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3702:133"/>
those who keepe the same secret,
and hide from Gods people, lest
they finding this iewel with the wise
merchant, should onely cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and hide it vp in their hearts
and soules: it is life, therefore they
from whom it is hid, walke in the
shadow of death: it is light, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they to whom it shineth not,
walke in feareful darknesse: it is the
foode &amp; phisicke of the sicke soule
of a sinner onely, therefore they
who know it not, nor wil not know
it, must starue and die eternally: it
is our directer and counseller, to
whom then it is hid, they wander
astray in the paths of foolishnesse.
Except this seede be sowen, how
can we bring forth good fruit in a
true faith, to a ioyfull haruest? it is
the power of God to saluation to
all them who beleeue; and by faith
wee are made members of Iesus
Christ: but how can wee beleeue,
except wee heare, (for faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by hearing; and how can we
heare it except it bee preached.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3702:133"/>
Therefore, who taketh away dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
preaching, they take away
carefull hearing, and who taketh
away hearing, they take away
the faith, in so farre as in them lieth,
and so sheweth themselues plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bee enemies of Iesus Christ,
and of his crosse. By it, wee are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
about the rootes, planted and
watered, and made fruitfull vines,
and sweete fig-trees in Gods gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and vineyard; therefore, who
taketh away the same, maketh God
in his wrath to put to the axe to
the roote of the tree, to cut it down,
and cast it (being barren and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull)
into eternall fire: being so
slow and backward, when wee are
often inuited to come to Gods
house &amp; banquet, how much slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
shall wee be without the hearing
of the inuitation of Gods worde?
Wee are too barren ground euen
when that raine and dew falleth
vpon our soules: but how much
barrenner shall wee be, and lesse
fructifie, when it doeth not fall?
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:3702:134"/>
Happy for euer is that Kingdome
or Citie, that retaineth the same in
the pure sinceritie thereof, without
addition, diminution, mixture, or
amission, as thrise woful is the same
that retaineth not the same so. The
most fearefull threatning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Christ Iesus, that <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mega,</hi>
threatneth any of the seauen
Churches, is that of the Church of
<hi>Ephesus: I will come against thee shortly,
and will remooue thy Candlesticke out of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reu. 2.</note>
               <hi>his place, except thou amend.</hi> The most
fearefull famine that euer came vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any Land, Kingdome, Citie, or
soule, is the famine of the word of
God, when the staffe of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
bread thereof is broken. This
plague or the report thereof, may
make euery eare to tingle: for
where it is, it is neuer alone, but
with it, is the infectious plague of
the pestilence of sinne, suffocating
euery soule vnto death eternall, not
taking men out of worldly miserie
to eternall ioy, as the bodily plague
doth many: but from their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3702:134"/>
ioy in sinne, vnto eternall mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of punishment. And euer with
it, or after also followeth the sharp
and seuere deuouring sworde of
Gods fierce wrath, and consuming
hoat displeasure. It is a fearefull
thing, when the watch or watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Gods word in the head of
the Tower is dumbe, when there is
no barking about the sheepe, how
can the sheepe be safe. It is a wofull
thing to see godly <hi>Samuel</hi> remoued
from <hi>Saul,</hi> that he dares not speake
Gods word plainely, but must tarie
at home all his life, and mourne
onely for <hi>Saul</hi> and his doings, when
hee is compelled to answere God,
how can I goe? for if <hi>Saul</hi> heare, he
will kill me. It is wofull to see <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>
the King, put out his hand
and bid, take holde of the Prophet
of God, because at the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord, hee cried against
the Altar of <hi>Bethel.</hi> It is fearefull to
heare that the Lords true Prophets
must be hid in caues, and feede on
bread and water, being dumbe,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3702:135"/>
when <hi>Eliah</hi> knoweth none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
left alone, to plead Gods cause
boldly, and must bee faine to flee
from place to place, in great neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
from the presence of <hi>Ahab</hi> and
his false Prophets, because he spake
Gods word truely, therefore hee
must bee called a troubler of <hi>Israel</hi>
and the estate. It is lamentable to
see, that <hi>Michaiah,</hi> for not speaking
of pleasant things, as the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of <hi>Ahab</hi> did, shall bee beaten
by <hi>Zidkiiah,</hi> a false, deceiuing, and
flattering spirit, and sent to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
house by the King to eate and
drinke the bread and water of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction:
to see bloody <hi>Iehoram</hi> send
for the head of <hi>Elisha</hi> in his wrath:
or <hi>Herod</hi> for the head of <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Baptist, for speaking the word of

for speaking of that, whereof
God commanded him not to keepe
a word backe, to bee apprehended
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:3702:135"/>
by the Priests and people, and to be
censured worthy to die the death:
to see <hi>Daniel</hi> cast in the Lions den:
and the three children in the fierie
furnace, for professing the seruice
of the Lord their God: is it not a
woful thing to see Iesus Christ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
daily for proclaiming the
will of his Father, and that ioyfull
yeare of Iubile for the freedome of
mens soules? to see <hi>Steuen</hi> stoned to
death for the testimony of Iesus:
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> imprisoned, for the
preaching of the Gospel freely, and
with threatning, commanded that
they preach no more? to see the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
beaten, and oftentimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carcerated:
<hi>Paul</hi> stoned, smitten, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
bound? &amp;c. The belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Apostle of Iesus Christ exiled,
to an Ile <hi>Patmos,</hi> and Gods seruants
the bearers of this glorious iewell
of his word, by manifolde waies
to be troubled, onely for the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of the trueth and of a good
conscience, which the itching eares
of these last times cannot abide to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3702:136"/>
heare, albeit they shoulde most
desire the same: <hi>For where Gods word
is not preached, the people perisheth;</hi> as te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth
the Preacher. And the chiefe
cause, that Gods word is so restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in many places, the mouths of
Gods seruants so shut vp, and the
veritie repressed and bound as it
were, is, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths
profite will cease, if <hi>Paul</hi>
preach; where Gods Arke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in place, <hi>Dagon</hi> must fall: and
if Iesus Christ in such humilitie be
suffered to bee acknowledged the
Sauiour, the Hie Priests honour,
iurisdiction, and profit must cease:
if <hi>Daniel</hi> be suffered, hee will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Priests knaueries; and <hi>Elias</hi>
will shew that <hi>Baal</hi> is no God, nor
heareth not: when <hi>Moses</hi> commeth
with the Tables of the Law from
the mount, the golden calfe must

to speake the truth freely, he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
<hi>Zidkiiah</hi> &amp; the falsflattering Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phets,

and authoritie: if <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist
should be obeyed, then <hi>Herod</hi> must
put away his <hi>Herodias.</hi> And where
Gods sincere and pure word only
getteh place and libertie, downe
must goe idolatrie, and not a relict
or hoofe thereof remaine: tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
authoritie of these, who with
<hi>Diotrephes,</hi> loueth the preheminence,
and to rule as lords ouer the Lords
inheritance, must bee trod downe
vnder the humble feete of Iesus
Christ, and of his word; who prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
against Gods true seruants
with malitious words; &amp; not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
content, neither they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
receiue the brethren, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
them that would, and thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
them out of the Church. The
triple crowne must yeelde to the
crown of thornes, &amp; al popish, eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
&amp; apish ceremonies, must fall
downe before this Arke of Gods
pure worde: where the worde of
Christ, who came to serue, getteth
right place, gracious Lord, must
cease; <hi>Caeser</hi> must haue that which
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:3702:137"/>
belongeth to him: and all pastours
with <hi>Paul,</hi> must graunt themselues
to bee seruants onely to Christs
flocke for his cause: their right title
is the most honorable that they can
haue, euen the title which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
is called by; to bee Sheepheards of
soules: where Gods word shineth,
their shining before the flock must
not be in gold &amp; silkes, but in good
workes: where Gods word ruleth,
their rule and gouernement must
be onely by Gods word; their scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that scepter which subiects
scepters to it selfe; their crowne,
their flocke: <hi>you are my crowne,</hi> saith
<hi>Paul:</hi> their sword, not temporal, nor
<hi>Caesars,</hi> but that two-edged sword
that is in Christs mouth, Gods; and
all their authority from Christs
commission onely, <hi>As my Father sent
me; so I send you:</hi> where Gods sacred
Law commeth, there they must not
worship the golden calfe of profit
onely: neither can <hi>Alexanders Diana</hi>
bee so fat vnto him, but with <hi>Moses</hi>
they must looke onely for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:3702:137"/>
of God: Christs kingdome is
not of this worlde, in it then they
must not looke for any recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I haue fought a good fight, &amp;c.
from henceforth is laid vp for me a crowne,
&amp;c.</hi> there is the reward hee looked
for. <hi>I goe</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>to my Father to
prepare a place for you:</hi> this is Christs
promise; <hi>For in the world you shall haue
affliction: and if you were of the world,
the world should loue you, but because you
are not, as I am not, therefore it hateth you.</hi>
In it then, nor of it, Pastours must
not thinke their reward to bee: and
if in the world, &amp; of the same, they
haue here their reward, it is to bee
feard that they shal neuer haue any
other; but as the world loueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;
they the world again, that their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
is like to bee with the
world also. Therfore, where Christs
word taketh place, worldly profite
and full bagges must depart: and
albeit the Minister must liue of the
Altar, to supply necessitie, yet
Christ, for Christ, and his glorie
onely, must bee preached, pride in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:3702:138"/>
the hie Priests; and auarice in <hi>Iudas,</hi>
was the first betraier of Christ:
pride and auarice now is, and euer
shall be, the only betraier of Christ
and his cause, and they know little
the power of Christ in their heart
or soule, as they preach his name
with their mouth, who with <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus</hi>
sonnes here, seeketh onely for
their preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, because they haue
followed him: but they who truely
follow him, must denie here, <hi>se suos,
&amp; sua,</hi> take vp their crosse and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him. The same is his answere
to all Ministers, as it was to <hi>Peter,</hi>
who when hee asked what they
should haue, because they followed
him: he answered, that they should
sit on twelue seates with him, and
iudge the twelue Tribes of <hi>Israel:</hi> so
he saith to euery Minister, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
him truely as they did, not
that hee shall be so or so powerfull
in the world, for hee hath chosen
the weake ones of the world; but
that hee shall sit at his right hand
with him in his kingdome, when he
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:3702:138"/>
shall iudge all the Tribes and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the world: they then who
pertaine vnto that kingdome, will
desire that great reward &amp; honour,
only more then all the honour and
kingdoms of the world, with their
glory, esteeming all as dung to win
Christ, &amp; many soules vnto Christ,
to know the power of his death &amp;
resurrection in themselues, and see
it in their flockes. But who pertain
not to this kingdome, they wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
their owne profite before all
things: &amp; if the preaching of Gods
word hinder or take away their
profit, with <hi>Alexander;</hi> that <hi>Diana</hi>
goe not downe, they will stirre vp
kings, kingdoms, cities, rulers and
people, against <hi>Paul</hi> and his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;
and if thirtie pennies may be
had, Christ Iesus shall be betrayed
with a kisse: If this light and fire of
Gods word should come in place,
it would consume, like <hi>Moses</hi> rod or
serpent, the serpentine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
fire of purgatorie: If it
were preached plainely vnto Gods
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:3702:139"/>
people, and to the soules of men,
that we must come onely to Christ,

vs nothing through him, according
to his will; and that the King, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

onely can forgiue the same.
Where should the golden pardons
of the Pope goe, or the profit of the
confessors, if it bee preached, that
Christ the Master, had not a hole
to repose his head in, nor so much
mony as could pay tribute for him
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or <hi>Peter?</hi> And if it be reported
how <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts. 3. said, <hi>Siluer or golde
haue I none;</hi> where shall the princely
pallaces of the seruants goe, &amp; the
great treasured heapes of golde
they lay vp? <hi>Paul</hi> soiourned in a
poore Tanners house that dressed
leather, and when hee sent for his
cloake and his scrolles, he maketh
no mention of any great treasure;
but hee laid vp his treasure in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
where the moath, the canker,
nor the theefe coulde not come,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3702:139"/>
gaining and treasuring by his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
many soules to God. <hi>Peter</hi> got
a great treasure, and conquesed
much, when at his Sermon so many
soules were conuerted to Christ, &amp;
ioyned to the Church. But these fat
woolues, and dumbe dogges, they
care not for such a treasure or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
woe be to them, for they doe
not the worke of the Lorde at all,
let it be negligently, woe be to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
for they preach not the Gospell,
they feede themselues and not the

haue a Lambes skinne, the name of
a christian, although they neuer
felt the power of Christ to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Bishop, or Pastour, albeit they
neuer ouer-see, nor can ouer-see,
not their flocke, but the flockes,
the sheepe neuer heard nor knew
their pastoral voice, but their thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
tyrannical iurisdiction; they

honours and riches, and with the
blood of the sheepe, but beating
out of Christs sheepfold and house,
their painefull fellow seruants, that
seeketh the life and feeding of the
sheepe onely: they will neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themselues, nor suffer others to
enter; they will neither come nor
bring to Christ, neither will they
suffer others: many soules perish in
their default; and great shal be their
condemnation who doe so, in the
worlde to come; they haue the
sheep-hooke in their hand, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
applies it to bring them into
Christs sheepfold; they haue the

forme of clouen tongues vpon
their heads, but not the clouen
tongue of Gods Spirit in their
heads or hearts, to diuide the word
aright, &amp; distribute the same vnto
Gods people.</p>
            <p>The world with the riches &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thereof, which Sathan offered
to Christ, is sufficient to make
them fall downe and worship him,
the world &amp; the kingdome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
soundeth sweetly in their eares,
because they are in loue one with
another, and their condemnation
is all one; but the word of God, <hi>It
is written,</hi> &amp; the voyce of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen, is as displeasant
vnto them, as the same <hi>It is written,</hi>
was to Sathan: Sell all and follow
me, was a hard saying to the rich
yonug man: they beeing of the
world, to bee selected from the
world, is as bitter a saying to them,
yea, more bitter to the worldly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that potion, which the world gaue
to Christ on the Crosse, vineger
and gall mixed together. Flint
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3702:141"/>
from flint may be sooner pulled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder,
&amp; the hardest Adamant or
Diamond diuided, then to diuide
and diuorce them from their sweet
<hi>Dalilah</hi> the world, and to doe that,
Gods word shall neuer get place
by them. These are the causes, that
that bright Candle is put vnder a
bushell by them; that that glorious
Citie is placed in a low valley; that
that precious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ewell is hid vnder
the earth, lest it be found, and had
onely in estimation, to be hid in
mens hearts: for if so bee that the
stronger man enter, the vsurper
shall be bound, &amp; cast out straight;
if light come, darkenesse shal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
as the morning cloudes are
driuen before the Sun: set vp Gods
Kingdome and Lawes, and put
downe their kingdome and lawes:
God and <hi>Belial</hi> cannot be together:
the aduancement of the Throne of
Iesus Christ the Lambe, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
of these goates out of their
throne; the divulgating of his
word, is the falsifying of theirs;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:3702:141"/>
therefore they striue to prolong
the night, as long as they may, that
the bright day-starre arise not, that
Light that shineth in darkenesse, to
discouer them and their workes.
The cause also, why many men,
chiefly yong men esteeme not, nor
take such delight in Gods word, as
they should; and care not much,
albeit it were hid, that they neuer
heard it much, is, because mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
chiefly in youth, affecteth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of the flesh, which, it (being
the word of the Spirit) fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
and restraineth. It is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of that narrow way, which
leadeth to life, and therefore will
not suffer libertie, to wander astray
in the wide &amp; wilde fields of sinne
to death: it is the knife that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the soare, and will haue strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
first, that ease may follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
when we sinne, neuer so little,
it will, like a good master, checke

Christ commanded the young
