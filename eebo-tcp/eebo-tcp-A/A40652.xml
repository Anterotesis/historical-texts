            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>First, because <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had lately lost its credit with the great God of <hi>Heaven,</hi> it was become <hi>Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi> in its reputation for her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to God, and cruelty to his servants, Matthew 23.37. <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, Thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not? Behold, your house is left unto you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate.</hi> Yea it was utterly unfit that the name of <hi>Christians</hi> should begin, or be born in that place where <hi>Christ</hi> was so cruelly put to death.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45575:5"/>4. Secondly, because <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was of <hi>a covetous, envious,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossing nature,</hi> ready to monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize and inclose all honour to it self. So that had the name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> first begun within the walls of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Jews would have been ready alone to lay claim thereunto, excluding the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to have any participation therein. As <hi>Christ</hi> therefore suffered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the walls of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> thereby proclaiming himself a publick good, not appropriated to that private nation, and for the same causes the name of <hi>Christians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan not at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> but at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Secondly, <hi>Negatively,</hi> The name began not at <hi>Rome.</hi> O how would the tide of <hi>Tybur</hi> have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45575:6"/>
swollen beyond bounds and banks, had the name of <hi>Christ</hi> first begun from that <hi>Citie</hi>? How would the papists boast (though not without some cause) yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all measure, that <hi>Rome</hi> in a manner was the <hi>godmother</hi> of true Religion, &amp; gave her the name of Christianity? If a father cannot in his writings vail his bonnet in a civil respect to the citie of Rome, and give it a regardfull salutation, because it was the imperiall ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the world; if an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Ecclesiasticall Historian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give it a Rhetoricall comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in respect it was so famous a Church, and most ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall Seat, having prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency before, though not superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority above, all other Churches;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45575:6"/>
I say, if in such cases their expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are hailed and tugged by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish parasites, to signifie (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mind of the speakers) the primacy and infallibility of the Romish Church: how would they ere now have hollowed it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eares of deaf men, &amp; impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously upbraided the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if the name of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had its rise from <hi>Rome,</hi> and originall in the walls thereof? But God hath marred their <hi>mark,</hi> and payred their <hi>pride,</hi> and blasted their <hi>boasting</hi>: Christians were first so called, not at <hi>Rome</hi> but at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Here let us enquire orderly into two things,

                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45575:7"/>What was it?

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The reason why there were so many <hi>Antioches</hi> is this, because there were two <hi>Antiochusses</hi> succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, both puissant princes and eminent Emperours of <hi>Asia,</hi> who founding, repairing, and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing severall cities, called them all after their own name.

in the text, is certainly known to be Antiochia in <hi>Coelosyria,</hi> so called, because lying in a hollow vale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed between the mountains of <hi>Libanus</hi> and <hi>Antilibanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was commonly called <hi>Antioch</hi> the great, and was a <hi>Metropolis</hi> for trade in those Eastern parts.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Come we now to consider what is <hi>Antioch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a pittifull inconsiderable village, famous onely for what it hath been; the Churches therein are buried in their own Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards. It falleth so much under the notice of a Geographer, that it falleth not under it generally; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in most Mapps, except some charitable ones, which are pleased in pitie to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45575:8"/>Yea, which is worst of all, a sound Christian and orthodox in his judgement, is hardly to be found in that citie where Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity first began. It is at this day infected with <hi>Mahumetisme,</hi> and such few sorry Christians as remain therein, are infected in the Fundamentalls of <hi>Religion</hi>: for they follow the Greek Church, and deny the procession of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirit from the sonne, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond person in the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 10. To teach humility to all places of greatnesse, not to confide in their own populous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but to walk in humility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, seeing <hi>Antioch</hi> the great, that voluminous citie, is now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitomized to nothing: yea, we may generally observe, that all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45575:8"/>
cities that wear the sirname of Great, are beheld by God with a jealous eye: partly because <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> is a flower of the Crown of heaven; partly because <hi>great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> presume on their popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousnesse to be <hi>great sinners</hi>; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in vain that their greatnesse will procure them an <hi>Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity,</hi> and God be moved to let them alone, rather then to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish so many, enough to make the sword of his Justice turn edge, before, it can cut through them.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The premises I say have moved the great God of heaven to hold a strict eye, and heavy hand over all cities sirnamed Great; whilest lesser places, <hi>Zoars,</hi> escape best in general judgements:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45575:9"/>
                     <hi>Nineveh the great,</hi> Jonah 3.3. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math the great, Rabbah the great, Babylon the great,</hi> Revel. 18.2. <hi>No the infinite,</hi> Nahum 3.9. And <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> by humane writers called <hi>Antiochia magna,</hi> are all reduced to ruines.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Give me leave to say to this citie of <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Darius</hi> did to <hi>Daniel</hi> in a <hi>holy complement, O Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, live for ever,</hi> that is, (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it a <hi>finite ever</hi>) might he, in <hi>life, health,</hi> and <hi>prosperity,</hi> continue to the utmost possibility of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So say I, <hi>O London, last for ever,</hi> may it flourish as long as any place hath a subsistence in this sublunary world; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, let it not be high minded, but fear, seeing <hi>Antioch</hi> a place as plentifull, as puissant, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45575:9"/>
populous, is now dwingled away to an inconsiderable village.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Come we now to the name of <hi>Christians</hi>:</p>
                  <p>This will bear a double debate, first, whether it was imposed by the enemies of the Church in scorn and derision, or whether the Church it self did assume it as an act of their own election and approbation.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. I conceive the first utterly improbable: for had the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the Church, the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of goodnesse and good men, given a name unto them, they would have invented and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed one more defamatory, of greater shame and disgrace, as to call them <hi>Hereticks, Nazarites, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifictians,</hi> and the like; and not so
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45575:10"/>
noble a name as <hi>Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the way we may observe, that the word <hi>Christian</hi> is used twice in the Bible, or if you will, but once and an half. Once, 1 Pet. 4.16. <hi>Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalf.</hi> The half time, Acts 26.28. when <hi>Agrippa</hi> said, <hi>Thou hast perswaded me almost to be a Christian.</hi> In both which places we find the word taken in an honourable accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nothing of shame being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported therein; which perswades us to believe, the name was never fastened on Gods servants by their professed enemies.</p>
                  <p>A second enquiry succeeds, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. Whether this name was by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45575:10"/>
divine injunction immediately bestowed upon them, or whether the Church meeting together, by a prudentiall Act, with a joint consent assumed it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>I confesse at the first reading, I conceived the text in the Original favoured the former, where I read <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: now <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> sometimes containeth divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration therein, and is so used Matth. 2.12. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: <hi>And being warned of God in a dream.</hi> This, I say, inclined me to believe the name of <hi>Christians</hi> to be revealed from God, and by him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately imposed on the disciples.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But on second thoughts, I find the word sometimes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45575:11"/>
no more then a plain deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. And so it is used, Rom. 7.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>she shall be called an adulteresse</hi>; which moveth me to believe, that without any such immediate revelation from heaven, in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the manifestation of Gods will, the Apostles there present, by the assistance of Gods spirit within them, and the generall consent of the Church about them, assumed that name upon themselves.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Possibly because many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, some of the <hi>Circumcision</hi> and some of the <hi>Uncircumcision</hi>; and because <hi>Gentiles</hi> was a name odious to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Iews</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive to the <hi>Gentiles</hi>: therefore the word <hi>Christians</hi> was pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45575:11"/>
as common to both, to bury the former names under it: for though <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> did ever remain as words of <hi>civil distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> they were henceforward abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, as <hi>terms of hatefull dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 18. But why were they not called <hi>Fatherians</hi> from God the Father, or <hi>holy Ghostians</hi> from the holy Ghost? why onely <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> from Christ the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Trinity? here, if any return that they are too harsh and ill sounding, too troublesome and tedious to be pronounced, the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> is in no degree satisfactory to the question.</p>
                  <p>For, first, were our tongues as long accustomed to the pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of these words, as they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45575:12"/>
have been used to the word <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> a very lisping utterance would easily be able to expresse them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we in <hi>England</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these last fifteen yeares, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted our tongues with as hard terms, with as numerous <hi>syllables,</hi> &amp; some of Latine, others of Greek extraction, (<hi>Presbyterians, Antinomians, Independents, Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives,</hi> &amp;c.) and yet these go down glib with us in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon discourse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 19. The true answer is this, we are called Christians from that person in the Trinity, that hath merited most in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of mankind.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And here farre be it from me to make odious comparisons
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45575:12"/>
betwixt the persons in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their deserts towards us, which have most indeared us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. That person who hath done least for us, hath done more for us then we can <hi>requite,</hi> then we can <hi>deserve,</hi> then we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, then we can conceive; however, may dust and ashes in all humility confesse this most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and comfortable truth, that Christ the second person in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> is the <hi>best friend</hi> we have in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and hath both done and suffered most in the effecting our salvation.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Thence is that expression of David, Psalme 110.1. <hi>The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at my right hand, untill I make thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thy footstool. The Lord,</hi> that is,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45575:13"/>
                     <hi>God the Father, said to my Lord,</hi> that is to <hi>God the Sonne, to Iesus Christ</hi>; indeed one can take but little comfort in the <hi>Lord,</hi> if not for <hi>my Lords</hi> intercession. <hi>The Lord</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his greatnesse and justice, is our enraged enemy, affording us cause of fear and sadnesse, till beheld as reconciled in our <hi>Lord</hi> unto us.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Now it will plainly appear, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath performed most for mankind in order to our <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, first, <hi>in operibus ad extra,</hi> in all outward actions, <hi>Christ the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond person in Trinity</hi> hath an equall share with the other two. Thus <hi>Christ,</hi> as well as the other <hi>two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in Trinity,</hi> created the World, and all therein, John 1.1, 2, 3. <hi>In
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45575:13"/>
the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. Secondly, we are justified by Christ, as well as by <hi>God</hi> the Father, Gal. 2.17. <hi>But if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we our selves are also found sinners, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ the minister of sinne? God forbid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. Thirdly, we are sanctified by <hi>Christ</hi> as well as by the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>: for as it is said, Rom. 15.16. <hi>Being sanctified by the holy Ghost</hi>; so it is said, 1 Cor. 1.2. <hi>To them that are sanctified through Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. Hitherto we have proved, <hi>That Christs goodnesse</hi> came para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45575:14"/>
with the other <hi>two persons in Trinity,</hi> in their relation to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>creating, justifying,</hi> and <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying us</hi>: now it remains that we shew what <hi>Christ</hi> hath peculiarly done and <hi>suffered</hi> for us. And this will plainly appear, if we consider, how three parts of four in the Creed, are made up of our Saviours performances for our <hi>salvation,</hi> wherein he alone had a <hi>personall interest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. <hi>Christ</hi> it was, who was conceived of the <hi>holy Ghost, Christ</hi> it was who was born <hi>of the Virgin Mary; Christ</hi> it was <hi>who suffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pontius Pilat; Christ</hi> it was <hi>who was crucified, dead, and buried; Christ</hi> it was <hi>who descended into hell; Christ</hi> it was <hi>who the third day rose again from the dead; Christ</hi> it is <hi>who sitteth on the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45575:14"/>
right hand of God almighty; Christ</hi> it shall be, <hi>who shall come to judge both the quick and dead</hi>: And thus we see, that the greater part of the <hi>Creed</hi> is but a <hi>Chronicle</hi> of <hi>Christs achievements</hi> for mankind, from whom we are <hi>justly called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="27">27. But some will say, grant it fit <hi>that Gods servants</hi> should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from <hi>the second person in Trinity,</hi> yet, why are they not <hi>called Iesuites from Iesus,</hi> rather then <hi>Christians from the name of Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. I answer, <hi>The name of Iesus which signifies a Saviour,</hi> is not of so <hi>transitive a nature as the word Christ</hi> is, nor can it be so properly applyed to men, without some suspition of blasphemy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining thereupon; <hi>Iesus</hi> importeth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45575:15"/>
a <hi>Saviour, Christ</hi> importeth <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; now every servant of God cannot be termed a <hi>Saviour,</hi> but may properly be called a <hi>Christ,</hi> and an <hi>anointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. This may be proved from the expression of David, Psal. 45.7. <hi>Thou lovest righteousnesse, and hatest wickednesse, therefore God, thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladness above thy fellows.</hi> See we here, <hi>That Christ being anointed</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his fellows, implieth that his fellows were also anointed, though in an inferiour proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though the <hi>grand shower of graces</hi> fell onely <hi>on the head of our Saviour,</hi> yet some stragling drops did light on all them who truly believe in him, so that every <hi>Saint of God</hi> is a little <hi>Christ or anointed,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:45575:15"/>30. They may also be called <hi>Christians,</hi> that is the <hi>professours</hi> of the faith, maintainers of the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> delivered to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and endeavourers to imitate the examples which he set before them.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Here we must not forget how the heathen made another deduction, and etymologie of the word <hi>Christians</hi>; for such pagans, in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> beholding the <hi>love and charity</hi> betwixt <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> how they mutually relieved each others wants; but especially, how they conversed together in the time of plagues and epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diseases, comforting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when heathen people started from the embraces of their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est relations: I say, seeing this,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45575:16"/>
they conceived they were called <hi>Christiani quasi Chrestani,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Greek word for <hi>mild and meek,</hi> as more mercifull men, more pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and compassionate persons then any others.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. But alasse, should heathens now look on the carriage and <hi>conversations of Christians</hi> one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, how spitefull and cruell we are, how Bearish, how Borish, how Brutish we are in our mutuall dissentions, they would conclude us not called from meeknesse; so ill we broke our names.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Come we now to the uses of what hath been delivered, which may serve to confute two sorts of people.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>First, Those that are ashamed of the name <hi>Christians.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>For the first, We charge this on the account of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> let them get it off as they can. For the word <hi>Christian</hi> in the citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> is taken to be a term of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, a <hi>note</hi> or <hi>brand</hi> of <hi>infamy</hi>; so that when they will disparage a person, they call him a <note n="*" place="margin">See the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> in his Annotat. on this verse, Acts 11.26. citing one <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus Francius</hi> for the justifying of this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> 
                     <hi>Christian,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth to as much as a <hi>silly fellow,</hi> a <hi>mean man,</hi> a man of <hi>no parts or endowments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="34">34. And will you know the true cause thereof? It is this; All pregnant wits of able and active parts, or of high and <hi>honourable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage,</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:45575:17"/>
enter themselves into some <hi>Order</hi>: if men, of <hi>Benedictines, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans, Franciscans, Carmelites, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,</hi> &amp;c. if women, <hi>Bridgittians, Clarians,</hi> &amp;c. so that besides the name of Christians, they have an addition from their <hi>Order</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of people. And if they be <hi>Seculars</hi> of any considerable <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency,</hi> then are they known by their <hi>dignities</hi> of <hi>Arch-deacons Bishops, Cardinalls,</hi> &amp;c. So that such plain poore people which are without <hi>welt</hi> or <hi>guard</hi> of any such <hi>Religious Accessions,</hi> are called <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> as uselesse in the <hi>Church,</hi> save as <hi>ordinary persons</hi> without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or dignity therein. Thus <hi>Christian</hi> passeth there for the civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest expression of a <hi>fool,</hi> and doth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45575:17"/>
not <hi>Rome</hi> shew her self to be <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian</hi> to purpose, where the name of <hi>Christian</hi> passeth for a term of <hi>dishonour,</hi> or at the best of <hi>diminution</hi>?</p>
                  <p n="35">35. In the second place we charge it on our <hi>Romish adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> that they are ashamed of the name <hi>Christian,</hi> because they write themselves <hi>Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pleasing</hi> and <hi>priding</hi> themselves in those titles, whilest the name of <hi>Christian</hi> (though not actually <hi>disowned</hi>) is disused by them, and left in <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="36">36. But here the <hi>Romanists</hi> turn our own <hi>Ordinance</hi> against us, and assault us with our own <hi>weapons.</hi> They heavily accuse us for being ashamed of the name <hi>Christian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45575:18"/>
calling our selves <hi>Lutherans, Calvinists, Hugenotes, Protestants, Remonstrants, Antiremonstrants,</hi> &amp;c. Thus as <hi>Mary</hi> complained, John 20.13. <hi>They have taken away the Lord, and I know not where they have layd him.</hi> They charge us that we have left out and lost <hi>Christ,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those many strange names we have assumed to our selves.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. I must enlarge my self in answer to this <hi>Objection.</hi> And first I lay down this <hi>Foundation,</hi> that we never took these names unto our selves, but they were fixed and fastned on us by the <hi>spleen</hi> &amp; <hi>envy</hi> of our <hi>Romish adversaries</hi>; and here we appeal to any unbiassed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be <hi>judge</hi> betwixt us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be fair and ingenuous dealing of the <hi>Papists</hi>? who first
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45575:18"/>
asperse us with such <hi>nicknames,</hi> first <hi>call us so,</hi> and then accuse us <hi>for being called so.</hi> And this will plainly appear, upon a particular examination of the aforesaid <hi>names.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="38">38. To begin with <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists.</hi> This we say. We acknowledge <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> two eminent instruments of Gods glory in their generations; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the first was more then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon man, armed <hi>cap a pe,</hi> with a couragious spirit, to break through, and rout the <hi>ranks</hi> of the <hi>Romish superstitions.</hi> However, we utterly disclaime to be called by their names: call us <hi>Lutherans,</hi> call us <hi>Calvinists,</hi> call us <hi>Protestants,</hi> or what they please, we stand si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and return no <hi>vous aves,</hi> as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45575:19"/>
utterly unconcerned in that <hi>call,</hi> onely we sind our tongues, when termed <hi>Christians:</hi> For <hi>the disciples were called Christians first at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="39">39. We reade a passage Isaiah 4.1. much appliable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. <hi>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, we will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel, onely let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.</hi> Here we may plainly perceive, that it is the <hi>prerogative Royall</hi> of the <hi>Husband</hi> alone, and part of his <hi>Maritall priviledge</hi> to have his wife denominated from him. God therefore who is a <hi>jealous God,</hi> may justly be suspitious of our <hi>Church</hi> her <hi>loyalty,</hi> if offering to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from any other, but from <hi>Christ</hi> her <hi>Husband.</hi>

John 3.29. <hi>He that hath the Bride is the Bridegroom: but the friend of the Bridegroom which stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and heareth him, rejoyceth greatly, because of the Bridegroomes voice, this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</hi> We al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin friends of the Bridegroom,</hi> shining and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lights, <hi>starres</hi> of the <hi>first magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> but <hi>Christ</hi> alone is the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> to whom our <hi>Church</hi> humbly and heartily appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self, triumphing to be called after his name alone.</p>

                     <hi>Protestants. S. Paul</hi> himself was one, 1 Cor. 15.31. <hi>I protest by your rejoycing which I have in Christ Iesus our Lord, I die daily. Protestation</hi> is no more then a <hi>solemn and serious profession of the truth.</hi>

                  <p n="42">42. But the name of <hi>Protestants,</hi> as imposed on those of our Church, had this originall.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45575:20"/>
but it can never be proved that we took that name to our selves, or took any delight or content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, as too narrow a name of party, whilst <hi>Rechoboth,</hi> God hath made us room in the word Christians, seeing that we rejoice in the latitude and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensivenesse thereof.</p>
                  <p n="43">43.

both, but now he speaks to them as a prophet; he knowes no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection, being acted with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall inspiration; he leaves off flesh and blood, being prompted by the spirit of God, and tells them, cursed be their wrath, for for it was fierce, and their anger, for it was furious.</p>
                  <p>I shall use no other method in the words, but such observations as are pertinent to the text, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for your souls.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>O my soul, &amp;c.</hi> seeing Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob doth entertain a discourse with his own soul, wee may learn,</p>
                  <p>A Christian who can discourse with his own soul, may make good company for himself.</p>
                  <p>This was Davids precept Psal. 4.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45575:46"/>
vers. 4. <hi>commune with your own hearts upon your beds</hi>; this is no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there is a kind of discourse which makes no noise: this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is the heart of heavenly meditation, he may give himself a question, and answer it himself; and David what he prescribes to us, practises himself, when he sayes, <hi>why art thou so sad O my soul, and why art thou so disquieted within me? trust still in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had people this art of entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a time to discourse with themselves, it would prevent much mischief; thou mayest divide thy soul into severall parts, and thou maist discourse if thou wilt with every faculty, with thy understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, memory, fancy, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall affections of thy soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45575:47"/>Ask that question of thy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which <hi>Philip</hi> askt of the Eunuch, Acts 10. <hi>understandest thou what thou readest</hi>? call your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to account whether you understand what you read or not.</p>
                  <p>Ask thy fancy that question which Acbish once propounded to king David, <hi>where hast thou been roving all this day</hi>? bring thy fancy to account.</p>
                  <p>Ask that of thy memory which the master did of the unjust stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Luke 16. <hi>give an account of thy stewardship</hi>; ask thy memory what good hast thou measured up.</p>
                  <p>When thou findest thy self transported with mirth, ask thy soul that question, God did to Sarah, <hi>why laughest thou?</hi> when thou seest the passion of anger grow
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45575:47"/>
too violently upon thee, ask of it that question which God did to the prophet Jonah, <hi>doest thou well to be angry?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider, if you could thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with your selves, you would prevent much bad company; for when we runne into the company of good fellowes, wee have but one thing to pretend unto as a thing incident to mans nature, that he loves company. But if we could entertain this discourse with our own souls, wee should be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lesse alone, then when we are alone, and abate the tediousnesse of solitarinesse with good socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh my soul come not thou into their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</hi> The next observation is,</p>
                  <p>That wicked men have certain
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45575:48"/>
secrets, which they communicate to those of their own society.</p>
                  <p>Wee read in the 26. Psalm of the secrets of the Lord; now as the Lord hath his secrets, so the devil hath his secrets of iniquity; and the reason why they keep them secret, is, because otherwise they would not attain to those ends which they propound to themselves: if all their designes were open, they would be frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and never obtain their hellish intents, and therefore that they may not be hindred in bringing them about, they keep them secret.</p>
                  <p>And yet know by the way, though they are secrets to men, they are not secrets to God; all things are naked and open before him, he is the searcher of the heart
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45575:48"/>
and reins. But no further of this; I come to that which is of more concernment.</p>
                  <p>It is a dangerous thing to come into the secrets of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>I divide wicked men into two sorts, those that call people into their secrets, and those that come into their secrets when called; the principalls, and the accessaries: there is a generation of people that think they will fare well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if they be not the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers, or the most active instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in an evil designe: they think this will bear them out, if they came in but by the by; oh beloved, know it is not enough to excuse thee.</p>
                  <p>And know that a man may come into an evil secret, and not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45575:49"/>
command it, contrive it, or act it.</p>
                  <p>First by consent to it, thus (not S. Paul) but Saul the persecutor came into the mischievous secret of stoning <hi>Stephen</hi>; for though it was openly acted, yet it was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately plotted. And what did <hi>Saul</hi> do? he threw never a stone, he did not, but I tell you what he did, he kept the clothes of those that did it: the Iewes put off their upper garments that their hands might be at the more liberty, with the more strength and steady aime to throw their stones at him, which their sleeves hindered; now <hi>Paul</hi> standing by, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wardrobe of their clothes, was equally guilty with them in that act.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:45575:49"/>The next thing by which a man may be guilty of a wicked sercret, is by concealing of it, and we find that God brought heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon meere concealing.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth of the Acts, it is said of <hi>Ananias</hi> that he kept back the price, his wife being privy to it, it is not said shee did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but onely conceal it. Now S <hi>Austin</hi> saith in this case it is one of the hardest things to clear Gods judgements.</p>
                  <p>God is just, the fault was in her use of this action, she might have discovered it unto the Church, and so have been spared.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by commending it; though we neither consent to it, or conceal it, yet if thou commend it, thou dost adopt that wicked act to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45575:50"/>
be thine own, and draw the guilt thereof upon thee; and so men come to be guilty of other folkes sinnes.</p>
                  <p>But if a man be a minister or a magistrate, he may be guilty of sinne otherwise, and neither of these wayes here spoken of; the minister if he doth not publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprove it, and the magistrate if he do not punish it.</p>
                  <p>The minister, if he do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it with Christian discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and moderation; though in the sinnes of great men there is much more danger in reproving them. A crack or want of repair in the top of a steeple is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to mend then any part; the mason must have many devices to climb unto it with the danger
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45575:50"/>
of loosing of his life: so it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to reprove great persons to high for us to meddle with. But if we be called to it, we must trust in the assistance of God; and wee partake of their sinnes if wee do not reprove them.</p>
                  <p>But the magistrate is guilty though he do reprove it, if he do not punish it. <hi>Ely</hi> did reprove his sonnes, it was well he did it, but this is not enough, the heinous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their offences was of that nature, that the proud flesh must be cut off, and not be suffered to fester in the body. But he being a magistrate and not punishing of it, suffered himself.</p>
                  <p>But now let us come to know the secret; what was the mischief which these two had done? the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45575:51"/>
story is large, and is set down by the spirit of God in the 34. of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis.</p>
                  <p>Now may I request you, when divine providence shall carry you to your quiet meditations, to read the whole story.</p>
                  <p>I shall give you a brief account of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iacob</hi> had but one only daughter, and shee would go gadding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to see other daughters; see what comes of the wandring of virgins from their parents houses, for this was it which wrought her misery, she would go abroad to see fashions, and going forth, she sees and is seen by the prince of the land.</p>
                  <p>Give now <hi>Shechem</hi> his due that did her this wrong, he was more
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45575:51"/>
honest in his dishonesty then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this age, who when they have improved their wicked thoughts upon womens weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, how many are there who do scornfully &amp; spitefully throw them off, and triumph in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest they have gotten by their own treachery, and the others fault, and throw away the snuff of their wantonnesse which ends their love?</p>
                  <p>It is said of <hi>Thamar</hi> the daughter of <hi>David,</hi> that after <hi>Ammon</hi> had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used her, he fell from her; but <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> had more generous principles, he doth endeavour to make her, whom formerly he had made his harlot, to be his wife.</p>
                  <p>This done, the sonnes of <hi>Jacob</hi> will not consent, unlesse they be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45575:52"/>
circumcised, which done, in comes <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> and kills them all, men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Now two things give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents to their cruelty.</p>
                  <p>First, that they abused the holy sacrament of circumcision, which God had appointed for a signe and a seal to the children of Israel, and to make this a cloak to their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous intents this is the first aggravation, they brought heaven into their intended designes.</p>
                  <p>The second was this, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the offence done was personall in <hi>Shechem</hi>; yet the punishment fell upon the whole city, and the women and children.</p>
                  <p>What mischief had the women done, whose known weaknesse is their profest armour against any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45575:52"/>
true valiant man? What fault have little infants done, whose fathers were the onely committers of the faults? this added to their cruelty.</p>
                  <p>But as a musket makes no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port when discharged in the same place and time with a full cannon; so the act of these is but small in comparison of the cruelty of which this day is our gratefull remembrance: <hi>my soul come not thou into their secrets.</hi> It was a secret in its nature, but a greater secret in regard of the time and place in which it was committed; it was plotted in the bowels of the earth, and they undermined many yards therein, least the sun ashamed to see it should discover it; or as if they would creep neerer to hell, from whence it was first invented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:45575:53"/>And it was a secret in respect of the persons who were joyned and soldered together with an oath of secresie; and mark a double concurrence of cruelty in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
                  <p>The sonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> abuse the sacrament of circumcision, under the covert whereof they might the better bring to passe their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded villanies; so <hi>Gardiner,</hi> he gave the sacrament of the Lords supper, to all those that were conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in this wicked designe and treason; that so he might enjoyn them to the greater secrecy.</p>
                  <p>And as in the secret of <hi>Iacobs</hi> sonnes there were men, women &amp; children slain; so these traitors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not their cruelty against the king onely, but surely that blow
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45575:53"/>
had not been given, but many thousands of people whose occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might have summoned them to that place, would have been sent with the peers of the land the same way of destruction. I do not question but there are those here present, whose memories have not let fall the day of this great deliverance; for it must not be said that the deliverance extended one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to those then living, but wee, though then in our mothers wombs, and not thought on, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate fully in the enjoyment thereof. For had it been effected as it was intended, it is easie for you to judge and conceive the sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition this land had groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; had it took effect the miseries of this land had been great, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45575:54"/>
the dishonour to God had been far greater, and if God had suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to come to passe, presently they had censured their own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be good and just, but the snare is broken, and we are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Oh let your prayers be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore joyned with mine, that wee may be all kept from the secrets of wicked men, and in a thankfull remembrance be constant in our praises to God for this dayes deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
                  <p>Some desire that this day may not be kept, but forgot, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it looks with a paler co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the Almanack then it use to do, but next year it will be a full jubile, fifty years since the contrivance thereof: let all those
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45575:54"/>
whom God shall lend life unto that day, keep in your minds the memoriall of so great a blessing, and to preserve the memory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for what principles of false doctrine had infected this land, had this plot taken effect? and therefore it shall be my prayer; that God will write thankfulnesse in your hearts to a continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the same.</p>

A namelesse <hi>Levite</hi> with his wife journeyed on the highwayes side, waited on by one servant. <hi>Balaam</hi> the false prophet rode in state with his two men: <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. the Levite in this chapter is decently atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, has his man: how many poor ministers now adayes for want of means are forced to be slaves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and servants to themselves? going on they come to the city of <hi>Gibeon,</hi> whose inhabitants were notoriously wicked, addicted to the sinne of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> where all the pleasure and delight consisteth in the enormity thereof. But as lust in this city was hot, so hospitality was cold, none invite this Levite home to their house; for then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Jewes</hi> there were no inns, or rather every house was an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45575:57"/>
inne, wherein strangers were free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained, and at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thanks was all the shot they had to discharge. At last comes an old man from his work out of the field at evening, and gives him a free invitation; mark (I pray) his character, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> he was an old man: your youthfull gallants have more bravery on their backs, then boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their hands; alass! they have been born since the death of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality. Even amongst us for the most part they are old men of an ancient stamp and edition almost worn out, which are most to be commended for their hospitable bounty. 2, he came from his work, those are most pitifull to others, who are most painfull in their own callings. Your great gamesters that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45575:58"/>
will play away an estate by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale, are loth to retaile out an almes to the poor, whilst com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the best husbands are the best house-keepers; liberality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fire that is maintained by thrift. The Levite entred into his house, but finds the haven more dangerous then the open sea; more safe might he have been in the wildernesse amongst beasts, then in the city amongst beastly men, who now presse to offer that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to his person, which is not to be named amongst Christians. At last they are content to spare the Levite himself (which I impute not to their pity, but to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence) and make his wife the prey of their lust; till the violence and variety thereof caused her
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45575:58"/>
sudden death; where marke by the way the justnesse of the wayes of God. This woman had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been false to her husband vers 2. and now see wherein shee had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, therein is shee punished.</p>

                     <l>Culpa libido fuit, poena libido suit.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>By lust shee had sinned, by lust shee doth suffer. She that could not be content to be severall to her husband alone, is now against her will made common to so many, till it cost her her life; yet it might please God so to sanctify this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto her, as thereby to bring her to a sight and sorrow for her sinnes, and her shamefull death on earth might occasion to her a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious life in heaven. Her husband laying hand on her corps, with a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45575:59"/>
knife cut it into twelve parts, and severally sends them to the jury of the tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hard hearted husband, if the least pity be alive in thy breast, offer not this wrong unto the dead. Is it not enough that her soul is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from her body, but her body also must be twelve times parted from it self? suffer her ashes to sleep in quiet, the pawn for the return of her soul; methinks that knife that cuts her hands should pierce thine heart: but comdemn not the Levite for this deed; it was not cruelty, but pitty and piety that moved him unto it, that the sight of the corps might make the Jewes the more throughly prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the cause, and every tribe that had a part of her body, might have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45575:59"/>
a part in revenging her innocent bloud. Her mouth onely spake whilst she was living, now each peice of her mangled corps speaks when shee is dead, whilest the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> both attentively heard and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously understood the language thereof, which made them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the causers of her death for matchlesse offendors: many men have done villanously, but these surmounted them all, <hi>there was no such deed done nor seen since</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I will not mangle my text as the Levite his wife, with often divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it; let it suffice to observe therein two principall parts,</p>

                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45575:60"/>In the first, two commendable practises of the Iewes commend themseIves to our meditation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First, they were well skilled, well versed in the severall actions which were done in their country before their time, and used to match &amp; compare one deed with another, to see which was better, which worse, which more which lesse vitious; and amongst the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of sinnes behold this in my text stands like a Saul, stands higher then his fellows by the shoulders upwards.</p>
                  <p>Herein let us follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Israelites, let us read hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories that we be not made an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story; let us compare the passages of the time past with those of the present age; for as it is a great ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45575:60"/>
in a Gentleman though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so proper and personable, if he hath but such a crick in his neck, that he cannot turn his face back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to see what is behind him: so it is a great shame in such a one as pretends to learning and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if by the benefit of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he cannot reflect the eyes of his mind backward, and see those things which were done in the dayes of his fathers, and in the old time before them. You therefore that have the chronicle of our kings in your houses, the Acts and monuments in your halls, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them not to a desk, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did their harps to the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, rather for sight then service, till moths have fretted out the bookes as worms have eaten the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45575:61"/>
bodies of those worthy men who compiled them; but at your best leisure read and peruse them. But when you have read all humane Authors over, they will be but so many muddy and brackish chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells to the pure and fresh foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Gods holy word: medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate therefore in the same both day and night, wherein alone you shall find stories more true, more various, more pleasant, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, then all other writers anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or modern are able to afford.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second praise-worthy practise in the Israelites is this, they kept the solemn and constant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of their coming out of the land of <hi>Egypt</hi>; from which as from a memorable <hi>aera,</hi> and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Epoche</hi> they used to date, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45575:61"/>
compute their severall actions; <hi>not since the day that the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael came out of the land of Egypt.</hi> And good reason they had to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it; God then bestowing on their fathers a great deliverance, who whilest they lived in Egypt, lived in continuall slavery. Indeed they had meat enough; which may serve to condemn the cruelty of some masters to their servants now adayes, who though they give them their bellyfull of work, will not give them their bellyfull of victualls.</p>
                  <p>The Egyptians dealt better with the Jewes in this kind; of onions, cucumbers, and the flesh-pots of Egypt, they had their full by their own confession. Yet their life being a bondage must needs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45575:62"/>
be miserable; liberty being the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life of our life without which our life is a continuall dying. Yea the coming of the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael out of Egypt may in some sort seem to them to have been the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the world; <hi>Adam</hi> was made of the dust of the earth, they then fetcht from the clay of the earth, whereof they had made many hard bricks, though not half so hard as the hearts of those Taskmasters, which were set over them; the world was made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the Jewes when they came out of Egypt, being made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly for outward respects no better then nothing. And as their remaining there was miserable, so their removing thence was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; wonderfully therefore
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45575:62"/>
should they have forgot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if they had forgot Gods wonders towards them in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
                  <p>And have not wee <hi>English</hi> men as many and remarkable delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances as ever the Jewes had? some common with us to all Christans, as the second birth day of the world at the birth of our Saviour. You therefore that are clarks and notaries, who in dating of acts and instruments, with your posting pens make such frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the year of the Lord, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that those words which have been so often written with your hands, may once be written in your hearts, with the benefits ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued to all mankind by the birth of our Saviour. Some proper
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45575:63"/>
to this our nation alone, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the <hi>Spanish</hi> invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in 88. <hi>Naomi</hi> said to the men of Bethlehem, Ruth 1. call me not <hi>Naomi</hi> fair; but call me <hi>mara</hi> bitter, for the Lord hath afflicted me, I went out full but return em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, &amp;c. so might that great fleet say, call me not the invincible <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado,</hi> but call me the conquered <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado</hi>; for the Lord hath punished my pride, I went out full, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the world, but return empty to the scorn of all nations. Go then you <hi>Spaniards,</hi> bragge of <hi>Lisbon, Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boa,</hi> and <hi>Toledo</hi> blades; sure I am that then an English sword ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by the arm of the God of heaven was proved to be the best mettall. Nor lesse miraculously from home-bred conspiracy in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45575:63"/>
gunpowder treason, where the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son onely was intention, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (thanks be to God) brought to execution, but the traytors. Well, its said that things written in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are most durable in difference of time; I would not wish to us a marble, hard or stony heart, but such a one as is soft, tender and pliable, and surely this will soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner receive and longest retain the print of Gods favours unto us, and principally of these deliverances wherein the people of England may be said to have come out of the land of Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Now that this sinne in my text may appear in its proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, consider with me; first the party to whome the wrong was offered was a <hi>stranger</hi>; the word
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45575:64"/>
stranger in the very mention of it ought to carry with it a protection from all wrongs; the heathen Romans were so Christian in this kind, that if their enemy chanced to enter into their house in nature of a stranger, there was a cessation from enmity, during his abode under their roof, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge gave place to hospitality, Secondly she was a <hi>woman,</hi> &amp; that sex may seem in some sort to be fenced from injury, because it is not fenced from injuries. For such is the known weakness of women, that wee count it weaknesse in men to offer them any wrong, and our modesty is the best safeguard and defence for theirs. Thirdly, she was a Levites wife, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks some shadow of sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45575:64"/>
should be reflected from him on her. Fourthly she was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused to death; indeed she died not presently, but before she came into the house, her soul got out of her body, and even in our law it is murther, that comes within the compasse of a year and a day; now murther you know is a crying sinne, yea, like <hi>Stentor</hi> the Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, it shouteth louder then 50. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary offences. The mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster mother may smother her child, but when she hath done, she cannot smother the murther of her child. Fifthly, abused to death by a whole city: those are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved who conceive the multitude of offendors diminish the offence. Rather the more the sinners, the more heinous the sinne; the worst
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45575:65"/>
sinne that ever was, was the most generall sinne that ever was, when all mankind together sinned at once in <hi>Adam</hi>: yea in our law that which being done by one or two, is but a trespasse, committed by more assumes the name of a ryot. Lastly by a whole city of Israelites: but if they had been <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> or <hi>Hittites</hi> that had done me this dishonour, then perchance I should have born it; had they been <hi>Canaanites</hi> or <hi>Jebusites</hi> had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me this disgrace, then more patiently could I have digested it, but they pretended to serve the same God, and observe the same religion. They were descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the loyns of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and issued from the womb of <hi>Rachel</hi>: what good doth the ark of God
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45575:65"/>
in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> with Levites a tending before it, <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, pot of manna, mercy seat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, if there be a <hi>Sodome</hi> in <hi>Sion,</hi> a <hi>Bethaven</hi> in <hi>Bethel,</hi> folly in <hi>Israel</hi>? verily I say unto you I have not found so great an offence no not amongst the Gentiles. Happy those poor <hi>Armenians</hi> which live in those remote parts, where the shrill sound of the gospel was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trumpetted forth, their invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible ignorance will be an Orator in the ears of the mercifull judge, not wholly to excuse but much to diminish their fault, not to prevaile for a full pardon, yet to procure a lighter punishment, whilst in the same day they shall rise up, and condemn the <hi>Jewes</hi> in my text, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better by the light of a candle,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45575:66"/>
then the <hi>Iewes</hi> by the beams of the sun.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the prescribing of the wholesome order for the future consult, <hi>consider, and give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>: but first wee must remove an objection which here may rise; for may some say, why is it not particularly exprest in the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> what punishment ought to be inflicted upon an whole city, when by lust they abuse a woman to death? had this been a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case and the penalty precisesly spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, it would have spared the Israelites all their pains to consult and consider; yea this may seem to argue the law of God of some defects and imperfections, that it is not adaequate to all occasions, and of extent large enough for all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45575:66"/>
necessities, and needs to be patcht and peeced with the accession of humane deliberation. For two reasons the particular punishment is expressed, first because the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God being charity it self, charitablely presumed that no Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites would be so wicked; the heathen appointed no punishment for <hi>parricides,</hi> supposing that sinne could not be committed. Men must first murther all nature in themselves, before they can be so unnaturall as to murther their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Secondly, the mentioning of the punishment might by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans suggestion, and mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption be abused to make them commit the sin: some sinnes are left out in the law, not because they are too little, but because they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45575:67"/>
are too great; should the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every villany be put into the law, the committing of many villanies would be put into our minds, which otherwise might be forgotten; and sinnes punisher would be made sins remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. Yet though this case for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance is not set down in the Bible, for substance it is in severall places; who sheddeth mans bloud, by man shall his bloud be shed, Gen. 6.9. now the scripture is not written for those that will be idle, but for such as comparing one place with another, by faithfull consequence will proportionably extract and deduce, what ought to be done in each severall action whose substance in the bible is recorded, though each circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45575:67"/>
particularly set down. And now I come to the order for the time to come: but behold in the order it self much confusion ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the variety of translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; you shall scarce find three bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles wherein two of these words are rendred alike: what therefore must wee do? the best way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the text is to practise it; and before wee give sentence what should be the meaning of these severall words, let us first consult with interpreters, and consider the originall. The first word in the great Bible, <hi>consult,</hi> importeth in the originall a meeting of many together, rendred by learned <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius, adhibete vos ad istud,</hi> settle your selves together to this matter. The observation is this; in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45575:68"/>
of moment we are not seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to follow our private advice, but jointly to unite your selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in consultation; eyes see more then an eye (saith the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.) I must confesse <hi>Paphnutius</hi> with his one eye (for his persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had bored out the other) saw more in the matter of ministers marriage then the 300 two-eyed bishops assembled in the councel o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Nice.</hi> But he was an exception from a generall rule; ordinarily tow are better then one: yea <hi>Solomon</hi> the wisest of earthly kings had his councel of aged men, which stood before him, 1 Kings 12.6. nay a greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> may be brought for the proof of this point: God himself, Genes. 1.26. being about to contract the first
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45575:68"/>
volume of the world into the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brigement of man, called as it were a councel in the persons of the Trinity; <hi>let us make man.</hi> Had God any need of councel? is not the same eternall act which is done by one person, done by all? or are not these things rather written for our instruction? surely for our instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they are written, that when we enterprise things of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, we may call for and make use of the councels and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of others; to blame then are they, who rashly runne on their own heads. I cannot but commend the swiftnesse of <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maaz</hi> his feet, 2 Sam. 18.28. who being sent out of <hi>Cushi</hi> came to <hi>David</hi> before him, yet can I not but dispraise the shallownesse of <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maaz</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:45575:69"/>
his judgement, who running before he had received perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions from <hi>Joab,</hi> came to the end of his journey scarce with the middle of his message.</p>
                  <p>Is it so then, that we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with others? then most lawfull, laudable, &amp; necessary is the vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them who are of learned councel: for should your silly cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents be entrusted w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the managing of their own suits, they would cut the throat of their most rightfull causes, even with the same sword with which you are able to defend them. But may you be pleased pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to heare the best spirituall advice which I freely bestow upon you, who would be glad to pay your fees, and give you deserved thanks for your councell, if mine
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45575:69"/>
occasions so required it. When such a cause shall be brought to your hands, as your own consciences shall proclaim to be bad, let <hi>Baal</hi> plead for himself, let iniquity be her own advocate; offer you not once to defend them: and when the case shall be good, loose it not in the labyrinths of delayes, and Meanders of demurrs, but bring it the narrowest cut, the nearest course from the first motion to the finall verdict. I must confesse there may be much corruption in a festred sore, but I dare boldly say, there is more corruption in the dishonest Chirurgion, that may quickly cure it, but will not for his private ends: indeed they that hold leases by lives, could be content that each life in their lease
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45575:70"/>
should be a <hi>Methuselah</hi> sith then your gain dependeth on the long depending of suits, some perchance may think it more beneficiall for you needlesly to protract them. But know by the speedy ending of them, your gain shall be the more by being the lesse; what is wanting in bulk shall be supplied in blessing, no diseased tympany shall swell your estate, but all your substance shall be solid whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some flesh: all the shekels in your coffers shall be shekels of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, such as you may enjoy with content, whilest you live, and leave to your wife, and thrifty heirs, when you die. To you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it belongeth to <hi>consult</hi>: this differs from the former, <hi>consult</hi> is with others, <hi>consider</hi> is in our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45575:70"/>
selves; for after wee have heard what others can say, we must not so pinne our practise on their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but we must also use our own best consideration, especially if it be in a case of conscience wherein our own good is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly interested. And this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is to go before our finall sentence. Before we passe our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most verdict, we are first seriously to premise a due deliberation in our selves, as formerly we have had 1 consultation with others. Let us go down and see, Gen. 1.18.21. whether the sinnes of <hi>Sodom</hi> be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cry which is come up unto mee. Our adversaries of the Romish Church are too too faulty herein, in giving sentence before they have well weighed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45575:71"/>
the cause. In the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> when our land was dark with ignorance, and light onely with those bonfires which burnt the martyrs, a woman in <hi>Jersey</hi> at the stake being delivered of a male child, the standers by took the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and threw it into the fire: matchlesse cruelty! children when newly born are to be baptized with water, not to be cast into the fire, or did they take it to be like the <hi>viper,</hi> Acts 28. which no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner crawled out of the heat of the flame, but S. <hi>Paul</hi> presently cast it in again? alas as yet it was no viper, no poison in the teeth, no venome in the tongue, whereby it may do hurt. Or did they think that it would take it by kind, because his mother (as they termed it) was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45575:71"/>
an heretick? no sinne is so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entailed from parent to child, but grace and good breeding may break it off. Had they well ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red those things before hand, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance they might have prevailed for a reprive, if not for a pardon for this child. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all other nations, read their letters backward, so the papists in their practise read backward, and invert the order of my text, and instead of consult, give sentence and consider; they first give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and then consult and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance consider: and I would to God all that hated popery hated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so this popish practise; for in some sort hereof guilty are they who seeing one wallowing in sinnes, rashly reason from the present to the

future, and condemn such a one for a reprobate or castaway. Let us not flatter black and say its white, nor defame white and say it is black; let us tell <hi>Judah</hi> of their sinnes, and <hi>Israel</hi> of their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions; for our callings warn us: let us tell a drunkard that he is a drunkard, an adulterer that he is an adulterer, and that his estate is desperate and damnable, if he live and dye impenitent in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But as for their finall estate, it belongeth not to us to give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of them; it is not for us to know these things which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath put in his own power: but if our censuring faculty be so sharp (on Gods blessing) let us turn the edge thereof inward: let us first read a criticall lecture on all
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45575:72"/>
our own bad thoughts, words, and actions, and then shall we have lesse leasure and delight to rome and range abroad.</p>
                  <p>Now the word <hi>consider</hi> in my text, warrants mee to addresse my speech to you who are of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for after consult is past, after you have heard a case debated and argued by learned councel, then is your duty to consider: your way, is so hedged on either side you cannot go out of it, except you will wilfully; for you are onely conscionably to find things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as you hear them alledged and proved, and this done your office is discharged; but beware of one thing, the being overswaied by one appearing and potent man amongst you. <hi>Barach</hi> said to <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>

Judge. 4.8. if thou wilt go up with me, I will go up, but if thou wilt not go up with me, then will I not go up. So too often the the rest of the jury to one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall man amongst them, please you S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to be for the plaintiff, wee are for the plaintiff, if you be for the defendant, wee are for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant; cast the prisoner, &amp; wee cast him, accquit you him, and wee accquit him: in a word, wee'l be the wax, print you upon us what impression you please. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, these things ought not to be so; that the prisoner should be cast at the verdict of twelve men, and eleven of these twelve have their judgements cast by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of one. Look therefore to your selves, except others will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

to God for your perjury; for to you it belongeth to <hi>consider.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the third step of the throne of justice, <hi>give sentence</hi>; where wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, after due consultation and consideration are past, wee ought not still to be neuters &amp; Scepticks, but absolutely to expresse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our selves on one side, as wee shall see most occasion. And yet how many be there which have learning too much to be papists, &amp; yet religion too little to be good protestants? They are loth to say that <hi>Luther</hi> is in the right, and they are loth to say that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is in the wrong. And as God saith of himself, I am what I am; so may it be said of these men, they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven what you would have them
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45575:74"/>
to be: nor need wee go out into the wildernesse to see these reeds shaken with the wind; I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid in our towns best traded, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces most populous, there be too many of them who spending all their life in tedious consulting, and considering of points, continue more unresolved then when they begun, &amp; will never give sentence. Which word putteth me in mind, to apply my self unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships to whom his Highnesse authority hath committed the power of passing the sentence of life and death; but I remember what <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> said to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. I have need to come to thee, and comest thou to mee? Is your Honours courtesie and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie such as to repair to my
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45575:74"/>
weak pains? when I, whose lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in law matters is no better then ignorance, have need to come to you, who are the captains of the first forme in the school of justice, and therefore need not now to learn the alphabet of your office: well do you know how to weild the sword in the hand; when to give a slanting blow, and where to make a down right stroke; whose actions are a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall web, whereof justice &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are the woof, and the warp. Leaving therefore your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, I come to them who come to these assizes, neither to do nor to suffer, but onely to heare and behold: when I compare this meeting in my text with ours at this time, I find a threefold cause
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45575:75"/>
for which wee ought to be hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thankfull to the God of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> first, that though there be many sinnes in our land, yet most of them are personall, not like this in my text, wherein a whole city to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether was jointly engaged. Should we have a murther gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally committed by a whole city, I am afraid, that the cable of that offence twisted with so many les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser cords of severall offendors, would be so tough and strong, it would almost make the sword of justice turn edge before it could cut through it. God daily diminish the sinnes of our land, that they may be fewer for number, lesser for measure, lighter for nature, and may our eyes live to see our churches more full, our prisons
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45575:75"/>
more emptie. Not to flatter our selves, we are a sinfull nation; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies amongst us are frequent, &amp; murther sometimes, (and were they never so seldome, they were too often (yet be it spoken to Gods glory, these be private sinnes, not city villainies as this of the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>: not but that we English men are as wild, and as untamed hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as ever the Iews were, but that God is pleased to hold us with a stronger bridle, &amp; curb of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining grace then he did them. Let him therefore have all the honour of the action.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we see the poor Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite was fain to send for justice abroad and about, from Dan to Beersheba with much care and cost: had the allowance of this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45575:76"/>
been no larger then the poor pittance of some curates and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars amongst us, this one charge would have exhausted his two yeares revenues: but let us thank God that justice is brought home to our doors. When I have seen with what tedious paces &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thighs poor people have pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully climed and clambred up the steep ascent to the town of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bury</hi> in this county, to bring water to the town; then have I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the conveniency of those cities, which seated in champion places have water at will; then have I praised the commoditie of those houses where turn the cock, and plenty flowes at pleasure: so when I consider the great trouble of the Levite in my text, to send
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45575:76"/>
about for justice, then have I just cause to praise God for the benefit of our itinerarie judges w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our cost, or procuring, bring justice home unto us. If any in this sence doth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, behold the cup is at his mouth, let him drink his fill.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the cause of all this mischeif is set down in the first verse, because there was no king in Israel; a tyrannie is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before an anarchy: for a commonwealth to want a chief, it is the chief of all wants, every man will do what he lists, none what he should. Too much liberty would make men slaves to their own lusts; <hi>Westminster</hi> hall would be turned unto the Gluttons kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a word, compared to this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45575:77"/>
confusion, that of Bable may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seem an exact modell of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. But (thanks be to God) our happinesse will appear the greater, if we consider the state of forreign countries, divided from us no less in condition, then by the sea; look upon high Germany which ever Prometheus like hath a cruell ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle feeding upon her entrailes: Is this the civil law, wherein nothing stands good but <hi>violenta passes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio,</hi> and <hi>firma ejectio?</hi> where souldiers keep Term all the year long, and scarce make a short vacation in the dead depth of winter? whilest thus the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent is drowned with woes, our happy island is dry; the waves rage round about us, but thanks be to God none
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45575:77"/>
runne over us; wee are more safe under our vines, then our neighbours in their castles.</p>
                  <p>Oh let us take heed that wee take not a surfet of our own happinesse, but be heartily thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, and expresse our thankfullnesse in the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our lives. But what go I about to do? this is none of Joshuas day wherein the sun stands still, time will wait at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on none; and I am pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to the undispenceablenesse of your occasions, wherefore the halfe of my text shall be the whole I will add at this time, <hi>consult, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, and give sentence.</hi>
