            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that is to ſaye, althoughe he woorke
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8629:14"/>
by Satan and by the wycked, &amp; vſeth
their iniquitye to execute hys Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes:
Yet he is not author of ſinne,
neyther doth ſynne pleaſe hym, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
he ſetteth before hym a iuſte

&amp; puniſheth righfully &amp; Iuſtly thoſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
he dryueth by hys ſecrete prouydence,
whether it ſeemeth good vnto hym.
Verely he hardeneth whom he wyll,
yet is there no vnryghteouſneſſe in
hym, for he doth nothyng but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which
is ryghteouſly done. And not only he
foreſeeth the ruyne of the wicked: but
alſo theyr fall is appoynted by hys
councell and will. As Salomon ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
<hi>Prouerb.</hi> 16. that not onely the
deſtruction of the vnryghteous and
proude was knowen before: but alſo
they were appoynted to perdition, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as God by hys bountye and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye
keepeth the faythfull, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not the deuill to haue power on
them, nor them to be ſuppreſſe wyth
ſynne. So alſo, he doth not only geue
ouer thoſe and denyes them his grace
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8629:15"/>
whom he wil puniſhe: but alſo he blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them and geueth them ouer into
a reprobate ſenſe, deliueryng them
to the power of the deuill. Shall we
then attribute vnto God any thyng
at all in euyll woorkes bycauſe that
if he denyed not hys grace, no man
ſhoulde bee geuen into a reproued
ſenſe? It is certayne that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
are geuen into a reprobate ſenſe
not only by the ſufferyng of God: but
it commeth to paſſe through hys iuſte
Iudgement, &amp; hys vpryght order that
the wycked are vexed by thys rage, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
through their own concupiſcence,
as by the force of the deuill. Yet we
muſt not lay any fault on God, for the
rootes of ſynne ar ſtil remayning in a
ſynner. Therfore, when we finde ſuch
ſentences in the Scripture, that God
hymſelf blyndeth or hardeneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart
of man, they aſſigne not the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vnto God, neyther do they make
hym author of euil, ſo as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fault ought
to bee imputed vnto him. It is ſayd
that God geues ouer the reprobate to
diuerſe deſyres, is thys to ſaye that he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8629:15"/>
depraueth or corrupteth their heart?
Not ſo, for the reaſon why the hart of
man is ſubiect to froward deſyres, is
foraſmuch as it was already corrupt
and faulty. Moreouer it is ſayd that
God blyndeth and hardeneth. May a
man ſay therfore that he is the author
or mynyſter of ſynne? God forbyd, but
rather by thys meanes he taketh ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
and punyſheth ſynnes, &amp; that
he doth Iuſtly wythout doyng them
wrong, in aſmuch as they haue refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

then that the ſpryng of ſynne is
not in God, neyther may the fault bee

man nothyng to haſt with God
endeuoryng to lay hys faultes and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences

and if he ſaue, it is of hys mere good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as alſo yf he condemne he hath
a iuſte cauſe to do it. He hath mercye
then on whom he will, and not on all,
he offereth hys grace to all, but all are
not made partakers of hys grace: but
yet hys bountye &amp; mercy is ſtretched

true that Ieſus Chriſte wythholdeth
as wel our handes from reuenge as
our heartes: but when any man with
out outrage and reuenge can defende
hymſelfe, and ſo keepe his goodes that
no man wrong hym, the woordes of

A man may caſtlye thinke that Chriſt

the choyſe, the glory, the agreementes,

Now that which is ſaied by <hi>Eſay</hi>
agreed with the circumſtance of the

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8629:24"/>

God ſhall not onely cauſe hys temple
to recouer the former magnificence:
but alſo that all nations ſhal aſſemble
ther and al the world ſhal agree in the
true religion. And til the time of chriſt
the temple was truly the place or houſe
of prayer, to wete, ſo long as the lawe
had force with her ſhadowes. And it be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gan
to be a houſe of praier vnto al na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
when the doctrine of the Goſpell

that was betwene the Iewes &amp;
the Gentiles is at the laſt taken away,
the entry into the houſe of God is open
to al men, of what country ſoeuer thei

it ſtretcheth through all the regions of

pray and to cal vpon the name of God
But when Chriſt ſayth, that when we

               </gap> the example of the Hipocrits

the Hipocrites are wont to pray in the

bicauſe they would be ſene of men.
They groſly and ſhamfully prophane
the name of God in that they praye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
or rather make ſhew of praying
bycauſe they would be prayſed of men.
Therefore he commaundeth thoſe that
be his to entre into their cloſets if they
wyl pray as they ought, and make ſuch
a praier as may be pleaſing vnto God.
It is true that we are commaunded in
ſondry places of the Scripture to pray
vnto God in the middeſt of a great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
and to geue hym thanckes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Chriſte tourne vs awaye from ſuche a

our good God receaueth all men vnto

a man hath commytted one fault or
many, he is fallen from the ſtate of a
Chriſten man, then how many ſinnes
there are, ſo many failes ther are, and
from this fal a man may be rayſed vp
by repentaunce through the grace &amp;
goodneſſe of God. But the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh not of thefte, of adulterye or
whoredome, of periurie, of ſlaughter,
or dronkenneſſe: but he noteth a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
tournyng backe or vniuerſall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſle
or fallyng from the Goſpell,
when the obſtinate ſynner offendeth

we muſt note y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> graces of God, which
are there rehearſed: For what may a

quencheth the lyght therof, that ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

whiche is one of the heauenly gyftes
ſhoulde not haue power to enter, and

<hi>and if I iudge my Iudgement is true.</hi> That

               </gap>e, that the father hath geuen all
iudgement to hys ſonne, that is, that
the father gouerneth all the worlde in

his iuriſdiction vnder the rule of him:
Not that the father as a priuate man
remayneth nowe idle in heauen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

manner of ſpeaking is not ſo much in
reſpect of God as of men. The father
chaunged not hys ſtate at all when he

earth: For being in hys ſonne he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in hym and by hym: But bycauſe
that when men wil clymbe vp to God

Therefore Ieſus Chriſt is ſet before

our eyes as the viſible Image of inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

thought that the ſame Helie that was

Iohn was not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light, that is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtode

Iohn the Baptiſte nor of any other

ryghtly y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he is not the light, to the end
hys bryghtneſſe bee it neuer ſo greate
dymme not the clereneſſe of the glory

y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Baptiſt that they made no accompt

            <p>Nowe as touchyng the other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
it is alſo true that Iohn y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſte
was a burnyng and ſhynyng

that they be lyghtes to the Lorde,

and the reaſon is bicauſe they ar ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
by hys ſpirite. And they haue
their eyes open not only for them ſelf:
but alſo to direct and guyde other into
the way of ſaluation. The Apoſtles
alſo haue caried the torche of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

Although therfore the faythfull be dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

he bryngeth thys yong man in, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue

Chriſt wil haue hym mount hygher,
to heare this holy doctryne as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
mouth of the liuyng God, and not of a

It is no maruel then y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Chriſt
ſendes thys yong man to God to the

Yet there is no inconuenience

Then he is apointed gouernor, iudge,

               </gap>yd that he was appoynted Kyng

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8629:40"/>
warning them not to loke vpon that
which they could do of themſelf: but to
leane vpon his ſtrengthe and inumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
power. The maner of this preſence
which the Lord promiſeth to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
muſt be vnderſtode ſpiritually: for
it is not nedeful that he ſhould not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
downe from heauen to ſuccour vs ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he can help vs by the grace of hys
holy ſpirite, ſtretching forth his hande
to vs from the higheſt of the heauens.
As touching hys humayne nature it
is certaine that there is an infinite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce
betweene hym and vs. But he
not onely ſpreads the efficacy of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite
through al the worlde: but alſo he
dwelleth truely in vs. Moreouer thys
promiſſe is not made only to the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels:
for it reacheth euen to the end of
the world. Very true it is that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſeth
hys ayde, chyefly to hys mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
whyche for that they are weake
and needy in euery condition, coulde
not execute the leſt part of their office.
Seing then their charge is as trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and harde as it is healthful, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
they haue more neede than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8629:40"/>
of the aſſiſtance of oure Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,

vs by playne experience, that

though Sathan lay many lettes in the
way. But generally al the faythfull ar
partakers of thys promiſſe, to the ende
no man ſhuld be diſcoraged as though
he were forſaken.</p>
            <p>Let vs then make thys concluſion
that although Chriſt be departed into
heauen, yet he is not ſo departed butte
that hee euer is and wil bee to the ende
with vs. He hath taken away the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of hys body from our ſight: but
he leaueth not the whyleſt to aſſiſt hys
faythfull which muſte yet liue in thys
worlde, but hee gouerneth the worlde
wyth a more preſente ſtrength. Thys
promyſſe of hys continuall aſſiſtaunce
was accomplyſhed by hys aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, in
which as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> body of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n of god was lif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted

and efficacy is ſpred beyond al the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
of heauen and of earthe. So then
theſe two things may wel be ſaid, that
the ſonne of God is no more amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs,
and yet he is among vs, and ſhal be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vntil the ende of the worlde. He is
here no more according to the preſence

any gayn ſaying, and not ſeeke to dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
hym in any ſorte. Lyke as they
know that ther is nothing better than
that which God wylles: ſo they do rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
obey hym. And this is the cauſe
why they abide ſtil and are not ſubiect
to chaunge and corruption, and why
they haue quietnes and continual hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.
To weete, bicauſe they are in
al and altogether agreeing to the wyl
of God. Seeing then there is nothyng
in them that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtandeth the holye and
good wyl of God, nothing that turnes
them awaye from his holye decrees,
nothing that can be deſired or wyſhed

            <p>Syth it is ſo that the Angelles of
heauen ſynce their creation haue euer
in al things and altogether yelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God true obedience, &amp; by that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
there hath neuer bene ſtrife or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
betwene him and them, how com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth
it to paſſe that they had neede to
be reconciled? For in the fyrſt Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Colloſſians mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8629:42"/>
not onely of men which are meant by
the things which be on earth: but alſo
of Angelles which are meant by thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that are in heauen. If hereupon a
man woulde ſay that the Angels haue
bene ſette at one with men, and ſo the
heauenly creatures are at one againe
with earthly things. This is not that
which Saint Paul meaneth here: for
he ſayth expreſſely that God hath reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to himſelf. The maner of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
reconciling to God is this, that before
while they were eſtraunged from hym
by ſinne, they ſhould haue felte him to
be a Iudge to their ruine and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
if the grace of the Mediatoure
had not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me betweene to appeaſe hys
angre. So the attonemente made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
God and men, is that the hatred
and ſtrifes were taken away by Ieſus
Chriſt our Lord, and ſo god of a Iudge
was made a Father. Betweene God
and the Angels there is another reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for in thys caſe ther was no offence or
ſtarting backe, and therfore ther was
no ſeparation or alienating: yet ther is
two reaſons why the Angels ſhould be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8629:42"/>
attoned with God. For ſince they be
creatures they wer not out of danger
of ſtumbling, but that they wer ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thed
by the grace of our Lorde Ieſus.
This now helpeth greatelye to make
continual peace with God, to wete, to
tarry in one ſteady ſtate of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſo that ther be no feare of falling
or reuolting, or otherwyſe dooing ſo
that they might be eſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged from god.
Moreouer in this ſame obedience whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſo exquiſite or ſo perfit a
perfitneſſe as may thorowly and in al

bicauſe that hauing in himſelf fulneſſe

So hee woulde not haue life to be as it

for this cauſe he hath yelded it ouer vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to

the body waxeth weake and dryeth vp

hunger. When we ſeeke the matter of
lyfe in the fleſhe of Ieſus Chriſt, then
we finde life in hym. So the glory and
excellency of the children of God, is in
Chriſt crucified: for that as ſone as we
turne vs back from the ſacrifice of hys
death, we can finde nothing but death,
and there is no other meane by which
the faythful are brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

head and authour of life, we muſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
hym as the ſeruaunt of hys Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For we are made rich in all ſorte

bowe in token of glorye and victorye.
But now Chriſt hymſelf ſayeth of hys
fleſh that it profiteth nothyng. Yet in ſo
ſpeakyng bee doothe not exclude alyke
all profyte of the fleſhe, as thoughe
there were no profyte to be taken of it.
Hee ſayeth it profiteth nothing when
it is parted from the ſpirite. Whence
proceedeth it that it geueth lyfe but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuche

that ſtycke at the earthy nature of hys

wee ſhall there fynde effectuouſly and

is verelye meate, and yet for al that
it profyteth nothinge. It is meate
bycauſe wee gette lyfe by it, bycauſe
that in it God hath bene reconcyled

It profiteth nothing if it be conſidered

For the ſede of Abraham whiche

thys that he wil caſt of none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<hi>All that my father gaue me, &amp;c.</hi> Where

or at al aduentures. But God choſeth
his faythful to geue them to hys ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne,
euen as it were from hande to hand.
For when he ſayeth that al that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

wel ſay alſo that God worketh in hys

that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may runne or wil or beſtowe

for refuſyng the Goſpell, it is by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,

As much may a man ſay of the

Yet the vnthankefulneſſe of many

whiche he wrought, to the end by
that meane they myghte be moued to
beleue hym. Thys then is not ſymply
to ſay that he can do nothyng of hym
ſelf, for he is God eternal &amp; almyghty.
And thys belongeth not perticularly
to the euerlaſtyng worde: but to the
ſonne of God, in aſmuche as he was
manyfeſted in the fleſhe. Such is thys
manner of ſpeakyng when he ſayeth
<hi>Ioan.</hi> 14. The worde which you heare is
not myne, but hys that ſent me. It is
wel knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he is the eternal wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God hys father which made
all the Prophetes &amp; Apoſtles, &amp; other

But this he ſayth to lifte men vp vnto

as it deſerued, excepte they had bene

to weete, that they that thynke
they haue to doe with a mortall man

therfore he affirmeth earneſtly that he
hath done nothyng in the healyng of
thys man that is diuerſe or contrary
to hys fathers will.</p>
            <p>And by the other ſentence, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that men haue no power on him
to take hys lyfe from hym, but that he

but beyng alſo willing to obey

that men cannot put him to death
but in as muche as he ſuffereth them:
but alſo he exempteth him ſelf from al
force of neceſſitye. But it ſtandeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that the faythful ſleepe and God
watcheth for their ſaluation, and ſo he
preuenteth their deſires and prayers.
For we wer more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miſerable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
our great dulneſſe if God ſhuld
tary tyl we open our mouthes to pray
to hym. But to ſpeake better, there is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8629:54"/>
nothing but his owne goodneſſe that
ſtirreth him to geue vs faith which go-before
al prayers both in tyme and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre.
Yet bicauſe he ſpeaketh theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
onely to his faithful he ſheweth vs
ſimply how the heauenly Father wyll
make vs partakers of his benefites.
Although he hee geue vs al thynges fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye:
yet to exerciſe oure fayth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
vs to pray to hym, to the end
hee maye graunte to our prayers that
which notwithſtanding flowes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his

            <p>But bycauſe fayth only is that which
obtayneth and goeth not beyonde the
boundes of Gods will which is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by hys word. Saint Iames ſayth
here very well, <hi>You aſke but receaue not.</hi>
and hee addeth to it the cauſe, for that
you aſke it to the ende to beſtow it on
your deſires and pleaſures. Is it reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that men ſhal make God the ſeruant
of their pleaſures and fonde deſires?
when they temper not their deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the maner that God hath ordained
but with an inordinate libertye geue
them ſelfe the bridle to aſke thinges
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8629:54"/>
which they ſhould be aſhamed to aſke
or to open before a man who ſoeuer he
were. It is good reaſon that they ſhuld
be denied. Certaynly ther is no feare
nor reuerence nor good opinion of god
among vs when we are ſo hardy and
raſhe to aſke of God things which our
owne conſcience would not grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vs.
Then before we ſhal obtayne we muſt
bridle our deſires. The way to brydle
them is to make them obediente and
ſubiect to God. To conclude wee ſhall
obtayne when Fayth whych is ruled
by the holy and good wyl of God ſhall
frame our harts. We ſhal not obtaine
when we aſke according to our deſires
neyther ſhould it be expedient for vs to

AL thinges that were expedient for

If the Lord Ieſus be Chriſt he

ſhould differ no whit from the olde

and it muſt not be offered againe, nor

Of their ſtrength and conſtancy haue
bene taken examples of patience, not

alſo were particular, and there is not

Saint Paul would ſay that any thing
that belonged to oure ſaluation lacked
in the paſſion of chriſt which had nede
after to bee accompliſhed and ſupplied
by the death of any other, as if that
which Ieſu Chriſt ſuffred ſufficed not

muſt be made perfect by the affliction
of the faythfull when the members of
the body are made lyke vnto their hed.
Let vs then ſee how the holy martyrs
ſuffre for the Churche. Thoſe that god
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8629:56"/>

of hys ſonne, that he may be the fyrſt
borne of many brethren. Wee knowe
that betwene the hed and the members
there is ſuche vnity, that the name of
Chriſt containeth ſomtime al the bodi.
As when Saint Paull maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. of the Church, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
at the lengthe that it is wyth Ieſu

ſo hee ſuffereth dayly in hys mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
And in thys ſorte the paſſions are
accompliſhed whych the heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath appoynted by hys ordinance
vnto the body of hys ſonn.</p>
            <p>Moreouer wee muſte not ſeeke
another more faythfull expounder of
that whyche Sainct Paul ſayeth than
hym ſelfe whenne hee addeth to it that
hee ſuffereth for the Church according
to the dyſpenſation or commiſſion that
was geuen vnto hym. For he was not
appoynted to bee a miniſter of redemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,
neyther dydde hee ſheadde hys

bloud to deliuer the faythfull fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
death. But we know the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
was committed to hym to edyfye
the Church and not to redeme it. And
this is it that he ſaith in another place
that he ſuffreth al thinges for the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens
ſake, that they might obtayne the
ſaluation which is in Ieſus Chriſt. And
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. he ſaith that he ſuffreth al thing
for their comfort and ſaluation. Then
let vs take thys for the concluſion, that
the ſonne of God only hath ſuffred for

Preach the Goſpel to al creatures
that wer able to heare and receiue
it, and that without accepting of anye
perſon, people, or nation, foraſmuchas
the Lord Ieſus was com to take away

He wyl haue his kingdom pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
euery where that the Gentiles
with the Iewes may be brought to the
true obedience of Fayth, and that the
Goſpell may bee a ſeale to all faithfull
ſhepheardes and miniſters wherwyth
their doctrine ſhould be ſealed. Vnder
the Lawe the Prophetes had limittes
appoynted them within the bounds of
Iury: but after that the fence was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the ſonne of God woulde that the
miniſters of hys Goſpel ſhould go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of to ſowe and ſpread the doctrine
of ſaluation throughout al the regions
of the world. Fyrſt the birthright abod
among the Iewes: yet afterward the
heritage of the happy life was made
common to the Gentiles. So the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
was accompliſhed of which the
Prophets make ſo often mention that
the Meſſias was geuen to the Gentils
for a light, to the ende he might be the

ſaluation of God euen to the endes of
the earth. To thys purpoſe hee ſayed,
<hi>Goe and preache the Goſpell to euery creature.</hi>
For after that peace was proclaymed
to all the houſeholde folke, the ſame
meſſage came alſo vnto ſtraungers,
and to thoſe that were farre of. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that charge were geuen to the
Apoſtels: yet it behoued them alſo to
keepe thys decree, and euen at thys
day it behoueth all miniſters to keepe
it, to weete, that they geue not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
thinges to dogges and that they
hurle not pearle before Swyne. The
treaſure of the heauenlye wyſedome
oughte to bee kepte for Goddes chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

abroade to the proude contemners of
God. They haue commaundement
to preache the Goſpell to euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Sayncte Paule affirmeth
that the preachyng thereof is a ſauour
of Death to the reprobate. And there
is nothyng more certayne than that it
is offered euery day to the vnbeleuing

of God as a wytneſſe agaynſte them,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8629:58"/>
to make them the more wyth oute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.
Bycauſe the miniſters or the
Goſpell and all they that are called to
the office of teaching can not diſcerne
betwene the children of God &amp; Swine.
Therefore theyre charge is to offre the
doctrine of Saluation indifferently to
all. For thoughe at the fyrſt they ſee
many ſelfe wylled ſtubbourne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apte

wil not ſuffer vs to accompt them

in the meane ſeaſon we muſte ſee who
they bee that Chriſt calleth doggs and
Swyne. We muſte not at the firſt
take all thoſe for ſuche that are eyther
prophane or vncleane or that are voyd
of the feare of God and of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But thoſe that by ſure and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſte

to the poſſeſſion of eternall ſaluation
whych he maketh partakers of his goſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel.

thys ſerueth nothyng for the expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng

what Sainte Paul meaneth, to
wete that there is no eſtate in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world
ſhut out from ſaluation, and from the
bleſſed life: but rather God would that
the Goſpel ſhould be offred to all. And
if we vnderſtand that the preaching of
the Goſpel is quickening, in that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueleth
to vs the righteouſneſſe of God
which is a certaine way to geue an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

ſtraunge which ſainct Paul ſayth that
Gods will is that al men ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
ſeing he wold haue all come to the
knowledge of the truth. But heere he
ſpeaketh of ſorts of men, of eſtats and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8629:60"/>
conditions of them, and not of euery
man a parte. For the intent of the
Apoſtle is none other but to contayne
Princes in the number, and that men
ſhuld not conſidre what maner of men
Princes were at that tyme: but what
God woulde haue them to be. Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
commeth to vs no otherwyſe but
by Gods free liberalitye. Nowe the

may ſomtimes ſtretch his grace

            <p>But the whileſt how many are ther
that by their vnthankfulneſſe and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bourneſſe
make themſelfe vnworthye
of thys ſaluation? What coulde God
haue done of all that whiche belonged
to the ſaluation of men whiche he hath
not done? And behold the greater part
ſtoutly and proudly reiect the grace of
God. Is not thys agreable to Goddes
righteouſneſſe that ſuche ſhoulde feele

If wee compare the greate nomber of

true thys ſentence is that there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

many Mahometes are heere beneath

The Apoſtle ſignifieth two thinges by
this former ſentence. Firſt that there
is nothing in man whereby he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to be preferred before other beſide
the meere grace and goodneſſe of god.
Wherfore they that already haue ſom
hope of ſaluation muſt not diſpayre of
other: for whatſoeuer they are nowe
they haue bene heretofore as all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
now are. If by the onely mercy
and goodneſſe of God they are come
out of vnbeleefe they oughte lykewyſe
to leaue ſome place to others. Yet thys
is not to ſaye that God ſo blindeth all
men that their vnbeleefe oughte to bee
imputed vnto hym: but he by hys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
ſo ordred the matter that all
ſhould be gylty of incredulity to thend
he might kepe al men ſhort and bound
vnder his iudgementes, and that is to
the end that ſaluation might come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hys onely goodneſſe and all deſertes

that God in the diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hys

mercy on all. That is to ſay, to the end
that none of thoſe which ſhalbe called
to ſaluation ſhould thynke to obtayne
ſaluation but only through the mercy
of God.</p>
            <p>Then ſeing it is ſo that God in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
hys grace, is not let from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng

            <p>WHEN the Lorde Ieſus ſayeth
iudge not, he doth not preciſely
forbyd to iudge: but his meaning
is to heale a ſickeneſſe whiche is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
almoſt in al This we ſee ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
that euery man geues him y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> head
but euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> buſyeth himſelf to iudge
other men ſtreight. And hardly ſhall a
man finde any one that is not tyckled
with deſyre to enquyre of other mens
faultes. Al wil confeſſe that it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable
euil to ſlatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelf in their
own vyces, and to be ſo nere markers
of the offences of their brethren. But
there is a plage yet more daungerous
that diuerſe whyle they condemne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
themſelf wil haue leaue to ſynne.
See then what our Lorde Ieſus doth
in ſaying <hi>Iudge not,</hi> to wete, he repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the fleſhe and froward appetyte of
checking, tawntyng and backbyting:
yet is it not ment hereby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſhould haue their eyes blynd filded
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8629:62"/>
to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> end they ſhould diſcerne nothing:
but they oughte to brydle themſelues
leaſt they ſhould be caryed away with
to great a deſyre to iudge. For when
any one coueteth to iudge his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
he cannot but be ouer rigorous. Thus
when Chriſt commaundeth that wee
ſhoulde not Iudge, he meaneth that
we ſhoulde not curiouſly enquyre of
the doynages of oure brethren. But
in the meane ſeaſon he wil not haue
vs to be without iudgement or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in ſuche ſort as we ſhould not bee
able to put a dyfference beetwene the
good and the euill or to ſaye what is
iuſte and ryghte, and what is wrong:
but he woulde there ſhoulde be a wiſe
moderation vſed, and that to iudge
well and ryghtly a man ſhoulde loke
ſimplye to the dede, and not to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
It behoueth vs to marke whye
the Lorde Ieſus ſpake thus. He had
to do with the Iewes which dyd inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete
hys workes maliciouſlie &amp; with
a peruerſe affection though they were
forced to graunt that they wer diuine.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8629:63"/>
He ſetteth before their eyes circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to whiche they beare reuerence &amp;
that of ryght. When they dyd it on the
Sabboth day they knewe wel that the
lawe of God was not broken, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the workes of God agree ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wel one with another. What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is there that they dyd not ſaye aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
of the workes of Chriſt but that
their ſpirites were occupied beefore
with a folyſhe iudgement which they

one wrong by another wronge,

what is it els but to ſet on fier y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which

peace and the Goſpell is preached. And
beſides it is much leſſe agreing wyth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

Prophets make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is only amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
the true ſeruauntes and the faithful of
God, and in Godly conſciences, in as

reacheth not vnto the vnbeleuing and
ſtubborne, though it be liberally offred
vnto them, and they can not abyde to
enter in fauor and couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with god.
And thereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes it that the meſſage
of peace rayſeth in them troubles and
greater ſtormes than before. For Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than

the doctrine of the ſonne of God is ſet

men cauſeth that Chriſte which is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour

ſo many times promiſeth hier and

we are ſo ſubiecte to the rule of God y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
we owe to hym both our ſelf and all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

any other way but of the meere

that by mutuall relation ioyne the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert

bycauſe that God is not moued by the
worthineſſe of the workes to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
them: but by his gentleneſſe and free
goodneſſe. True it is that by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines

but it is on that conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
al that is there required of them.
But bicauſe this bonde is voluntary it
is certayne and ſure that man can aſk
or require nothing of God as thoughe
he had deſerued any thing at his hand
By thys meanes the pryde of the fleſh
falleth downe flat on the ground. For

although a man had fulfilled the lawe:
yet he could not bring in any reckoni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g

him ſome ouerplus, for he ſhuld on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
haue paied that which he ought. And
in this ſenſe it is ſayd that we be vnpro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable
ſeruaunts, for God receaueth
nothing of vs that commeth from elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
but onely he gathereth vp the

            <p>Now the Apoſtles vaunt that they
haue left al and followed Chriſt. But
what was that all? for ſeeing they wer

It was then a vayne boaſte, as we ſee

a folly to gather of theſe words that it

to learne to make our ſelf meete for

it were a glaſſe before oure eyes in the

if a man wyll gather hereof that

hym ſelfe to bee fourmed to geue
obedience vnto God. Although it haue

            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:8629:75"/>
There is a like commaundement eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
where in the holy Scriptures. Wee
ſee cleerly heereby that we be called to
holines. Ther is a difference betwene
the calling and the office of Chriſtians
and betwene their faculty and power.
It is certaine that the faythful are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to purge themſelf: but God wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth
ſufficiently that it is hys office
to purge when hee promiſeth to ſende
pure and cleane waters, to the end wee
may be made cleane. And therfore we
muſt deſire of God that he will purge
vs of our filthines rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to proue
our owne ſtrength without hys ayde.
Now hereof we will take this doctrine
that ther is no goodneſſe in men whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

For if we forge imaginations

is to the end a man ſhoulde not thynke
that thys benefyte is reſtrayned to a
fewe people onely, or to certayne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
A man maye replye, howe
maye thys bee that the ſynnes of all
the worlde are blotted oure. There
at certayne frentrycke ſpyrites which
vnder thys coloure receaue al the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
to ſaluation, yea the deuyl
hymſelfe. But wee oughte not to
tarye aboute the refutyng of thys
monſtruous opynion. If a man
ſaye that Ieſu Chriſt hath ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
ſuffered for the faultes of all the
worlde but that hys death hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyted
the faythfull onely thys is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
but it is not all. For here is
another meanyng in the woordes of
Sainte Iohn, that is to ſaye, that thys
benefite is beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to the whole
Church, and therfore the reprobate ar
excluded. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayth of al the world
it is ſpoken of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſhoulde beleue,
and whiche were ſcattered in diuerſe
countreyes of the world. For then we

the grace of Ieſu Chriſt is when it is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8629:79"/>
tolde vs that it is the only ſaluation of
all the worlde.</p>
            <p>As touchyng y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other ſentence wher
Chriſt ſayth that he prayeth not for the
worlde, thys worde world is taken in
another meanyng, to wete, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.
And therein he ſheweth open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he will aſke nothyng whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
not with the good pleaſure of
his father. He reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth vnto him
thoſe onely which hys father loueth of
hys owne good will. For he ſayeth he
prayeth not for thoſe that are cutte of
from the kingdome of God, bycauſe he
hath not care but onely for hys owne
ſhepe which he had receaued at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hand
of hys father. A man will ſaye that
here is an abſurditie, for the beſte rule
we haue to make our prayers by, is to
folow Ieſu Chriſt and to haue him for
our Maſter and leader. Then we are
appoynted to praye for all generally,
moreouer the Sonne of God himſelfe
prayed afterward indifferently for all
ſaying, forgeue them, for they knowe
not what they do. Very true it is that
we muſt praye for all men: Yet for all
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8629:79"/>
that ſuch prayers ar reſtrayned to the
faythfull and choſen onely. We ought
to deſyre that thys man and that man,
and euery man myght be ſaued and ſo
to comprehend all mankynde bycauſe
we cannot yet dyſcerne the faythfull
from the reprobate. In the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
nowithſtanding when we deſyre y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyngdome of God ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, we

haue one nature co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with vs. And
we leaue to the Iudgement of God the
deſtruction of thoſe which he knoweth
to be reprobates. But as touching our
Lorde Ieſu Chriſt, there is another
manner of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be alledged. Fayth
and loue make hym to pray ſo: but this
is not all, he mounteth aboue all men,
he entreth into the inner chamber of
the heauens where he goeth euen vnto
the ſecretes of hys father, and hauyng
preſentlye before hys eyes hys fathers
hidden iudgementes, he knoweth wel
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:8629:80"/>
for whom he ſhould pray, deſyryng no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
that is agaynſt the will of hym,
nor makyng any prayer or requeſt for
thoſe that are caſte backe from him, he
is the propitiation for the ſynnes of

vnprofitable, he ſheweth euidently y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
he ſpeaketh in reſpecte of ceremonyes
foraſmuch as he addeth thereunto the
offyce of ſacrifycing. The ceremonyes
had no certayntie in themſelfe, and of
themſelfe they helpe not a whyt to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:
for as touchyng that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

ſacrifyces, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by them ſynnes ſhuld

it proceded from another thyng. For
euen as all ceremonyes were referred

they coulde nothyng of themſelfe and
dyd nothyng: but all their vertue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended

Seyng then the Iewes aledge them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt

But what? are they ſeperated from

of which he ſpeaketh. To
be ſhort, a man ſhal fynde no commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
in olde ceremonies til he be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me
to Chriſt. Let vs ſaye then, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lawe
is called vnprofitable when it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Chriſt, of thys ſorte is the takyng
awaye of the fyrſt commaundemente.
The fyrſt lawes and ordinaunces are
aboliſhed by the latter. The lawe had
bene publyſhed long beefore Dauyd.
Then he rayned whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he brought forth
thys Prophecye of the creatyng of a

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8629:82"/>
abolyſheth the fyrſt. Nowe ſeyng the
fyrſt is aboliſhed by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> latter that came

came after, dyd abolyſhe the lawe that

the lawe is not made vayne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
by fayth: but rather it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmed
and eſtablyſhed, that as often
as the lawe is ſet agaynſt fayth, the
fleſhly ſenſe taketh holde byandby of
an opinion of repugnaunce, as though
one were contrary to the other. Nowe
thys peruerſe imagination hath place
chieflye among thoſe, that hauyng no
ryght vnderſtandyng of the lawe, like
nothyng ells in it but the ryghteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of woorkes, and leaue the promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
And thys was ſayd in reproche to

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law by his preaching. This made
him to proteſt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he came not to aboliſhe

belonged as wel to maners as to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.
For ſeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel maketh
an end of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ceremonyes of Moyſes, it
was thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it went about to deſtroy
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:8629:83"/>
or ouerthrow the miniſtery of Moyſes.
Beſyde, foraſmuche as it bryngeth to
naught all righteouſneſſe of workes, it
is thought lykewyſe that it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye
to ſo many wytneſſes of the lawe
where God affyrmeth that in the lawe

               </gap>
but to al the lawe generally. For firſt,

requireth, fyrſt in the miniſters of his

hys faythfull But when Saint Paule
ſayth that to be truly wyſe we muſt be
made fooles in thys world, he ſpeaketh
agaynſt the folyſhe preſumption of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that will be wyſe in their own conceit.
He exhorteth vs not to diſceaue oure
ſelues by a falſe opinion, attributyng
vnto our ſelf any wiſedome. For in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dede al they which leane vpon their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:8629:85"/>

ſpoken chiefly againſt thoſe which are
not content with the ſimpleneſſe of the
Goſpel, not that it is requiſite we ſhuld
altogether refuſe the wyſdom which is
geuen vs of nature, or that whych we
haue gotten by long vſe and knowlege
of things: but onely that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it to the true obedience of God, to
the ende we ſhould not be wyſe but by
his word. For to be made a fole in this
worlde, is to deſyre to geue place to the
wyl of God, and to receaue wyth feare
and reuerence all that he teacheth vs,
rather than to folow that which to our
ſelf ſemeth good and alowable.</p>
            <p>To the ende then thoſe two places
may be wel agreed, we muſte make a
diſtinction betweene the true wyſdome
and the falſe. The falſe wyſedome and
that whych diſceaueth vs, is when we
content vs wyth our ſelf as touchyng
the takyng of counſell in our buſineſſe
eyther to gouerne our ſelfe, or to take
ordre for that we haue to do, when wee
depend not of any other, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue
not neede of the guydyng of another,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:8629:86"/>
but when we think we are able inough

our eyes ſhutte, we ſuffer God to
gouerne vs. And when diſtruſting our
ſelf we reſte vpon hym ſetting all oure
wiſdome in him, yelding our ſelf eaſy
to be taught and altogether obedient.
Thus our wiſdom muſt turn to ſmok,
to the end the will of God may raygne
ouer vs, that we be voyde of our owne
wyſedome that wee may be filled with
the wiſdom of God.</p>

In the other ſentence our Lord Ieſus
ſheweth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what reuerence we ought
to receiue the doctrine of God. Out of
what mouth ſoeuer it proceedeth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth
vs to hearken to it and obey it.
Thoughe the Scribes and Phariſies
were ill liuers and that a man ſhoulde
in no wiſe follow their lyfe: yet muſte
he frame his manners and lyfe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the rule of the lawe, whiche is
hard at their mouthe. It was neceſſary
for him to reproue many faults in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to the end al the people ſhould not bee
infected with them. They were miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the doctrine, but to the end the
doctrin ſhuldnot be corrupted through
theire faultes, the Lord Ieſus willeth
the faithful to bee diligente hearers of
their words and not followers of their
workes.</p>
            <p>But now we muſt ſee whether with
out making any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought
to obey al that which the Doctors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and gloſes, and did lode
the poore ſoules with vniuſt lawes and

Sonn of God will haue their doctrine
kepte as though a man ſhuld not reſiſt
their tyranny at al. But it is very eaſy
to reſolue this doubt: for the meaninge
of Chriſte was to make difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
the holy lawe of God and theire

THE difficulty ſhal be eaſyly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall vnderſtand that

be gathered together in one flock. And
in the ſecond it is ſhewed that at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> laſte
the ſheepe ſhall bee ſeparated from the
Goates where nowe they are myngled
one wyth another. As touching y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> firſt,
euen as wee beleeue and confeſſe that
there is one holy vniuerſal Chyrch: ſo
it neceſſarily behoueth that ther ſhould
be a body of one onely heade. There is
one God ſayth ſaint Paul, ther is one
fayth, ther is one baptiſme, ſo we muſt
be one as alſo we be called to one ſelfe
hope: ſo it is ſayd <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. Now albeit it
ſeme to be deuyded into many flockes:
yet the faythful which are ſcatred here
and there through al the world, ar ſhut
within one park and cloſed within one
hedge and cloſure, for one ſelf worde is
preached to al, they vſe al lyke ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes,
they haue al one ſelfe rule of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
to God, they haue al in one maner
that whych is requiſite for the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theyr fayth. Nowe the meane by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:8629:89"/>
whych al the flocke of God is gathered
together, is when there is but one ſhep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>heard
for all, and when hys voyce one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is heard, when the Churche is made
ſubiect to Chriſt onely and obeyeth his
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement and heareth his voyce
and his doctrin then is it in good ſtate.
But when the Lord Ieſus is dumme,
when his maieſty is troden vnder fote
when hys holy ordinances are ſet forth
to be mocked at and contemned, what
can a man ſaye of that goodly vnitye,
but that it is a diuiliſh Sinagoge or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy,
worſe and more execrable with

Chriſt raygneth, there is no knowlege
of God but wher the honor of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde
is geuen vnto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But the other ſentence ſheweth that
al the diſorders that are thys day in the

ordre. There are Hypocrites mired w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            <p>The ſtate of this Kingdome ſhall be

not to ſay that he left his workes ſo as
he hath no more care of them, as if a
maſter Maſon or Carpenter hauing
finiſhed the building of his houſe ſhuld
leaue it to him that could ocupy it, not
caring any more for it, or as a ſhippe-wright
afterthat he hath finiſhed a veſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſel
ſhould geue it ouer to the waues of
the ſea not caring what ſhoulde betide
of it. So the reſte or Sabat of God is
not a ſluggiſhneſſe or idleneſſe, but a
ſound perfection which bringeth with
it a quiet ſtate of reſt. God then reſted
from al his workes, that is to ſaye hee
ceaſſed from creating of new kindes of
any thing. There was ſo ſounde a
perfection that nothing coulde bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Wherfore it is ſaid that God hath
ſet to the laſt hand. And that which is
recited by Moiſes is aſmuche as if hee
had ſaid, that which God was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to do was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fulfilled. To be ſhort
this is ſpoken onely to ſhewe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſſe
of the building of the worlde,
ſo that heere of a manne coulde notte
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:8629:91"/>
gather that God ſo reſted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
that he hath left them of ſeing they
haue no vertue or force nor ſubſtance
but in hym. In the meane tyme it is
certayne that God worketh and is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
continualy in that he vpholdeth
the world by hys power, that he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
it by hys prouidence, that he main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taines
al creaturs in their being, and
alſo multiplies them. Thereby a man
may ſee how true thys ſentence of the
Sonne is, <hi>My Father worketh from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng
euen tyll now:</hi> for if God neuer ſo
litle wythdrawe hys hand, all thinges
ſhal peryſh in a momente, and ſhall be
ſtrayghtways brought to naught, as it
is ſayd in the. 104. Pſalme. Beſydes a
man could not well know that God is
the creatour and faſhioner of heauen
and earth except this be attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hym that he geueth ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and quic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kening
to al things, that he ſuſtaineth
the world by hys hygh vertue, that he
gouerneth it by his hyghe councel and
mayntayneth it by his goodneſſe and

pleaſure, as well beneath here in earth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8629:91"/>

For the reaſon why God iuſtifyeth vs

we fayle in kepyng it. Wherfore al the

            <p>But to accorde thys ſentence with
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:8629:96"/>
the fyrſte, it behoueth to loke vpon the

the lawe was written in tables of ſtone.</hi> Then
it was but a doctryne of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> letter. Thys

the Goſpel by which men are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

the law is to ſet forth the ſickneſſe, but
not to ſhewe what remedy a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might
haue to heale it. But the offyce of the

Saint Paule whoe had to doe with the

not only vnprofitable: but alſo it bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

for a man to renounce hymſelf: but
rather ſeyng the lawe is ſpiritual (as
Saint Paule ſaith) &amp; of our part we ar
nothyng but fleſhe, ther muſt nedes be
a great difference beetwene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe of
God and vs. And where Saint Peter
ſayeth it is a yoke whiche not oure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were able to beare, he ſpeaketh
not of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> onely which men haue accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
but alſo of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which they myght
haue done. Neyther ſpeaketh he of any
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon perſons but of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy fathers:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8629:99"/>
ſeth he ſayth that ſuch coulde not beare
the yoke of the lawe, it appeareth that
it is impoſſible for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beare it. Here
he medleth not only with the woorkes
and will of men, but alſo with theyr
power &amp; abilitye. With this alſo Saint
Paule agreeth affyrmyng that it was
impoſſible for the lawe to geue vs life,
bicauſe it was weake through y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fleſhe.
If any man can performe the lawe,
certaynly he ſhall fynde in it the lyfe
whiche was promyſed in it. But when
Saint Paule ſayth that lyfe cannot be
attayned by the lawe a man may well
conclude that in it is requyred a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
ſo hygh and perfect as man
can not accomplyſhe. If a man looke
vpon nothyng ells but the ſtrength of
mans nature not only he ſhall not bee
ſtrong ynough to beare the yoke of the
law: but alſo he ſhal be vnable to moue
hys little fynger to fulfyll the leaſt iote
of it. Theſe ſentences are very certayn
and true, that al the thoughts of mans
vnderſtandyng are peruerſe euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
chyldehode, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> al the ſenſes of the fleſhe
are enemies to God, that there is none
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:8629:99"/>
that ſeketh God, and many other lyke
which ar often found in the ſcriptures
A man then may conclude that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mans abilitye is weake and vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
touchyng the fulfylling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe:
but alſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he hath no ſtrength or power
at al to accompliſhe it. What is then to
be vnderſtode of Saint Iohns wordes
who ſayth that the commaundements
of God are not heauy? This is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
that the hardneſſe procedeth not
at al from the lawe: but from the fault
of our fleſhe. Thys is that whiche was
alledged by Saint Paule, whoe after
he had ſayd it was not poſſible for the
lawe to iuſtifye vs, byandby after lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the fault on our fleſhe. Saint Paul
in theſe ſentences which haue ben here
aboue alledged compareth the lawe
with the faultie nature of man. Dauid
in other places which ſeme to bee very
contrary to the fyrſt ſheweth how they
are mynded and affectioned which are
regenerate by the holy ghoſt, thei take
great pleaſure in it. And in dede Saint
Iohn reſtraynes thys ſentence to the
children of God, ſaying that thys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8629:100"/>
of the power of the holy ghoſt,
that it is no grefe to the faythfull to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
God.</p>
            <p>Yet hereunto a man may reply that
althoughe the faythfull are gouerned
and regenerate by the ſpirite of God,
yet haue they a harde fyght to ſuſtayne
agaynſt their own fleſhe. And let them
enforce themſelues the moſt they can,
yet ſcarcely ſhal they do halfe their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye.
And beſyde there is thys withal,
that they are oftentime ſhaken, and ar
ready almoſte to fall downe vnder the
burden. We ſee whereabout Saint
Paule that greate and excellent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
went. He complayneth that he was
kepte captyne, &amp; mournes accompting
hymſelf to be in miſerable caſe, in that
he can not ſerue God with a franke
will. But conſyder whye, the lawe is
called ſofte and eaſy, it is foraſmuch as
beyng defended with heauenly power
we ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me the concupiſcence of our
fleſhe. For howſoeuer the fleſhe ſtry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
the faythfull ſee that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
that maye more delyght them,
than the ſeruyng obeying, and folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:8629:100"/>
of God. But yet that thys may be
better vnderſtode, it behoueth vs to
Ioyne with theſe commaundementes
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fatherly goodneſſe of God, by whiche
the rigour of the lawe is aſſwaged. So
when we knowe that God beareth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably
with vs although we can not
fulfyll the lawe with oure workes, yet
thys goodneſſe maketh vs readyer to
obeye hym. And thys is that whiche is
ſayd in the. 130. Pſalme. <hi>Forgeueneſſe is
with thee O Lorde that thou ſhouldeſt bee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

that had Chriſt incloſed in hym. But
Abraham had ſo receaued the promiſes

But now let vs ſee how the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fathers receaued not

poureth forth hys grace vpon vs, he ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
them onely a taſte of it wher he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
hymſelfe as it were preſente to

fel from the faith. The Apoſtle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
maketh hys argument thus. A farre

if we ſhrinke wee are doubly inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>They from far of beheld the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all

ſayd already) is ſpoken by compariſon,

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8629:105"/>
harden themſelf in al il and of pride re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
al the graces of God. And to ſpeak
at a word, which in their diſſolute and
deſperate lyfe carry a certayne marke
of reprobation. It is truely ſaid of ſuch
that ſaluation is farre from them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they reiect Ieſus Chriſt whiche is
author of ſaluation. Chriſt then is not
a Sauiour vnto al ſinners, as alſo it is
added that he is come to cal ſinners to
repentaunce. Pardon is gyuen vs, but
it is not to nouriſh and maintayn ſine
but to bring vs to lyue wel and Godly.
For the ſonne reconcileth vs to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnder this condition, that beeing
bought agayne by hys bloud, we ſhuld
offre our ſelf as liuely ſacrifices, as. S.

of God is opened to the end that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
all carnal deſires we ſhould
lyue holily. Where there is no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce

commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, that is, that you loue
one another. When the lawes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunces
are new they are more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
obſerued, afterward they ſlippe
by litle and litle out of the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance
of men, and at length are clere oute of

IT behoueth vs to mark who they be
to whom Chriſt directeth this ſaie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.
and to what purpoſe. He had reproued
the Phariſien hypocrites which did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt
cleanneſſe to be in outward wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhings:
ſayeng, you clenſe thoſe things
that are without, and the whileſt, that
which is within you, is ful of thefte, of
deceit and malice. O foles hath not he
that made that which is without made
alſo that that is within? So, accordyng
to hys cuſtome he mindeth to w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drawe
them from ceremonies, to bring them
to true loue: ſaying ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly that it is not
water that clenſeth as wel men as the
meates: but it is weldoing. Not that he
would diminiſhe the grace of God by
theſe words, neither doth he reiect y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>remonies
of the law as vayne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable:
but ſpeaking to thoſe that
with ſygnes and bare figures did arro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gantly
mocke God, he ſhewed that the
lawful vſe onely ſanctifieth the meate.
But haue we a wyll to knowe how we
ſhal vſe our meates wel and ryghtlye,
that ſhal be when of our plenty we ſhal
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:8629:108"/>
relieue the nede of the pore. Wherefore
it were farre better to giue almoſe of
our ouerplus, than to be to ſcrupulous
in waſhing our hands and veſſels, and
in ſo doing to let paſſe and forget the
pore. When he ſayth that al things are
cleane when we geue almoſe, this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
not that in almoſe there is any
ſatiſfaction by which we ſhould be cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from our offences. For Chriſte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth
not heere wyth what price wee
ſhould bye the forgeueneſſe of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
but he ſheweth that they that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
a part of their bread to the pore
ſhal eate their bread purely. But ſaint
Paul ſayth that though he ſhould geue
al hys goodes to be employed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing
of the neceſſity of the pore, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
if he haue not loue, al that
is nothing, And thus wher is the clean<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe
of whych mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made before?
He hymſelfe ſoluteth ſufficientlye this
queſtion when he ſayth, <hi>If I haue no loue.</hi>
Loue then maketh almoſe pure: and
almoſe well and charitably diſtributed
maketh vs to vſe wel and holylye the
meates whiche God hathe geuen vs.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:8629:108"/>
There are then almoſes which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
wythout loue. If a man conſyder
by it ſelfe the almoſe done to the poore
and chyeflye when a man vnclotheth
himſelfe to clothe other, it is worthy of
great prayſe. But bycauſe often tymes
one kynd of ambition goeth before and
commeth forth of another kinde of am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bition,
and not of a true liberalitye, or
els when he hymſelfe which is lyberal

For ſeeing they muſt reproue the faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of other they ſhuld eaſily com to be
hated of other, &amp; their doctrin ſhuld be
eaſly reiected, if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhuld eaſly admit

Yet leſt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> il lyuers ſhuld take an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
therof to ſynne &amp; to exempt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelf
from al correction, hee willeth that al
they that leade a diſſolute and offenſiue
lyfe ſhoulde bee openly rebuked. And
forthwith the reaſon is added, That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may feare. Whenſoeuer any ordre
is taken for the good, the wycked take
holde of it and by that means wil haue
a priuiledge or freedome from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente.
Hee moderateth then y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whiche

to the end y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> none ſhould thinke y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
vnder thys ſhadow it ſhould be lawful

that babling tonges ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> elders falſly accuſed ſhould
not be wrongfully blamed &amp; defamed.
Yet if ther be among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an il lyuer he
ought rygrouſly to be puniſhed &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
And why? y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other ſee y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thei
which ar of degre &amp; dignity are not for
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:8629:109"/>
borne, they being warned by ſuche ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
ſhould be the more in feare For
why ſhould a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> geue more libertye to
thoſe whoſe ſynnes may moſt hurt, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to thoſe whoſe faultes ſhal not be of ſo
great offence. By the way, thys muſte
be vnderſtode of thoſe ſynnes &amp; faultes
whiche geue open occaſion of offence.
For if any of the auncientes or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
committe any lyght fault and no
notable crime, he ſhould rather bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
a parte, than blamed openly.
Now thys is ſo farre from contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſentence of our Sauior Chriſt,
that it rather ſerueth it for an expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For when by the fyrſt ſentence we
know howe a man ſhould behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in rebuking open ſynnes, we may
alſo vnderſtand by the ſeconde howe a
man ſhoulde vſe hymſelf in reprouing
the faultes which as yet are ſecret and
hydde. Chriſt hauyng ſhewed how we
muſte beare the weakeneſſe of other,
ſheweth afterward howe and to what
end &amp; howe long it behoueth vs to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them. He geueth vs a meane, which
is, not to offende to muche, or to geue
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:8629:110"/>
occaſion of euil to the weake: and yet it
is fytt their ſyckeneſſe ſhuld be healed.
He geueth thys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement to his
faythfull ſo to ſpare one another that
notwithſtanding thei endeuour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectvice
And this is worthy diligently
to be noted, for when we ſpare or beare
with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it can hardly be but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we ſhal
forbeare to reproue them boldly. We
do al (welnyghe) declyne to one ſyde or
to the other, eyther we are content to
diſceaue one another by daungerous &amp;
deadly flattery, eyther ells wee are to
ſharpe in purſuing faultes and ſynnes
when we ſhould redreſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He there
ſetteth forth three degrees of brotherly
correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but hereit ſhal ſuffice to ſhew
that as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to reproue openly
thoſe ſynnes which ar open or knowen
of al. So as touchyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinnes y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as yet
are ſecret, we muſt proue this remedy,
beefore wee paſſe any further namely
whether by warnyng geuen a parte to
the offender a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may withturne him
from hys offence. But if he cannot bee
wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne by ſuch a meane, other remedies

herein are we comforted that we haue
a ready and ſouerayne remedye to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peace
god, by hauing recourſe vnto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt hys Sonne. And thys is a
thyng whereon oure conſciences may
reſte, thys is that wherein ſtandeth the
righteouſneſſe of men, and wherein is
grounded the hope of their ſaluation:
otherwiſe our tonges &amp; mouthes ar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
&amp; our prayers ſynne. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne
of God is oure mouth, oute of whiche
we ſpeake things pleaſyng vnto God:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:8629:111"/>
he is our altare wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we offer our
prayers in a ſacrifyce of ſwere ſauour:
he is our eye with whiche wee beholde
God a mercifull God vnto vs. So he
ſpeaketh &amp; intreateth for vs, not that
we muſte accompt or meaſure thys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creacyng
accordyng to our fleſhly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandyng.
For we muſt not thinke
that he is on his knees to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
or ſupplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or that he hath his
handes ioyned together and lyfted vp
to pray: but bycauſe he preſenteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
continually with hys death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
which are in ſteade of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
interceſſion and haue the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
efficacye and ſtrength of a liuely
prayer to get vs grace at hys fathers
hand, and to make hym graunt our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.
But he is ſo our aduocate, that
we muſt aſke nothing but in his name,
&amp; when we ſhall aſke or make requeſt
in hys name, then the treaſures of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
muſt be opened and liberally dealt
out. For God wil denye nothyng that
ſhalbe aſked in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Ieſus Chriſt
hys Sonne. How ſayth he then that it
ſhal be no more nedeful that he ſhould
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:8629:111"/>
entreate for hys Dyſciples? And what
nede is there to praye in hys name, yf
he take on him the charge to be our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate
or interceſſour. And Saint
Paule ſayth in thys eyght of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epiſtle
to the Romaines that he entreateth for
vs. Saint John calleth hym our aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
For anſwere, It behoueth to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande
that Chriſt ſayeth not here
ſymply y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil not bee our aduocate,
he meaneth that hys father ſhal bee ſo
bent to doe good to hys. Diſciples that
he wil geue them of hys owne accorde
&amp; without muche a do, al that they ſhal
requyre of hym, for the great loue that
he beareth them. He wil preuent the
aduocate or interceſſour which (if thys
wer not) ſhould ſpeake for them. And to
conclude he addeth, the father hymſelfe
loueth you bicauſe you haue louer me,

the paynes whiche wee had deſerued, &amp;

there is nothyng more horrible than to

ſuche as had an hundred tymes ſix alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed

<hi>Act.</hi> 2. he fett y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> panges of death, that is

that he myghte bee oure true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſoure

nedefull he ſhould abyde the aſſault of
al the powers and force of hel and the
horrour of eternal death. And thys is
that that is ſayd in the Articles of oure
fayth, that he deſcended into hel when
he ſuffered ſo many vylannyes, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
iniuryes &amp; outrages, when he ſwet

            <p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with hym, ſo horrible
and feareful is the iudgement of God,
Albeit he was in al things pleaſyng to
hys father and albeit he had no waye
offended him: yet he was accounted on
the Croſſe more wicked than theues:
for Barrabas was quite and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
Al dutyes of humanitye were
denyed, yea ſuch as wer offred to other
which ſhoulde be put to death for their
myſdedes. He ſhewed then ſuche extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitye
of anguyſhe when on the Croſſe
he made thys outcrye. <hi>My God my God
why haſte thou forſaken me?</hi> It is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
then if it be ſayd that he deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
downe into hel, that is to ſay to the
depe gulfes of al miſeries, and myſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:8629:114"/>
For he ſuffered the death which
by the wrath of God was layd vpon il
doers. Is not thys a terrible thyng for
a man to fele himſelf forſaken of God,
to fynde no fauoure or ſuttour at hys
hand when he calleth on hym, when a
man loketh for nothing els of him but
that he hath conſpired to deſtroye him.</p>
            <p>Now ſeyng it is ſo that he ſpake not
thys worde after the opinion of other
but as he felte it in dede, how is it that
he ſayeth in thys 16. of Iohn, that he
is not alone but that hys father is with
hym? Althoughe it ſeme that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is ſome abſurditye, that ſuch a word
of dyſpayre ſhoulde come oute of the
mouth of the Sonne of God: yet when
he felte the death and deſtruction ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng
to the felyng of the fleſhe, he
ceaſed not to haue a faſte fayth in hys
heart, by whiche he behelde God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
of whoſe abſence he complayneth.
For a whyle hys God head gaue place
to the weakeneſſe of the fleſhe in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
as touched our ſaluation, to the
end he might accomplyſhe al the parts
of our redemption.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:8629:114"/>
There is alſo a dyfference betwene
the felyng of nature and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and vnderſtandyng of faythe,
Wherfore theſe two thyngs may wel
agree, that Chriſt conceaued in hys
ſpiryte that God had forſaken hym,
and that accordyng as the felyng of
man tolde hym. And yet for all that
he had thys fyrmneſſe of fayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God
was gentle and fauourable to hym.
Whiche thyng he ſheweth when he
maketh thys preface that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to God as to his God, &amp; that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he make any mention of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
whych he beateth backe ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fyrmely by the buckler of fayth.</p>
            <p>Furthermore in thys feareful care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
carefulneſſe, hys fayth abode ſafe
and whole ſo that complaynyng to bee
forſaken he truſted to the nere ayde of
God. But we muſt marke to what
purpoſe he ſayth that his father is with
hym. For albeit he myghte well haue
ſpoken thys woorde euen in hys an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyſhe:
yet it behoueth vs to marke
the circumſtance of the place. He
had ſayed beefore that the houre was
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:8629:115"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me already that euery one of hys A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
ſhould be ſcattered abrode and
ſhuld leaue hym alone. He addeth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by and by thys correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Though
I be not alone, but my father is with
me. He ſygnifyeth that thoughe al the
world ſhoulde forſake hym yet ſhoulde
he bee nothyng abated thereby. Hys
truth and hys glorie are grounded in
hym and depend not on the worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuing
it, or not beleuing. If al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world
forſake hym, yet he ceaſeth not to abide
whole. For he is God not hauyng any
nede at al of the helpe of any other. Let
hym be lefte alone yet hys father will
take his part: ſo that he ſhal not nede to
borrowe ought of men. Whoſoeuer
ſhal haue thys wel prynted in his hart
ſhal not ceaſe to abyde faſte though al
the world ſhoke, yea and the very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakyng
of al other ſhal not ouer throwe
his fayth. For he which contenteth not
hymſelfe with God onely he doth hym
not the honour that belongeth to him,
howſoeuer it bee although the violence
of the extreme anguyſhe, made this cry
and this vehement worde to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me out
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:8629:115"/>
of the mouth of the ſonne of God, <hi>My
God my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> yet
was, it euer true that hys father was
with hym. Wherfore we ought not to
thynke y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hys father was at any tyme
agaynſt hym or angry with hym: for
howe ſhould he be angry with his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued
ſonne in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was wel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Or howe could Chriſt appeaſe or
quench the wrath of God and make an
attonement betwene God and men yf
he were angry with hym.</p>

HOwſoeuer this place of Geneſis
may be expounded, a man myght
thinke that Cayn was bleſſed of
God. Fyrſte if it be expounded, <hi>I haue
gotten a man wyth the Lord,</hi> thys is as if it
wer ſayd by the benefit or grace of god,
as if Eue imputed it to the bleſſing of
God that ſhe had ofſpring, as it is ſayd
in the. 126. Pſalme, The fruyte of the
wombe is a gyfte and bleſſing of God.
Secondarily if a man ſay I haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
or poſſeſſed by the Lordes helpe, it is
as muche to ſaye as God hath don me
thys good turne that I haue a man.
In thys manner Eue ſhoulde geue
thanckes to God for that he had begon
to rayſe poſterity of her, wher ſhe was
worthy neuer to haue children, as wel
as ſhee deſerued to be euerlaſtingly de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
Thyrdely if a man expound it.
I haue poſſeſſed a man of God, it ſhuld
be as if Eue did promeſſe herſelf alrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy

the Faythe of Eue ſhoulde be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

the promeſſe by Fayth that the head of

Fourthly if a man receiue this expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is the moſt allowable of al,
I haue gotten or poſſeſſe a man vnto
the Lord, it ſhould be as if Eue ioyed
in herſelfe for the childe that was born

frute of her generation. Howſoeuer
this be taken, it ſeemeth that in the
byrthe of Cayne there is matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioicing
for aſmuchas he is of the Lord.
Eue truely not knowing what a one

But the whyleſte hee was of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

But Saint Paule ſpeaketh of another
manner of knowlege in thys ſeconde
Chapiter of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> firſt to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Corrinthians.
Thys knowledge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not of fleſhly

Chriſtes very enemyes which wer led

wyſedome of God ſhyne clearely, the
which notwithſtanding the great ones
could not comprehend. To crucifie our
Lorde Chriſt, of one ſyde were the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
of the Iewes which were in
reputation of holyneſſe and wyſedome
aboue all other, on the other ſyde Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
and the Empyre of Rome. Herein
a man ſeeth manyfeſtly the blyndneſſe
of al thoſe whiche are not wyſe but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

are to ſorts of ignorance, the fyrſt is
that which procedeth from an vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
zeale, and doth not ſymply reiect y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
which is good, but it reiecteth it bicauſe
it thynketh it to be ill. But although no
man ſo ſynneth of ignorance that the
whyleſt he is not gyltye before God of
a naughtie conſcience bicauſe hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye
is euer myxed withal, or ſome pride
or dyſpiſyng: Neuertheleſſe it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
ſometymes that al Iudgement &amp;
vnderſtandyng is ſo cloked in the witt
of man that nothyng appeareth but
mere ignorance, not only to the eies of
other, but alſo of themſelf. Saint Paul
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8629:125"/>
was ſuch a one beefore he was lyghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
For he hated Ieſus Chriſt and his
doctryne in that he was caryed awaye
with a fonde zeale not knowing what
he dyd, and yet he was not without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſye
nor without pryde, ſo that he
was inexcuſable before God. But his
vyces were altogether couered wyth
ignorance and blyndneſſe, ſo that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
perceaued them not nor felt them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond manner of ignorance is
more like to a ſtubborneſſe and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
than a mere ignorance: for they
that of their own accord riſe vp againſt
God, ar as it wer freniticke me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They
haue eyes and yet they ſee not. Theſe
gouernours were ſuche, and we muſte

of them, for if they had wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

of God: and thys apprehenſion
can not bee wythout feare: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that feare is not without com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forte.
The wicked alſo may haue feare
and horrour of the preſence of the lord
but that feare maketh them to remayn
confounded.</p>
            <p>There is a goodly example of bothe in
the reſurrection of the Sonne of God.
The Soldiours that kepte the tombe
feared. The holye wemen alſo that
came to anoynt hys body were afraid.
But let vs heare what difference there
is betwene the one feare and the other.
The Soldioures whyche were inured
with tumultes and ſtryfe were for all
that ſo aſtonnied and ſwallowed vp
with fighte that they fell as half dead,
yea not hauing ſtrengthe or power to
ryſe. The wemen lykewyſe feared
but comforte followed by and by after
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:8629:129"/>
which rayſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp from their feare &amp;
flyghte ſo that at the laſt they began to
hope for ſome better thing. And truely
it is very conuenient that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hygh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty
of God ſhould indifferently make
al to tremble, as well the good as the
ill, to the ende that all fleſh may kepe
ſcilence before hys face. But after
that the Lorde hymſelfe hath humbled
the faythfull, foorthwith he appeaſeth
their fearfulneſſe leaſte beeing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
they ſhoulde fal vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den,
and not that onely, but alſo he
healeth by the mildeneſſe of hys grace
the wound and hurt which he himſelfe
cauſed. But as touching the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
and proud they are ſodenly flygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and wyther by little and little in
their tourmentes: as men out of theyr
wittes are agaſte for a litle whyle: yet
are they not touched to the quicke, for
by and by they forget that they wer in
feare, not that the remembraunce of
the feare is altogether oute of them,
but bycauſe thys lyuely apprehenſion
of Gods power is fallen from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:8629:130"/>
Nowe as touching the fyrſt Feare
whiche proceadeth of Fayth, it maketh
vs to walke in all reuerence and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
vnto Goddes Iuſtyce. And
therefore it maketh vs happy bycauſe
God wyl neuer forſake thoſe that obey
him in feare and lowlyneſſe. Thys is
contrary to the common opinion of al
men that they that ſeate the Lord are
happy and principally in thys life. For
how many Epicures are there whiche
vomite oute blaſphemies, ſaying that
God fauoureth the wicked when they
proſper in their wickedneſſe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
the proſperity of the wicked trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
and maketh the weake to wauer:
beſyde, they faint in trouble and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe.
And althoughe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſers
of God ar not very wel at their
eaſe, and that the ſtate of the good
is in ſome ſorte good and tollerable:
yet ſo it is that the more parte haue
their eyes blinde or ſhutte vppe when
they conſider Goddes prouidence.
But howſoeuer it be, this is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne

the Lorde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:8629:130"/>

            <p>We muſte remembre the ſeconde

but trembling and horroure. There
is in deede a ſeruyle feare which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
contrary to willing reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
When we loue not God francklye as
our father but ar chiefely conſtrayned
by feare of punniſhment: but Saynte
Iohn meaneth another thynge: hys
mind is to ſhew that when we knowe
by Faith what the loue of god to vs is,
wee haue peace in our conſcience why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is contrary to this feare. And
though we cannot yet altogether driue
feare awaye, bycauſe we canne haue
but a little taſte of the loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes

tempeſtes feare is truly driuen awaye
bycauſe it geueth place to fayth. Feare
then is not in loue, not that it moueth

Chriſt ſuffereth theſe to touche hym to

Saint Mathew addeth that the we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
bowed downe before hym which
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:8629:131"/>
was an argumente or a ſygne of an
vndoubted knowledge. Alſo he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
hys Dyſciples to touche hym and
ſpecially Thomas to put hys fyngers
within the hollowneſſe of his wounds.
And that he dyd bycauſe it was nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
to put them out of al doubt of hys
reſurrection. But when he ſawe that
Marye ſtayed at hys bodily preſence
and loked for no other happier maner
of enioying hym than that he ſhoulde
bee conuerſante in earth with them,
a man oughte not to maruell if he
were willyng to moderate and correct
thys vnaduiſed zeale. Wherefore
let vs take thys for a certayntye that
Chriſt forbad not Marye to touch him
tyll he ſawe that ſhee Importunely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyred

The reaſon is added therunto whiche
ſufficiently ſheweth that whiche is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
worthy to be noted, to wete, that he

to cure the ſyckeneſſe of ambition, by
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:8629:133"/>
whiche men ſeke for glorye at mennes

whyleſt the Chriſtian vertues can not

Thys cannot otherwiſe be. Euen

man beyng as it were hyd in hymſelfs
ought to deſyre that men ſhould ſo ſee

Nowe ſeeing Chriſt condemneth ſuch
a vilannous flighte, and good cauſe
whye: howe commeth it to paſſe that
in another place he appoynteth hys A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtels
to flye from towne to towne
when they are perſecuted? It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye
to aunſwere. In geuyng them
thys commaundemente hys minde is
not that they ſhoulde becomme hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges
and ſhould ſet aſyde all careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for theyre ſheepe, or to forſake
theire charge as if they were well and

yea and he appoynteth them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
are hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted from one place to flie to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
but not on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhuld

to endeuour to employ the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel
to better. For thys happeneth but to
ofte that they which haue ſuffered one
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:8629:135"/>
perſecution would be willing to reſt as
foyled Soldiours. But Chriſt giueth
no ſuche time of reſt to his ſeruaunts,
but his commaundemente is that they
ſhoulde not ceaſſe till they haue ended
their courſe. And we muſt marke that
he hiddeth them not to flie into Caues
or ſecrete places: but when theyre la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure
profiteth not in one towne, hee
would that they ſhuld withdraw them
ſelfe vnto another, where other maner
of people are for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſaluation of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which
they may buſy themſelfe agayne. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
this reſolution wee maye eaſilye
ſoyle this doubt, to wete, if al that flye
ought to be holden for hyrelings.</p>
            <p>Thus a man may ſay that we ought
not without difference to condemne al
thoſe that flye: yet the whileſte euerye
flyght is not lawful. Some to preciſe
and ſtrayght haue condemned flyeng
away as if it were a kinde of denial: if
it were ſo, a part of the reproch ſhoulde
fall on Chriſt and his Apoſtels. And on
the other ſyde, if it were lawful to flye
for euerye occaſion, what difference
were there in the tyme of perſecution
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:8629:135"/>
betwene the good ſheapheard and the
hierling? A man may kepe here a good
meane. Let not the ſhepherd leaue his
place for feare, nor let him by his flight
betray his flock, nor let him geue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of fickleneſſe, yet let him not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute
good aduyſement throw himſelfe
into daungers. If all the Churche bee
perſecuted, or if men ſeeke to put to
death a part of it, it were il don of the
ſheephearde to abſente himſelfe whoſe
duety was to offer foorth his owne life
to ſaue others. But ſometyme it
maye comme to paſſe that by abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting
hymſelfe, he may appeace the rage
of the ennemyes, and ſo he maye by
departing prouide profitably for al the
whole Church.</p>

the face of a King and ſo beginneth.
Not that beauty for it ſelf ought gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

He himſelfe teſtyfieth here that
he was appoynted to be the miniſter
of heauenly grace only for the Iewes.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:8629:139"/>
Hereon he argueth that he oughte not
to ſuccour ſtraungers: but this is not
to ſay that the grace and vertue of the
Lord Ieſus was continually ſhutte in
within ſo ſtraight bounds, but bycauſe
the reaſon of the tyme ſo would that he
ſhould begin with the Iewes, and for
that time geue himſelf only vnto them,
for the wall was not broken before the
reſurrection, ſo that the Sonne of God
himſelfe might proclayme peace vnto
the Gentiles which were baniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

why he forbode his Apoſtels to ſow
their doctrine any where but in Iewry

Iudgemente, as thoughe hee ſayed

the difference was onely herein, that
God dealing graciouſly with them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered

thys was a remedye that followed the
il. But howe ſoeuer man eauyl, the
Holye Ghoſte pronounceth that there
is neyther Iewe nor Greeke but are
al by nature ſubiect to condemnation:
And if we be of nature worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
it followeth then that
ſinne hath the firſte and chiefe place in
euery one of vs, for God is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye
but agaynſte ſynne. And the
other ſentence of the ſeuenth Chapiter
of the fyrſte to the Corinthes, tendeth
to a diuerſe end: for it is ſpoken of the
holineſſe of Mariage. The band of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage
is ſingular: The wife is the half
part of the houſeband, there be two in
one fleſh, there the houſebande is the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:8629:140"/>
wiues hed, ther the woman is her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes

an vnfaythful wyfe, or contrarywyſe,
but that by ſo ſtrict a knotte the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
muſte bee polluted: but Mariage
leaueth not therefore to bee holy, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
muſte thou feare the infection, as
though the beleuing part were defiled
by the vnbeleuing. And beholde the
argument is brought from the effecte.
If the Mariage were defiled the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which ſhould come of it ſhould be
vncleane: but they be holy, it foloweth
then that the Mariage is holy. Euen
therefore as the vnbeliefe of the one of
the twayn, either of the father or of the
mother letteth not but that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> children
are borne holy, ſo alſo it letteth not but
that the Mariage is holy.</p>
            <p>How then ſhal we agree this ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence
with the other that of nature wee are

All then from the fyrſt to the laſte are

and if the ſtryfe be for the title, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

hymſelf the Maſter teacher of the
Gentils, hys mynde was not wickedly
to ſteale from Chriſt the honour y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
vnto hym. Neyther is Chriſtes
meanyng any thyng ells but to bryng
euery man vnder hym from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
to the ſmalleſt, to reſerue his right
wholly to hymſelfe. He careth not then
with what tytle they be adorned which
haue the charge of teachyng, only hys

that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould vſurpe any rule

the ſame ſenſe the honour of the name
father belongeth to God: for men haue
not geuen to themſelfe that name, but
it hath bene graunted them of God.
And it is not ynough to ſaye that men
which haue children are fathers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the fleſhe and that God alone is
father of the ſpirites. True it is that
ſometime a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal finde thys diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſcriptures as in the. 12. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Hebrues. But ſeing Saint
Paule calleth hymſelf very often a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:8629:145"/>
father, it behoueth vs to ſee how
this agreeth with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of our Lord
Ieſu, loe then what we muſt ſay. The
honour of father is falſely geuen vnto
men when by that name the glorye of
God is darkened, that is when a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
man ſeperates hymſelf from God
to be accompted a father, ſeyng that al
degrees of kyndred depend of God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Chriſt, and thoſe degrees are ſo
knytte together, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> to ſpeake fytly God
is alone the father vnto al.</p>
            <p>The whileſt God willeth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
vs to honour our fathers to
reuerence them, to obeye them, and to
loue them, and thys commaundement
is confyrmed by threates, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſſe.
The threate is that al ſtubborne
&amp; dyſobedient children to their fathers
ſhould be punyſhed by death. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſſe
is that they that ſhal honour and
obeye their father ſhal liue long on the
earth. Yet notwithſtandyng we muſte
haue thys reſolution before our eyes,
that a man neuer ought to turne aſide
from the will of God.</p>
            <p>Nowe touchyng that the fathers
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:8629:146"/>
haue rule ouer theyr children it is for
thys reaſon, bycauſe God hath choſen
them, impartyng to them ſome parte
of hys honour. The ſubiection then
that children owe vnto their fathers
ought to bee vnto them as a ſtayre to
leade them to the reuerence and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of God, whoe is the chiefe father.
But if the fathers wil make their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

theyr fathers but ſtraungers,
whiche woulde tourne them from thys

was not Iuſtifyed by hys wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:8629:146"/>
maketh thys argument. If Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
were Iuſtifyed by hys woorkes,
he maye beaſte of hys deſerte: but ſo
it is, that he hath nothyng whereof to
boaſt beefore God. It followeth then
that he was not Iuſtifyed by his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.
But thys is hys glorye, &amp; the thing
he may boaſte of, that he embraced the
goodneſſe of God by fayth.</p>
            <p>Fayth maketh a man to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me
oute of hym, and leadeth hym to God.
So the glorye of Abraham was not
in hys woorkes nor in the worthineſſe
of hys perſon: but in the mere good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and grace of God. For when
a man will trulye boaſte hymſelfe, he
muſt bryng nothyng of hys owne, but
the knowledge of hys owne myſerye,
throughe whiche he may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me to ſeke
the goodneſſe and mercye of God. And
ſurely the ryghteouſneſſe whyche is
of faythe is the onely reſkue that the
poore ſynner hath beyng deſtitute of
all workes. So then Abraham, in the
promyſe that was made to hym dyd
apprehend the goodneſſe of god whiche
was offered hym, by which he felt that
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:8629:147"/>
righteouſneſſe was imparted vnto him.</p>
            <p>Let vs nowe ſhewe howe he was

for euery man to know that Saint

righteouſneſſe, for if we loke narrowly
to hys meanyng, we ſhal fynde that he
medleth not at al w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the matter of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification:
but he goeth about to ſhew
what y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> profeſſion of fayth is worth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
works. The proues which he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
ar to be applyed to thys ſentence,
that fayth is but dead without workes:
and that good workes are euer ioyned
with fayth. To ſolute at a woorde thys
doubt, we muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> double ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of thys word Iuſtifie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
S. Paule teacheth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wee are Iuſtified

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we obtayne this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are
accompted to be iuſte before God. But
S. Iames loketh to another marke,
namely whoſoeuer ſayeth he is a bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it behoueth he ſhuld ſhewe by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of his beliefe. It is certaine
that. S. Iames mynded not to ſhewe
whereon the truſt of Saluation ought

to reſt, wherin Saint Paule reſteth
only. Thys worde then Iuſtification,
accordyng to Saint Paule, is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putyng
of free ryghteouſneſſe beefore
God or before hys Iudgemente ſeate.
And according to Saint Iames it is
a declaration or approuyng of ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
by workes or by effectes, and
that before men: as alſo a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>In the meane tyme notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
true it is that there is nothyng
ſayd in corners. It behoueth vs to
marke to what purpoſe he maketh this
proteſtation. Cayphas the Prieſt
calleth hym to accounte as if hee had
had to doe with a ſeditious man that
had deuyded the Church by Scyſmes
and factious gatheryng Dyſciples to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and as if he had had to doe with
a falſe Prophet whiche had endeuored
to corrupt the fayth and true religion.
Chriſt hauyng exerciſed the offyce of a
teacher entreth not into a newe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wil he let ſlippe any thyng that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the defence of the truth: but
he ſheweth that he is ready to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
that which he taught. But in ſo
ſaying he debateth not what is lawful
or not lawfull, as if it bee lawfull to
Preache ſecretlye or openly but hys
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:8629:149"/>
minde is to repulſe the proud vnſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe
of the Prieſt that inquired (as
of a thing doubtfull) of a thing whyche
was very openly knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So, to make
theſe two places agree, wher he ſayth,
hee hath ſpoken nothing in ſecrete, it
oughte to bee referred to the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce
of the worde which hath euer
bene like though the forme and maner
of teaching hath bene diuerſe. He hath
oftentimes taught thoſe that were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

he hath taught nothing pryu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

touching the ſubſtaunce, but that

not thys of crafte, as if of ſet purpoſe
he woulde haue kepte cloſe or hid from
the people things which he ſayd to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

ſaieng Sara his wife, was his ſiſter.
Truly a man can not excuſe his fault,
for God had had other meanes to ſaue
his life than by his endangering his
Wifes chaſtitis by help of a Lie. Hee
excuſeth him ſelfe after, that he hath
not lied, and that he forged nothing
contrary to the truth. This was ſurely
a great fault, for it was not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of him
that his Wife was aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doned ouer to

            <p>DAuid hauing proteſted that he had
bene drawen out of the lowe dep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
by the onely hand and power
of God, confeſſeth at the laſte, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hath moued him to deliuer hym
but his good pleaſure, to the ende that
al the prayſe ſhould be geuen him. But
herewithall alſo it behooueth to note
that hee ſpeaketh of the good pleaſure
of God, loking on hys calling, &amp; chiefly
reſting thereupon, that al the battailes
that had bene ſet againſt him wer not
ſtyrred vp for anye other cauſe but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had ſimply obeyed the calling
of God. And ſo the ſuccor of God was
euer ready and at hand, foraſmuche as
he did not thruſt in himſelf of his owne
motion, but had bene anointed before
by the hand of Samuel, whiche was a
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:8629:156"/>
figure of the free choiſe of God. But
ſoone after he ſayth that God hath yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hym acording to his righteouſneſſe,
and according to the cleaneneſſe of his
handes. It ſemeth at the firſt ſight that
he is contrary to hymſelfe. He had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
al to the good pleaſure of God
now he vaunteth that he hath bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced
as he deſerued. But a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
may eaſyly agree theſe two ſentences.
He had firſt proteſted that he cam not
into the hope of the Kingdome but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the admiſſion and conduct of God,
and that men had not geuen their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to heaue him vp to this dignity, nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
had hee thruſte himſelfe in by his
owne motion: but foraſmuche as the
good pleaſure of God was ſuch. Both
were neceſſary. Fyrſt it behooued that
God ſhould preuent his ſeruaunt with
his free fauour and grace, and that he
ſhould chooſe hym to bee King, and
then after ſeeing Dauid on his part o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
hym with a good conſcience, and
receiued the Kingly dignity which god
had offred hym. whatſoeuer his enemy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es
deuiſed to ouerthrow his Fayth, he
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:8629:156"/>
followed conſtantlye the ryghte courſe
of his calling. Then not onely theſe
two ſentences do not dyſagree, but one
of them very wel anſwereth the other:
Moreouer Dauid doth not here preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
himſelfe before God as beeing armed
wyth whole and perfit ryghteouſneſſe,
he offereth not here hys whole lyfe to
be examined, whether there were any
thyng in it to be found fault wythal or
no, and that therfore he ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
grace and to be accoumpted iuſt.
But willyng to defende hys innocency
before God agaynſt the ſelau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders and
falſe reproouinges of hys ennemyes,
he affyrmeth that in thys caſe hee had
borne hymſelf purely and vpryghtlye:
foraſmuche as he had enterpryſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
farther than God commaunded
hym and whatſoeuer conſpyracye hys
aduerſaryes had made agaynſte hym,
yet he kept himſelf with the bounds of
hys calling.</p>

            <p>TRVE it is that Chriſt after hys
reſurrection had no neede to eate
and drinke, he had in dede taken
his body agayne, but it had ſuch quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that it was no more ſubiecte eyther
to hunger or to thyrſt. But when it is
ſayd that after his reſurrection hee ate
and dranke, it is to ſhewe what care he
had to prouide for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rudeneſſe of thoſe
that were hys, abacing hymſelf ſo low
that albeit he was adorned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heauenly
glory yet hee dyd eate and drynke as if
he had bene a mortal man, and that
was to the ende his reſurrection ſhuld
not be darke or doubtful vnto vs. If
curious men aſke what became of that
meate, the aunſwere is, that as it was
made of nothing ſo it was eaſly brought
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o nothing by the power of the Sonne
of God. The meate which is taken for
the nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the body is digeſted:
but we knowe that Chriſte tooke that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:8629:157"/>
meate to nourriſh our fayth. If a man
replye that only he ſeemed to eate and
drynke, what had ſuch a ſemyng proſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
It is not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nedeful to ſuch ſcapes
or ſtertyng holes: for whan it is ſayd y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the ſonne of God was not by his owne
nede to eate &amp; drinke, but was willing
to helpe the weakeneſſe of thoſe that
were his, it is ynough to cutt of all the
triflyng gloſes of men. But when in
the other place y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde Ieſus ſpeaketh
by an Allegorie he warneth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as well of hys death that was at
hand, as alſo of the heauenly life which
he calleth newe. For how much nerer
the death of their Maſter, was ſo much
the more ought they to be confyrmed,
to the end they ſhould not be altogether
dyſcouraged. Moreouer ſeing his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
was to ſet forth hys death before
their eyes in the holy Supper as in a
glaſſe, it is not without cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſayth
he ſhall ſhortlye departe oute of this
world. Now bicauſe they wer trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
newes he addeth ſtrayght after a
comfort that they ſhould not be afrayd
to dye, ſeing that after death that ſhall
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:8629:158"/>
haue a farre better life. His death was
nigh, but from thence he ſhould pas to
happy immortality, and ſhuld not liue
alone in the Kingdome of God, but his
faythfull beare hym company in thys
heauenly lyfe. By thys meane hee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
hys faythful as it were by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand
to the Croſſe, and from thence he lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hope of ryſing agayne.
If a man ſay that eating and drinking
belongeth not to the Kingdom of God,
it is to no purpoſe, Chriſt meaneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
but that hys Diſciples ſhalbe ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
ſhortly depriued of his preſence, ſo
that he ſhal liue no more with them tyll
he and they together ſhal enioy the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
&amp; heauenly lyfe. He ſayth that then
there ſhalbe a new maner of drink and
meate. And this is ſpoken ſymplye and
without a figure in Saint Luke til the
Kingdom of God come. Laſtly thys ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not
be vnderſtode of the tyme be twyrt
hys reſurrection and his aſcention du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
whiche hee ate and dranke with
his Diſcyples as it hath bene ſayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
It was then a ſtate or meane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
betwene the courſe of the mortal
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:8629:158"/>
lyfe and the marke of the heauenly life
And then the Kingdome of God was
not yet opened, and therfore he ſayd to
Mary I am not yet gone vp to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And withal the Diſciples wer not
yet entred into the Kingdome of God
to drink of the new wine with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
of God beeing made partakers of one
ſelfe glory. Then to take away al ſhew
of contrariety that myght be betwene
theſe two ſentences, that hee wyll not
drink and yet he hath dronken he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not preciſelye of eating and dryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
