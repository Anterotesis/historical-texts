            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Occasion of this Discourse.</head>
            <p>THE Proceedings of late, in City and Country, against some of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> for Riots, for only Meeting peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly together to serve and worship God, first put me upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the Nature of Riots. What upon that Inquiring I have found I here present to publick view, for common benefit, that none through ignorance may be occasion of bringing an unjust suffering upon an innocent People, and thereby Guilt upon themselves. I do not pretend much skill in Law (a Study and Profession I was never bred to) But having spent some hours on this Occasion, in searching what the Law-Books say in this Case, I hope I may (without incurring the Censure of Presumption) communicate my Gleanings to such of my well-meaning Country-men, as have not leisure or opportunity to inform themselves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. I solemnly declare I have no other end or aim in this Work, than to do Good and prevent Evil: Which Consideration, with men of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Ingenuity, will be, <hi>I</hi> hope, a sufficient Apology for any seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boldness in this Vndertaking.</p>

            <head>A Discourse concerning Riots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THat the Nature of a <hi>Riot</hi> may be the better understood, I intend to observe this Method. <list>
                  <item>1. To set down the strict and proper Signification of the word.</item>
                  <item>2. To Inquire what the Statute Law says concerning it.</item>
                  <item>3. To observe what the common Acceptation of the word [<hi>Riot</hi>] is in Common Law.</item>
                  <item>4. To shew the contrarieties between <hi>Riots</hi> and peaceable religious <hi>Meetings.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, to begin with the Signification of the word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cowell,</hi> a Doctor of the Civil Law, and the King's Professor thereof in the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> says,
<q>The word Riot (<hi>in Latin,</hi> Riotum) cometh of the French, Rioter, that is, Rixari (<hi>which signifies to</hi> Chide, Scold, Brawl, Strive, <hi>or</hi> Quarrel.) Cowell<hi>'s Interpreter,</hi> verbo <hi>Riot.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lambard</hi> says,
<q>Riot I think to be derived from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Rioter,</hi> signifying to Scold (or Brawl) because such manner of Acts be commonly accompanied with words of Brawl. <bibl>
                     <hi>Eirenarcha l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blunt</hi> says, Riot (in French <hi>Riote</hi>) is a <hi>brawling scolding Contention.</hi> Glosso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph. <hi>verbo Riot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Judge <hi>Coke</hi> says, <hi>Riotum</hi> (a Riot) cometh of the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Riotter,</hi> that is, <hi>Rixari</hi>; which (as I noted before) signifies to <hi>scold, brawl, quarrel,</hi> &amp;c. Inst. 3. <hi>part cap.</hi> 79. <hi>Tit. Riots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Keeble</hi> says,
<q>Riot is of the <hi>French</hi> Riotter, to <hi>scold</hi> or <hi>brawl,</hi> because such manner of Acts be commonly accompanied with words of brawl. <bibl>Assistance to Justices of the Peace. <hi>p.</hi> 645.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is enough to shew how <hi>unapplicable</hi> the word Riot, in its proper and true signification, is to a <hi>peaceable, quiet, religious Meeting,</hi> which admits not of any scolding, brawling, quarrelling, or the like.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Statute-Law,</hi> although divers Statutes were antienly made for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of Riots, Routs and unlawful Assemblies, as 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4.7.—2 <hi>H.</hi> 5.8. and 19 <hi>H.</hi> 7.13. Yet none of them define or describe what a Riot is. So that I find nothing in the Statute-Law will add Light to this Inquiry; and therefore we must have recourse to the Common-Law, and observe,</p>
            <p n="3">3. What the Common Acceptation of the word [<hi>Riot</hi>] is in the Common Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cowell</hi> says, It signifies in our Common Law, <hi>the forcible doing of an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful act by three or more Persons assembled together for that purpose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cowell</hi>'s Interpreter, <hi>verbo Riot. The same says</hi> Lambard in his <hi>Eirenarcha l.</hi> 2.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107496:3"/>
               <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>The same</hi> says <hi>West,</hi> Part 2. Symbol. Tit. Indictments. <hi>The same</hi> says <hi>R. Blunt</hi> in his <hi>Glossograph. verbo Riot. The same</hi> says <hi>Tho. Blunt</hi> in his Law-Dictionary, <hi>verbo Riot, The same</hi> (in effect) says the Book called <hi>Les Termes de le Ley, Tit. Riot,</hi> p. 244. And to <hi>the same</hi> purpose speaks <hi>Keeble,</hi> in his Assistance to Justices of the Peace. p. 645.</p>
            <p>Thus in short the define a Riot: but in the further opening of it, there are seven things I observe the Law-Books make essential to a Riot; which I will set down severally.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first is the <hi>Number of Persons</hi> engaged in it; which may be any Number <hi>above Two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The second is, that <hi>there be some fact actually done.</hi> For if three Persons or more should assemble together, and with intent to do such an act as would amount to a Riot: yet <hi>if they do it not,</hi> but depart again without doing any thing, <hi>their so assembling is no Riot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A Riot, says <hi>Lambard,</hi> is thought to be, where three or more persons be disorderly assembled to commit with force any such unlawful act, <hi>And do accordingly execute the same.</hi>

               <q>A Riot, says <hi>Pulion,</hi> is where three persons or above do assemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together to beat or maim a Man, <hi>&amp;c. And they do it. </hi>

               <hi>Dalton</hi> says,
<q>Where three persons or more shall come or assemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together, to the intent to do any unlawful act, with force or violence, against the Peace, or to the manifest terror of the People,—<hi>If they do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any such thing indeed, then it is a Riot.</hi>

               </q>
               <hi>The same says Meriton</hi> in his Guide for Constables p. 93.</p>
            <p>
               <q>A <hi>Riot,</hi> says <hi>Keeble,</hi> is thought to be, where three or more porsons be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly assembled to commit with force any unlawful act, <hi>And do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly execute the same.</hi> 
                  <bibl>Assist. to Just. p. 645.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>She herd</hi> having shewed what number of Persons, and what kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Act can make a Riot, says,
<q>a <hi>Riot</hi> is, where they do not only begin, and go on, but <hi>finish</hi> their work, or with unlawful Weapons <hi>do</hi> such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful act, <bibl> Grand Abridgment Part 3. p. 259.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From all which it is evident, that for any number of Persons <hi>barely to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> themselves together (thougb it were with a Riotous intention) is <hi>no Riot,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the same persons being so assembled, do commit some such unlawful act as in construction of Law will amount to a Riot (and of what kind that must be, shall be our next Inquiry.) So that, if in a peaceable manner to preach or pray could legally be interpreted a Riotous Act: yet those Meetings which are wholly silent, wherein there is <hi>nothing said, nothing done</hi>; or wherein (which is much alike) no proof can be made of anything said or done (and such, it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107496:3"/>
seems was that Meeting, which gave occasion to this discourse) such Meetings to be sure <hi>cannot be Riots,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A third thing is, that the act or deed done must be <hi>not only unlawful,</hi> but <hi>injurious to another.</hi> This appears by the Examples given by the most Eminent Lawyers that have written of this Subject.</p>
            <p>Judge <hi>Coke</hi> says, "<hi>A Riot in the Common Law signifieth, when three or more do any unlawful act:</hi> then to explain what he means here by an <hi>unlawful act,</hi> he immediately adds,
<q>As to beat any man, or to hunt in his Park, Chase or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, or to enter or take possession of another Man's Land, or to cut or destroy his Corn; Grass or other profit. <bibl>Instit. 3. p. c. 79. Tit. Riots.</bibl>

               <hi>Shepherd,</hi> having shewed what number of Persons must be present to make a Riot, adds,
<q>A second thing that <hi>must</hi> be in the Case to make up <hi>any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> in these Offences, <hi>must</hi> be, that the Assembly they go with, or their intent and design must be evil, to do some hurt to Men or that which is theirs:</q>

<q>As breach of Inclosures, or Bancks, or Conducts, Parks, Pounds, Houses, Barns, the burning of stacks of Corn, or the like; or to enter into Lands, to beat others, or to carry away their Wives, or the like. <bibl>Grand Abridg. 3. part p. 259. Tit. Riots.</bibl>

               </q>
 For this he cites divers Authors, particularly <hi>Dalton,</hi> who gives the self-same Examples of an unlawful Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous act, and out of whom he seems to have transcribed this verbatim. So that I need not repeat what <hi>Dalton</hi> there says; but shall only observe out of him,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107496:4"/>
that one of the Reasons he gives, why, <hi>If divers do assemble and gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to play at certain unlawful Games and Sports</hi> (which he mentions) <hi>it is no Riot,</hi> is, because <hi>These Meetings</hi> (says he) <hi>usally are not with any intent to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer or do violence or hurt to the Person, Possessions or Goods of any other.</hi> Dalt. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Just. c. 85. Tit. Riots.</p>
            <p>By all these Instances it is evident, that those <hi>unlawful Acts</hi> which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law takes notice of as <hi>Riots,</hi> are such as are some way or other <hi>injurious</hi> and <hi>hurtful</hi> to the <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>Possessions</hi> of others; But quiet and peaceable Meetings, for the Worship of God only, are <hi>no ways injurious</hi> or hurtful to the Persons or Possessions of any. So that it is <hi>not every</hi> unlawful Meeting, or Assembly of People forbidden by the Law, that will amount unto a Riot. 'Tis true indeed, every Riot is an unlawful Assembly; but (the Terms are not convertible) <hi>every unlawful Assembly is not a Riot.</hi> Dalton says, <hi>The manner of doing an unlawful Act by an Assembly of People, may be such (and so handled) as that it shall not be punished as a Riot.</hi> Country Just. c. 86. p. 221. And both <hi>Lambard</hi> and <hi>Keeble,</hi> from <hi>Marrow,</hi> assure us, that <hi>an unlawful thing maybe so done, as that it cannot be made a Riot.</hi> Eirenarcha, l. 2. c. 5. Assistannce to Just. p. 645. And so says <hi>Shepherd</hi> also, Grand Abridgment 3. part. p. 260.</p>
            <p>And to manifest yet further, that by an <hi>unlawful</hi> Act in a riotous sense, the Law Books intend such an Act as is <hi>injurious</hi> or hurtful to the Person or Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions of another they tell us that unlawful Act which makes a Riot, must be <hi>Malum in se Evil in it self</hi> and of its own nature. This <hi>Dalt.</hi> implies, when he says that to <hi>play at Foot-ball, Bucklers, Bear-baitings, Dancings, Bowls, Cards or Dice, or such like Games or Desports</hi> (which he confesses are unlawful) <hi>is no Riot,</hi> because <hi>they are not Evil in themselves.</hi> Country Just. c. 85. But in the last Edition of <hi>Dalton</hi>; (printed last year, with many considerable Additions by another hand) it is said expresly,
<q>An unlawful Assembly, Riot or Rout, is where three or more shall gather together, come or meet in one place, to do some unlawful Act with violence, and <hi>that unlawful act must be Malum in se,</hi> that is, evil in it self) <hi>and not Malum prohibitum</hi> (not evil forbidden, only.)</q>
See the new Edition of <hi>Dalton</hi>'s Country Justice, c. 136. Now if (according to these) that unlawful act which makes a Riot must be <hi>evil in it self</hi>; or injurious, then surely <hi>it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly</hi> be a Riot for people to assemble peaceably and quietly together to worship God: for certainly no man can harbour a thought, that it is <hi>evil in it self</hi> for Men and Women to worship God, or to assemble together, in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, for that end. And it is manifest that the statute of the 22. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. (commonly called the Conventicle Act) which prohibits those Meetings to greater Numbers, doth not take those Meetings to be <hi>evil in themselves,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it permits them to lesser Numbers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth thing <hi>essential to a Riot</hi> is <hi>force</hi> or <hi>violence.</hi> So all agree.</p>

               <hi>Cowell</hi> says, It signifies in our Common Law, the <hi>forcible</hi> doing of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Cowell's Interpreter, verbo Riot.</p>

            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Keeble</hi> says, a Riot is thought to be where three or more persons be disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly assembled to commit <hi>with force</hi> any such unlawful Act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Assist. to Just. p. 645.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lambard</hi> not only defines a Riot to be, where three or more persons be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly assembled to commit <hi>with force,</hi> any such unlawful act; but at his entrance upon the Discourse of Riots, having premised that many Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be without any apparent shew of Assembly against the Peace; <hi>I will leave them,</hi> says he, <hi>and resort to those other that the Commission saith to be done vi armata</hi>; and thereupon he proceeds to describe Riots, Routs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that it is plain he lookt upon that act which could make a Riot, to be an act done <hi>vi armata,</hi> with <hi>armed force,</hi> or, as the Phrase is, <hi>with force and Arms.</hi> And therefore, treating of what one Justice may do in the Case of a Riot, he says, <hi>He alone (or with his Servant) may go to the place, and such as he findeth riotously assembled and Armed, he may arrest — and may take their Weapons from them.</hi> Eirenarcha, l. 2. c. 5. Tit. Riots. Which implies that they must be <hi>Armed,</hi> they must have <hi>Weapons,</hi> that commit a Riot.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Shepherd</hi> speaks full and plain: For describing an unlawful Assemby, Rout and Riot, he says,
<q>Rout is, where being thus met they move, <hi>being weaponed,</hi> from the place of their Meeting towards the place where they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to do this act, in a <hi>turbulent</hi> way to effect it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But a Rior, he says, is where they not only begin and go on, but with <hi>Vnlawful Weapons</hi> finish or do such an unlawful Act. <bibl>Grand Abridgment 3. part. p. 259:</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dalton</hi> says expresly, <hi>It seemeth it can be no Riot, except there be an intent precedent to do some unlawful Act, and with violence or force,</hi> Count, Just. ch. 85. Thus all concur, that that Act which makes, or can be made a Riot, must be a <hi>forcible Act,</hi> or an Act done <hi>with force.</hi> So that <hi>No Force, No Riot.</hi> And therefore, seeing our peaceable, quiet, religious Meetings are <hi>wholly free from force and violence,</hi> it follows that they are also <hi>free from Riot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that none may err through misapprehension that the words [<hi>vi arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> or <hi>with force and Arms</hi>] are words of <hi>Form</hi> only, and not <hi>material</hi> and <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential</hi> to a Riot; let me add what <hi>Lambard</hi> saith thereupon.
<q>Even as the <hi>Civilians</hi> do handle two sorts of <hi>Force</hi>: of which they call the one <hi>vim,</hi> and <hi>vim simplicem, privatam; five quotidianam</hi>; and the other <hi>vim armatam, atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem &amp; publicam,</hi> because the first is void of any fearful outrage, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seemeth to kindle the Coals of Sedition it self: So likewise says he, our Law taketh knowledge of two manner of <hi>Force,</hi> whereof the one is rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107496:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than actual, and may therfore be termed, <hi>A Force in the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Law,</hi> which accounteh all that to be <hi>vis,</hi> which is contrary to <hi>Ius.</hi> But the other is <hi>apparent</hi> by the Act it self, which alwaies carrieth some <hi>fearful Shew,</hi> and matter of <hi>Terror</hi> (or trouble) with it. <bibl>
                     <hi>Eirenar.</hi> l. 2. c. 4. p. 140.</bibl>
               </q>
 And therefore (l. 2. c. 5. p. 174.) he explains [<hi>vis armata</hi>] to be that, which doth <hi>bring manifest Terror unto the Subject.</hi> And as he makes that which he calls an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual force, or a force in the consideration of Law, to relate to Suits and Actions at Law for Trespasses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So (in his first Book, c. 2. p. 7.) he declares, It is <hi>no part</hi> of the Justices Office to forbid lawful Suits and Controversies, but to suppress <hi>injurious force and violence moved against the Person, his Goods or Possessions</hi> And in p. 10. he saies,
<q>I conclude that this <hi>furious Gesture</hi> and <hi>beastly force of body or hands</hi> (and not every Contention, Suit and disagreement of minds) <hi>is the proper subject and matter about which the Office of the Iustices of the Peace is to be exercised.</hi>
               </q>
Now since a Riot is the proper Subject and matter about which the Office of Justices of the Peace is to be exercised, it follows that that <hi>vis armata, that</hi> force and Arms, which is of necessity to the making of a Riot, must needs be <hi>this furious Gesture</hi> this <hi>beastly</hi> force of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>hands</hi> (as <hi>Lambard</hi> calls it) which brings <hi>terror to the People,</hi> and which <hi>our Meetings are free from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dalton</hi> also, undertaking to shew what the Law accounteth to be <hi>force,</hi> and what <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi> be offensive in these and the like cases, saies,
<q>To have Harness, Guns, Bows and Arrows, Cross-bows, Halberts, Javelins, Bills, Clubs, Pikes, Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forks, or Swords not usually born by the Parties, shall be said to be <hi>vis ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata.</hi> And so to use casting of Stones, hot Coals, scalding Water or Lead, or, be said to be <hi>vis armata; </hi>

            </p>
            <p n="5">5 A Fifth thing is the <hi>previous Intent</hi> of the Persons assembled. Both <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi> and <hi>Keeble</hi> tell us, <hi>The intention and purpose of those that be assembled is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the weighing.</hi> And they instance some Cases of persons that being met at an Ale-house, a Christmas-Dinner, or a Church-Ale, fell together by the Ears and fought, yet this was no Riot (but a sudden Affray only) because <hi>they did not come thither with intention to fight</hi>; Eiren. l. 2. c. 5. Assist. to Just. Tit. Riots.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shepherd</hi> says,
<q>If many come together <hi>unarmed,</hi> they know not why them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; this is no offence punishable, unless it can be known, that they came to some <hi>Evil Intent,</hi> or that they do <hi>miscarry themselves</hi> in some <hi>Evil Act.</hi>
               </q>
Now, since we come together <hi>unarmed,</hi> not to any <hi>Evil Intent,</hi> but to a <hi>very good</hi> Intent, namely, to serve and worship the true God, in a peaceable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and do <hi>not miscarry</hi> our selves in any <hi>Evil Act</hi> in our Meeting: Surely (if <hi>Shepherd</hi> might be Judge) <hi>Our Meetings are not Riots.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Dalton</hi> speaks home; <hi>It seemeth,</hi> says he, <hi>it can be no Riot, except there be an intent precedent to do some unlawful Act, and with violence and force</hi>; Count. Just. ch. 85. Now the intent of our Meetings being <hi>only</hi> to serve and worship God, and that <hi>not</hi> with violence or force, but in peace and quietness, it seemeth such Meetings <hi>cannot be Riots.</hi>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:107496:5"/>6.

<q>Two <hi>special things</hi> there are that be common, and <hi>must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur</hi> both in the unlawful Assembly, Rout and Riot. 1. That three persons at the least be gathered together;—2. That <hi>there being together, do breed some apparent disturbance of the Peace,</hi> either by signification of <hi>Speech,</hi> shew of <hi>Armour, Turbulent Gesture,</hi> or <hi>actual and express violence.</hi> So that either the peaceable sort of men be <hi>unquieted</hi> and <hi>feared</hi> by the Fact, or the lighter sort and busie-bodies be imboldened by the Example; <bibl>

meet to play at Bowls, Tables, or Cards</hi> (which yet are unlawful Games for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bidden by the Statute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8.9.) <hi>and do use no misbehaviour against the Peace, they are not punishable in this degree.</hi> How much <hi>less</hi> then are they punishable in this degree, (<hi>viz.</hi> of Riot) who meet together for a good and <hi>godly end</hi> only, to worship God, and <hi>use no misbehaviour against the Peace!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all these Testimonies it appears, both that to the making of a Riot there must of necessity be a <hi>breach of the Peace</hi>; and also wherein that Breach of the Peace consists, namely, in <hi>threatning Speeches, shew of Armour, turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gesture,</hi> or <hi>actual violence.</hi> And that this is indeed the true and proper meaning of the words [<hi>Breach of the Peace</hi>] might be further confirmed by other evidences out of <hi>Lambard</hi>'s Eiren. l. 1. c. 2. and l. 2. c. 3. But most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of <hi>Dalton,</hi> who having defined Peace (in a legal sense) to be <hi>An Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from actual and injurious force and offer of violence,</hi> saies, <hi>The breach of this Peace seemeth to be any injurious force or violence moved against the person of another, his Goods, Lands, or other possessions, whether it be by threatning words, or by furious Gesture, or force of the body, or any other force used</hi> in terrorem; <hi>Count.

                  <bibl>Assist. to Just. p. 646.</bibl>
               </q>
 With <hi>Keeble</hi>'s Judgment I chuse to close this point, both as he is the last (so far as I know) that hath written on this Subject, and for that his Book hath the Approbation of all the twelve Judges</p>
            <p>Many other Authors I could have quoted on this Subject, &amp; some too of great Name, as <hi>Marrow, Kitchin, Brook, Crompton,</hi> &amp;c. whom I find cited by others to this purpose; but not having read these Authors my self, I forbear using them, that I might not rely on any authority taken up at second hand.</p>
            <p>Thus having gone through the several parts of a Riot, according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution premised, I take a Riot, in short to be this. When <hi>three</hi> persons, or more, <hi>are assembled together</hi> in Arms, with a <hi>fore-intent</hi> and purpose to do such an <hi>unlawful act,</hi> as is both <hi>evil in it self,</hi> and hurtful to another, either in person, or estate; and <hi>do it</hi> in a <hi>forcible manner,</hi> to the <hi>apparent Breach</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> either by <hi>threatning words, shew</hi> of <hi>Armour, turbulent Gesture,</hi> or <hi>open violence,</hi> and to the <hi>manifest terrour of the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Now because (according to the Rule, <hi>Contra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ia juxta se posita magis elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cescunt,</hi> i e.) when Contraries are set one by another, their Contrarieties do the more manifestly appear, I will briefly set forth the Contrarieties between Riots and peaceable Religious Meetings, by opposing our Meetings to Riots, through the several particulars before mentioned.</p>
            <p>And first as to <hi>number of Persons.</hi> In a Riot (if the fact be such as the Law accounts Riotous) any number of Persons <hi>above two</hi> is sufficient to commit a Riot.</p>
            <p>But in those Meetings for the exercise of Religion which are forbidden by the Conventicle-act, it is not unlawful even by that Act for <hi>four persons besides the Family</hi> (how numerous so ever that be) to assemble together. So that even in point of numbers there is a <hi>material difference</hi> between Riots and Religious Meetings: which shews, the Parliament that gave liberty to <hi>four persons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sides the family to meet, did not understand those Meetings to be Riots. Th-Conventicle-act doth not permit Riots: But the Conventicle-act doth permie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107496:7"/>
Religious Meetings to such Numbers as (as if those Meetings were of a Riotous nature) are sufficient to mak a Riot; Therefore <hi>such Meetings are not Riots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In a Riot there must of necessity be some <hi>overt act,</hi> some <hi>deed done,</hi> some <hi>fact committed</hi> by the persons assembled (which may come under the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of outward evidence) more than their <hi>bare assembling</hi> together, else <hi>it cannot be a Riot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (as in none of our Meetings there is any Riotous act, (so) in such of our Meetings as are wholly silent, there is <hi>no</hi> overt act at all, <hi>no</hi> deed done, <hi>no</hi> fact committed by any of the persons assembled (which may come under the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of outward evidence) more than their <hi>bare assembling</hi>: therefore <hi>such Meetings cannot be Riots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In Riots, the fact done must be <hi>not only</hi> unlawful, but <hi>injurious</hi> or <hi>hurtful</hi> to another, either in <hi>person</hi> or <hi>estate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Meetings (if at all unlawful) are <hi>no way injurious</hi> or <hi>hurtful</hi> to any, either in <hi>person</hi> or <hi>estate</hi>: therefore <hi>our Meetings are no Riots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That Act which makes a Riot must be done <hi>vi armata,</hi> with <hi>force</hi> and <hi>arms,</hi> or in a <hi>forcible</hi> manner.</p>
            <p>But our Meetings are <hi>not held,</hi> nor is there any thing done by us in them, <hi>vi armata,</hi> with <hi>force</hi> and <hi>arms,</hi> or in a <hi>forcible</hi> manner: therefore <hi>our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not Riots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. To make a Riot, there must be a <hi>previous intent</hi> in the persons assembled, to do some such unlawful act as is evil in it self and hurtful to others, and that with force.</p>
            <p>But in our Meetings, we have <hi>no previous intent</hi> to do any such unlawful act, as is evil in it self and hurtful to others; nor have we any other intent at all, than sincerely and really to serve and worship God, and that without force or violence: therefore <hi>our Meetings are not Riots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. It is not a Riot, unless the <hi>Peace be broken</hi> or disturbed by the persons as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, either by <hi>threatning speeches,</hi> shew of <hi>Armour, Turbulent Gesture,</hi> or <hi>open violence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in our Meetings, the <hi>Peace is never broken</hi> nor disturbed <hi>by us,</hi> we give <hi>no threatning speeches</hi>; we shew <hi>no armour</hi> (nor have any to shew) we use <hi>no Turbulent Gestures; nor</hi> do we <hi>offer violence</hi> to any: therefore <hi>our Meetings are not Riots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. It is not a Riot, except it be done with <hi>Terrour to the People.</hi> But our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are <hi>not held with Terrour to the People: therefore our Meetings are not Riots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How truly I have stated the Case, on the one hand, with respect to Riots, the many Quotations in the fore-going Discourse will shew. How true an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, on the other hand, I have given of our Meetings, the whole Nation (and all Nations wherein we have Meetings) may judg. Upon the whole, my request is, that all, both Justices and Jurors, who are or shall be concerned in this or the like Case, will seriously weigh the matter, and not <hi>strain</hi> the Law
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107496:7"/>
beyond its due Extent. <hi>To oppress any by colour of Law, is the greatest abuse of Law.</hi> I intreat Grand-Juries therefore to <hi>regard Iustice, to regard their Oath.</hi> They are sworn expresly to <hi>examine diligently, and true presentment mabe,</hi> &amp;c. They are sworn expresly, to <hi>present the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth, to the best of their knowledge.</hi> Now that they may not break their Oath, but that they may <hi>true</hi> Presentment make, that they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>nothing but</hi> the Truth, that they may not present a <hi>Falshood</hi> for <hi>Truth,</hi> I intreat them again and again to <hi>examine diligently</hi> both what Riots are, and what our Meetings are. And if upon such <hi>diligent Examination</hi> they find any of those <hi>material</hi> and <hi>essential Differences</hi> between our Meetings and Riots (which I have before observed) that then they will, like just Men and Christians, keep themselves clear from making <hi>false</hi> Presentments instead of <hi>True,</hi> from writing <hi>Billa vera</hi> (a <hi>true Bill</hi>) upon that Bill (and delivering it in as such up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Oaths) which perhaps in three parts of four is utterly and apparently <hi>false</hi>: The like request I make to petit Juries in the like Case, who are sworn <hi>well and truly to try, and true deliverance make,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>according to their Evidence.</hi> Which Evidence ought to be of <hi>good fame</hi>: for it's a Maxim, <hi>Iustitia non potest cum Scelerato Commercium habere</hi>; Justice can have no Commerce with a wicked graceless person: And <hi>Turpes a tribunalibus arcentur.</hi> Vile persons ought to be rejected by Courts of Judicature. And therefore witnesses are required to be not only <hi>Legales,</hi> Lawful men, but <hi>Probi,</hi> virtuous and good men, men of approved honesty, from such Witnesses the Jury may expect (and ought to have before they find any man guilty) a plain, full and <hi>clear</hi> evidence of <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> material part of the charge laid against him; and let me add, of all such Circumstances also, as may any way <hi>aggravate the Offence</hi>: for nothing that may endamage the accused party should be taken upon Presumption or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, nor without plain and clear proof. The witnesses deposition is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called evidence, because it makes the Truth and falsehood of the charge evident and plain: and saies <hi>Coke, Probationes debent esse evidentes &amp; perspicuae,</hi> proofs ought to be evident and clear. O that all men concerned in these and such like Cases, would so <hi>conscienciously</hi> and considerately discharge the duty of their Offices, that with <hi>comfort</hi> they might give account thereof to the <hi>Great</hi> Judge at the <hi>last</hi> day! For why should any draw upon their own heads the guilt of Perjury, and the vindictive cry of oppressed Innocents;</p>
            <p>But if there be any that are eager and desirous in their minds to have our Meetings punished as Riots; Let me intreat them also to consider, How <hi>disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> a Reflection it would be both to the <hi>Government,</hi> and to the <hi>Religion</hi> established thereby, If peaceable, quiet, Religious Meetings, conscienciously holden, only and alone for the Worship and Service of God (wherein <hi>no Evil</hi> is either acted or intended, <hi>no violence</hi> or <hi>force</hi> used, <hi>no breach</hi> of the <hi>peace</hi> made, <hi>no terrour</hi> given: but an innocent, meek, passive, and truly Christian beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and deportment shewn) should be judicially declared <hi>Riots,</hi> and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107496:8"/>
as such: when at the same time our Law-Books assures us, that not only <hi>playing</hi> at Bowls, Dice, Cards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But even the Numerous Assemblies that frequent those more Clamorous, Rude, Impetuous and Boisterous sports of <hi>Dancings, Foot-ball-playing, Bear-baitings, Bucklers</hi> or <hi>Fencings,</hi> and such like, are <hi>not</hi> Riots, Routs, nor unlawful Assemblies, shall such <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>Russianly</hi> sports wherein so much <hi>Rudeness, disorder</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness</hi> is committed (and which seem to be so near of Complexion to Riots) be declared to be <hi>no Riots:</hi> and shall <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>Religious Meetings,</hi> wherein only <hi>God is worshipped</hi> (and which have <hi>no</hi> shew nor appearance of Riots in them) be condemned <hi>for Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots! God forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any should think our Meetings may be Riots, because we sometimes meet in the open Streets or in the High-way; Let such consider, that we do not meet in the Streets or High-waies by <hi>Choice,</hi> but by <hi>Constraint.</hi> We come not with <hi>intent</hi> to meet in the Streets or High-waies, but in our Meeting-houses. But where we are <hi>shut out</hi> and <hi>kept out</hi> of our Meeting-Houses, we are <hi>necessitated</hi> to meet abroad. And yet there also we demean out selves <hi>peaceably</hi> and <hi>quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> not offering violence or injury to any, nor coming with any Intent so to do. And if any should apprehend, that our not departing immediately upon a Constable's making Proclamation, doth make our Meetings Riots, it may not be amiss for such to enquire, whether there be any Statute <hi>in force,</hi> that doth impower Constables, and other inferiour Officers, to make such Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and requires the persons assembled forthwith to depart thereupon. The Act made in the first year of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> c. 12 (which appointed the making of Proclamation in some Cases of another nature, though not by a Constable, so far as I observe) being but a temporary Act continued by Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> (in the first year of her Reign, c. 16.) to the end of the next Parliament after her death is long since <hi>expired,</hi> or discontinued, as <hi>Pulton, Dalton</hi> and <hi>Keeble</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares. However if it were in force, it would not reach us or our Meetings, which are <hi>not guilty</hi> of any of <hi>those Offences,</hi> against which that Act was made.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I desire the Reader to observe, that the difference between a Riot, Rout and unlawful Assembly, is only in the execution or Non-Execution of that Act, which, being done, makes a Riot. In all things else they are alike, there must be the <hi>same number</hi> of Persons to make an <hi>unlawful Assembly,</hi> as to make a <hi>Riot.</hi> There must be the <hi>same previous intent</hi> in the one as in the other; the fact intended to be done in an <hi>unlawful Assembly,</hi> must be of the <hi>same</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with that which is done in a <hi>Riot,</hi> that is, it must be evil in it self and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to another, as well in the one as in the other. There must be <hi>vis arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, force and arms</hi> to the making of an <hi>unlawful Assembly,</hi> as well as to the making of a <hi>Riot.</hi> There must be <hi>breach of the peace</hi> to make an <hi>unlawful Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> as well as to make a <hi>Riot.</hi> There must be <hi>Terrour to the people</hi> to make an <hi>unlawful Assembly,</hi> as well as to make a <hi>Riot.</hi> All the odds is, that if the Persons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107496:8"/>
so assembled, in such forcible manner, to the Breach of the Peace and terrour of the People, do <hi>not actually perform</hi> that unlawful act, which is evil in it self and injurious to the person, or Possessions of another, but depart again <hi>without proceeding to do it,</hi> then it is only an <hi>unlawful Assembly</hi>; whereas if they indeed <hi>do it,</hi> then it is a <hi>Riot.</hi> And a Rout is a degree between both, when after the Persons are so assembled, there is some <hi>Progress</hi> made, they ride, go, or move forward, towards the Execution of such unlawful and injurious Act, and yet do not actually execute it.</p>

            <p>SInce I have undertaken to discourse of the Nature of <hi>Riots,</hi> and there is some mention in Holy <hi>Scripture</hi> of <hi>Rioting,</hi> &amp;c. it will not be amiss to shew what <hi>Rioting</hi> is in <hi>Scripture</hi>-sence also.</p>
            <p>The Prodigal <hi>Son</hi> (in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.13,) is said to have wasted his substance with <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otous living</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

It is used again, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.6. where it is required that the Children of such as were to be ordained Elders, should be [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] <hi>not accused of Riot,</hi> that is, of leading a <hi>dissolute</hi> and <hi>profuse</hi> life. The same word is used again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4. and very well explained by the verse foregoing. For the Apostle having said (verse 3.) <hi>The time past of our lives may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in Lasciviousness, Lusts, Excess of Wine, Revellings, Banquetings and abominable Idolatries</hi>; adds verse 4.) <hi>Wherein they</hi> (the Gentiles, who yet walked in such things) <hi>think it strange, that you ran not with them to the same Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of</hi> Riot, <hi>viz.</hi> to walk in <hi>Lasciviousness, Lusts, Excess of Wine, Revellings, Banquetings,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>There is one place more in the New Testament, where we read the word <hi>Riot,</hi> and that is in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. where the Apostle speaks of some, who <hi>counted it pleasure to Riot in the day time.</hi> The Greek word there used is [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] which signifies <hi>Excess of Pleasures</hi> and <hi>effeminating Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies.</hi> It is used in the same sense, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.25. and <hi>Iames</hi> 5.5. in which last place it is joyned with a word that signifies to <hi>live wantonly. (Ye have lived in Pleasure on the Earth, and been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter; ye have condemned and killed the Iust,</hi> saith the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi>) a word not elsewhere used in the New Testament, save in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. where we read, <hi>She that liveth in Pleasure [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] is dead while she liveth.</hi> These are the <hi>Pleasures</hi> the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> called <hi>Riot.</hi> And this is all I remember to have read of <hi>Riot</hi> and <hi>Rioting</hi> in the New Testament.</p>
            <p>In the Old Testament, I meet with it but twice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20. <hi>Be not among Wine-bibbers; amongst Riotous Eaters of Flesh.</hi> Chap. 28.7. <hi>He that is a Companion of Riotous persons, shameth his Father.</hi> In the Margin, He that <hi>feedeth Gluttons,</hi> &amp;c. There is also a Marginal Reference to Chap. 29.3. where it is said, <hi>He that keepeth Company with Harlots spendeth his substance.</hi> In Latin these Texts are turned by <hi>Hierom, Pagnine, Montanus, Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Iunius,</hi> by the words <hi>Commessatio, Commessator,</hi> and <hi>Comedo</hi> (an old obsolete word) all signifying <hi>Gluttonous Gourman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing,</hi> or <hi>inordinate Eating and Drinking,</hi> whereby men do <hi>Riotously waste</hi> and <hi>consume</hi> their Estates. Let this suffice, without particular Application, to shew what <hi>Rioting</hi> and <hi>Rioters</hi> are in <hi>Scripture</hi>-sense.</p>
