         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT the Doctrine of <hi>Original
Sin,</hi> is one of the fundamental
Truths of our Christian Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath been alwayes owned in
the Church of God. And an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
part it is of that peculiar possession of
truth, which they enjoy, whose Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God is built upon, and resolved into
Divine Revelation. As the world by its <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
never knew God aright, so the Wise Men
of it were always utterly ignorant of this
inbred evil in themselves and others. With us
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and Conviction of it, lie in the
very foundation of all wherein we have to
do with God, in reference unto our pleasing
of him here, or obtaining the enjoyment of
him hereafter. It is also known what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it hath into the great truths concerning
the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, his mediation, the fruits
and effects of it, with all the benefits that
we are made partakers of thereby. Without
<pb facs="tcp:42900:4"/>
a supposition of it, not any of them can be truly
known, or savingly believed. For this cause
hath it been largely treated of by many holy
and <hi>Learned Men,</hi> both of old and of latter
dayes. Some have laboured in the discovery
of <hi>its nature,</hi> some of its <hi>guilt</hi> and demerit;
by whom also the <hi>truth</hi> concerning it hath
been vindicated from the opposition made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, in the past and present Ages. By most
these things have been considered in their <hi>full
extent</hi> and latitude, with respect unto all
men by nature, with the estate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them who are wholly under the power
and guilt of it. How thereby men are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enabled
and incapacitated in themselves to
answer the obedience required either in the
Law, or the Gospel, so as to free themselves
from the <hi>Curse</hi> of the one or to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
partakers of the <hi>blessing</hi> of the other,
hath been by many also fully evinced. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that there are <hi>Remainders</hi> of it abiding
in <hi>Believers</hi> after their Regeneration and
Conversion to God, as the Scripture abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
testifies; so it hath been fully taught and
confirmed; as also how the <hi>guilt</hi> of it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
unto them, and by what means the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
of it is weakened in them. All these things
I say have been largely treated on, to the great
benefit and edification of the Church. In what
<pb facs="tcp:42900:4"/>
we have now in design, we therfore take them
all for <hi>granted,</hi> and endeavour only farther
to carry on the discovery of it in its actings
and oppositions to the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of
God in Believers. Neither do I intend the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing
of any thing that hath been contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
about it. What the <hi>Scripture</hi> plainly
revealeth &amp; teacheth concerning it, what Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
evidently find by <hi>experience</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
what they may learn from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and acknowledgments of others, shall be
represented in a way suited unto the capacity
of the meanest and weakest who is concerned
therein. And many things seem to render the
handling of it at this season, not unnecessary.
The Effects and fruits of it which we see in
the Apostasies and backslidings of many, the
scandalous sins and miscarriages of some, and
the course and lives of the most, seem to call
for a due consideration of it. Besides of how
great concernment a full and clear acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the power of this <hi>Indwelling-Sin</hi>
(the matter design'd to be opened) is unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
to stir them up to watchfulness and
diligence, to faith and prayer, to call them to
repentance, humility, &amp; self-abasement, will
appear in our progress. These in general were
the ends aimed at in the ensuing Discourse,
which being at first composed and delivered
<pb facs="tcp:42900:5"/>
for the use and benefit of a <hi>few,</hi> is now by
the Providence of God made publick. And if
the <hi>Reader</hi> receive any advantage by these
weak endeavours, let him know that it is
his duty, as to give Glory unto God, so to
help them by his prayers, who in many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and Afflictions are willing to labour
in the Vineyard of the Lord, unto which work
they are called.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Indwelling-Sin in Believers, treated of by the
Apostle, Rom. 7. 21. The Place explained.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is of <hi>Indwelling-sin,</hi> and that in
the remainders of it in Persons
after their Conversion to God,
with its power, efficacy, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
that we intend to treat.
This also is the great design of
the Apostle, to manifest and
evince in <hi>c.</hi> 7. of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Many
indeed are the contests about the principal scope
of the Apostle in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> and in what state
the Person is, under the Law, or under Grace
whose condition he expresseth therein. I shall
not at present enter into that dispute, but take
that for granted, which may be undeniably proved
and evinced; namely, that it is the condition of
a <hi>Regenerate Person,</hi> with respect unto the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power of Indwelling-sin, which is there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and exemplified by, and in the Person of the
Apostle himself. In that discourse therefore of his,
shall the foundation be laid of what we have to
offer upon this subject. Not that I shall proceed
in an Exposition of his Revelation of this Truth,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42900:6"/>
as it lies in its own contexture, but only make
use of what is delivered by him, as occasion shall
offer it self. And here first occurreth, that which
he affirms, ver. 21. <hi>I find then a Law, that when I
would do good, evil is present with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>four things</hi> observable in these words.</p>
            <p>First, The Appellation he gives unto <hi>Indwelling-Sin,</hi>
whereby the expresseth its power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
it is a <hi>Law.</hi> For that which he terms a <hi>Law,</hi>
in this verse, he calls in the foregoing, <hi>sin that
dwelleth in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The way whereby he came to the
discovery of this <hi>Law,</hi> not absolutely, and in its
own nature, but in himself, he <hi>found</hi> it; <hi>I find a
Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The frame of his soul and inward
Man with this Law of Sin, and under its discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>He would do good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The state and activity of this <hi>Law,</hi>
when the soul is in that frame, when it would
do good, <hi>it is present with him.</hi> For what ends
and purposes we shall shew afterwards.</p>
            <p>The first thing observable is the Compellation
here used by the Apostle, he calls <hi>Indwelling-Sin</hi> a
<hi>Law.</hi> It is a <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Law</hi> is taken either properly, for a <hi>directive
Rule;</hi> or improperly, for an <hi>operative effective
Principle,</hi> which seems to have the force of a Law.
In its first sense, it is a Moral Rule which directs
and commands, and sundry wayes moves and
regulates the mind, and the will, as to the things
which it requires, or forbids. This is evidently
the general nature and work of a Law. Some
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42900:6"/>
things it commands, some things it forbids, with
<hi>Rewards</hi> and Penalties, which move and impel
men to do the one, and avoid the other. Hence
in a secondary sense, an <hi>inward principle,</hi> that
moves and enclines constantly unto any Actions,
is called a Law. The principle that is in the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of every thing, moving and carrying it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
its own end and rest, is called the <hi>Law of
Nature.</hi> In this respect every inward principle
that inclineth and urgeth unto operations or
actings suitable to it self, is a Law. So
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. The powerful and effectual working of
the Spirit and grace of Christ in the hearts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
is called the <hi>Law of the Spirit of life.</hi> And
for this reason doth the Apostle here call <hi>Indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-sin</hi>
a Law. It is a powerful and effectual
indwelling-principle, inclining and pressing unto
actions agreeable and suitable unto its own nature.
This and no other is the intention of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
in this expression. For although that term, a
Law, may sometimes intend a <hi>state</hi> and <hi>condition,</hi>
and if here so used, the meaning of the words
should be, <hi>I find that this is my condition, this is the
state of things with me,</hi> that when I would do
good evil is present with me, which makes no great
alteration in the principal intendment of the place;
yet properly it can denote nothing here, but the
chief <hi>subject</hi> treated of. For although the name of
a Law be variously used by the Apostle in this
Chapter; yet when it relates unto <hi>sin,</hi> it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
applyed by him to the condition of the
person, but only to express either the nature, or
the power of sin it self: so ver. 23. <hi>I see another
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42900:7"/>
Law in my members, warring against the Law of
my mind, and bringing me into captivity unto the
law of sin which is in my Members.</hi> That which he
here calls the <hi>Law of his mind,</hi> from the principal
subject and seat of it, is in it self no other but the
<hi>Law of the Spirit of life,</hi> which is in Christ Jesus,
<hi>chap.</hi> 8. 2. or the effectual power of the Spirit of
grace, as was said. But the <hi>Law</hi> as applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>sin,</hi> hath a double sense; for as in the first place,
<hi>I see a Law in my Members,</hi> it denotes the being
and nature of sin; so in the latter, <hi>leading into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
to the Law of sin which is in my Members,</hi> it
signifies its power &amp; efficacy. And both these are
comprised in the same name singly used, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.
Now that which we observe from this <hi>name,</hi> or
term of a <hi>Law</hi> attributed unto sin, is, That <hi>There
is an exceeding efficacy and power in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Indwelling-sin in Believers, with a constant
working towards evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is in Believers, 'tis a Law even <hi>in them,</hi>
though not <hi>to them.</hi> Though its rule be broken,
its strength weakned and impaired, its root mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
yet it is a <hi>Law</hi> still of great force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.
There where 'tis least felt, it is most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful.
Carnal men in reference unto spiritual &amp;
moral duties, are nothing but this Law, they do
nothing but from it, and by it. It is in them a
ruling and prevailing principle of all <hi>moral</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with reference unto a supernatural and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
end. I shall not consider it in them in whom
it hath most power, but in them in whom its
power is chiefly discovered and discerned, that
is in Believers, in the others only in order to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42900:7"/>
the farther conviction and manifestation thereof.</p>
            <p>2dly, The Apostle proposeth the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he discovered this Law in himself,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I find then,</hi> or therefore a <hi>Law.</hi> He
<hi>found</hi> it; it had been <hi>told</hi> him there was such a
Law, it had been <hi>preached</hi> unto him. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
him, that there was a <hi>Law of Sin.</hi> But it is
one thing for a man to know in general, that there
is a <hi>Law of Sin:</hi> Another thing for a man to
have an <hi>experience</hi> of the power of this Law of sin
in himself. It is preached to all; all men that
own the Scripture acknowledge it, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
therein; but they are but few that <hi>know</hi> it
in themselves, we should else have more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of it than we have, and more contendings
against it, and less fruits of it in the world. But
this is that which the Apostle affirms; not that
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it had been preached unto him,
but that he found it by experience in himself. <hi>I
find a Law;</hi> I have experience of its power and
efficacy. For a man to find his sickness and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
thereon from its effects, is another thing than
to hear a discourse about a disease from its causes.
And this experience is the great preservative of all
Divine Truths in the soul. This it is to know a
thing indeed, in reality, <hi>to know it for our selves,</hi>
when as we are taught it from the Word, so we
find it in our selves. Hence we observe,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Believers have experience of the power
and efficacy of Indwelling-Sin.</hi> They <hi>find</hi> it in
themselves, they <hi>find</hi> it as a Law. It h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th a self-evidencing
efficacy to them that are <hi>alive</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
it: They that find not its power, are under
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42900:8"/>
its Dominion. Whosoever contend against it,
shall know and find, that it is present with them,
that it is powerful in them. He shall find the
<hi>stream</hi> to be strong, who swims against it, though
he who rouls along with it, be insensible
of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The general frame of Believers not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the inhabitation of <hi>this Law of Sin,</hi>
is here also expressed. <hi>They would do good.</hi> This
Law is present <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The
habitual inclination of their will is unto good.
This Law in them, is not a Law unto them, as it
is to Unbelievers. They are not <hi>wholly</hi> obnoxious
to its power, nor <hi>morally</hi> unto its commands.
Grace hath the Soveraignty in their souls; This
gives them a <hi>Will</hi> unto good; <hi>they would do good,</hi>
that is, alwayes and constantly, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to commit sin,</hi> is to make a trade of
sin, to make it a mans business to sin; so it is said, a
Believer doth not <hi>commit sin.</hi> And so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to do that which is good; to will to do so; is to
have the <hi>habitual</hi> bent and inclination of the will
set on that which is good, that is, morally and
spiritually good, which is the proper subject treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of; whence is our Third Observation.</p>
            <p>There is, and there is through grace kept up in
Believers, a constant and ordinarily prevailing wil
of doing good, notwithstanding the power and
efficacy of Indwelling-Sin to the contrary.</p>
            <p>This in their <hi>worst</hi> condition, distinguisheth them
from Unbelievers in their <hi>best.</hi> The <hi>Will</hi> in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
is under the power of the Law of sin. The
opposition they make to sin, either in the root, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42900:8"/>
branches of it, is from their light, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;
the <hi>will of sinning</hi> in them is never taken
away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take away all other considerations &amp; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances,
whereof we shall treat afterwards, and
they would sin willingly always. Their faint en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to answer their convictions, are far from
<hi>a will of doing that which is good.</hi> They will plead
indeed, that they would leave their sins, if they
could, and they would fain do better than they do.
But it is the <hi>working</hi> of their Light and Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
not any spiritual <hi>inclination</hi> of their wills,
which they intend by that expression. For where
there is a will of doing good, there is a choice of
that which is good for its own excellency sake,
because it is desirable and suitable to the soul, and
therefore to be preferred before that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Now this is not in any unbelievers; they
do not, they cannot so chuse that which is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
good, nor is it so excellent or suitable unto
any principle that is in them: only they have some
desires to attain that <hi>end,</hi> whereunto that which is
good doth lead, and to avoid that evil which the
neglect of it tends unto. And these also are for
the most part so weak and languid in many of
them, that they put them not upon any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
endeavours; witness that luxury, sloth,
worldliness and security, that the generality of
men are even drowned in. But in believers there
is a will of doing good, an habitual disposition and
inclination in their wills unto that which is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
good. And where this is, it is accompanied
with answerable effects. The will is the principle
of our moral actions, and therefore unto the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42900:9"/>
disposition</hi> thereof, will the general course
of our actings be suited. Good things will proceed
from the good treasures of the heart. Nor can this
disposition be evidenced to be in any but by its
fruits. A will of doing good, without doing good,
is but pretended.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is yet another thing remaining
in these words of the Apostle, arising from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that the <hi>presence</hi> of sin hath unto the <hi>time</hi> and
<hi>season</hi> of <hi>duty: When I would do good,</hi> (saith he)
<hi>evils is present with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two thing to be considered in the
<hi>will of doing good,</hi> that is in Believers.</p>
            <p>First, There is its <hi>habitual residence</hi> in them. They
have always an <hi>habitual inclination of will</hi> unto
that which is good. And this habitual preparation
for good is always present with them, as the
Apostle expresses it, ver. 18. of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are special <hi>times</hi> and <hi>seasons</hi> for
the exercise of that principle. There is a, <hi>When I
would do good,</hi> a season wherein this or that good,
this or that duty is to be performed and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
suitably unto the habitual preparation
and inclination of the will.</p>
            <p>Unto these two, there are two things in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling-sin</hi>
opposed. To the <hi>gracious principle</hi>
residing in the will, inclining unto that which is
spiritually good, it is opposed as it is a <hi>Law</hi> that is a
<hi>contrary priciple</hi> inclining unto evil, with an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
from that which is good. Unto the second,
or the actual willing of this or that good in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
unto this, <hi>when I would do good,</hi> is opposed
the presence of this Law, <hi>evil is present with me,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:42900:9"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; evil is at hand and ready
to oppose the <hi>actual accomplishment</hi> of the good
aimed at. Whence,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Indwelling-sin is effectually operative
in rebelling and inclining to evil, when the will of
doing good is in a particular manner active, and
inclining unto obedience.</p>
            <p>And this is the description of him who is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
and a sinner, as every one who is the <hi>former,</hi>
he is the <hi>latter</hi> also. These are the contrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and the contrary operations that are in him.
The principles are a <hi>will of doing good</hi> on the one
hand, from grace, and a <hi>Law of sin</hi> on the other.
Their adverse actings and operations are insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in those expressions, <hi>When I would do good,
evil is present with me.</hi> And these both are more
fully expressed by the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>For the
flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against
the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so that I cannot do the things that I would.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here lie the springs of the whole course of
our obedience. An acquaintance with these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
principles, and their actings, is the principal
part of our wisdom. They are, upon the matter,
next to the free grace of God in our Justification
by the blood of Christ, the only things wherein
the glory of God and our own souls are concern'd.
These are the springs of our holiness, and our sins,
of our joys and troubles, of our refreshments and
sorrows. It is then all our concernments to be
throughly acquainted with these things, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to walk with God, or to glorifie him in this
world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:42900:10"/>
And hence we may see what <hi>wisdom</hi> is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
in the guiding &amp; management of our hearts &amp;
ways before God. Where the <hi>subjects</hi> of a Ruler
are in fewds &amp; oppositions one against another,
unless great <hi>wisdom</hi> be used in the government of
the whole, all things will quickly be ruinous in
that State. There are these contrary principles in
the hearts of Believers, and if they labour not to
be spiritually wise, how shall they be able to steer
their course aright? Many men live in the dark
to themselves all their days; what ever else they
know, they know not themselves. They know
their outward estates, how <hi>rich</hi> they are, and the
condition of their bodies as to health and sickness
they are careful to examine; but as to their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man,</hi> and their principles as to God and
Eternity, they know little or nothing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Indeed few labour to grow <hi>wise</hi> in this
matter, few study themselves as they ought, are
acquainted with the evil of their own hearts as
they ought, on which yet the whole course of their
obedience, and consequently of their eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
doth depend. This therefore is our <hi>wisdom,</hi>
and it is a needful wisdom, if we have any design
to please God, or to avoid that which is a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to the eyes of his glory.</p>
            <p>We shall find also in our inquiry hereinto, what
<hi>diligence</hi> and watchfulness is required unto a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
conversation. There is a constant <hi>enemy</hi> unto
it in every ones heart: and what an enemy it
is we shall afterwards show, for this is our design
to discover him to the uttermost. In the mean
time we may well bewail the woful sloth and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42900:10"/>
that is in the most, even of Professors.
They live and walk as though they intended to
go to heaven hood-wink<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and asleep, as though
they had no <hi>enemy</hi> to deal withall. Their mistake
therefore and folly will be fully laid open in our
Progress.</p>
            <p>That which I shall principally fix upon, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
unto our present design, from this place
of the Apostle, is that which was first laid down,
namely, that <hi>there is an exceeding efficacy and power
in the remainder of indwelling-sin in Believers, with
a constant inclination and working towards evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Awake</hi> therefore, all of you in whose hearts are
any thing of the ways of God. Your <hi>enemy</hi> is not
only <hi>upon</hi> you, as on <hi>Sampson</hi> of old, but is <hi>in you</hi>
also. He is at work by all ways of <hi>force</hi> and <hi>craft,</hi>
as we shall see. Would you not dishonour God
and his Gospel, would you not scandalize the Saints
and ways of God, would you not wound your
consciences, and endanger your souls, would you
not grieve the good and holy Spirit of God, the
Author of all your comforts; would you keep
your garments undefiled, and escape the woful
temptations and pollutions of the days wherein we
live; would you be preserved from the number of
the <hi>Apostates</hi> in these latter days? awake to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of this cursed <hi>enemy,</hi> which is the spring
of all these and innumerable other evils, as also of
the ruine of all the souls that perish in this world.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>THat which we have proposed unto conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is the <hi>power and efficacy of Indwelling-sin.</hi>
The ways whereby it may be evinced are
many. I shall begin with the <hi>Appellation</hi> of it in
the place before mentioned, it is a <hi>Law; I find a
Law,</hi> saith the Apostle. It is because of its power
and efficacy that it is so called; so is also the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of grace in Believers the <hi>Law of the spirit of
life,</hi> as we observed before, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. which is the
<hi>exceeding greatness of the power of God in them,
Ephes.</hi> 1. 19. Where there is a <hi>Law</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is power.</p>
            <p>We shall therefore shew both what belongs unto
it, as it is a <hi>Law</hi> in general, and also what is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
or proper in it, as being <hi>such a Law</hi> as we have
described.</p>
            <p>There are in general two things attending every
<hi>Law,</hi> as such.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Dominion. Rom.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>The Law hath domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over a man whilst he liveth;</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it <hi>Lordeth</hi> it over a man. Where any Law takes
place, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it hath <hi>dominion.</hi> It is properly the
<hi>act of a Superiour,</hi> and it belongs to its nature to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
obedience by way of dominion. Now there is
a two-fold <hi>dominion,</hi> as there is a two-fold Law.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42900:11"/>
There is a <hi>moral</hi> authoritative dominion over a
man, and there is a <hi>real effective</hi> dominion in a
man. The first is an affection of the Law of God,
the latter of the Law of sin. The Law of sin hath
not in it self a <hi>moral dominion,</hi> it hath not a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
dominion or authority over any man, but it
hath that which is equivalent unto it; whence it
is said <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to <hi>reign</hi> as a King, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12. and
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to <hi>Lord</hi> it, or have dominion, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.
as a Law in general is said to have, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 1. But
because it hath lost its <hi>complete dominion,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
unto Believers, of whom alone we speak, I
shall not insist upon it in this utmost extent of its
power. But even <hi>in</hi> them it is a Law still, though
not a <hi>Law unto</hi> them; yet, as was said, it is a
Law <hi>in</hi> them. And though it have not a complete,
and as it were a <hi>rightful dominion</hi> over them, yet
it will have a <hi>domination</hi> as to some things in them.
It is still a Law, and that in them, so that all its
actings are the actings of a Law; that is, it acts
with power, though it have lost its complete
power of ruling in them. Though it be <hi>weakened,</hi>
yet its nature is not <hi>changed.</hi> It is a Law still, and
therefore powerful. And as its particular workings
(which we shall afterwards consider) are the
ground of this Appellation, so the term it self teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us in general, what we are to expect from it,
and what endeavours it will use for <hi>dominion,</hi> to
which it hath been accustomed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A Law, as a Law, hath an efficacy
to <hi>provoke</hi> those that are obnoxious unto it unto
the things that it requireth. A Law hath <hi>Rewards</hi>
and <hi>Punishments</hi> accompanying of it. These se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42900:12"/>
prevail on them to whom they are propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
though the things commanded be not much
desirable, And generally all Laws have their effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
on the minds of men from the <hi>Rewards</hi> and
<hi>Punishments</hi> that are annexed unto them. Nor is
this Law without this spring of power: it hath
its rewards and punishments. The <hi>pleasures</hi> of sin
are the <hi>rewards</hi> of sin; a reward that most men
lose their souls to obtain. By this the Law of
sin, contended in <hi>Moses</hi> against the Law of grace,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25, 26. <hi>He chose rather to suffer afflictions
with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of
sin for a season; for he looked unto the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of reward.</hi> The contest was in his mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Law of sin, and the Law of grace. The
motive on the part of the Law of sin, wherewith
it sought to draw him over, and wherewith it
prevails on the most, was the <hi>reward</hi> that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto him, namely that he should have the
present enjoyment of the <hi>pleasures of sin,</hi> By this
it contended against the reward annexed unto the
Law of Grace, called the <hi>Recompence of reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this <hi>sorry reward</hi> doth this Law keep the
world in obedience to its commands. And expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
shew us, of what power it is to influence
the minds of men. It hath also <hi>Punishments</hi> that it
threatens men with, who labour to cast off its
yoke. What ever evil, trouble or danger in the
world attends Gospel obedience; what ever hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
or violence is to be offered to the sensual part
of our natures in a strict course of mortification,
sin makes use of as if they were <hi>punishments</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the neglect of its commands. By these it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42900:12"/>
prevails on the <hi>fearful,</hi> who shall have no share
in life eternal, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. And it is hard to say
by whether of these, its pretended rewards, or
pretended punishments, it doth most prevail, in
whether of them its greatest strength doth lie.
By its <hi>rewards</hi> it inticeth men to sins of commission,
as they are called, in ways and actions tending to
the satisfaction of its lusts. By its <hi>punishments</hi> it
induceth men to the omitting of duties, a course
tending to no less a pernicious event than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
By which of these the Law of sin hath its
greatest success in and upon the souls of men, is not
evident, and that because they are seldom or never
separated, but equally take place on the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
But this is certain, that by tenders and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the pleasures of sin on the one hand, by
threats of the deprivation of all sensual content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and the infliction of temporal evils on the
other, it hath an exceeding efficacy on the minds
of men, oftentimes of Believers themselves. Unless
a man be prepared to reject the reasonings that
will offer themselves from the one and the other
of these, there is no standing before the <hi>power</hi> of
this Law. The world falls before them every day,
With what deceit and violence they are urged
and imposed on the minds of men, we shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
declare; as also what advantages they
have to prevail upon them. Look on the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of men, and you shall find them wholly by
these means at sins disposal. Do the profits and
pleasures of sin lie before them, nothing can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them from reaching after them. Do diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and inconveniencies attend the duties of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42900:13"/>
Gospel, they will have nothing to do with them,
and so are wholly given up to the Rule and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of this Law.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ght</hi> in general we have into the power
and efficacy of Indwelling-sin from the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a <hi>Law,</hi> whereof it is partaker.</p>
            <p>We may consider nextly what <hi>kind of Law</hi> in
particular it is, which will farther evidence that
power of it, which we are enquiring after. It is
not an outward, written, commanding, directing
<hi>Law,</hi> but an inbred, working, impelling, urging
<hi>Law.</hi> A Law <hi>proposed</hi> unto us, is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for efficacy to a Law <hi>inbred</hi> in us. <hi>Adam</hi>
had a Law of sin <hi>proposed</hi> to him in his temptation,
but because he had no Law of Sin <hi>inbred</hi> and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in him, he might have withstood it. An <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred</hi>
Law must needs be effectual. Let us take
an example from that Law, which is contrary to
this Law of Sin. The Law of God, was at first <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred</hi>
and natural unto man, it was concreated with
his faculties, and was their <hi>rectitude</hi> both in being
and operation in reference to his end of living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and glorifying of him. Hence it had an
especial power in the whole soul, to enable it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all obedience, yea, and to make all obedience
<hi>easie</hi> and pleasant. Such is the power of an inbred
Law. And though this Law as to the <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
of it, be now by nature cast out of the soul,
yet the remaining sparks of it, because they are
inbred, are very powerful and effectual, as the
Apostle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. Afterwards God
renews this Law, and writes it in Tables of Stone;
but what is the efficacy of this Law; will it now
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42900:13"/>
as it is external, and proposed unto men, enable
them to perform the things that it exacts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires?
not at all. God knew it would not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it were turned to an <hi>internal Law</hi> again; that
is untill of a moral outward rule, it be turned
into an inward real principle. Wherefore God
makes his Law <hi>internal</hi> again, and implants it on
the heart as it was at first, when he intends to
give it power to produce obedience in his people,
Jer. 31. 31, 32, 33. <hi>I will put my Law in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi> This is
that which God fixeth on, as it were upon a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the insufficiency of an outward Law lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
men unto Obedience. The written Law,
saith he, will not do it; Mercies and Deliverances
from distress will not effect it; Trials and Afflictions
will not accomplish it; then saith the Lord, will
I take another course; I will turn the <hi>written Law,</hi>
into an <hi>internal living Principle,</hi> in their hearts,
and that will have such an efficacy, as shall assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>make</hi> them my People, and <hi>keep</hi> them so. Now
such is this Law of Sin, it is an <hi>Indwelling-Law,
Rom.</hi> 7. 17. It is <hi>sin that dwelleth in me,</hi> ver. 20.
<hi>Sin that dwelleth in me,</hi> ver. 21. It is <hi>present with
me,</hi> ver. 23. It is <hi>in my Members;</hi> yea, it is so far in
a man, as in some sense it is said to be the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
ver. 18. <hi>I know that in me, that is in my flesh
there dwelleth no good thing.</hi> The <hi>flesh,</hi> which is the
Seat and Throne of this Law, yea, which indeed is
this Law, is in some sense the man himself, as <hi>Grace</hi>
also is the new man. Now from this considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, that it is an <hi>Indwelling-Law</hi> inclining and
moving to sin, as an inward habit or Principle, it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42900:14"/>
hath sundry advantages increasing its strength and
farthering its power. As,</p>
            <p>First, It alwayes <hi>abides</hi> in the soul, it is never ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
The Apostle twice useth that expression, it
<hi>dwelleth</hi> in me. There is its constant residence and
habitation. If it <hi>came</hi> upon the soul only at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
seasons, much obedience might be perfectly
accomplished in its absence. Yea, and as they deal
with <hi>usurping Tyrants,</hi> whom they intend to thrust
out of a City, the gates might be sometimes shut
against it, that it might not return. The soul might
<hi>fortifie</hi> it self against it. But the soul is its <hi>home,</hi>
there it <hi>dwells,</hi> and is no wanderer. Where ever
you are, whatever you are about, this Law of Sin is
alwayes <hi>in you.</hi> In the best that you do, and in the
worst. Men little consider what a dangerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
is alwayes at <hi>home</hi> with them. When they
are in Company, when alone, by night or by day,
all is one, sin is with them. There is a living <hi>coal</hi>
continually in their houses, which if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be not
looked unto, will <hi>fire</hi> them, and it may be <hi>consume</hi>
them. O the woful security of poor souls! How
little do the most of men think of this <hi>Inbred</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that is never from home! How little for the
most part doth the <hi>watchfulness</hi> of any Professors
answer the danger of their state and condition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is alwayes <hi>ready</hi> to apply it self to
every end and purpose that it serves unto. It doth
not only <hi>dwell in me,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>but when
I would do good, it is present with me:</hi> There is
somewhat more in that expression, than meer <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling.</hi>
An <hi>Inmate</hi> may dwell in an house, and
yet not be alwayes m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dling with what the good
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42900:14"/>
man of the house hath to do, (that so we may keep
to the allusion of <hi>Indwelling,</hi> used by the Apostle.)
But it is so with this Law, it doth so <hi>dwell</hi> in us,
as that it will be <hi>present with us</hi> in every thing we
do, yea, oftentimes when with most <hi>earnestness</hi> we
desire to be quit of it, with most <hi>violence</hi> it will put
it self upon us: <hi>When I would do good, it is present
with me.</hi> Would you pray, would you hear, would
you give Alms, would you meditate, would you
be in any duty acting faith on God, and love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, would you work righteousness, would
you resist temptations, this troublesome perplexing
<hi>Indweller</hi> will still more or less put it self upon
you, and be present with you; so that you cannot
perfectly and compleatly accomplish the thing that
is good, as our Apostle speaks, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. Sometimes
men by hearkning to their temptations, do stir up,
excite and provoke their lusts; and no wonder if
then they find them <hi>present</hi> and active. But it will
be so, when with all our endeavours we labour to
be free from them. This Law of Sin dwells in us,
that is, it adheres as a depraved principle unto our
<hi>minds</hi> in <hi>darkness,</hi> and vanity, unto our Affections
in sensuality, unto our wills in a loathing of, and
aversation from that which is good, and by some,
more, or all of these, is continually putting it
self upon us, in inclinations, motions, or suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to evil, when we would be most gladly quit
of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It being an indwelling-Law, it applyes
it self to its work with great <hi>facility</hi> and easiness,
like the sin that doth so <hi>easily beset us, Heb.</hi> 12. 1. It
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath a great <hi>facility</hi> and easiness in the application of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42900:15"/>
it self unto its work; it needs no doors to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto it, it needs no Engines to work by. The
soul cannot apply it self to any duty of a man, but
it must be by the exercise of those <hi>faculties</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Law hath its residence. Is the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or the <hi>Mind</hi> to be applyed unto any thing?
there it is in ignorance, darkness, vanity, folly,
madness. Is the <hi>Will</hi> to be engaged, there it is also
in spiritual deadness, stubborness, and the roots of
obstinacy? Is the heart and <hi>Affections</hi> to be set on
work, there it is in inclinations to the world, and
present things, and sensuality, with proneness to all
manner of defilements? Hence it is <hi>easie</hi> for it to
insinuate it self into all that we do, and to hinder
all that is good, and to further all sin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
It hath an <hi>intimacy,</hi> an inwardness with the
soul, and therefore in all that we do, doth easily
beset us. It possesseth those very faculties of the
soul, whereby we must do, what we do, what ever
it be, good or evil. Now all these advantages it hath
as it is a <hi>Law,</hi> as an <hi>Indwelling-Law</hi> which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests
its power and efficacy. It is alwayes resident
in the soul, it puts its self upon all its actings, and
that with easiness and facility.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>Law</hi> which the Apostle asfirms, that
he <hi>found</hi> in himself, this is the title that he gives
unto the powerful and effectual remainders of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling-Sin,
even in Believers, and these general
evidences of its power from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Appellation have
we. Many there are in the world, who <hi>find</hi> not this
Law in them, who whatever they have been
taught in the word, have not a spiritual sense and
experience of the power of Indwelling-Sin, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42900:15"/>
that because they are wholly under the Dominion
of it. They find not that there is <hi>darkness</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their minds, because they are darkness it
self, and darkness will discover nothing. They
find not <hi>deadness</hi> and an indisposition in their
hearts and wills to God, because they are <hi>dead</hi>
wholly in trespasses and sins. They are at peace
with their lusts, by being in bondage unto them.
And this is the state of most men in the world,
which makes them wofully despise all their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
concernments. Whence is it that men follow
and pursue the world with so much greediness,
that they neglect Heaven, and life, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
for it every day? Whence is it that some
pursue their sensuality with delight, they will
drink, and revel, and have their sports, let others
say what they please? Whence is it that so many
live so unprofitably under the word, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
so little of what is spoken unto them,
that they practise less of what they understand,
and will by no means be stirred up to answer the
mind of God in his calls unto them? It is all from
this Law of Sin, and the power of it that rules and
bears sway in Men, that all these things do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
but it is not such persons of whom at present
we particularly treat.</p>
            <p>From what hath been spoken, it will ensue, that
if there be such a Law in Believers, it is doubtless
their duty to <hi>find</hi> it out, to find it so to be.</p>
            <p>The more they find its power, the less they will
feel its effects. It will not at all advantage a man
to have an <hi>hectical</hi> distemper, and not to discover
it; a fire lying secretly in his house, and not to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42900:16"/>
know it. So much as Men find of this Law i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them, so much they will <hi>abhor</hi> it and themselves,
and no more. Proportionably also to their discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it, will be their <hi>earnestness</hi> for Grace; not
will it rise higher. All watchfulness and <hi>diligence</hi>
in obedience will be answerable also thereunto.
Upon this one hinge, or finding out, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing
the power and the efficacy of this Law of
Sin, turns the whole course of our lives. Ignorance
of it breeds senslesness, carelesness, sloth, security
and pride, all which the Lords soul abhors. Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
into great, open, conscience-wasting, scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
sins, are from want of a due spiritual conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this Law. Enquire then how it is with
your souls, what do you find of this Law, what
experience have you of its power and efficacy? Do
you find it dwelling in you, alwayes present with
you, exciting it self, or putting forth its poison with
facility and easiness, at all times, in all your duties,
<hi>when you would do good?</hi> what humiliation, what
self-abasement, what intensness in prayer, what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
what watchfulness doth this call for at your
hands? What spiritual wisdom do you stand in need
of? What supplies of Grace, what assistance of the
Holy Ghost will be hence also discovered? I fear we
have few of us a diligence proportionable to our
danger.</p>

               <p>The Seat or subject of the Law of Sin. The
Heart, What meant thereby. Properties of
the Heart as possessed by sin. Unsearchable.
Deceitful. Whence that Deceit ariseth. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
of these Considerations.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving manifested <hi>Indwelling-Sin</hi> whereof we
treat in the remainders of it in Believers, to be
a <hi>Law,</hi> and evinced in general, the power of it
from thence, we shall now proceede to give parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
instances of its efficacy and advantages, from
some things that generally relate unto it as such.
And these are three. First, Its <hi>seat</hi> and subject:
Secondly, Its <hi>natural</hi> properties; and Thirdly, Its
<hi>operations</hi> and the manner thereof, which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
we aim at, and shall attend unto.</p>
            <p>First, For the <hi>Seat</hi> and subject of this Law of
Sin, the Scripture every where assigns it to be the
<hi>heart.</hi> There <hi>Indwelling-Sin</hi> keeps its especial resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
It hath invaded and possessed the Throne
of God himself, Eccles. 9. 3. <hi>Madness is in the heart
of men whilest they live.</hi> This is their madness, or
the root of all that madness which appears in their
lives, Matth. 15. 19. <hi>Out of the heart proceed evil
thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications,
Thefts, false Witness, Blasphemies, &amp;c.</hi> There are
many outward temptations and provocations that
befall men, which excite and stir them up unto these
evils. But they do but as it were, open the Vessel,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42900:17"/>
and let out what is laid up and stored in it. The
root, rise, and spring of all these things is in the
<hi>heart.</hi> Temptations and occasions put nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a man, but only draw out what was in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Hence is that summary description of the
whole work and effect of this Law of sin, Gen. 6. 5.
<hi>Every imagination of the thoughts of Mans heart is
only evil continually;</hi> So also, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 21. The
whole work of the Law of Sin, from its first rise,
its first coyning of actual sin, is here described,
and its seat, its work-house, is said to be the <hi>heart.</hi>
And so it is called by our Saviour, <hi>The evil treasure
of the heart,</hi> Luke 6. 45. <hi>An evil man, out of the evil
treasure of his heart, bringeth forth evil things.</hi>
This <hi>treasure</hi> is the prevailing principle of moral
actions that is in men. So in the beginning of the
Verse, our Saviour calls <hi>Grace</hi> the <hi>good treasure</hi> of
the heart of a good man, whence that which is good
doth proceed. It is a principle constantly and <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly</hi>
inciting and stirring up unto, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bringing forth actions conformable, and like
unto it, of the same kind and nature with its self.
And it is also called a <hi>treasure</hi> for its abundance. It
will never be exhausted, it is not wasted by mens
spending on it: yea, the more lavish men are of this
stock, the more they draw out of this treasure, the
more it grows and abounds: As men do not spend
their Grace, but increase it by its exercises, no
more do they their Indwelling-Sin. The more
men exercise their Grace in duties of obedience,
the more it is strengthened and encreased. And the
more men exert and put forth the fruits of their
lust, the more is that enraged and encreased in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42900:17"/>
them. It feeds upon its self, swallows up its own
poyson, and grows thereby. The more men sin,
the more are they inclined unto sin. It is from
the <hi>deceitfulness</hi> of this Law of Sin, whereof we
shall speak afterwards at large, that men perswade
themselves, that by this or that particular sin, they
shall so satisfie their lusts, as that they shall need to
sin no more. Every sin increaseth the <hi>principle,</hi>
and fortifieth the habit of sinning. It is an <hi>evil
treasure</hi> that increaseth by doing evil. And where
doth this treasure lye? It is in the <hi>heart,</hi> there it is
laid up, there it is kept in safety. All the men in
the world, all the Angels in Heaven, cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess
a man of this treasure, it is so sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely stored
in the heart.</p>
            <p>The <hi>heart</hi> in the Scripture is variously used.
Sometimes for the <hi>mind</hi> and understanding; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the <hi>will;</hi> sometimes for the <hi>Affections;</hi>
sometimes for the <hi>Conscience;</hi> sometimes for the
whole soul. Generally it denotes the <hi>whole soul of
man,</hi> and all the faculties of it, not absolutely, but as
they are all one principle of moral operations, as they
all concurr in our doing good or evil. The <hi>mind</hi>
as it enquireth, discerneth, and judgeth what is
to be done, what refused; the <hi>Will,</hi> as it <hi>chuseth,</hi> or
<hi>refuseth,</hi> and avoids; the <hi>Affections</hi> as they <hi>like</hi> or
<hi>dislike,</hi> cleave to, or have an aversation from that
which is proposed to them; the <hi>conscience</hi> as it
warns, and determines, are all together called the
<hi>heart.</hi> And in this sense it is that we say the seat
and subject of this Law of Sin is the <hi>heart</hi> of man.
Only we may add, that the Scripture speaking of
the heart, as the principle of mens good or evil
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42900:18"/>
actions, doth usually insinuate together with it two
things belonging unto the manner of their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
            <p>First, A <hi>suitableness</hi> and pleasingness unto the
soul in the things that are done. When men take
delight, and are pleased in and with what they do,
they are said to do it <hi>heartily</hi> with their whole
hearts. Thus when God himself blesseth his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in love and delight, he sayes, he doth it with
<hi>his whole heart, and his whole soul,</hi> Jer. 32. 41.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Resolution and constancy in such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And this also is denoted in the <hi>Metaphorical</hi>
expression before used of a <hi>Treasure,</hi> from whence
men do constantly take out the things which either
they stand in need of; or do intend to use.</p>
            <p>This is the subject, the seat, the dwelling place
of the Law of Sin. The <hi>heart</hi> as it is the entire
principle of moral operations, of doing good or
evil, as out of it proceed good or evil. Here
dwells our Enemie: This is the Fort, the <hi>Cittadel</hi>
of this Tyrant, where it maintains a rebellion
against God all our dayes. Sometimes it hath more
strength, and consequently more success; someti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
less of the one, and of the other, but is alwayes
in rebellion whilest we live.</p>
            <p>That we may in our passage take a little view
of the strength and power of sin from this seat
and subject of it, we may consider one or two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the heart that exceedingly contribute
thereunto. It is like an Enemy in war, whose
strength and power, lye not only in his <hi>numbers,</hi>
and force of Men or Arms, but also in the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable
Forts that he doth possess. And such is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42900:18"/>
the <hi>heart</hi> to this enemy of God and our souls, as
will appear from the properties of it, whereof one
or two shall be mentioned.</p>
            <p>First, It is <hi>unsearchahle. Jer.</hi> 17. 9, 10. <hi>Who can
know the heart? I the Lord search it.</hi> The heart of
man is pervious to God only; hence he takes the
honour of <hi>searching the heart</hi> to be as peculiar to
himself, and as fully declaring him to be God, as
any other glorious Attribute of his Nature. We
know not the hearts of one another, we know not
<hi>our own hearts</hi> as we ought. Many there are that
know not their hearts as to their general bent and
disposition, whether it be good or bad, sincere and
sound, or corrupt and naught; but no one know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all the secret <hi>intrigues,</hi> the windings and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the actings and aversations of his own heart.
Hath any one the perfect measure of his own light
and darkness? Can any one know what actings
of chusing or aversation his Will will bring forth,
upon the proposal of that endless variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that it is to be exercised with? Can any
one traverse the various mutability of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Do the secret springs of acting and refusing
in the soul, lie before the eyes of any man? Doth
any one know what will be the motions of the
mind or will, in such and such conjunctions of
things? Such a suiting of objects, such a pretension
of reasonings, such an appearance of things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable?
All in heaven and earth but the <hi>Infinite</hi>
All-seeing God, are utterly ignorant of these
things. In this <hi>unsearchable heart</hi> dwells the Law
of sin, and much of its security, and consequently
of its strength, lies in this, that it is past our finding
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42900:19"/>
out. We fight with an enemy whose <hi>secret strength</hi>
we cannot discover, whom we cannot follow into
its retirements. Hence oftentimes, when we are
ready to think sin quite ruined, after a while we
find it was but out of fight. It hath coverts and
retreats in an <hi>unsearchable heart,</hi> whither we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pursue it. The soul may perswade it self all is
well, when sin may be safe in the hidden darkness
of the mind, which 'tis impossible that he should
look into, for what ever makes manifest is <hi>light.</hi>
It may suppose the <hi>will of sinning</hi> is utterly taken
away, when yet there is an unsearchable reserve
for a more suitable object, a more vigorous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
than at present it is tried withal. Hath a
man had a contest with any lust, and a blessed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over it by the holy Ghost, as to that present
trial; when he thinks it is utterly expelled, he ere
long finds that it was but retired out of fight. It
can lie so close in the minds darkness, in the wills
indisposition, in the disorder and carnality of the
affections, that no eye can discover it. The best of
our wisdom is but to watch its first appearances,
to catch its first <hi>under-earth heavings</hi> and workings
and to set our selves in opposition to them; for to
follow it into the secret corners of the <hi>heart,</hi> that
we cannot do. It is true, there is yet a relief in
this case, namely that he to whom the work of
destroying the Law of sin, and body of death in
us is principally committed, namely the holy
Ghost, comes with his Ax to the very root, neither
is there any thing in an unsearchable heart that is
not open and naked unto him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. But we
in a way of duty may hence see what an enemy we
have to deal withall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42900:19"/>
Secondly, As it is unsearchable, so it is <hi>deceitful,</hi>
as in the place above mentioned; it is <hi>deceitful
above all things,</hi> incomparably so. There is great
<hi>deceit</hi> in the dealings of men in the world, great
in their counsels and contrivances in reference to
their affairs private and publick; great deceit in
their words and actings: the world is full of deceit
and fraud. But all this is nothing to the <hi>deceit</hi> that
is in mans heart <hi>towards himself,</hi> for that is the
meaning of the expression in this place, and not
towards others. Now incomparable deceitfulness,
added to <hi>unsearchableness,</hi> gives a great addition
and encrease of strength of the Law of sin, upon
the account of its seat and subject. I speak not yet
of the deceitfulness of sin it self, but the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>heart</hi> where it is seated. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 25.
<hi>There are seven abominations in the heart;</hi> that is,
not only many, but an absolute complete number,
as <hi>seven</hi> denotes: and they are such abominations
as consist in deceitfulness; so the caution fore-going
insinuates, <hi>Trust him not;</hi> for it is only <hi>deceit</hi> that
should make us <hi>not to trust</hi> in that degree and
measure which the object is cabable of.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>deceitfulness</hi> of the heart, whereby
it is exceedingly advantaged in its harbouring of
sin, lies chiefly in these two things.</p>
            <p>First, That it abounds in <hi>contradictions,</hi> so that it
is not to be found and dealt withall according to
any constant rule, and way of procedure. There
are some men that have much of this from their
natural constitution, or from other causes in their
conversation. They seem to be made up of <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions;</hi>
sometimes to be very <hi>wise</hi> in their affairs,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42900:20"/>
sometimes very <hi>foolish;</hi> very open, and very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
very <hi>facile,</hi> and very obstinate; very easie
to be entreated, and very revengeful, all in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
height. This is generally accounted a
bad character, and is seldom found but when it
proceeds from some notable predominant lust.
But in general, in respect of moral good or evil,
duty or sin, it is so with the heart of every man;
flaming hot, and key cold; weak, and yet stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born;
obstinate, and facile. The frame of the heart
is ready to <hi>contradict</hi> it self every moment. Now
you would think you had it all for such a frame,
such a way; anon it is quite otherwise: so that
none know what to expect from it. The rise of
this is the disorder that is brought upon all its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
by sin. God created them all in a perfect
harmony and union. The Mind and Reason were
in perfect subjection and subordination to God,
and his Will; the Will answered in its choice of
good, the discovery made of it by the mind; the
Affections constantly and evenly followed the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and Will. The minds subjection to
God was the spring of the orderly and <hi>harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
motion of the soul, and all the wheels in it. That
being disturbed by sin, the rest of the faculties
move cross and contrary one to another; the Will
chuseth not the good which the Mind discovers,
the Affections delight not in that which the Will
chuseth, but all jar and <hi>interfere,</hi> cross and rebel
against each other. This we have got by our
falling from God. Hence sometimes the Will leads,
the Judgment follows. Yea, commonly the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
that should attend upon all, get the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42900:20"/>
and draw the whole soul captive after
them. And hence it is, as I said, that the heart is
made up of so many <hi>contradictions</hi> in its actings.
Sometimes the mind retains its sovereignty, and
the affections are in subjection, and the will ready
for its duty. This puts a good face upon things.
Immediately the rebellion of the affections, or the
obstinacy of the will take place and prevail, and
the whole <hi>Scene</hi> is changed. This, I say, makes
the heart <hi>deceitful</hi> above all things; it agrees not
at all in it self, is not constant to it self, hath no
order that it is constant unto, is under no certain
conduct that is stable, but if I may so say, hath a
<hi>rotation</hi> in it self, where oft-times the <hi>feet</hi> lead and
guide the whole.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Its deceit lies in its <hi>full promisings</hi>
upon the first appearance of things. And this also
proceeds from the same principle with the former.
Sometimes the affections are <hi>touched</hi> and wrought
upon, the whole heart appears in a fair frame, all
promiseth to be well. Within a while the whole
frame is changed; the mind was not at all affected
or turned; the affections a little acted their
parts and are gone off, and all the fair promises of
the heart are departed with them. Now add this
<hi>deceitfulness</hi> to the <hi>unsearchableness</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and we shall find, that at least the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of dealing effectually with sin in its seat and
throne, will be exceedingly encreased. A deceiving
and a deceived heart, who can deal with it? especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considering that the heart imploys all its deceits
unto the service of sin, contributes them all to its
furtherance. All the disorder that is in the heart,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42900:21"/>
all its false promises, and fair appearances, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the interest and advantages of sin. Hence God
cautions the people to look to it, left <hi>their own
hearts should entice and deceive them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who can mention the treacheries and deceits
that lie in the heart of man? It is not for nothing
that the holy Ghost so expresseth it, <hi>It is deceitful
above all things;</hi> uncertain in what it doth, and
false in what it promiseth. And hence moreover it
is, amongst other causes, that in the pursuit of our
war against sin, we have not only the old work to
go over and over, but new work still while we
live in this world; still new stratagems and wiles
to deal withall, as the manner will be where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchableness
and deceitfulness are to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with.</p>
            <p>There are many other properties of this feat and
subject of the Law of sin, which might be insisted
on to the same end and purpose, but that would
too far divert us from our particular design; and
therefore I shall pass these over with some few
considerations.</p>
            <p>Never let us reckon that our work in contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against sin, in crucifying, mortifying, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
of it, is at an end. The place of its habitation
is <hi>unsearchable;</hi> and when we may think that we
have throughly won the field, there is still some
reserve remaining that we saw not, that we knew
not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Many Conquerors have been ruined by
their carelesness after a victory; and many have
been spiritually wounded after great successes
against this enemy. <hi>David</hi> was so, his great sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal
into sin was after a long profession, manifold
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42900:21"/>
experiences of God, and watchful keeping himself
from his iniquity. And hence in part hath it come
to pass, that the profession of many hath declined
in their <hi>old age,</hi> or riper time, which must more
distinctly be spoken to afterwards. They have given
over the work of mortifying of sin, before their
work was at an end. There is no way for us to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
sin in its unsearchable habitation, but by being
endless in our pursuit. And that command of the
Apostle which we have, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 5. on this account
is as necessary for them to observe, who are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of their race, as those that are but
at the beginning of it. <hi>Mortifie therefore your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that are on the earth;</hi> be always doing it whilst
you live in this world. It is true, great ground is
obtained, when the work is vigorously and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
carried on; sin is much weakened, so that
the soul presseth forwards towards perfection.
But yet the work must be <hi>endless,</hi> I mean whilst we
are in this world. If we give over, we shall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see this enemy exerting it self with new
strength and vigour. It may be, under some great
affliction, it may be in some eminent enjoyment of
God, in the sense of the sweetness of blessed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Christ, we have been ready to say,
that there was an end of sin, that it was dead and
gone for ever: But have we not found the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
by experience? hath it not manifested that it
was only retired into some unsearchable recesses of
the heart, as to its in-being and nature, though it
may be greatly weakened in its power? Let us
then reckon on it, that there is no way to have
our work done, but by always doing of it; and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42900:22"/>
he who dies <hi>fighting</hi> in this warfare, dies assuredly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a <hi>Conqueror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Hath it its residence in that which is
<hi>various,</hi> inconstant, <hi>deceitful</hi> above all things, this
calls for perpetual <hi>watchfulness</hi> against it. An open
enemy that deals by <hi>violence</hi> only, always gives
some respite; you know where to have him, and
what he is doing, so as that sometimes you may
sleep quietly without fear: But against adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
that deal by deceit and treachery, (which
are long swords, and reach at the greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
nothing will give security but perpetual
<hi>watchfulness.</hi> It is impossible we should in this
case be too jealous, doubtful, suspicious, or watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
The heart hath a thousand wiles and deceits,
and if we are in the least off from our watch, we
may be sure to be surprised. Hence are those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated
commands and cautions given for <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
for being circumspect, diligent, careful, and
the like. There is no living for them who have
to deal with an enemy <hi>deceitful above all things,</hi>
unless they persist in such a frame. All cautions that
are given in this case are necessary, especially that,
<hi>remember not to believe.</hi> Doth the heart promise
fair, rest not on it, but say to the Lord Christ, Lord,
do thou undertake for me. Doth the Sun shine fair
in the morning, reckon not therefore on a fair day;
the clouds may arise and fall: though the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
give a fair appearance of serenity and peace,
turbulent affections may arise, and cloud the soul
with sin and darkness.</p>
            <p>Thirdly then, commit the whole matter with
all care and diligence unto him who can <hi>search th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

heart</hi> to the uttermost, and knows how to prevent
all its treacheries and deceits. In the things before
mentioned lies our <hi>duty,</hi> but here lies our <hi>safety.</hi>
There is no treacherous corner in our hearts,
but he can search it to the uttermost; there's no
deceit in them but he can disappoint it. This course
<hi>David</hi> takes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. after he had set forth
the <hi>Omnipresence</hi> of God, and his <hi>Omniscience,
vers.</hi> 8, 9, 10. he makes improvement of it, <hi>verse</hi>
23. <hi>Search me, O Lord, and try me.</hi> As if he
had said, It is but a little that I know of my deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
heart, only I would be <hi>sincere,</hi> I would not
have reserves for sin retained therein; wherefore
do thou, who art present with my heart, who
knowest my thoughts long before, undertake this
work, perform it throughly, for thou alone art able
so to do.</p>
            <p>There are yet other arguments for the eviden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the power and strength of <hi>Indwelling-sin</hi>
from whence it is termed a <hi>Law,</hi> which we must

we laid them down.</p>

                  </gap>ant.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE have seen the <hi>seat</hi> and <hi>subject</hi> of this
Law of Sin. In the next place we might
take a view of its <hi>nature</hi> in general, which also
will manifest its power and efficacy. But this I
shall not enlarge upon; it being not my business
to declare the <hi>nature</hi> of Indwelling-Sin, it hath
also been done by others. I shall therefore only
in reference unto our special design in hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<hi>one property</hi> of it, that belongs unto its nature:
And this alwayes where ever it is. And this is
that which is expressed by the Apostle, Rom. 8. 7.
<hi>The carnal mind is enmity against God;</hi> that which
is here called, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the wisdom of the
flesh,</hi> is the same with the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> which we
insist on. And what sayes he hereof? Why it is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>enmity against God</hi> It is not
only an <hi>Enemy,</hi> for so possibly some <hi>Reconciliation</hi>
of it unto God might be made, but it is <hi>Enmity</hi> it
self, and so not capable of accepting any terms of
peace. <hi>Enemies</hi> may be reconciled, but enmity
cannot. Yea, the only way to reconcile <hi>Enemies,</hi>
is to destroy the <hi>enmity.</hi> So the Apostle in another
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42900:23"/>
case tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>We who were Enemies,
are reconciled unto God;</hi> that is, a work compassed
and brought about by the blood of Christ; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
of the greatest enemies. But when he
comes to speak of <hi>enmity,</hi> there is no way for it, but
it must be <hi>abolished</hi> and destroyed, Eph. 2. 15.
<hi>Having abolished in his flesh the enmity:</hi> There is
no way to deal with any <hi>enmity</hi> whatever, but by
its abolition or destruction.</p>
            <p>And this also lyes in it as it is <hi>enmity,</hi> that every
part and parcel of it, if we may so speak, the
least degree of it that can possibly remain in any
one, whilest, and where there is any thing of its
nature, is <hi>enmity</hi> still. It may not be so effectual
and powerful in operation, as where it hath more
life and vigour, but it is enmity still. As every
drop of poyson, is poyson, and will infect, and
every spark of fire, is fire, and will burn; so is
every thing of the Law of Sin, the last, the least of
it, it is enmity, it will poyson, it will burn. That
which is any thing in the <hi>abstract</hi> is still so; whilst
it hath any being at all. Our <hi>Apostle</hi> who may
well be supposed to have made as great a progress
in the subduing of it, as any one on the earth, yet
after all cryes out for deliverance, as from an <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
Enemy, Rom.</hi> 7. 24. The meanest acting,
the meanest and most imperceptible working of it,
is the acting and working of enmity. Mortification
abates of its <hi>force,</hi> but doth not change its <hi>nature.</hi>
Grace changeth the nature of man, but nothing can
change the nature of sin. What ever effect be
wrought upon it, there is no effect wrought in it, but
that it is <hi>enmity</hi> still, sin still. This then by it is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42900:24"/>
our astate and condition, <hi>God is love,</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 4. 8.
He is so in <hi>himself,</hi> eternally excellent and desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
above all. He is so <hi>to us,</hi> he is so in the blood
of his Son, and in all the inexpressible fruits of it,
by which we are what we are, and wherein all our
future hopes and expectations are wrapped up.
Against <hi>this God</hi> we carry about us an <hi>enmity,</hi> all
our dayes. An enmity that hath this from its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it is incapable of cure or reconciliation.
Destroyed it may be it shall be, but cured it cannot
be. If a man hath an Enemy to deal withal that
is too mighty for him, as <hi>David</hi> had with <hi>Saul,</hi> he
may take the course that he did; consider what it is
that provoked his Enemy against him, &amp; so address
himself to remove the cause and make up his peace,
1 Sam. 26. 19. <hi>If the Lord have stirred thee up
against me, let him accept an Offering, but if they
be the Children of men, cursed be they of the Lord;</hi>
come it from God or man, there is yet hopes of
peace. But when a man hath <hi>enmity</hi> it self to deal
withal, nothing is to be expected but continual
fighting to the destruction of the one party. If it be
not overcome and destroyed, it will overcome and
destroy the soul.</p>
            <p>And herein lyes no small part of its <hi>power</hi> which
we are enquiring after; it can admit of no terms
of peace, of no composition. There may be a
composition, where there is no Reconciliation.
There may be a <hi>truce</hi> where there is no <hi>peace.</hi> But
with this Enemy we can obtain neither the one,
nor the other. It is never quiet conquering, nor
conquered, which was the only kind of Enemy
that the famous Warriour complained of, of old. It
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42900:24"/>
is in vain for a man to have any expectation of
<hi>rest</hi> from his <hi>lust,</hi> but by its death, of <hi>absolute free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
but by his own. Some in the tumultuating
of their corruptions, seek for quietness by labouring
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o satisfie them, <hi>making provision for the flesh to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the lusts thereof;</hi> as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi>
13. 14. This is to aslake Fire by Wood and Oyle.
As all the fuel in the world, all the fabrick of the
creation that is combustible, being cast into the fire,
will not at all satisfie it, but increase it; so is it
with satisfaction given to sin by sinning, it doth
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut inflame and increase. If a man will part with
some of his goods unto an enemy, it may satisfie
him; but enmity will have all, and is not one whit
the more satisfied, that if he had received nothing
at all. Like the <hi>lean Cattle</hi> that were never the
less hungry, for having devoured the fat. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bargain with the fire to take but so much of
your houses, ye have no way but to quench it. It
is in this case, as it is in the contest between a
wise Man and a Fool, Prov. 29. 9. <hi>Whether he rage
or laugh, there is no rest.</hi> What ever frame or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
he be in, his importunate folly makes him trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome.
It is so with this Indwelling-Sin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it rage or laugh, whether it violently tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate,
as it will do on provocations and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it will be outragious in the soul, or whether

               </gap>t seem to be pleased and contented, to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
all is one, there is no peace, no rest to be had
with it, or by it. Had it then been of any other
nature, some other way might have been fixed on,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut being it consists in <hi>enmity,</hi> all the relief the soul

               </gap>ath must lye in its ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:42900:25"/>
Secondly, It is not only said to be <hi>enmity,</hi> but it
is said to be <hi>enmity against God.</hi> It hath chosen a
great enemy indeed. It is in sundry places proposed
as <hi>our Enemy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Abstain from fleshly
lusts, which warr against the soul.</hi> They are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the soul, that is, to our selves. Sometimes
as an Enemy to the Spirit that is in us, <hi>The flesh
lusteth or fighteth against the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. It
fights against the Spirit, or the <hi>Spiritual principle</hi>
that is in us, to conquer it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it fights against our souls
to destroy them. It hath special ends and designs
against our souls, and against the principle of Grace
that is in us; but its proper formal object is God,
it is enmity against God. It is its work to oppose
Grace, it is a consequent of its work to oppose our
souls, which follows upon what it doth, more than
what it intends; but its nature and formal design
is to oppose God; God as the Law-giver, God as
holy, God as the Author of the Gospel, a way of
salvation by Grace, and not by works, is the direct
object of the Law of Sin. Why doth it oppose
duty, <hi>so that the good we would do, we do not,</hi>
either as to matter or manner? Why doth it render
the soul carnal, indisposed, unbelieving, unspiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
weary, wandring? It is because of its enmity
to God, whom the soul aims to have communion
withal in duty. It hath as it were that command
from Satan, which the <hi>Assyrians</hi> had from their
King, <hi>Fight neither with small nor great, save only
with the King of Israel,</hi> 1 Kings 22. 31. It is neither
great nor small, but <hi>God himself,</hi> the King of <hi>Israel,</hi>
that sin sets it self against. There lyes the secret
formal reason of all its opposition to <hi>good,</hi> even
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42900:25"/>
because it relates unto <hi>God.</hi> May a road, a trade,
a way of duties be set up, where communion with
God is not aimed at, but only the duty it self, as is
the manner of men in most of their superstitious
Worship, the opposition that will lye against it
from the Law of Sin will be very weak, easie and
gentle. Or as the <hi>Assyrians</hi> because of his shew of
a King, assaulted <hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> but when they found
that it was not <hi>Ahab,</hi> they turned back from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
of him. Because there is a shew and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Worship of God, sin may make head
against it at first, but when the duty cryes out in
the heart, that indeed God is not there; Sin turns
away to seek out its proper Enemy, even God
himself elsewhere. And hence do many poor
Creatures spend their dayes in dismal tiring Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions,
without any great reluctancy from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
when others cannot be suffered freely to watch
with Christ in a spiritual manner one hour.
And it is no wonder that men fight with carnal
weapons for their Superstitious Worship <hi>without,</hi>
when they have no fighting against it <hi>within.</hi> For
God is not in it; and the Law of Sin makes not
opposition to any duty, but to God in every duty.
This is our state and condition, all the opposition
that ariseth in us unto any thing that is spiritually
good, whether it be from darkness in the mind,
or aversation in the will, or sloth in the Affections,
all the secret arguings and reasonings that are in
the soul in pursuit of them, the direct object of
them is God himself. The enmity lyes against
<hi>him,</hi> which consideration surely should influence
us to a perpetual constant watchfulness over our
selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:42900:26"/>
It is thus also in respect of all propensity unto
sin, as well as aversation from God. It is God
himself that is aimed at. It is true, the pleasures,
the wages of sin do greatly influence the sensual
carnall affections of men; but it is the Holiness
and Authority of God, that sin it self rises up
against: It hates the yoke of the Lord; <hi>Thou hast
been weary of me,</hi> saith God to sinners, and that
during their performance of abundance of duties.
Every act of sin is a fruit of being <hi>weary of God.</hi>
Thus <hi>Job</hi> tells us, what lyes at the bottom in the
heart of sinners; <hi>they say to the Lord, depart from
us;</hi> it is enmity against him and aversation from
him. Here lyes the formal nature of every sin, it is
an opposition to God, a casting off his yoke, a brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
off the dependance which the Creature ought
to have on the Creator. And the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
7. gives the reason why he affirms <hi>the carnal mind
to be enmity against God;</hi> namely, because it is <hi>not
subject to the will of God, nor indeed can be.</hi> It ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is, nor will, nor <hi>can</hi> be subject to God, its
whole nature consisting in an opposition to him.
The soul wherein it is, may be subject to the Law
of God, but this Law of Sin sets up in contrariety
unto it, and will not be in subjection.</p>
            <p>To manifest a little farther the power of this
Law of Sin from this property of its nature, that
it is enmity against God; one or two inseparable
Adjuncts of it may be considered, which will far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
evince it.</p>
            <p>First, it is <hi>universal;</hi> Some contentions are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto some particular concernments, this is
about one thing, that about another. It is not so
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42900:26"/>
here; the enmity is absolute and <hi>universal,</hi> as are
all enmities that are grounded in the nature of
the things themselves. Such enmity is against the
whole kind of that which is its object. Such is
this enmity; for First, It is <hi>Vniversal</hi> to all of
God; and Secondly, It is <hi>Vniversal</hi> in all of
the soul.</p>
            <p>First, It is <hi>universal to all of God.</hi> If there were
any thing of God, his nature, properties, his mind
or will, his Law or Gospel, any duty of obedience
to him, of communion with him, that sin had not
an enmity against, the soul might have a constant
shelter and retreat within it self, by applying it
self to that of God, to that of duty towards him,
to that of communion with him, that sin would
make no opposition against. But the enmity lyes
against God, and <hi>all</hi> of God, and every thing
wherein or whereby we have to do with him. It is
not subject to the Law, nor any part nor parcel,
word or tittle of the Law. Whatever is opposite to
any thing as such, is opposite unto all of it. Sin is
enmity to God as God, and therefore to all of
God. Not his Goodness, not his Holiness, not his
Mercy, not his Grace, not his Promises: There is
not any thing of him, which it doth not make head
against; nor any duty, private, publick, in the
heart, in external works, which it opposeth not.
And the <hi>nearer</hi> (if I may so say) any thing is to
God, the greater is its enmity unto it. The more of
spirituality and holiness is in any thing, the greater
is its enmity. That which hath most of God, hath
most of its opposition. Concerning them in whom
this Law is predominant, God sayes, <hi>Ye have set at
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42900:27"/>
naught all my counsel, and you would have none of
my reproof, Prov.</hi> 1. 25. Not this or that part of
Gods counsel, his mind or will is opposed, but <hi>all
his counsel;</hi> whatever he calleth for, or guideth
unto, in every particular of it, all is set at naught,
and nothing of his reproof attended unto. A man
would think it not very strange that sin should
maintain an enmity against God in his <hi>Law,</hi> which
comes to judge it, to condemn it; but it raiseth a
greater enmity against him in his Gospel, wherein
he tenders mercy and pardon, as a deliverance from
it, and that meerly because more of the glorious
properties of God nature, more of his excellencies
and condescension, is manifested therein, than in
the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is <hi>universal in all of the soul.</hi> Would
this Law of Sin have contented it self to have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
any one <hi>faculty</hi> of the soul, would it have
left any one at liberty, any one affection free from
its yoke and bondage, it might possibly have been
with more ease opposed, or subdued. But when
Christ comes with his spiritual power upon the
soul to conquer it to himself, he hath no quiet
landing place. He can set foot on no ground but
what he must fight for and conquer. Not the mind,
not an Affection, not the will, but all is secured
against him. And when Grace hath made its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance;
yet sin will dwell <hi>in all its coasts.</hi> Were
any thing in the soul at perfect freedom and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
there a <hi>stand</hi> might be made to drive it from
all the rest of its holds: But it is <hi>universal,</hi> and
wars in the whole soul. The mind hath its own
darkness and vanity to wrestle with; the will its
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42900:27"/>
own stubborness, obstinacy and perversness, every
affection its own frowardness and aversation from
God, and its sensuality to deal withal; so that
one cannot yield relief unto one another, as they
ought; they have as it were, their hands full
at home. Hence it is that our <hi>knowledge</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
our <hi>obedience</hi> weak, love not immixed,
fear not pure, delight not free and noble. But I
must not insist on these particulars, or I could
abundantly shew how diffused this principle
of enmity against God is through the whole
soul.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hereunto might be added its <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</hi>
It is constant unto it self, it wavers not,
it hath no thoughts of yielding or giving over,
notwithstanding the powerful opposition that is
made unto it both by the Law and Gospel, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
shall be shewed.</p>
            <p>This then is a <hi>third Evidence</hi> of the power of
sin, taken from its nature and properties, wherein
I have fixed but on <hi>one instance</hi> for its Illustration,
namely, that it is <hi>enmity against God,</hi> and that
universal and constant. Should we enter upon a
full description of it, it would require more space
and time than we have allotted to this whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
What hath been delivered might give us
a little sense of it, if it be the will of God, and
stir us up unto watchfulness. What can be of a more
sad consideration than that we should carry about
us constantly that which is enmity against God, and
that not in this or that particular, but in all that
he is, and in all wherein he hath revealed himself.
I cannot say it is well with them who <hi>find it not.</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:42900:28"/>
It is well with them indeed in whom it is weakned,
and the power of it abated. But yet for them
who say it <hi>is not in them, they do but deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and there is no truth in them.</hi>

         </div>
         <div n="5" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. V.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Nature of Sin farther discovered as it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
against God. Its aversation from all
good, opened. Means to prevent the effects
of it prescribed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE have considered somewhat of the nature
of <hi>Indwelling-sin,</hi> not <hi>absolutely,</hi> but in
reference unto the discovery of its power. But this
more cleary evidenceth it self in its <hi>actings</hi> and
<hi>operations.</hi> Power is an act of life, and operation
is the only discoverer of life. We know not that
any thing lives, but by the effects and works of life.
And great and strong operations discover a
powerful and vigorous life. Such are the operations
of this <hi>Law of sin,</hi> which are all demonstrations
of its power.</p>
            <p>That which we have declared concerning its
nature, is that it consists in <hi>enmity.</hi> Now there are
two general heads of the working or operation of
<hi>enmity.</hi> First, <hi>Aversation.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Opposition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>Aversation.</hi> Our Saviour describing the
<hi>enmity</hi> that was between himself and the Theachers
of the Jews, by the effects of it, saith in the Prophet,
<hi>My soul loathed them, and their soul also ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42900:28"/>
me, Zach.</hi> 7. 8. Where there is mutual
enmity, there is mutual <hi>aversation,</hi> loathing, and
abomination. So it was between the Jews and the
Samaritans, they were enemies, and abhorred one
another; as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Opposition,</hi> or contending against one
another, is the next product of <hi>enmity, Isa.</hi> 63.
10. <hi>He was turned to be their enemy, and he fought
against them;</hi> speaking of God towards the people.
Where there is <hi>enmity,</hi> there will be <hi>fighting,</hi> it
is the proper and natural product of it. Now both
these <hi>effects</hi> are found in this <hi>Law of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, For <hi>Aversation,</hi> there is an aversation in it
unto God, and every thing of God, as we have in
part discovered in handling the <hi>enmity</hi> it self, and
so shall not need much to insist upon it again. All
<hi>indisposition</hi> unto <hi>duty,</hi> wherein communion with
God is to be obtained, all <hi>weariness</hi> of duty, all
carnality or <hi>formality</hi> under duty, it all springs
from this root. The wise man cautions us against
this evil, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>When thou goest to the house
of God, keep thy foot.</hi> Hast thou any spiritual duty
to perform, and dost thou design the attaining of
any communion with God? look to thy self, take
care of thy <hi>affections,</hi> they will be gadding and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
and that from their <hi>aversation</hi> to what thou
hast in hand. There is not any good that we
would do, wherein we may not find this <hi>aversation</hi>
exercising it self. <hi>When I would do good, evil is
present with me;</hi> at any time, at all times, when I
would do any thing that is spiritually good, it is
present; that is, to <hi>hinder me,</hi> to obstruct me in
my duty, because it abhors and loaths the thing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42900:29"/>
which I have in hand, it will keep me off from it if
it be possible. In them in whom it prevails, it
comes at length unto that frame which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 31. It will allow an outward
<hi>bodily presence</hi> unto the worship of God, wherein
it is not concerned, but it keeps the heart quite
away.</p>
            <p>It may be some will pretend, they find it not so
in <hi>themselves,</hi> but they have <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi>
in and unto all the duties of obedience that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto. But I fear, this <hi>pretended liberty</hi> will be
found upon examination to arise from one or both
of these causes. First, <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the true state and
condition of their own souls, of their inward man
and its actings towards God. They know not how
it is with them, and therefore are not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in what they report. They are in the <hi>dark</hi>
and neither know what they do, nor whither they
are going. It is like the <hi>Pharisee</hi> knew little of this
matter, which made him <hi>boast</hi> of his duties to
God himself. Or, secondly, It may be what ever
duties of worship or obedience such persons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
they may through want of faith, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Christ, have no communion with God in
them. And if so, <hi>sin</hi> will make but little opposition
unto them therein. We speak of <hi>them</hi> whose hearts
are exercised with these things, and if under their
complaints of them, and groanings for deliverance
from them, others cry out unto them, <hi>Stand off,
we are holier than ye,</hi> they are willing to bear their
condition, as knowing that their way may be safe,
though it be troublesome, and being willing to
see their own dangers, that they may avoid the
ruine which others fall into.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42900:29"/>
Let us then a little consider this <hi>aversation</hi> in
such acts of obedience, as wherein there is no
concernment but that of God and the soul. In pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
duties there may be a mixture of other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations;
they may be so influenced by custom
and necessity, that a right judgment cannot from
them be made of this matter. But let us take into
consideration the duties of <hi>retirement,</hi> as <hi>private
Prayer</hi> and <hi>Meditation,</hi> and the like; or else
extraordinary duties, or duties to be performed in
an extraordinary manner.</p>
            <p>First, In these will this <hi>aversation</hi> and loathing
oftentimes discover it self in the <hi>affections.</hi> A se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
striving will be in them about close and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
dealing with God. Unless the hand of God in
his Spirit be high and strong upon the soul, even
when convictions, sense of duty, dear and real
esteem of God, and communion with him, have
carried the soul into its closet, yet if there be not
the vigour and power of a <hi>spiritual life</hi> constantly
at work, there will be a secret lothness in them
unto duty; yea, sometimes there will be a violent
inclination to the contrary; so that the soul had
rather do any thing, embrace any <hi>diversion,</hi> though
it would it self thereby, than vigorously apply
it self unto that which in the inward man
it breaths after. It is <hi>weary</hi> before it begins, and
says, when will the work be over? Here God and
the soul are immediately concerned, and it is a
great conquest to <hi>do what we would,</hi> though we
come exceedingly short of what <hi>we should</hi> do.
Secondly, It discovers it self in the <hi>mind</hi> also:
when we address our selves to God in Christ, we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42900:30"/>
are, as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, <hi>to fill our mouths with arguments,
Job</hi> 23. 4. that we may be able to <hi>plead</hi> with
him, as he calls upon us to do, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 26. <hi>Put me
in remembrance, let us plead together.</hi> Whence the
Church is called upon to take unto it self <hi>words</hi> or
arguments in going to God, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 2. The sum
is, that the <hi>Mind</hi> should be furnished with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
that are prevailing with God, and be in
readiness to <hi>plead</hi> them, and to manage them in the
most spiritual manner to the best advantage. Now
is there no difficulty to get the <hi>mind</hi> into such a
frame, as to lay out it self to the utmost in this
work? to be clear, steady, and constant in its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
To draw out, and make use of its stores and
furniture of promises and experiences? It <hi>starts,</hi>
wanders, <hi>flags</hi> all from this secret <hi>aversation</hi> unto
communion with God, which proceeds from the
<hi>Law of Indwelling-sin.</hi> Some complain that they
can make no work of <hi>Meditation,</hi> they cannot bend
their minds unto it. I confess there may be a great
cause of this, in their want of a right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the duty it self, and of the ways of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the soul in it, which therefore I shall a little
speak to afterwards. But yet this <hi>secret enmity</hi> hath
its hand in the loss they are at also, and that both
in their minds and in their affections. Others are
forced to live in <hi>family</hi> and <hi>publick</hi> duties, they
find such little benefit and success in <hi>private.</hi> And
here hath been the beginning of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> of
many Professors, and the source of many foolish
sensual opinions. Finding this <hi>aversation</hi> in their
minds and affections from closeness and constancy
in private spiritual duties, not knowing how to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42900:30"/>
conquer and prevail against these difficulties
through <hi>him who enables us,</hi> they have at first been
subdued to a neglect of them, first <hi>partial,</hi> then
<hi>total,</hi> until having lost all conscience of them, they
have had a door opened unto all sin and licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and so to a full and utter <hi>Apostasie.</hi> I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
there are very few that <hi>apostatize</hi> from a
profession of any continuance, such as our days
abound withall, but their door of entrance into the
folly of back-sliding, was either some <hi>great and
notorious sin</hi> that bloodied their consciences, tainted
their affections, and intercepted all delight of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing more to do with God; or else it was
a course of <hi>neglect in private duties,</hi> arising from a
weariness of contending against that powerful
<hi>aversation</hi> which they found in themselves unto
them. And this also through the craft of Satan
hath been improved into many foolish and sensual
opinions, of <hi>living unto God without, and above
any duties of communion.</hi> And we find, that after
men have for a while choaked and blinded their
consciences with this pretence, cursed wickedness
or sensuality hath been the end of their folly. And
the reason of all this is, that the giving way to the
<hi>Law of sin</hi> in the least, is the giving strength unto
it: To let it alone is to let it <hi>grow,</hi> not to conquer
it is to be conquered by it.</p>
            <p>As it is in respect of <hi>private,</hi> so it is also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of <hi>publick</hi> duties, that have any thing <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
in them. What strivings, struglings, and
pleadings are there in the heart about them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
against the spirituality of them? Yea, in and
under them, will not the mind and affections
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42900:31"/>
sometimes be intangled with things <hi>uncouth,</hi> new
and strange unto them, such as at the time of the
least serious business, a man would not deign to
take into his thoughts. But if the least loose, liberty
or advantage be given unto <hi>Indwelling-sin,</hi> if it be
not perpetually watched over, it will work to a
strange and an unexpected issue. In brief, let the
soul uncloath any duty what ever, <hi>private</hi> or <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
any thing that is called <hi>Good,</hi> let a man divest
it of all outward respects which secretly insinuate
themselves into the mind, and give it some <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency</hi>
in what it is about, but do not render it
acceptable unto God, and he shall assuredly find
somewhat of the power, and some of the effects of
this aversation. It begins in lothness and indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
goes on with intangling the mind and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
with other things, and will end, if not
prevented, in <hi>weariness</hi> of God, which he complains
of in his people, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 22. They ceased from
duty because they were weary of God.</p>
            <p>But this instance being of great importance unto
Professors in their walking with God, we must not
pass it over without some intimations of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for them in their contending against it, and
opposition to it. Only this must be premised, that
I am not giving directions for the mortifying of
<hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> in general, which is to be done alone
by the Spirit of Christ, by vertue of our union with
him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. but only of our <hi>particular duty,</hi>
with reference unto this especial evil or effect of
<hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> that we have a little insisted on, or
what in this <hi>single case</hi> the wisdom of faith seems
to direct unto, and call for; which will be our
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42900:31"/>
way and course in our process upon the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of other effects of it.</p>
            <p>First, The great means to prevent the fruits and
effects of this <hi>aversation,</hi> is the constant keeping of
the soul in an universally holy frame. As this
weakens the whole <hi>Law of sin,</hi> so answerably all
its properties; and particulary this <hi>aversation.</hi>
It is this <hi>frame</hi> only that will enable us to say with
the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 57. 7. <hi>My heart is fixed, O God,
my heart is fixed.</hi> It is utterly impossible to keep
the heart in a prevailing holy frame in <hi>any one du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
unless it be so in and unto <hi>all and every one.</hi> If sin
intanglements get hold in any <hi>one thing,</hi> they will
put themselves upon the soul in <hi>every thing.</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
even frame and temper in all duties, in <hi>all
ways,</hi> is the only preservative for any <hi>one</hi> way. Let
not him who is neglective in <hi>publick</hi> perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that all will be clear and easie in <hi>private</hi> or on
the contrary. There is an <hi>harmony</hi> in obedience,
break but one part and you interrupt the whole.
Our wounds in particular arise generally from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence
as to the whole course. So <hi>David</hi> informs
us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 6. <hi>Then shall I not be ashamed, when I
have a respect unto all thy commandements.</hi> An uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
respect to all Gods commandements, is the
only preservative from <hi>shame.</hi> And nothing have
we more reason to be ashamed of, than the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
miscarriages of our hearts in point of duty,
which are from the principle before mentioned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Labour to prevent the very <hi>beginnings</hi>
of the workings of this aversation; let grace be
before-hand with it in every duty. We are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. to <hi>watch unto prayer;</hi> and as is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42900:32"/>
is unto prayer, so unto every duty; that is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and take care that we be not hindered from
within, nor from without, as to a due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it. <hi>Watch</hi> against temptations to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them, watch against the Aversation that is
in sin to prevent it. As we are not to <hi>give place to
Satan,</hi> no more are we to sin. If it be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
in its first attempts, it will prevail. My
meaning is, whatever <hi>Good,</hi> as the Apostle speaks,
we have to do, and <hi>find evil present with us,</hi> as we
shall find it present, prevent its parlying with the
soul, its insinuating of poison into the mind and
Affections, by a vigorous, holy, violent stirring up
of the grace, or graces that are to be acted and set
at work peculiary in that duty. Let <hi>Jacob</hi> come
first into the world, or if prevented by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of <hi>Esau</hi> let him lay hold on his heel to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
him, and obtain the birth-right. Upon the
very first motion of <hi>Peter</hi> to our Saviour, crying,
<hi>Master, spare thy self,</hi> he immediately replyes,
<hi>get thee behind me Satan.</hi> So ought we to say, get
thee gone thou <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> thou present evil, and
it may be of the same use unto us. Get grace then,
up betimes unto Duty, and be early in the rebukes
of sin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Though it do its worst, yet be sure it
never prevail to a <hi>conquest.</hi> Be sure you be not
<hi>wearied</hi> out by its pertinacy, nor driven from your
hold by its importunity; Do not faint by its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
Take the Apostles advice Heb. 6. 11. <hi>We desire
that every one of you, do shew the same diligence to
the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be
not slothful.</hi> Still hold out in the same diligence.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42900:32"/>
There are many wayes whereby men are driven
from a constant holy performance of duties, all of
them dangerous, if not pernicious to the soul. Some
are diverted by <hi>business,</hi> some by company, some
by the power of temptations, some discouraged by
their own darkness; but none so <hi>dangerous</hi> as this,
when the soul gives over in <hi>part,</hi> or in <hi>whole,</hi> as
wearied by the Aversation of sin unto it, or to
<hi>communion</hi> with God in it. This argues the souls
giving up of it self unto the power of sin, which
unless the Lord break the snare of Satan therein,
will assuredly prove ruinous. Our Saviours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
is, that we ought <hi>alwayes to pray, and not
to faint, Luke</hi> 18. 1. Opposition will arise, none so
bitter and keen as that from our own hearts; if we
faint we perish. <hi>Take heed lest you be wearied,</hi> saith
the Apostle, <hi>and faint in your minds, Heb.</hi> 12. 3.
Such a <hi>fainting</hi> as is attended with a <hi>weariness</hi> and
that with a giving place to the Aversation working
in our hearts, is to be avoided, if we would not
perish. The caution is the same with that of the
same Apostle, Rom. 12. 12. <hi>Rejoycing in hope,
patient in tribulation, continuing instant in prayer.</hi>
And in general with that of Chap. 6. 12. <hi>Let not sin
therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
obey it in the lust thereof.</hi> To cease from duty, in
part, or in whole, upon the Aversation of sin unto
its spirituality, is to give sin the Rule, and to obey it
in the lust thereof. Yield not then unto it, but hold
out the conflict; wait on God and ye shall prevail,
Isa. 40. 31. <hi>They that wait upon the Lord shall
renew their strength, they shall mount up with
wings as Eagles, they shall run and not be weary,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42900:33"/>

God. That after all the discoveries that God hath
made of himself unto them, all the Kindness they
have received from him, his doing of them good
and not evil in all things, there should yet be such an
heart of unkindness and unbelief, still abiding, as
to have an <hi>Aversation</hi> lying in it to Communion
with Him: How ought the thoughts of it to cast us
into the dust, to fill us with shame and self-abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
all our days? What have we found in God in
any of our approaches or addresses unto him, that it
should be thus with us? What iniquity have we
found in him? <hi>Hath he been a Wilderness unto us,
or a Land of Darkness?</hi> Did we ever lose any thing
by drawing nigh unto him? Nay, hath not therein
lyen all the rest and peace which we have obtained?
Is not he the Fountain and Spring of all our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
of all our desirable things? Hath he not bid
us welcome at our coming? Have we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from him more than heart can conceive,
or tongue express? What ails then our foolish and
wretched hearts, to harbour such a cursed secret
dislike of him and his ways? Let us be ashamed

when men had lost all spiritual sense and savour

of Opposition. First, It lusteth. Wherein

Rebellion against the Law of Grace. (2.) In
Assaulting the soul.</p>

            <p>HOw this enmity worketh by way of <hi>Aversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
hath been declared, as also the means
that the soul is to use for the preventing of its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and prevalency. The second way whereby it
exerts its self is <hi>Opposition.</hi> Enmity will <hi>oppose</hi> and
contend with that wherewith it is at enmity. It
is so in things natural and moral. As light and
darkness, heat and cold, so vertue and vice op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
each other. So is it with sin and Grace, saith
the Apostle, these are contrary one to the other,
Gal. 5. 17. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42900:34"/>
set in mutual opposition,</hi> and that continually and
constantly, as we shall see.</p>
            <p>Now there are two wayes whereby <hi>Enemies</hi>
mannage an opposition. First, By <hi>force:</hi> and
Secondly, by <hi>fraud</hi> and deceit. So when the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
became Enemies to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and
mannaged an enmity against them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 10.
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> saith, <hi>Let us deal wisely,</hi> or rather cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               </gap>; He used <hi>all manner of fraudulent
Sophistry.</hi> And unto this deceit they added <hi>force,</hi> in
their grievous oppressions. This is the way and
manner of things where there is a prevailing <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</hi>
And both these are made use of by the <hi>Law
of Sin</hi> in its enmity against God, and our souls.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with the First; or its actings <hi>as it
were in a way of force,</hi> in an open down-right op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to God and his Law, or the <hi>Good</hi> that a
Believing soul would do in obedience unto God,
and his Law. And in this whole matter, we must
be careful to stear our course aright, taking the
<hi>Scripture</hi> for our Guide, with Spiritual Reason and
Experience for our Companions. For there are
many Shelves in our course, which must diligently
be avoided, that none who consider these things
be <hi>troubled</hi> without cause, or <hi>comforted</hi> without a
just foundation.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>First way,</hi> whereby this sin exerts its <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
in opposition, namely, <hi>as it were by force</hi> or
strength, there are four things expressing so many
distinct degrees in its progress and procedure in
the pursuit of its enmity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:42900:35"/>
First, Its general Inclination, it <hi>lusteth, Gal.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Its particular way of contending, it
<hi>fights or wars, Rom.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>James</hi> 4. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Its success in this contest, <hi>it brings the
soul into Captivity to the Law of Sin, Rom.</hi> 7. 23.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Its growth and rage upon success, it
comes up to <hi>madness,</hi> as an enraged Enemy will
do, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 3. All which we must speak to in
order.</p>
            <p>First, In general it is said to <hi>Lust, Gal.</hi> 5. 17.
<hi>The flesh lusteth against the Spirit.</hi> This word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
the general nature of that opposition
which the <hi>Law of Sin</hi> maketh against God, and
the Rule o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his Spirit or Grace in them that believe,
and therefore the least degree of that opposition is
expressed hereby. When it doth any thing it
<hi>lusteth.</hi> As because <hi>burning</hi> is the general acting of
fire, what ever it doth else, it doth also <hi>burn.</hi> When
fire doth any thing, it burns: And when the Law
of Sin doth any thing, it <hi>lusts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence all the actings of this Law of Sin are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>lusts of the flesh,</hi> Gal. 5. 16. <hi>Ye shall not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
the lusts of the flesh,</hi> Rom. 13. 14. <hi>Make no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision

these <hi>lusts of the flesh</hi> those only whereby men act
their <hi>sensuality</hi> in riot, drunkènness, uncleaness, and
the like, but they comprehend all the <hi>actings</hi> of
the Law of Sin whatever in all the faculties and
Affections of the soul. Thus <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 3. We have
mention of the <hi>desires,</hi> or <hi>wills,</hi> or <hi>lusts</hi> of the mind,
as well as of the flesh. The <hi>mind</hi> the most spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

               </gap> the soul hath its <hi>lusts,</hi> no less than the
<hi>sensual appetite,</hi> which seems sometimes more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42900:35"/>
to be called the flesh. And in the products
of these lusts, there are defilements of the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
as well as of the <hi>flesh,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. that is, of the
<hi>mind</hi> and <hi>understanding,</hi> as well as of the Appetite
and Affections, and the body that attends their
service. And in the <hi>blamelesness</hi> of all these consists
our holiness, 2 Thess. 5. 23. <hi>The God of peace, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
you wholly, and I pray God your whole Spirit,
and soul, and body be preserved blameless unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Yea, by the flesh
in this matter the whole Old man, or the Law of
Sin is <hi>intended,</hi> John 3. 6. <hi>That which is born of
the flesh is flesh;</hi> that is, it is all so, and nothing else.
And what ever remains of the <hi>old</hi> nature in the <hi>new
man</hi> is flesh still. And <hi>this flesh lusteth;</hi> this Law of
Sin doth so, which is the general bottom and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all its opposition unto God. And this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
doth two wayes.</p>
            <p>First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In an hidden close <hi>propensity</hi> unto all evil.
This lyes in it <hi>habitually.</hi> Whilest a man is in the
state of nature, fully under the power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of this <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> it is said, that <hi>every figment
of his heart is evil,</hi> and that continually, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5.
It can frame, fashion, produce, or act nothing but
what is evil: because this <hi>habitual propensity</hi> unto
evil, that is in the Law of Sin, is absolutely predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
in such a one. It is in the heart like <hi>poison</hi>
that hath nothing to allay its venemous qualities,
and so infects whatever it touches. And where
the power and dominion of it is broken, yet in its
own nature it hath still an <hi>habitual propensity</hi> unto
that which is evil, wherein its <hi>lusting</hi> doth consist.</p>
            <p>But here we must distinguish between the <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42900:36"/>
frame of the heart, and the natural propensity
or habitual inclination of the Law of Sin in the
heart.</hi> The <hi>habitual inclination of the heart</hi> is
denominated from the principle that bears Chief or
Soveraign Rule in it; and therefore in Believers it
is unto <hi>Good,</hi> unto God, unto holiness, unto obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
The heart is not <hi>habitually</hi> inclined unto
evil by the remainders of Indwelling Sin, but this
<hi>Sin in the heart</hi> hath a constant <hi>habitual propensity</hi>
unto evil in its self, or its own nature. This the
Apostle intends by its <hi>being present with us;</hi> it is
present with me, that is, alwayes, and for its own
end, which is to <hi>lust</hi> unto sin.</p>
            <p>It is with Indwelling-Sin as with a <hi>River;</hi>
whilest the Springs and Fountains of it are open,
and waters are continually supplyed unto its
streams, set a damm before it, and it causeth it to
rise and swell, untill it bear down all, or overflow
the banks about it. Let these waters b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>abated,</hi>
dryed up in some good measure, in the springs of
them, and the remainder may be coerced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained.
But still as long as there is any <hi>running
water</hi> it will constantly press upon what stands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, according to its weight and strength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is its nature so to do. And if by any means
it make a passage, it will proceed. So is it with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling-Sin:</hi>
whilest the springs and fountains of
it are open, in vain is it for men to set a <hi>damm</hi>
before it by their convictions, resolutions, vowes
and promises. They may check it for a while,
but it will increase, rise high, and rage at one time
or another, until it bears down all those convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and resolutions, or makes it self an <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground-passage</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42900:36"/>
by some secret lust that shall give a
full vent unto it. But now suppose that the springs
of it are much <hi>dryed</hi> up by Regenerating Grace,
the streams or actings of it abated by Holiness, yet
whilest any thing remains of it, it will be pressing
constantly to have vent, to press forward into actual
sin. And this is its <hi>lusting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>habitual propensity</hi> in it is discovered
two wayes.</p>
            <p>First, In its <hi>unexpected surprizals</hi> of the soul into
foolish sinful figments and imaginations which it
looked not for, nor was any occasion administred
unto them. It is with Indwelling-Sin, as it is with
the contrary principle of sanctifying Grace. This
gives the soul, if I may so say, many a <hi>blessed sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal.</hi>
It oftentimes ingenerates and brings forth
an holy spiritual frame in the heart and mind,
when we have had no previous rational conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to work them thereunto. And this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests
it to be an <hi>habitual principle</hi> prevailing in
the mind: So <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Or ever I was aware my
soul made me as the Chariots of Aminadab;</hi> that is,
free, willing and ready for communion with
Christ. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>I knew not;</hi> it was done by the
power of the Spirit of Grace, so that I took no
notice of it, as it were, until it was done. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
actings of Grace in this manner, exciting
acts of faith, love and complacency in God, are
Evidences of much strength and prevalency of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in the soul. And thus also is it with <hi>Indwelling-Sin;</hi>
ere the <hi>soul is aware,</hi> without any provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or temptation, when it knows not, it is cast
into a vain and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oolish frame. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n produceth its
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42900:37"/>
               <hi>figments</hi> secretly in the heart, and prevents the minds
consideration of what it is about. I mean hereby
those <hi>Actus primo primi,</hi> first acts of the soul, which
are thus far <hi>involuntary,</hi> as that they have not the
<hi>actual consent</hi> of the Will unto them; but are <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi>
as far as sin hath its residence in the Will.
And these <hi>surprizals,</hi> if the soul be not awake to
take speedy care for the prevention of their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
do oftentimes set all as it were on fire, and
engage the mind and affections into actual sin.
For as by Grace we are oftentimes ere we are aware
made as the <hi>Chariots of a willing people,</hi> and are far
engaged in heavenly-mindedness and communion
with Christ, making speed in it as in a <hi>Chariot;</hi> so
by sin are we oftentimes, ere we are aware, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into distempered affections, foolish imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and pleasing delightfulness in things that are
not good nor profitable. Hence is that caution of
the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, If a man be
<hi>surprized</hi> at unawares with a fault or in a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.
I doubt not but the subtilty of Satan, and
the power of temptation, are there taken into
consideration by the Apostle, which causeth him
to express a mans falling into sin, by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
if <hi>he be surprized;</hi> So this working of <hi>Indwelling-Sin</hi>
also hath its consideration in it, and that in the
<hi>chiefest place</hi> without which nothing else could
<hi>surprize</hi> us. For without the help thereof, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver
comes from without, from Satan, or the world,
must admit of some <hi>parley</hi> in the mind before it be
received, but it is from within, from our selves
that we are <hi>surprized.</hi> Hereby are we disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and wrought over to do that which we
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42900:37"/>
would not, and hindered from the doing of that
which we would.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that when the soul is oftentimes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as it were quite another thing, engaged quite
upon another design, sin starts that in the heart or
imaginations of it, that carryes it away into that
which is evil and sinful. Yea, to manifest its power,
sometimes when the soul is seriously engaged in
the <hi>mortification</hi> of any sin, it will by one means
or other lead it away into a <hi>dalliance</hi> with that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sin whose ruine it is seeking, and whose mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
it is engaged in. But as there is in this
operation of the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> a special <hi>enticing</hi> or
<hi>entangling,</hi> we shall speak unto it fully afterwards.
Now these <hi>surprizals</hi> can be from nothing but an
<hi>habitual propensity</hi> unto evil in the principle from
whence they proceed. Not an habitual inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto actual sin in the mind or heart, but an
habitual propensity unto evil in the sin that is in
the mind or heart. This prevents the soul with
its figments. How much communion with
God is hereby prevented, how many Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are disturbed, how much the minds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of Men have been defiled by this acting
of sin, some may have observed. I know no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
burthen in the life of a Believer than these <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary
surprizals</hi> of soul involuntary I say, as
to the actual consent of the Will, but not so in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of that corruption which is in the Will, and
is the Principle of them. And it is in respect unto
these, that the Apostle makes his complaint, <hi>Rom.</hi>
7. 24.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This <hi>habitual inclination</hi> manifests it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42900:38"/>
self in its <hi>readiness and promptness,</hi> without dispute
or altercation to joyn and close with every tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
whereby it may possibly be excited. As
we know it is in the nature of fire to burn, because
it immediately lays hold on whatever is <hi>combustible.</hi>
Let any temptation whatever be proposed unto
a man, the suitableness of whose <hi>matter</hi> unto his
corruptions, or manner of its proposal, makes it a
temptation; immediately he hath not only to do
with the temptation as outwardly proposed, but
also with his own heart about it. Without farther
consideration or debate, the temptation hath got a
friend in him. Not a moments space is given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>proposal,</hi> and the necessity there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on the soul to look to its enemy within.
And this also argues a constant <hi>habitual propensity</hi>
unto evil. Our Saviour said of the assaults and
temptations of Sathan, <hi>The Prince of this world
cometh, and he hath no part in me, Joh.</hi> 14. 30.
He had more temptations <hi>intensively</hi> and <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,</hi>
in number, quality and fierceness, from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
and the world, than ever had any of the sons
of men: But yet in all of them, he had to deal only
with that which came from <hi>without.</hi> His holy heart
had nothing to like them, suited to them, or ready
to give them entertainment: <hi>The Prince of this
world had nothing in him.</hi> So it was with <hi>Adam;</hi>
when a temptation be fell him, he had only the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
proposal of it to look unto, all was well
within, until the outward temptation took place and
prevailed. With us it is not so.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>City</hi> that is at unity in it self, compact and
entire, without divisions and parties, if an enemy
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42900:38"/>
approach about it, the Rulers and Inhabitants have
no thoughts at all but only how they may oppose
the enemy <hi>without,</hi> and resist him in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.
But if the City be <hi>divided</hi> in it self, if
there be factions and <hi>Traitors</hi> within, the very first
thing they do, is to look to the enemies at home,
the Traitors within; to cut off the head of <hi>Sheba,</hi>
if they will be safe. All was well with <hi>Adam</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
doors, when Satan came, so that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do but to look to his assaults and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.
But now on the access of any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the soul is instantly to look <hi>in,</hi> where it shall
find this <hi>Traitor</hi> at work, closing with the baits
of Sathan, and stealing away the heart. And this it
doth always, which evinceth an <hi>habitual inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Psal.</hi> 38. 17. saith <hi>David,</hi> I am ready to halt,
or <hi>for halting;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I am prepared</hi> and
disposed unto <hi>hallucination,</hi> to the slipping of my
foot into sin, <hi>verse</hi> 16. as he expounds the meaning
of that phrase, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 2, 3. There was from
<hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> a continual disposition in him to be
<hi>slipping,</hi> stumbling, halting on every occasion or
temptation. There is nothing so vain, foolish, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
fond, nothing so vile and abominable,
nothing so <hi>atheistical</hi> or execrable, but if it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto the soul in a way of temptation, there
is that in this <hi>Law of sin</hi> which is ready to answer it,
before it be decried by grace. And this is the first
thing in this <hi>lusting</hi> of the Law of sin, it consists in
its <hi>habitual propensity</hi> unto evil, manifesting it self
by the <hi>involuntary surprisals</hi> of the soul unto sin,
and its readiness without dispute or consideration
to joyn with all temptations whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42900:39"/>
Secondly, Its <hi>lusting</hi> consists in its <hi>actual</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
after that which is evil, and <hi>actual</hi> opposition
unto that which is good. The former instances
shewed its constant readiness to this work, this
now treats of the work it self. It is not only <hi>ready,</hi>
but for the most part always engaged. It <hi>lusteth</hi>
faith the holy Ghost, it doth so continually. It
<hi>stirreth</hi> in the soul by one act or other constantly,
almost as the spirits in the blood, or the blood in
the veins. This the Apostle calls its tempting,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Every man is tempted of his own lust.</hi>
Now what is it to be tempted? It is to have that
proposed to a mans consideration, which if he close
withall, it is evil, it is sin unto him. This is sins
trade; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>it lusteth.</hi> It is raising up in the
heart, and proposing unto the mind and affections,
that which is evil, trying, as it were, whether the
soul will close with its suggestions, or how far it
can carry them on, though it do not wholly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
Now when such a temptation comes from
<hi>without,</hi> it is unto the soul an <hi>indifferent</hi> thing,
neither good nor evil unless it be consented unto.
But the very proposal from <hi>within,</hi> it being the
souls own act, is its sin. And this is the work of
the <hi>Law of sin;</hi> it is restlesly and continually raising
up, and proposing innumerable various forms and
appearances of evil, in this or that kind, indeed in
every kind, that the nature of man is capable to
exercise corruption in. Something or other, in
matter, or manner, or circumstance, inordinate,
unspiritual, unanswerable unto the Rule, it ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and proposeth unto the soul. And this power
of sin to beget figments and idea's of actual evil in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42900:39"/>
the heart the Apostle may have respect unto,
1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 22. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
Keep your selves from every evil figment or <hi>idea</hi>
of sin in the heart; for the word there used doth
not any where signifie an <hi>outward form or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi>
neither is it the appearance of evil, but an
<hi>evil idea</hi> or figment that is intended. And this
<hi>lusting of sin</hi> is that which the Prophet expresseth
in wicked men, in whom the Law of it is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 20. <hi>The wicked are like the troubled
sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire
and dirt.</hi> A similitude most lively expressing the
<hi>lustings</hi> of the Law of sin, restlesly and continually
bubling up in the heart, with wicked, foolish and
filthy imaginations and desires. This then is the
first thing in the opposition that this enmity makes
to God, namely in its general inclination, it
<hi>lusteth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There is its particular way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
it <hi>fights</hi> or <hi>wars;</hi> that is, it acts with
strength and violence, as men do in war. First, it
<hi>lusts</hi> stirring and moving inordinate figments in the
<hi>Mind,</hi> desires in the appetite and the <hi>Affections,</hi>
proposing them to the <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll.</hi> But it rests not there,
it cannot rest: it urgeth, presseth and pursueth
its proposals with earnestness, strength and vigour,
fighting, and contending, and warring to obtain
its end and purpose. Would it meerly <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r up</hi> and
<hi>propose</hi> things to the soul, and immediately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in the sentence and judgment of the mind
that the thing is evil, against God, and his will,
and not farther to be insisted on, much sin might
be prevented that is now produced. But it <hi>rests</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:42900:40"/>
not here, it proceeds to carry on its design, and
that with earnestness and contention. By this
means, wicked men <hi>inflame themselves, Isa.</hi> 57. 5.
They are <hi>self-inflamers,</hi> as the word signifies, unto
sin, every spark of sin is cherished in them until it
grows into a flame, and so it will do in others
where it is so cherished.</p>
            <p>Now this fighting or warring of sin consists in
two things.</p>
            <p>First, In its <hi>rebellion</hi> against grace, or the Law
of the mind.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In its <hi>assaulting</hi> the soul, contending
for Rule and Sovereignty over it.</p>
            <p>The first is expressed by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23.
<hi>I find,</hi> saith he, <hi>another Law,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>rebelling against the Law of my
mind.</hi> There are, it seems, <hi>two Laws</hi> in us, the Law
of the flesh, or of sin; and the Law of the mind, or
of grace. But contrary Laws cannot both obtain
<hi>Sovereign</hi> power over the same person, at the same
time. The sovereign power in Believers, is in the
hand of the Law of grace; so the Apostle declares,
<hi>verse</hi> 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God in the inward
man.</hi> Obedience unto this Law is performed with
<hi>delight</hi> and complacency in the inward man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
its authority is <hi>lawful</hi> and good. So more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>For sin shall not have dominion
over you, for ye are not under the Law but under
grace.</hi> Now to war against the Law that hath a just
Sovereignty, is to rebell; and so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
signifies; it is to rebell, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ught to have been so
translated, <hi>reb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lling against the Law of my mind.</hi>
And this rebellion consists in a stubborn obstina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42900:40"/>
opposition unto the commands and directions of
the Law of grace. Doth the <hi>Law of the mind</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
any thing as duty? doth it severely rise up
against any thing that is evil? When the lusting of
the Law of sin rises up to this degree, it contends
against obedience with all its might, the effect
whereof, as the Apostle tells us, is <hi>the doing of that
which we would not, and the not doing of that which
we would, verse</hi> 15, 16. And we may gather a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
instance of the power of sin in this its rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
from this place. The <hi>Law of grace</hi> prevails
upon the Will, so that it <hi>would do</hi> that which is
good. <hi>To will is present with me,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>When I
would do good,</hi> ver. 19. And again, ver. 21. <hi>And I
would not do evil,</hi> ver. 19. 20. And it prevails upon
the <hi>understanding,</hi> so that it approves or disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
according to the dictates of the Law of grace.
<hi>Ver.</hi> 16. <hi>I consent unto the Law that it is good;</hi> and
<hi>verse</hi> 15. The Judgment always lies on the side of
grace. It prevails also on the <hi>affections,</hi> ver. 22. <hi>I
delight in the Law of God in the inward man.</hi>
Now if this be so, that grace hath the Sovereign
power in the Understanding, Will, and Affections,
whence is it that it doth not always prevail, that we
do not always do that which we would, and abstain
from that which we would not? Is it not strange
that a man should not do that which he chuseth,
willeth, liketh, delighteth in? Is there any thing
more required to enable us unto that which is good?
The Law of grace doth all as much as can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from it, that which in it self is abundantly suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for the perfecting of all holiness in the fear
of the Lord. But here lies the difficulty, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42900:41"/>
opposition that is made by the <hi>rebellion</hi> of
this Law of sin. Neither is it expressible with what
vigour and variety sin acts it self in this matter.
Sometimes it proposeth diversions, sometimes it
causeth weariness, sometimes it finds out difficulties,
sometimes it stirs up contrary affections, sometimes
it begets prejudices, and one way or other
intangles the soul, so that it never suffers grace to
have an absolute and complete success in any duty.
<hi>Verse</hi> 18. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I find
not the way <hi>perfectly to work</hi> out, or accomplish
that which is good; so the word signifies; and that
from this opposition and resistance that is made by
the Law of sin. Now this rebellion appears in two
things.</p>
            <p>First, In the opposition that it makes unto the
general <hi>purpose</hi> and course of the soul.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the opposition it makes unto <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
duties.</p>
            <p>First, In the opposition it makes to the <hi>general
purpose</hi> and course of the soul. There is none in
whom is the Spirit of Christ, that is his, but it is his
general design and purpose to walk in an universal
conformity unto him in all things. Even from the
inward frame of the heart, to the whole compass
of his outward actions, so it is with him. This
God requires in his Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, and be thou perfect.</hi> Accordingly his design
is to walk before God, and his frame is sincerity
and uprightness therein. This is called, <hi>Cleaving
unto the Lord with purpose of heart, Acts.</hi> 11. 23.
that is, in all things, and that not with a sloathful,
dead, ineffectual purpose, but such as is operative,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42900:41"/>
and sets the whole soul at work in pursuit of it.
This the Apostle sets forth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14.
<hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were
already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that for which also I am apprehended of
Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not my self to have
apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting
those things which are behind and reaching forth
unto those things which are before, I press toward
the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Jesus.</hi> He useth three words excellently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the souls universal pursuit of this purpose of
heart in cleaving unto God, First, saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ver.
12. <hi>I follow after,</hi> prosecute; the word signifies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to <hi>persecute,</hi> which with what earnestness and
diligence it is usually done, we know. Secondly,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I reach forward,</hi> reaching with great
intention of spirit and affections. It is a great and
constant endeavour that is expressed in that word.
Thirdly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, say we, <hi>I press to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the mark,</hi> that is, even as men that are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for a prize. All set forth the vigour, earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
diligence and constancy that is used in the
pursuit of this purpose. And this the nature of the
principle of Grace requireth in them in whom it is.
But yet we see with what <hi>failings,</hi> yea <hi>fallings,</hi>
their pursuit of this course is attended. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rame
of the heart is changed, the heart is stollen away,
the affections intangled, eruptions of unbelief and
distempered passions discovered, carnal wisdom
with all his attendances are set on work; all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the general principle and purpose of the
soul. And all this is from the <hi>rebellion</hi> of this Law
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42900:42"/>
of sin, stirring up and provoking the heart unto
disobedience, The Prophet gives this <hi>character</hi> of
<hi>hypocrites, Hos.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>Their heart is divided,
therefore shall they be found faulty.</hi> Now though
this be <hi>wholly</hi> so in respect of the mind and judgment
in hypocrites only, yet it is <hi>partially</hi> so in the best, in
the sense described. They have a division, not <hi>of</hi> the
heart, but <hi>in</hi> the heart; and thence it is that they
are so often found faulty. So saith the Apostle, <hi>so
that we cannot do the things that we would, Gal.</hi>
5. 17. We cannot accomplish the design of close
walking according to the Law of grace, because of
the contrariety and rebellion of this Law of sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It rebells also in respect unto parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
duties. It raiseth a combustion in the soul
against the particular commands and designings of
the Law of grace: <hi>You cannot do the things that you
would;</hi> that is, the duties which you judge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on you which you approve and delight in
in the inward man, you cannot do them as you
would. Take an instance in prayer. A man address<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himself unto that duty, he would not only
perform it, but he would perform it in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that the nature of the duty, and his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
do require. He would <hi>pray in the spirit,</hi> fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently,
with sighs and groans that cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered;
in faith with love and delight, pouring
forth his soul unto the Lord: this he aims at.
Now oftentimes he shall find a rebellion, a fighting
of the Law of sin in this matter. He shall find
difficulty to get <hi>any thing</hi> done, who thought to
do <hi>all things.</hi> I do not say, that it is thus <hi>always,</hi>
but it is so when sin <hi>wars</hi> and <hi>rebells,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42900:42"/>
an especial acting of its power. Woful
intanglements do poor creatures oftentimes meet
withall upon this account. Instead of that free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
Communion with God that they aim at,
the best that their souls arrive unto, is but to go
away mourning for their folly, deadness and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
In a word, there is no command of the
Law of Grace that is known, liked of, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the soul, but when it comes to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
this <hi>Law of sin</hi> one way or other makes
head and rebels against it. And this is the first way
of its <hi>fighting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It doth not only <hi>rebel</hi> and resist, but
it assaults the soul; it sets upon the Law of the
mind and grace, which is the second part of its
warring, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>they fight,</hi> or war <hi>against the soul. Jam.</hi> 4. 1.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>They fight,</hi> or
war <hi>in your members. Peter</hi> shews what they oppose
and fight against, namely the <hi>Soul,</hi> and the Law of
Grace therein; <hi>James,</hi> what they fight with, or
by, namely the members, or the corruption that
is in our mortal bodies. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
against a superiour; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is to assault or
war for superiority. It takes the part of an <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailant</hi>
as well as of a resister. It makes attempts
for rule and sovereignty, as well as opposeth the
rule of grace. Now all war and fighting hath
somewhat of <hi>violence</hi> in it, and there is therefore
some <hi>violence</hi> in that acting of sin, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
calls <hi>fighting</hi> and warring. And this assailing
efficacy of sin, as distinguished from its rebelling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
treated of, consists in these things that ensue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:42900:43"/>
First, All its <hi>positive</hi> actings in stirring up unto
sin, belong to this head. Oftentimes by the vanity
of the mind, or the sensuality of the affections,
the folly of the imaginations, it sets upon the <hi>soul</hi>
then, when the Law of grace is not actually put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it on duty, so that therein it doth not rebel
but assault. Hence the Apostle cries out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.
24. <hi>Who shall deliver me from it,</hi> who shall <hi>rescue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
me out of its hand, as the word signifies. When
we <hi>pursue</hi> an enemy, and he resists us, we do not
cry out, <hi>Who shall deliver us,</hi> for we are the assail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants;
but, <hi>Who shall rescue me,</hi> is the cry of one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
who is set upon by an enemy. So it is here, a man
is assaulted by his own <hi>lusts,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> speaks. By
the way side, in his employment, under a duty,
sin sets upon the soul with vain imaginations, foolish
desires, and would willingly employ the soul to
make provision for its satisfaction; which the
Apostle cautions us against, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
Do not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
the providence or projection of the flesh, for
its own satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Its <hi>importunity</hi> and urgency seems to
be noted in this expression of its <hi>warring.</hi> Enemies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in war are restless, pressing and importunate. So is
the Law of sin. Doth it set upon the soul? cast off
its motions, it returns again; rebuke them by the
power of grace, they withdraw for a while, and
return again. Set before them the Cross of Christ,
they do as those that came to take him, at sight of
him they went backwards, and fell unto the
ground, but they arose again and laid hands on
him. Sin gives places for a season, but returns and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42900:43"/>
presseth on the soul again. Mind it of the love of
God in Christ, though it be stricken, yet it gives
not over. Present <hi>Hell-fire</hi> unto it, it rusheth into
the midst of those flames. Reproach it with its
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olly and madness, it knows no shame, but presseth
on still. Let the thoughts of the mind strive to flie
from it, it follows as on the wings of the wind.
And by this <hi>importunity</hi> it wearies and warrs out

               </gap>t self imposed on with them, as if it were another
person, an express enemy got within him. All
this the Apostle discovers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15, 17. <hi>The
things that I do I hate;</hi> it is not of outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but the inward risings of the mind that he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reats. <hi>I hate them,</hi> saith he, I abominate them.
But why then will he have any thing more to do
with them? If he hate them, and abhor himself
for them, let them alone, have no more to do with
them, and so end the matter. Alas, saith he, <hi>verse</hi>
17. <hi>It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth
in me.</hi> I have one within me that is my enemy, that
with endless restless importunity puts these things
upon me, even the things that I hate and abominate;
I cannot be rid of them, I am weary of my self, I
cannot flie from them; <hi>O wretched man that I am,
who shall deliver me?</hi> I do not say that this is the
ordinary condition of Believers, but thus it is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42900:44"/>
often, when this Law of Sin riseth up to war and
fighting. It is not thus with them in respect of
particular sins, this or that sin, outward sins, sins
of life or conversation; but yet in respect of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of mind, inward and spiritual distempers, it
is often so. Some I know pretend to great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but I am resolved to believe the Apostle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them all and every one.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It carryes on its <hi>war,</hi> by entangling of
the Affections and drawing them into a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the mind. Let Grace be enthroned in
the mind and judgement, yet if the <hi>Law of Sin</hi>
layes hold upon, and entangles the Affections, or
any of them, it hath gotten a Fort from whence
it continually assaults the soul. Hence the great
duty of <hi>mortification</hi> is chiefly directed to take
place upon the Affections, Col. 3. 5. <hi>Mortifie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Members which are upon the earth, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
uncleanness, inordinate Affection, concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence
and covetousness which is Idolatry.</hi> The
members that are upon the Earth, are our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
For in the outward part of the body, sin is
not seated: in particular, not covetousness which is
there enumerated to be mortified amongst our <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that are on the Earth.</hi> Yea, after Grace hath
taken possession of the soul, the <hi>Affections</hi> do become
the principal seat of the remainders of sin. And
therefore <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that this Law <hi>is in our Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,
Rom.</hi> 7. 23. and <hi>James,</hi> that it wars in <hi>our
Members, Chap.</hi> 4. 1. that is, our Affections. And
there is no estimate to be taken of the work of
<hi>mortification</hi> aright, but by the Affections. We may
every day see Persons of very eminent Light,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42900:44"/>
that yet visibly have unmortified hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations.
Their Affections have not been <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
with Christ. Now then when this Law of
Sin can possess any Affection whatever it be, love,
delight, fear, it will make from it, and by it, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
assaults upon the soul. For instance, hath it
got the love of any one entangled with the world,
or the things of it, <hi>the lust of the flesh, the lust of
the eyes, or the pride of life:</hi> How will it take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
on every occasion, to break in upon the
soul? It shall do nothing, attempt nothing, be in
no place, or company, perform no duty, private
or publick, but sin will have one blow or other at
it; it will be one way or other soliciting for it
self.</p>
            <p>This is the summ of what we shall offer unto
this acting of the <hi>Law of Sin</hi> in a way of <hi>fighting</hi>
and warring against our souls, which is so often
mentioned in the Scripture. And a due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of it is of no small advantage unto us, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to bring us unto self-abasement, to teach
us to walk humbly and mournfully before God.
There are two things that are suited to humble
the souls of men. And they are, First, A due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of God, and then of themselves. Of
God in his Greatness, Glory, Holiness, Power, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and Authority; of our selves in our mean, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and sinful condition. Now of all things in
our condition, there is nothing so suited unto this
end and purpose, as that which lyes before us;
namely, the vile remainders of enmity against
God which are yet in our hearts and natures.
And it is no small evidence of a gracious soul,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42900:45"/>
when it is willing to search it self in this matter,
and to be helped therein from a word of truth.
When it is willing that the Word should dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the secret parts of the heart, and rip open what
ever of evil and corruption lyes therein. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
sayes of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hos. 10. 11. <hi>He loved to
tread out the corn;</hi> he loved to work when he
might eat, to have alwayes the corn before him;
but God sayes he, <hi>would cause him to plough;</hi> a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
no less needful, though at present not so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.
Most men love to hear of the <hi>doctrine of
Grace,</hi> of the pardon of sin, of free love, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they find <hi>food</hi> therein; however it is evident
that they grow and thrive in the life and notion of
them. But to be breaking up the <hi>fallow ground</hi> of
their hearts, to be enquiring after the weeds and
Briars that grow in them, they delight not so
much. Though this be no less necessary than the
other. This path is not so beaten as that of
Grace, nor so trod in, though it be the only way to
come to a true knowledge of Grace it self. It
may be some who are wise and grown in other
truths, may yet be so little skilled in searching
their own hearts, that they may be slow in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and understanding of these things. But
this <hi>sloth</hi> and neglect is to be shaken off, if we have
any regard unto our own souls. It is more than
probable, that many a false <hi>Hypocrite</hi> who have
deceived themselves as well as others, because they
thought the Doctrine of the Gospel pleased them,
and therefore supposed they believed it, might be
delivered from their soul ruining deceits, if they
would diligently apply themselves unto this search
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42900:45"/>
of their won hearts. Or would other <hi>Professor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
walk with so much boldness and security as some
do, if they considered a right what a deadly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Enemy they continually carry about with
them and in them; Would they so much <hi>indulge</hi>
as they do to carnal joyes, and pleasures, or pursue
their perishing affairs with so much delight and
greediness as they do? It were to be wished, that
we would all apply our hearts more to this work,
even to come to a true understanding of the nature,
power and subtilty of this our Adversary, that
our souls may be humbled; and that,</p>
            <p>First, In walking with God; His delight is with
the humble and contrite ones, those that tremble at
his word, the mourners in <hi>Sion,</hi> and such are we
only, when we have a due sense of our own vile
condition. This will beget reverence of God, sense
of our distance from him, admiration of his Grace
and condescension, a due valuation of mercy, far
above those light verbal aiery <hi>attainments</hi> that
some have boasted of.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In walking with others, it layes in
provision to prevent those great evils of judging,
spiritual unmercifulness, harsh censuring, which
I have observed to have been pretended by many,
who at the same time, as afterwards hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
have been guilty of greater or worser
crimes, than those which they have raved against
in others. This, I say, will lead us to meekness,
compassion, readiness to forgive, to pass by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
even when we shall consider what is our
state, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> plainly declares, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. The
man that understands the evil of hi sownheart,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42900:46"/>
how vile it is, is the only useful, fruitful and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly
believing and obedient person. Others are
fit only to delude themselves, to disquiet Families,
Churches, and all Relations whatever. Let us then
consider our hearts wisely, and then go and see if
we can be proud of our <hi>gifts,</hi> our graces, our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation
and esteem amongst Professors, our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Let us go then and judge, condemn, reproach
others that have been tempted; we shall find a
great inconsistency in these things. And many
things of the like nature might be here added
upon the consideration of this woful effect of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

in its opposition unto God, and the Law of

7. 23. <hi>I find a Law leading me Captive, (Captivating
me) unto the Law of Sin.</hi> And this is the utmost
height which the Apostle in that place carries the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42900:46"/>
opposition and warring of the remainders of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling-Sin
unto; closing the consideration of it
with a complaint of the state and condition of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
thereby; and an earnest prayer for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from it, ver. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am,
who shall deliver me from this body of death.</hi> What
is contained in this expression, and intended by it,
shall be declared in the ensuing Observations.</p>
            <p>First, It is not directly the <hi>power</hi> and actings of
the Law of Sin that are here expressed, but its <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi>
in and upon its actings. But <hi>success</hi> is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
evidence of power, and <hi>leading Captive</hi> in War
is the height of <hi>success.</hi> None can aime at greater
<hi>success,</hi> than to lead their Enemies Captive. And
it is a peculiar expression in the Scripture of <hi>great
success.</hi> So the Lord Christ on his victory over
Satan, is said to <hi>lead Captivity Captive, Ephes.</hi> 4. 8.
That is, to conquer him, who had conquered and
prevailed upon others. And this he did when by
death he <hi>destroyed him that had the power of death,
that is the Devil, Heb.</hi> 2. 14. Here then a great
<hi>prevalency</hi> and power of sin in its warring against
the soul is discovered. It so wars, as to <hi>lead Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi>
which had it not great power, it could not
do, especially against that <hi>resistance</hi> of the soul
which is included in this expression.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is said, that it leads the
soul captive <hi>unto the Law of Sin.</hi> Not to this or
that sin, particular sin, actual sin, but to the
<hi>Law of Sin.</hi> God for the most part orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
things so, and gives out such supplies of
grace unto Believers, as that they shall not be made
a prey unto <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> particular sin, that it should
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42900:47"/>
prevail in them, and compel them to serve it in
the lusts thereof, that it should have Dominion
over them, that they should be <hi>Captives</hi> and slaves
unto it. This is that which <hi>David</hi> prayes so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
against, Psalm. 19. 12, 13. <hi>Cleanse thou me
from secret faults, keep back thy servant also from
presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over
me, then shall I be upright.</hi> He supposeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the Law of Sin in him, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. which
will bring forth <hi>errors of life,</hi> and secret sins against
which he findeth relief in pardoning and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
mercy which he prayes for. This saith he
will be my condition. But for <hi>sins of pride</hi> and
boldness, such all sins are, that get <hi>Dominion</hi> in
a man, that make a <hi>Captive</hi> of a man, the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
thy servant from them. For what sin soever
gets such power in a man, be it in its own nature
small or great, it becomes in him in whom it is,
a sin of <hi>boldness, pride,</hi> and presumption. For these
things are not reckoned from the nature or kind
of the sin, but from its prevalency and customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness,
wherein its pride, boldness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and contempt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of God doth consist. To the same purpose, if I
mistake not, prayes <hi>Jabez,</hi> 1 Chron. 4. 10. <hi>O that
thou wouldst bless me indeed and enlarge my Coast,
and that thine hand may be with me, and that thou
wouldst keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me.</hi>
The holy man took occasion from his <hi>own name</hi>
to pray against sin that that might not be a <hi>grief
and sorrow</hi> to him by its power and prevalency.
I confess sometimes it may come to this with a
Believer, that for a season he may be <hi>lead Captive</hi>
by some particular sin. It may have so much
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42900:47"/>
prevalency <hi>in</hi> him, as to have power <hi>over</hi> him. So
it seems to have been with <hi>David</hi> when he lay so
long in his sin without repentance. And was plainly
so with those in Isa. 57. 17, 18. <hi>For the iniquity
of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him, I
hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly
in the way of his heart; I have seen his wayes, and
will heal him.</hi> They continued under the power of
their <hi>covetousness:</hi> so that no dealings of God with
them, for so long a time could reclaim them. But
for the most part when any Lust or Sin doth so
prevail, it is from the advantage and fartherance
that it hath got by some <hi>powerful temptation</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
He hath poysoned it, enflamed it, and entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
the soul. So the Apostle speaking of such as
through sin were fallen off from their holiness sayes,
<hi>they were in the snare of the Devil, being taken
Captive by him at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 26. Though it
were their own lust, that they served, yet they
were brought into bondage thereunto, by being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
in some snare of Satan. And thence they are
said to be <hi>taken alive,</hi> as a poor Beast in a toyle.</p>
            <p>And here, by the way we may a little enquire
whether the prevailing power of a particular sin
in any, be from it self, or from the influence of
<hi>temptation</hi> upon it, concerning which at present
take only these two Observations.</p>
            <p>First, Much of the <hi>prevalency</hi> of sin upon the
soul is certainly from <hi>Satan,</hi> when the perplexing
and captivating sin hath no peculiar footing, nor
advantage in the nature, constitution, or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the sinner. When any <hi>lust</hi> grows high and
prevailing more than others upon its own account,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42900:48"/>
it is from the peculiar advantage that it hath in the
natural constitution, or the station or condition of
the person in the world. For otherwise the Law
of Sin gives an equal propensity unto all evil, an
equal vigour unto every lust. When therefore it
cannot be discerned, that the <hi>captivating</hi> sin is
peculiary fixed in the nature of the sinner, or is
advantaged from his education or employment in
the world, the prevalency of it is peculiary from
Satan. He hath got to the root of it, and hath
given it poyson and strength. Yea, perhaps some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that which may seem to the <hi>soul</hi> to be the
corrupt <hi>lusting</hi> of the heart, is nothing but Satans
imposing his suggestions on the imagination. If
then a man find an importunate rage from any
corruption, that is not evidently seated in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Let him as the Papists say, <hi>cross</hi> himself, or
fly by faith to the Cross of Christ, for the Devil
is nigh at hand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When a Lust is prevalent unto <hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi>
where it brings in no advantage to the <hi>flesh,</hi> it
is from Satan. All that the Law of Sin doth of it
self, is to serve the <hi>providence of the flesh, Rom.</hi>
13. 14. And it must bring in unto it somewhat of
the profits and pleasures that are its object. Now
if the prevailing sin do not so act it self, if it be
more spiritual and inward, it is much from Satan
by the imagination, more than the corruption of
the heart it self. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>I say then, that the Apostle treats not here, of
our being <hi>captivated</hi> unto this or that sin, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Law of Sin.</hi> That is, we are compelled to
bear its presence and burden whether we will or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42900:48"/>
no. Sometimes the soul thinks or hopes that it
may through grace be <hi>utterly freed</hi> from this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
Inmate. Upon some sweet enjoyment of
God, some full supply of grace, some return from
wandering, some deep affliction, some through
humiliation, the poor soul begins to hope that it
shall now be freed from the Law of Sin. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while it perceives that it is quite otherwise.
Sin acts again, makes good its old station, and
the soul finds that whether it will or no, it must
bear its yoke. This makes it sigh and cry out for
deliverance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This leading Captive argues a preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
against the <hi>renitency</hi> or contrary actings of
the will. This is intimated plainly in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
namely, that the will opposeth, and
makes head as it were against the working of sin.
This the Apostle declares in those expressions
which he uses, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 19, 20. And herein consists
the <hi>lusting of the Spirit</hi> against the flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.
17. That is, the contending of grace to expell and
subdue it. The spiritual habits of grace that are in
the <hi>Will,</hi> do so resist and act against it. And the
excitation of those habits by the Spirit are directed
to the same purpose. This leading <hi>Captive,</hi> is
contrary I say, to the inclinations and actings of
the <hi>renewed will.</hi> No man is made a Captive but
against his will. Captivity is misery and trouble,
and no man willingly puts himself into trouble.
Men chuse it in its <hi>causes,</hi> and in the wayes
and means leading unto it, but not in it self.
So the Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> informs us, Hos. 5. 11. <hi>Ephraim
was not willingly oppressed and broken in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42900:49"/>
Judgement;</hi> that was his misery and trouble; but
he willingly walked after the Commandement of
the <hi>Idolatrous Kings</hi> which brought him thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Whatever consent then the soul may give unto
sin, which is the means of this Captivity, it gives
none to the <hi>Captivity</hi> it self; that is against the will
wholly. Hence these things ensue.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That the power of sin is great,</hi> which is that
which we are in the demonstration of; and this
appears in its prevalency unto Captivity; against
the actings and contendings of the will for liberty
from it. Had it no opposition made unto it, or were
its Adversary, weak, negligent, slothful, it were no
great evidence of its power, that it made Captives.
But its prevailing against diligence, activity,
watchfulness, the constant renitency of the will,
this evinceth its efficacy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This leading Captive intimates <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
particular successes.</hi> Had it not success in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
it could not be said at all to lead captive.
Rebell it might, assail it might, but it cannot be
said to <hi>lead Captive</hi> without some successes. And
there are several degrees of the success of the Law
of Sin in the soul. Sometimes it carries the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
unto outward <hi>actual sin</hi> which is its utmost
aim. Sometimes it obtaineth the <hi>consent of the
will,</hi> but is cast out by grace, and proceeds no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Sometimes it wearies and entangles the
soul, that it turns aside as it were, and leaves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
which is a success also. One or more, or
all of these must be, where <hi>Captivity</hi> takes place.
Such a kind of course doth the Apostle ascribe unto
cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ousness, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:42900:49"/>
Thirdly, This leading captive manifests this
condition <hi>to be miserable and wretched.</hi> To be thus
yoked and dealt withall against the judgment of
the mind, the choice and consent of the will, its
utmost strivings and contendings, how sad is it?
When the neck is sore and tender with former
pressures, to be compell'd to bear the yoke again,
this pierces, this grieves, this even breaks the heart.
When the soul is principled by grace unto a
<hi>loathing</hi> of sin, of every evil way, to an hatred of
the least discrepancy between it self and the holy
will of God, then to be imposed on by this <hi>Law of
sin,</hi> with all that enmity and folly, that deadness
and filth, wherewith it is attended: what more
dreadful condition? All captivity is dreadful in its
own nature; the greatest aggravation of it is from
the condition of the Tyrant unto whom any one is
captivated. Now what can be worse than this Law
of sin? Hence the Apostle having once mentioned
this captivity, cries out as one quite weary and
ready to faint, <hi>ver.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This condition is <hi>peculiar to Believers.</hi>
Unregenerate men are not said to be <hi>led captive</hi> to
the Law of sin. They may indeed be led captive
unto this or that particular sin or corruption, that
is, they may be forced to serve it against the power
of their convictions. They are convinced of the
evil of it, an adulterer of his uncleanness, a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
of his abomination, and make some resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it may be, against it. But their lust is too
hard for them, they cannot cease to sin, and so
are made captives or slaves to this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
sin. But they cannot be said to be <hi>led captive
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42900:50"/>
to the Law of sin,</hi> and that because they are willingly
subject thereunto. It hath, as it were, a rightful
dominion over them, and they oppose it not, but
only when it hath irruptions to the disturbance of
their consciences. And then the opposition they
make unto it is not from their <hi>wills,</hi> but is the mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
acting of an affrighted conscience, and a convinced
mind. They regard not the <hi>nature</hi> of sin, but its
<hi>guilt</hi> and consequences. But to be brought into
captivity, is that which befalls a man against his
will. Which is all that shall be spoken unto this
degree of the actings of the power of sin, manifesting
it self in its success.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last degree of the opposition
made by the Law of sin to God, and the Law of
his Will and Grace, is in its <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Madness.</hi>
There is <hi>Madness</hi> in its nature, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>The
heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness
is in their heart.</hi> The evil that the heart of man is
full of by nature, is that <hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> whereof we
speak. And this is so in their heart, that it riseth
up unto <hi>madness.</hi> The holy Ghost expresseth this
rage of sin by a fit similitude which he useth in
sundry places, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Hos.</hi> 8. 9. It maketh
<hi>men as a wild Ass;</hi> she traverseth her ways, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>eth up the wind, and runneth whither her mind
or lust leads her. And he saith of Idolaters enraged
with their lusts, that they <hi>are mad upon their idols,
Jer.</hi> 5. 38. We may a little consider what lies in
this <hi>madness</hi> and rage of sin, and how it riseth up
thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rst, For the <hi>nature</hi> of it, it seems to consist in
a violent, heady, per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inacious pressing unto evil or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42900:50"/>
sin. <hi>Violence,</hi> importunity and pertinacy are in it.
It is the tearing and torturing of the soul by any
sin to force its consent, and to obtain satisfaction.
It riseth up in the heart, is denied by the Law of
grace, and rebuked; it returns and exerts its
poison again; the soul is startled, casts it of; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
again with new violence and importunity,
the soul cries out for help and deliverance, looks
round about to all springs of Gospel grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
trembles at the furious assaults of sin, and casts
it self into the arms of Christ for deliverance. And
if it be not table to take that course, it is foiled and
hurried up and down through the mire and filth
of foolish imaginations, corrupt and noisome lusts,
which rend and tear it, as if they would devour its
whole spiritual life and power. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9,
10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. It was not much otherwise with
them whom we instanced in before, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 17.
They had an inflamed inraged lust working in
them; even <hi>covetousness,</hi> or the love of this world,
by which, as the Apostle speaks, men <hi>pierce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
through with many sorrows.</hi> God is angry
with them, and discovereth his wrath by all the
ways and means that it was possible for them to be
made sensible thereof. He was <hi>wroth</hi> and smo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
them; but though it may be this staggered them
a little, yet they went on. <hi>He is angry, and hides
himself from them,</hi> deserts them as to his gracious
assisting comforting Presence. Doth this work the
effect? No they go on <hi>frowardly</hi> still, as men mad on
their covetousness. Nothing can put a stop to their
raging lusts. This is <hi>plain madness</hi> and fury. We
need not seek far for instances, we see men mad on
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42900:51"/>
their lusts every day: And which is the worst kind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of <hi>madness,</hi> their lusts do not rage so much in
them, as they rage in the pursuit of them. Are
those greedy pursuits of things in the world, which
we see some men engaged in, though they have
other pretences, indeed an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thing else but plain
<hi>madness</hi> in the pursuit of their lusts? God who
searcheth the hearts of men, knows, that the most
of things that are done with other pretences in the
world, are nothing but the actings of men mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and furious in the pursuit of their lusts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That sin ariseth not unto this height
ordinarily, but when it hath got a double advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>First, That it be provoked, enraged and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by some great <hi>temptation.</hi> Though it be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
poison in it self, yet being inbred in nature, it
grows not violently outragious without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
of some new poison of <hi>Sathan</hi> unto it in
a suitable t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mptation. It was the advantage that
Sathan got against <hi>David,</hi> by a suitable temptation
that raised his lusts to that <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>madness,</hi> which
it went forth unto in the business of <hi>Bathsheba</hi> and
<hi>Vriah.</hi> Though sin be always a fire in the bones,
yet it flames not, unless Sathan come with his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
to blow it up. And let any one in whom the
Law of sin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riseth to this height of rage, seriously
consider, and he may find out where the devil
stands and puts in the business.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It must be advantaged by some <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
entertainment and prevalency. Sin grows not
to this height at its first assault. Had it not been
suffered to make its entrance, had there not been
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42900:51"/>
some yielding in the soul, this had not come about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The great wisdom and security of the soul in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with in-dwelling sin, is to put a violent stop
unto its <hi>beginnings,</hi> its first motions and actings.
Venture all on the first attempt. Die rather than
yield one step unto it. If through the <hi>deceit</hi> of sin,
or the <hi>negligence</hi> of the soul, or its carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to give bounds to lusts actings at other sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
it makes any entrance into the soul, and finds
any entertainment, it gets strength and power, and
insensibly ariseth to the frame under consideration.
Thou hadst never had the experience of the <hi>fury</hi>
of sin, if thou hadst not been content with some of
its <hi>dalliances.</hi> Hadst thou not brought up this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
this slave delicately, it would not have now
presumed beyond a son. Now when the <hi>Law of
sin</hi> in any particular hath got this double advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
the furtherance of a vigorous temptation,
and some prevalency formerly obtained, whereby
it is let into the strengths of the soul, it often riseth
up to this frame whereof we speak.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We may see what <hi>accompanies</hi> this
rage and madness, what are the properties of it, and
what effects it produceth.</p>
            <p>First, There is in it the casting off, for a time at
least, of the yoke, rule and government of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Law of Grace. Where Grace hath the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi>
it will never utterly be expell'd from its
Throne, it will still keep its right and sovereignty.
But its <hi>influences</hi> may for a season be intercepted,
and its government be suspended by the power of
sin. Can we think that the <hi>Law of grace</hi> had any
actual influence of rule on the heart of <hi>David,</hi> when
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42900:52"/>
upon the provocation received from <hi>Nabal,</hi> he
was so hurried with the desire of self-revenge, that
he cryed, <hi>gird on your swords,</hi> to his companions,
and resolved not to leave alive one man of his whole
houshold, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25 34. Or that <hi>Asa</hi> was in any
better frame, when he <hi>smote the Prophet,</hi> and put him
in Prison, that spake unto him in the name of
the Lord. Sin in this case is like an <hi>untamed Horse,</hi>
which having first cast off his Rider, runs away
with fierceness and rage. It first casts off a present
sense of the yoke of Christ, and the Law of his
Grace, and then hurries the soul at its pleasure.
Let us a little consider how this is done.</p>
            <p>The seat and residence of grace is in the whole
soul; it is in the Inner man, it is in the mind, the
will, and the affections; for the <hi>whole soul is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
by it unto the Image of God, Ephes.</hi> 4. 23,
24. And the whole man is a <hi>new Creature,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 17. And in all these doth it exert its power and
efficacy; Its Rule or Dominion is the pursuit of its
effectual working in all the faculties of the soul,
as they are one united principle of moral and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
operations. So then, the interrupting of
its exercise, of its Rule and Power by the Law
of Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must consist in its contrary acting in and
upon the faculties and affections of the soul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by which grace should exert its power
and efficacy. And this it doth. It <hi>darkens</hi> the
mind, partly through innumerable vain preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
and false reasonings, as we shall see when
we come to consider its <hi>deceitfulness;</hi> and partly
through the <hi>steaming</hi> of the Affections, heated
with the noisome lusts that have laid hold on
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42900:52"/>
them. Hence that saving light that is in the
mind is clouded and stifled, that it cannot put
forth its <hi>transforming power</hi> to change the soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the likeness of Christ discovered unto it, which
is its proper work, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. The habitual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the will to obedience, which is the
next way of the working of the Law of grace, is
first <hi>weakned,</hi> then cast aside, and rendered useless
by the continual solicitations of sin and temptation;
so that the will first lets go its hold, and disputes
whether it shall yield or no; and at last gives up
it self to its Adversary; and for the <hi>Affections</hi>
commonly the beginning of this evil is in them.
They cross one another, and torture the soul with
their impetuous violence. By this way is the
Rule of the Law of Grace intercepted by the Law
of Sin, even by imposing upon it in the whole <hi>seat</hi>
of its Government. When this is done, it is sad
work that sin will make in the soul. the Apostle
warns Believers to take heed hereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12.
<hi>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies
that you should obey it in the lusts thereof.</hi> Look to
it that it get not the <hi>Dominion,</hi> that it usurp not
Rule, no not for a moment. It will labour to intrude
it self into the <hi>Throne,</hi> watch against it, or a woful
state and condition lyes at the door. This then
accompanies this rage and madness of the Law of
Sin. It casts off during its prevalency the Rule
of the Law of Grace wholly. It speaks in the
soul, but is not heard, it commands the contrary,
but is not obeyed. It cryes out, <hi>do not this
abominable thing which the Lord hateth,</hi> but is
not regarded; that is, not so far as to be able to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42900:53"/>
put a present stop to the rage of sin, and to recover
its own rule, which God in his own time restores
to it by the power of his Spirit dwelling in
us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Madness</hi> or rage are accompanied
with <hi>fearlesness</hi> and contempt of danger. It takes
away the power of consideration, and all that
influence that it ought to have upon the soul. Hence
sinners that are wholly under the power of this
rage, are said, <hi>to run upon God and the thick bosses
of his buckler,</hi> Job 16. 21. That wherein he is
armed for their utter ruine. They despise the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
that he can do to them, being secretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to accomplish their lusts though it cost
them their souls. Some few considerations will
farther clear this unto us.</p>
            <p>First, Ofttimes when the soul is broken loose
from the power of <hi>renewing grace,</hi> God deals with
it to keep it within bounds by <hi>preventing grace.</hi>
So the Lord declares that he will deal with <hi>Israel,
H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s.</hi> 2. 6. seeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hou hast rejected me, I will take
another course with thee. I will lay obstacles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee that thou shalt not be able to pass on
whither the fury of thy lusts would drive thee. He
will propose that to them from without, that shall
obstruct them in their progress.</p>
            <p>Secondly, These <hi>hinderances</hi> that God laves in
the way of sinners, as shall be afterwards at large
declared; are of two sorts.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Rational considerations</hi> taken from the
consequence of the sin and evil that the soul is soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
unto, and perplexed withal. Such are the
<hi>fear of Death,</hi> Judgement, and Hell, falling into the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42900:53"/>
hands of the Living God, who is a consuming fire.
Whilest a man is under the power of the Law of
the Spirit of Life, the <hi>Love of Christ constraineth
him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. The principle of his doing good
and abstaining from evil, is <hi>faith working by love,</hi>
accompanied with a following of Christ because of
the sweet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour of his name. But now when
this blessed <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> yoke</hi> is for a season cast off, so as
was manifested before, God sets an hedge of <hi>terrour</hi>
before the soul, minds it of Death and Judgement
to come, flashes the flames of Hell Fire in the face,
fills the soul with consideration of all the evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of sin to deter it from its purpose. To this
end doth he make use of all threatnings recorded
in the Law and Gospel. To this Head also may be
referred all the considerations that may be taken
from things temporal, as shame, reproach,
scandal, punishments, and the like. By the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of these things, I say, doth God set an
<hi>hedge</hi> before them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Providential Dispensations are used
by the Lord to the same purpose, and these are of
two sorts;</p>
            <p>First, Such as are suited to work upon the soul,
and to cause it to desist and give over in its lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and pursuit of sin. Such are <hi>Afflictions</hi> and
Mercies, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 17. <hi>I was wroth and I smote them,</hi>
I testified my dislike of their wayes by Afflictions;
So <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 9, 11, 12. <hi>God chastens men with pains
on their bodies,</hi> saith he, in <hi>Job, to turn them from
their purpose, and to hide sin from them, Job</hi> 33.
17, 19. And other wayes he hath to come to them
and touch them, as in their Names, Relations,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42900:54"/>
Estates and desirable things. Or else he heaps
mercies on them that they may consider whom they
are rebelling against. It may be signal distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
mercies are made their portion for many
dayes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Such as <hi>actually hinder</hi> the soul from
pursuing sin, though it be resolved so to do. The
various wayes whereby God doth <hi>this,</hi> we must
afterwards consider.</p>
            <p>These are the wayes I say, whereby the soul is
dealt withal, after the Law of <hi>Indwelling-Sin</hi> hath
cast off for a season the influencing power of the
Law of Grace. But now when <hi>lust</hi> rises up to
<hi>rage</hi> or <hi>madness,</hi> it will also contemn all these,
even the Rod and him that hath appointed it.
It will rush on shame, reproaches, wrath, and
whatever may befall it. That is, though they be
presented unto it, it will venture upon them all.
Rage and madness is <hi>fearless.</hi> And this it doth two
wayes.</p>
            <p>First, It <hi>possess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th the mind,</hi> that it suffers not the
consideration of these things to dwell upon it, but
renders the thoughts of them slight and <hi>evanid.</hi>
Or if the mind do force it self to a contemplation
of them, yet it interposeth between it and the
<hi>Affections,</hi> that they shall not be influenced by it
in any proportion to what is required. The soul
in such a condition will be able to take such things
into contemplation, and not at all to be moved by
them. And where they do prevail for a season,
yet they are insensibly wrought off from the heart
again.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By secret stubborn <hi>resolves</hi> to venture
all upon the way wherein it is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42900:54"/>
And this is the second branch of this Evidence
of the <hi>power of sin,</hi> taken from the opposition that
it makes to the <hi>Law of Grace, as it were</hi> by the
way of force, strength and violence; the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its <hi>deceit</hi> doth now follow.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>THE second part of the evidence of the <hi>power
of Sin</hi> from its manner of operation, is taken
from its <hi>deceitfulness.</hi> It adds in its working, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi>
unto <hi>power.</hi> The efficacy of that must needs
be great, and is carefully to be watched against,
by all such as value their souls, where power and
deceit are combined, especially advantaged
and assisted by all the wayes and means before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on.</p>
            <p>Before we come to shew wherein the nature of
this <hi>deceitfulness of sin</hi> doth consist, and how it
prevaileth thereby, some testimonies shall be
briefly given in unto the <hi>thing it self,</hi> and some
light into the <hi>general nature</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:42900:55"/>
That Sin, <hi>Indwelling-Sin,</hi> is deceitful, we have
the express Testimony of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi>
3. 13. <hi>Take heed that ye be not hardened by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness
of sin.</hi> Deceitful it is, take heed of it,
watch against it, or it will produce its utmost effect
in <hi>hardening of the heart</hi> against God. It is on the
account of sin, that the <hi>heart</hi> is said to be <hi>deceitful
above all things, Jer.</hi> 17. 9. Take a man in other
things, and as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, though he <hi>would be
wise and crafty, he is like the wild Asses Colt,
Job</hi> 11. 12. a poor, vain, empty, nothing. But
consider his <hi>heart</hi> on the account of this Law of Sin,
it is <hi>crafty</hi> and deceitful above all things, <hi>They are
wise to do evil,</hi> saith the Prophet, but to do good
they know not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 22. To the same purpose
speaks the Apostle, Ephes. 4. 2. <hi>The old man is
corrupt according to deceitful lusts.</hi> Every lust,
which is a branch of this Law of Sin, is <hi>deceitful;</hi>
and where there is poyson in every stream, the
Fountain must needs be corrupt. No particular lust
hath any <hi>deceit</hi> in it, but what is communicated
unto it from this Fountain of all actual lust, this
<hi>Law of Sin.</hi> And (2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10.) the coming
of the Man of Sin, is said to be in and with the
<hi>deceivableness of unrightcousness.</hi> Unrighteousness
is a thing generally decryed and evil spoken of
amongst men, so that it is not easie to conceive how
any man should prevail himself of a reputation
thereby. But there is a <hi>deceivableness</hi> in it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the minds of men are turned aside from a due
consideration of it; as we shall manifest afterwards.
And thus the account which the Apostle gives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those who are under the power of sin is,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42900:55"/>
that they are <hi>deceived, Titus</hi> 3. 3. And the life of
evil men, is nothing but <hi>deceiving and being
deceived,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. So that we have sufficient
Testimony given unto this qualification of the
<hi>Enemy</hi> with whom we have to deal; he is <hi>deceitful,</hi>
which consideration of all things puts the mind of
man to a loss in dealing with an Adversary. He
knows he can have no security against one that is
<hi>deceitful,</hi> but in standing upon his own guard and
defence all his dayes.</p>
            <p>Farther to manifest the strength and advantage
that sin hath by its <hi>deceit,</hi> we may observe that the
Scripture places it for the most part as the head
and spring of every sin, even as though there were
no sin <hi>followed after,</hi> but where <hi>deceit</hi> went before.
So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13, 14. The reason the Apostle gives
why <hi>Adam</hi> though he was <hi>first formed,</hi> was not
<hi>first in the transgression,</hi> is because he was not <hi>first
deceived.</hi> The Woman though made last, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>first deceived,</hi> was first in the sin. Even that
first sin began in deceit, and until the mind was
<hi>deceived,</hi> the soul was safe. <hi>Eve</hi> therefore did truly
express the matter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 13. though she did it
not to a good end; <hi>the Serpent beguiled me,</hi> saith
she, <hi>and I did eat.</hi> She thought to extenuate her
own crime, by charging the <hi>Serpent.</hi> And this
was a new fruit of the sin she had cast her self into.
But the matter of fact was true, she was <hi>beguiled</hi>
before she eat; deceit went before the transgression.
And the Apostle shews that Sin and Satan still take
the same c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urse, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. There is saith he, the
same way of working towards actual sin, as was of
old; beguiling, deceiving goes before, and sin that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42900:56"/>
is the actual accomplishment of it followeth after.
Hence all the great works that the Devil doth in
the world, to stir men up to an opposition unto the
Lord Jesus Christ and his Kingdom, he doth them
by <hi>deceit,</hi> Rev. 12. 9. <hi>The Devil who deceiveth
the whole world.</hi> It were utterly impossible men
should be prevailed on to abide in his service,
acting his designs to their eternal, and sometimes
their temporal ruine, were they not exceedingly
<hi>deceived.</hi> See also <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 10.</p>
            <p>Hence are those manifold Cautions that are
given us to take heed, that <hi>we be not deceived,</hi> if
we would take heed that we do not sin. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.
6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.
8. From all which testimonies we may learn the
influence that <hi>deceit</hi> hath into <hi>sin,</hi> and consequently
the advantage that the <hi>Law of Sin</hi> hath to put forth
its power by its <hi>deceitfulness.</hi> Where it prevails to
deceive, it fails not to bring forth its fruit.</p>
            <p>The ground of this efficacy of sin by deceit is
taken from the <hi>faculty of the soul</hi> affected with it.
Deceit properly affects the <hi>mind;</hi> it is the <hi>mind</hi>
that is deceived. When sin attempts any other way
of entrance into the soul, as by the <hi>Affections,</hi> the
mind retaining its right and Soveraignty, is able to
give check and controul unto it. But where the
mind is tainted, the prevalency must be great.
For the <hi>mind</hi> or understanding is the leading fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the soul, and what that fixes on, the will
and affections rush after, being capable of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
but what that presents unto them.
Hence it is, that though the entanglement of the
<hi>Affections</hi> unto sin be oft-times most troublesome,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42900:56"/>
yet the deceit of the <hi>mind</hi> is alwayes most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
and that because of the place that it possesseth
in the soul, as unto all its operations. Its Office
is to <hi>guide, direct,</hi> choose and lead; and if the
light that is in us be darkness, how great is that
darkness.</p>
            <p>And this will farther appear, if we consider the
nature of <hi>deceit</hi> in general. It consists in presenting
unto the soul, or mind, things <hi>otherwise than they
are,</hi> either in their Nature, Causes, Effects, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
respect unto the soul. This is the general
nature of <hi>deceit,</hi> and it prevails many wayes. It
<hi>hides</hi> what ought to be seen and considered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals
circumstances and consequences, presents what
is not, or things <hi>as they are not,</hi> as we shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
manifest in particular. It was shewed before,
that Satan beguiled and <hi>deceived</hi> our first Parents;
that term the Holy Ghost gives unto his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and seduction. And how he did deceive them
the Scripture relates, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 4, 5. He did it by
representing things <hi>otherwise</hi> than they were. The
fruit was <hi>desirable,</hi> that was apparent unto the
eye. Hence Satan takes advantage secretly to
insinuate, that it was meerly an <hi>abridgement</hi> of
their happiness, that God aimed at in forbidding
them to eat of it. That it was for a tryal of their
obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that certain though not immediate
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> would ensue upon the eating of it, he <hi>hides</hi>
from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>m; only he proposeth the present advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of knowledge, and so presents the whole case
quite otherwise unto them, than indeed it was.
This is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>re of <hi>deceit;</hi> it is a Representation
of a matter under disguises, hiding that which is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42900:57"/>
undesirable, proposing that which indeed is not in
it, that the mind may make a false judgment of it.
So <hi>Jacob</hi> deceived <hi>Isaac</hi> by his Brothers raiment,
and the skins on his hands and neck.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Deceit</hi> hath advantage by that way of
management which is inseparable from it. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
carried on by <hi>degrees,</hi> by little and little, that
the whole of the design and aim in hand be not at
once discovered. So dealt <hi>Satan</hi> in that great <hi>deceit</hi>
before-mentioned; he proceeds in it by steps and
degrees. First, He takes off an objection, and tells
them <hi>they shall not die;</hi> then proposeth <hi>the good of
knowledge to them,</hi> and their being <hi>like to God</hi>
thereby. To hide and conceal ends, to proceed by
<hi>steps</hi> and degrees, to make use of what is obtained,
and thence to press on to farther effects, is the true
nature of deceit. <hi>Steven</hi> tells us, that the <hi>King of
Egypt dealt subtilly</hi> or <hi>deceitfully</hi> with their <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
Acts</hi> 7. 19. How he did it we may see, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.
he did not at first fall to <hi>killing</hi> and <hi>slaying</hi> of them,
but says, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. Come, let us <hi>deal wisely;</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to oppress them. This brings forth their <hi>bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
ver.</hi> 11. Having got this ground to make
them slaves, he proceeds to <hi>destroy their children,
ver.</hi> 16. He fell not on them all at once, but by
degrees. And this may suffice to shew in general,
that sin is <hi>deceitful,</hi> and the advantages that it hath
thereby.</p>
            <p>For the Way, and Manner, and Progress of sin
in working by <hi>deceit,</hi> we have it fully expressed,
<hi>James</hi> 1. 14, 15. <hi>Every man is tempted when he is
drawn away of his own lust and enticed, then when
lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin, and sin
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42900:57"/>
when it is finished bringeth forth death.</hi> This place
declaring the whole of what we aim at in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
must be particularly insisted on.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>foregoing verse,</hi> the Apostle manifests
that men are willing to drive the <hi>old trade,</hi> which
our first Parents at the entrance of sin <hi>set up</hi> withall,
namely of excusing themselves in their sins, and
casting the occasion and blame of them on others.
It is not, say they, from themselves, their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and inclinations, their own designings, that
they have committed such and such evils, but
meerly from their temptations. And if they know
not where to fix the evil of those temptations, they
will lay them on God himself, rather than go
without an excuse or extenuation of their guilt.
This evil in the hearts of men the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh,
<hi>verse</hi> 13. <hi>Let no man say when he is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
I am tempted of God; for God cannot be
tempted of evil, neither tempteth he any man.</hi> And
to shew the justness of this reproof in the words
mentioned, he discovers the true causes of the rise
and whole progress of sin, manifesting that the whole
<hi>guilt</hi> of it lies upon the <hi>sinner,</hi> and that the whole
<hi>punishment</hi> of it, if not graciously prevented, will
be his lot also.</p>
            <p>We have therefore, as was said, in these words
the whole progress of lust or indwelling-sin, by
the way of subtilty, fraud and deceit, expressed and
limited by the Holy Ghost. And from hence we
shall manifest the particular ways and means
whereby it puts forth its power and efficacy in the
hearts of men by <hi>deceitfulness</hi> and subtilty; and
we may observe in the words,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:42900:58"/>
First, The utmost End aimed at in all the actings
of sin, or the tendency of it in its own nature, and
that is <hi>death: Sin when it is finished bringeth forth
death;</hi> the everlasting death of the sinner: pretend
what it will, this is the <hi>end</hi> it aims at and tends
unto. Hiding of ends and designs, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
property of deceit. This sin doth to the
utmost; other things innumerable it pleads, but
not once declares that it aims at the death, the
everlasting death of the soul. And a fixed appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of this <hi>end</hi> of every sin, is a blessed means
to prevent its prevalency in its way of deceit or
beguiling.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The general way of its acting towards
that end, is by <hi>Temptation; Every man is tempted
of his own lust.</hi> I purpose not to speak in general of
the nature of <hi>Temptations,</hi> it belongs not unto our
present purpose, and besides I have done it else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
It may suffice at present to observe, that
the life of temptation lies in deceit. So that in the
business of sin, to be effectually <hi>tempted,</hi> and to be
<hi>beguiled</hi> or <hi>deceived,</hi> are the same. Thus it was in
the first temptation, it is every where called the
Serpents beguiling or deceiving, as was manifested
before: <hi>The Serpent beguiled Eve,</hi> that is, prevailed
by his temptations upon her. So that every man is
<hi>tempted,</hi> that is, every man is <hi>beguiled</hi> or deceived
by his own lust, or <hi>indwelling-sin,</hi> which we have
often declared to be the same.</p>
            <p>The Degrees whereby sin proceedeth in this
work of <hi>tempting</hi> or <hi>deceiving,</hi> are <hi>five.</hi> For we
shewed before, that this belongs unto the nature
of deceit that it works by <hi>degrees,</hi> making its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by one step to gain another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:42900:58"/>
The first of these consists in drawing off, or
drawing away; <hi>Every man is tempted when he is
drawn away of his own lust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is in enticing; <hi>and is enticed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third, in the conception of sin; <hi>when lust
hath conceived,</hi> when the heart is enticed, then lust
conceives in it.</p>
            <p>The fourth is the bringing forth of sin in its
actual accomplishment, <hi>When lust hath conceived it
brings forth sin.</hi> In all which there is a secret allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to an adulterous deviation from conjugal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and conceiving or bringing forth children of
whoredom and fornication.</p>
            <p>The fifth is, the <hi>finishing of sin,</hi> the compleating of
it, the filling up of the measure of it, whereby the
end originally designed by lust is brought about:
<hi>Sin when it is finished bringeth forth death.</hi> As lust
conceiving, naturally and necessarily bringeth forth
sin, so sin finished, infallibly procureth eternal death.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these relates to the <hi>Mind;</hi> that is
drawn off, or drawn away by the deceit of sin.
The <hi>second</hi> unto the <hi>Affections,</hi> they are enticed or
intangled. The <hi>third</hi> to the <hi>Will,</hi> wherein sin is
conceived; the consent of the Will being the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
conception of actual sin. The <hi>fourth</hi> to the
<hi>Conversation,</hi> wherein sin is <hi>brought forth;</hi> it exerts
it self in the lives and courses of men. The <hi>fifth</hi>
respects an <hi>obdurate course</hi> in sinning, that finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
consummates, and shuts up the whole work of
sin, whereon ensues <hi>death</hi> or eternal ruine.</p>
            <p>I shall principally consider the <hi>three first,</hi> wherein
the main stength of the deceit of sin doth lie, and
that because in <hi>Believers,</hi> whose state and condition
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42900:59"/>
is principally proposed to consideration, God is
pleased, for the most part, graciously to prevent
the <hi>fourth instance,</hi> or <hi>the bringing forth of actual
sins</hi> in their conversations; And the last alwaies
and wholly, or their being obdurate in a course of
sin to the finishing of it. What waies God in his
grace and faithfulness makes use of to <hi>stifle the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of sin</hi> in the womb, and to hinder its actual
production in the lives of men, must afterwards be
spoken unto. The <hi>first three instances</hi> then we shall
insist upon fully, as those wherein the principal
concernment of Believers in this matter doth lie.</p>
            <p>The first thing which sin is said to do, working
in a way of deceit, is to draw away, or to draw off;
whence a man is said to be <hi>drawn off,</hi> or <hi>drawn
away</hi> and diverted, namely from <hi>attending</hi> unto
that course of obedience and holiness, which, in
opposition unto sin and the Law thereof, he is
bound with diligence to attend unto.</p>
            <p>Now it is the <hi>Mind</hi> that this effect of the <hi>deceit</hi>
of sin is wrought upon. The Mind or Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as we have shewed, is the guiding, conducting
faculty of the soul; it goes before in discerning,
judging, and determining to make the way of moral
actions fair and smooth to the Will and Affections.
It is to the soul, what <hi>Moses</hi> told his Father-in-law
that he might be to the People in the Wilderness,
as <hi>eyes to guide them,</hi> and keep them from wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that desolate place. It is the <hi>eye</hi> of the soul,
without whose guidance the Will and Affections
would perpetually wander in the Wilderness of
this world, according as any <hi>object,</hi> with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<hi>present Good,</hi> did offer or present it self
unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:42900:59"/>
The first thing therefore that sin aims at in its
<hi>deceitful working,</hi> is to draw off and divert the
mind from the discharge of its duty.</p>
            <p>There are two things which belong unto the
duty of the mind, in that <hi>special office</hi> which it hath
in and about the obedience which God requireth.</p>
            <p>First, To keep it self and the whole soul in such
a frame and posture, as may render it ready unto
all duties of obedience, and watchful against all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements
unto the conception of sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In particular carefully to attend unto
all particular actions, that they be performed <hi>as</hi>
God requireth, for matter, manner, time and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
agreeable unto his Will, as also for the obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
all particular <hi>tenders</hi> of sin in things forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
In these two things consists the whole duty of
the mind of a Believer. And from both of them
doth <hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> endeavour to divert it, and
draw it off.</p>
            <p>The first of these is, the duty of the mind, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
unto the general frame and course of the
whole soul; and hereof two things may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
First, That it is founded in a due constant
consideration; 1. Of our selves, of sin and its
vileness. 2. Of God, of his grace and goodness.
And both these doth sin labour to draw it off from.
Secondly, In attending to those <hi>Duties</hi> which are
suited to obviate the working of the Law of sin, in
an especial manner.</p>
            <p>First, It endeavours to draw it off from a due
consideration, apprehension and sensibleness of its
own <hi>vileness,</hi> and the danger wherewith it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
This in the first place we shall instance in.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42900:60"/>
A due constant consideration of sin in its nature,
in all its aggravating circumstances, in its end and
tendency, especially as represented in the Blood and
Cross of Christ ought alwaies to abide with us.
<hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Know therefore and see, that it is an evil
thing and a bitter, that thou hast for saken the Lord
thy God.</hi> Every sin is a <hi>forsaking</hi> of the Lord our
God. If the heart know not, if it consider not, that it
is an evil thing and a bitter, <hi>evil</hi> in it self, <hi>bitter</hi> in
its effects, fruit and event, it will never be secured
against it. Besides, that frame of heart which is
most accepted with God in any sinner, is the <hi>humble,</hi>
contrite, self-abasing frame: <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15. <hi>Thus saith
the high and losty one that inhabiteth eternity,
whose name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy
place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble
spirit: to revive the spirit of the humble, to revive
the spirit of the contrite ones.</hi> See also <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 13,
14. This becomes a sinner, no garment sits so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
about him. <hi>Be cloathed with humility,</hi> saith
the Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. It is that which becomes
us, and it is the only safe frame. He that walketh
humbly walketh safely. This is the design of <hi>Peters</hi>
advice, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Pass the time of your so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing
here in fear.</hi> After that he himself had mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried
by another frame of mind, he gives this
advice to all Believers; It is not a bondage, servile
fear, disquieting and perplexing the soul, but such
a fear as may keep men constantly <hi>calling upon the
Father,</hi> with reference unto the final judgement,
that they may be preserved from sin, whereof they
were in so great danger, which he advises them
unto. <hi>If ye call on the Father, who without respect of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42900:60"/>
persons judgeth according to every mans work, pass
the time of your sojourning here in fear.</hi> This is the
humble frame of soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how is this obtained?
how is this preserved? No otherwise but by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
deep apprehension of the evil, vileness, and
danger of sin. So was it wrought, so was it kept
up in the approved Publican: <hi>God be merciful,</hi>
saith he, <hi>to me a sinner:</hi> Sense of sin kept him
humble, and humility made way for his access un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a testimony of the pardon of sin.</p>
            <p>And this is the great <hi>preservative</hi> through grace
from sin, as we have an example in the instance of
<hi>Joseph, Gen.</hi> 39. 9. Upon the urgency of his great
temptation, he recoils immediately into this frame
of spirit; How, saith he, can I do this thing, <hi>and
sin against God?</hi> A constant steady sense of the evil
of sin, gives him such preservation, that he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Liberty and Life in opposition to it. To fear
sin, is to fear the Lord; so the holy man tells us
that they are the same, <hi>Job</hi> 28. 28. <hi>The fear of
the Lord that is wisdom, and to depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
that is understanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore in the first place, in general, doth
the <hi>Law of sin</hi> put forth its deceit about, namely
to draw the <hi>mind</hi> from this frame, which is the
strongest fort of the souls defence and security.
It labours to divert the mind from a due appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the vileness, abomination, and danger of
sin. It secretly and insensibly insinuates <hi>lessening,</hi>
excusing, extenuating thoughts of it; or it draws
it off from pondering upon it, from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
about it in its thoughts so much as it
ought, and formerly hath been. And if after the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42900:61"/>
heart of a man hath through the Word, Spirit
and Grace of Christ been made tender, soft, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sensible of sin, it becomes on any account, or
by any means whatever to have less, sewer,
slighter, or less affecting thoughts of it, or about
it, the mind of that man is <hi>drawn away</hi> by the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness
of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two wayes amongst others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Law of sin endeavours <hi>deceitfully</hi> to draw
off the mind from this duty, and frame ensuing
thereon.</p>
            <p>First, It doth it by an horrible <hi>abuse of Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</hi>
There is in the <hi>Gospel</hi> a remedy provided
against the whole evil of sin, the filth, the guilt of
it, with all its dangerous consequents. It is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the deliverance of the souls of men from
sin and death. A discovery of the gracious will of
God towards sinners by Jesus Christ. What now is
the genuine tendency of this doctrine, of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of grace, and what ought we to use it and
improve it unto? This the Apostle declares, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.
11, 12. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
live soberly, righteously, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
world.</hi> This it teacheth, this we ought to
learn of it, and by it. Hence <hi>Vniversal holiness</hi> is
called a <hi>conversation that becometh the Gospel,</hi> Phil.
1. 27. It becomes it as that which is answerable
unto its end, aim, and design, as that which it
requires, and which it ought to be improved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And accordingly it doth produce this effect
where the word of it is received and preserved
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42900:61"/>
in a saving light, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 20, 21, 22,
23, 24. But herein doth the <hi>deceit</hi> of sin inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it self. It separates between the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
Grace, and the use and end of it. It stayes upon
its notions, and intercepts its influences in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
application. From the Doctrine of the <hi>assured
pardon</hi> of sin, it insinuates a <hi>regardlesness</hi> of sin.
God in Christ makes the <hi>proposition,</hi> and Satan and
Sin make the <hi>conclusion.</hi> For that the <hi>deceitfulness</hi>
of <hi>sin</hi> is apt to plead unto a regardlesness of it
from the grace of God whereby it is pardoned,
the Apostle declares in his reproof and detestation
of such an insinuation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>What shall we
say then, shall we continue in sin, that grace may
abound? God forbid.</hi> Mens deceitful hearts, saith he,
are apt to make that conclusion; but far be it
from us, that we should give any entertainment
unto it. But yet that some have evidently improved
that deceit unto their own eternal ruine, <hi>Jude</hi>
declares, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Vngodly men, turning the grace of
God into lasciviousness.</hi> And we have had dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
instances of it in the daies of temptation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we have lived.</p>
            <p>Indeed in opposition unto this deceit lies much
of the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of faith, and power of Gospel-Grace.
When the mind is fully possessed with,
and cast habitually and firmly into the mould of
the notion and Doctrine of Gospel-Truth about
the full and free forgiveness of all sins in the blood
of Christ, then to be able to keep the heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
in a deep humbling sense of sin, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
of it, and self-abasement for it, is a great
effect of Gospel-Wisdom and Grace. This is the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42900:62"/>
tryal and touchstone of Gospel-<hi>Light.</hi> If it keep
the heart sensible of sin, humble, lowly, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
on that account; If it teach us to water a
free pardon with tears, to detest forgiven sin, to
watch diligently for the ruine of that, which we
are yet assured, shall never ruine us, it is <hi>Divine,</hi>
from above, of the Spirit of Grace. If it secretly
and insensibly make men loose and <hi>slight</hi> in their
thoughts about sin, it is adulterate, selfish, false.
If it will be all, answer all ends, it is nothing.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to pass, that sometimes we see
men walking in a <hi>bondage-frame of Spirit</hi> all their
daies, low in their light, mean in their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Grace, so that it is hard to discern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Covenant in their Principles they belong unto;
whether they are under the Law, or under Grace,
yet walk with a more conscientious tenderness of
sinning, than many who are advanced into higher
degrees of light and knowledge than they. Not
that the saving light of the Gospel, is not the <hi>only
Principle</hi> of saving holiness and obedience; but
that through the deceitfulness of sin it is variously
abused to counteance the soul in manifold neglect
of duties, and to draw off the <hi>mind</hi> from a due
consideration of the nature, desert and danger of
sin. And this is done several waies.</p>
            <p>First, The soul having frequent need of relief
by Gospel-Grace against a sense of the guilt of sin,
and Accusation of the Law, comes at length to
make it a <hi>common and ordinary thing,</hi> and such as
may be slightly performed. Having found a good
medicine for its wounds, and such as it hath had
experience of its efficacy, it comes to apply it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42900:62"/>
               <hi>slightly,</hi> and rather skinneth over, than cureth its
sores. A little less earnestness, a little less diligence
serves every time, until the soul it may be begins
to secure it self of <hi>pardom in course.</hi> And this tends
directly to <hi>draw off the mind</hi> from its constant and
universal watchfulness against sin. He whose light
hath made his way of access plain for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of pardon, if he be not very watchful, he is
far more apt to become overly, formal, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in his work, than he who by reason of <hi>mists</hi>
and <hi>darkness,</hi> beats about to find his way aright
to the Throne of Grace. As a Man that hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
travelled a Road passed on without regard or
enquiry; but he who is a stranger unto it observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all turnings, and enquiring of all Passengers,
secures his Journey beyond the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>deceitfulness of sin</hi> takes advantage
from the <hi>Doctrine of Grace,</hi> by many waies and
means to extend the bounds of the souls liberty
beyond what God hath assigned unto it. Some
have never thought themselves free from a legal
bondage-frame, until they have been brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>confines</hi> of sensuality, and some into the
<hi>depths</hi> of it. How often will sin plead, this strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
this exactness, this solicitude is no waies
needful; relief is provided in the Gospel against
such things. Would you live as though there
were no need of the Gospel? as though pardon
of sin were to no purpose? But concerning these
pleas of sin from Gospel-Grace, we shall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to speak more hereafter in particular.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In times of <hi>temptation</hi> this deceitfulness
of sin, will argue expresly <hi>for sin</hi> from Gospel-Grace;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42900:63"/>
at least it will plead for these two things.</p>
            <p>First, That there is not need of such a tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
severe contending against it, as the principle
of the <hi>new Creature</hi> is fixed on. If it cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the soul or mind <hi>wholly</hi> from attending unto
temptations to oppose them, yet it will endeavour
to draw them off, as to the <hi>manner</hi> of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance.
They need not use that diligence
which at first the soul apprehends to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will be tendering relief as to the
event of sin, that it shall not turn to the ruine or
destruction of the soul, because it is, it will, or
may be pardoned by the Grace of the Gospel.
And this is true, this is the great and only relief
of the soul against sin, the guilt whereof it hath
contracted already; the blessed and only remedy
for a guilty soul. But when it is pleaded and
remembred by the deceitfulness of sin in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with temptation unto sin, then it is <hi>poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
poyson is mixed in every drop of this bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
to the danger, if not death of the soul. And
this is the first way whereby the <hi>deceitfulness of sin</hi>
draws off the mind from a due attendance unto
that sense of its vileness, which alone is able to
keep it in that humble, self-abased frame that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
with God. It makes the <hi>mind</hi> careless, as
though its work were needless, because of the
abounding of Grace; which is a Souldiers neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of his station trusting to a reserve, provided
indeed only in case of keeping his own proper
place.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sin takes advantage to work by its
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42900:63"/>
deceit in this matter of <hi>drawing off the mind</hi> from
a due sense of it, from the state and condition of
men in the world. I shall give only one instance
of its procedure in this kind. Men in their youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
daies have naturally their affections more
quick, vigorous and active, more sensibly work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in them, than afterwards. They do as to
their sensible working and operation <hi>naturally</hi>
decay, and many things befall men in their lives,
that take off the edge and keenness of them. But
as men lose in their Affections, if they are not
besotted in sensuality, or by the corruptions that
are in the world through lust, they grow and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
in their Understandings, Resolutions, and
Judgements. Hence it is, that if what had place
formerly in their <hi>Affections,</hi> do not take place in
their <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>judgements,</hi> they utterly lose them,
they have no more place in their souls. Thus men
have no regard for, yea, they utterly despise those
things which their Affections were set upon with
delight and greediness in their Childhood. But
if they are things that by any means come to be
fixed in their Minds and Judgements, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
a high esteem for them, and do cleave as close
unto them, as they did when their Affections were
more vigorous. Only as it were they have changed
their seat in the soul. It is thus in things spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
the first and chiefest seat of the sensibleness of
sin, is in the <hi>Affections;</hi> as these in natural youth,
are great and large, so are they spiritually in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
youth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>I remember the kindness of thy
youth, the love of thine espousals.</hi> Besides such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are newly come off from their convictions,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42900:64"/>
wherein they have been cut to the heart, and so
made tender. Whatever touches upon a wound
is throughly felt. So doth the guilt of sin before
the wound given by conviction be throughly
cured. But now when affections begin to decay
naturally, they begin to decay also as to their
sensible actings and motions in things spiritual.
Although they improve in Grace, yet they may
decay in sense. At least spiritual sense is not <hi>radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
in them, but only by way of communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now in these decayes, if the soul take not
care to fix a deep sense of Sin on the <hi>Mind and
Judgement,</hi> thereby perpetually to affect the heart
and affections, it will decay. And here the deceit
of the Law of Sin interposeth it self. It suffers
a sense of sin to decay in the Affections, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
the mind from entertaining a due, constant
fixed consideration of it. We may consider this a
little in persons that never make a progress in the
waies of God beyond conviction. How <hi>sensible</hi>
of sin will they be for a season? How will they
then mourn and weep under a sense of the guilt of
it? How will they cordially and heartily resolve
against it? Affections are vigorous, and as it were
bear rule in their souls. But they are like an herb
that will flourish for a day or two with watering,
although it have no root. For, a while after we
see, that these men the more experience they have
had of sin, the less they are afraid of it, as the
Wise Man intimates, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 11. And at length
they come to be the greatest contemners of sin
in the world. No sinner like him that hath sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
away his convictions of sin. What is the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42900:64"/>
reason of this? sense of sin was in their convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
fixed on their Affections; as it decayed in
them, they took no care to have it deeply and
graciously fixed on their minds. This the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness
of sin deprived them of, and so ruined
their souls. In some measure it is so with Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
If as the sensibleness of the Affections decay,
if as they grow heavy and obtuse, great Wisdom
and Grace be not used to fix a due sense of sin
upon the mind and judgement, which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke,
excite, enliven and stir up the Affections
every day, great decayes will ensue. At first, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
trouble, grief, fear, affected the mind, and
would give it no rest. If afterwards the mind do
not affect the heart with sorrow and grief, the
whole will be cast out, and the soul be in danger of
being hardened. And these are some of the waies
whereby the <hi>deceit of sin</hi> diverts the mind from
the first part of its safe preserving frame, or draws
it off from its constant watchfulness against sin and
all the effects of it.</p>
            <p>The second <hi>Part</hi> of this general duty of the mind,
is to keep the soul unto a constant, holy considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God and his Grace. This evidently lies at
the Spring-head of Gospel-obedience. The way
whereby sin draws off the <hi>mind</hi> from this part of
its duty is open and known sufficiently, though
not sufficiently watched against. Now this the
Scripture every where declares to be the filling of
the minds of men <hi>with earthly things.</hi> This it
placeth in direct opposition unto that <hi>Heavenly
frame</hi> of the mind, which is the spring of Gospel-obedience,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Set your Affections on things
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42900:65"/>
above, not on things on the earth,</hi> or set your minds.
As if he had said, on both together you cannot be
set or fixed, so as principally and chiefly to mind
them both. And the Affections to the one and
the other, proceeding from these different princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>minding</hi> the one and the other, are opposed
as directly inconsistent, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Love not the
world, neither the things that are in the world, if
any man love the world, the love of the Father is not
in him.</hi> And actings in a course suitable unto
these Affections are proposed also as contrary; <hi>you
cannot serve God and Mammon.</hi> These are two
Masters whom no man can serve at the same time,
to the satisfaction of both. Every <hi>inordinate mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
then, of earthly things, is opposed unto that
frame wherein our minds ought to be fixed on
God and his Grace in a course of Gospel-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Several waies there are whereby the <hi>deceitfulness
of sin</hi> draws off the mind in this particular, but
the chief of them is by pressing these things on
the mind under the notion of things <hi>lawful,</hi> and it
may be necessary. So all those who excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the <hi>Parable,</hi> from coming in to the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Feast
of the Gospel, did it on the account of
their being engaged in their <hi>lawful</hi> Callings. One
about his <hi>Farm,</hi> another his <hi>Oxen,</hi> the means
whereby he ploughed in this world. By this plea
were the minds of men drawn off from that frame
of Heavenliness which is required to our walking
with God, and the rules of not loving the world, or
using it as if we used it not, are hereby neglected.
What wisdom, what watchfulness, what serious
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42900:65"/>
frequent trial and examination of our selves is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
to keep our hearts and minds in an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
frame, in the use and pursuit of earthly
things, is not my present business to declare. This
is evident, that the engine whereby the deceit of
sin <hi>draws off</hi> and turns aside the mind in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is the pretence of the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of things about
which it would have it exercise it self, against
which very few are armed with sufficient diligence,
wisdom and skill. And this is the first and most
general attempt that <hi>indwelling-sin</hi> makes upon the
soul by <hi>deceit:</hi> It draws away the mind from a
diligent attention unto its course in a due sense of
the evil of sin, and a due and constant consideration
of God and his Grace.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The deceit of Sin in drawing off the mind
from a due attendance unto especial Duties
of Obedience, instanced in Meditation
and Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HOw sin by its <hi>deceit</hi> endeavours to draw off
the mind from attending unto that holy
frame in walking with God, wherein the soul
ought to be preserved, hath been declared. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
we now to shew how it doth the same work
in reference unto those <hi>especial duties,</hi> by which
the designs, workings and prevalency of it may in
an especial manner be obviated and prevented
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42900:66"/>
Sin indeed maintains an enmity against all duties of
obedience, or rather with God in them. <hi>When I
would do good,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>evil is present with
me.</hi> When ever I would do good, or what good
soever I would do, that is spiritually good, good
in reference unto God, it is present with me, to
hinder me from it, to oppose me in it. And on
the other side, all duties of obedience do lie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
against the actings of the Law of sin. For as
the <hi>flesh</hi> in all its actings <hi>lusteth</hi> against the spirit, so
the <hi>spirit</hi> in all its actings <hi>lusteth</hi> against the flesh.
And therefore every duty performed in the
strength and grace of the Spirit, is contrary to the
Law of sin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>If ye by the Spirit do morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the deeds of the flesh.</hi> Actings of the Spirit of
grace in duties doth this work. These two are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
But yet there are <hi>some duties,</hi> which in their
own nature, and by Gods appointment, have a
peculiar influence into the weakening and subduing
the whole law of sin in its very principles, and
chiefest strengths. And these the mind of a <hi>Believer</hi>
ought <hi>principally</hi> in his whole course to attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And these doth sin in its deceit endeavour <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally</hi>
to draw off the <hi>mind</hi> from. As in diseases of
the body, some remedies, they say, have a specifick
quality against distempers; so in this disease of
the soul, there are some duties that have an <hi>especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
vertue</hi> against this sinful distemper. I shall not
insist on many of them, but instance only in two,
which seem to me to be of this nature; namely
that by Gods designation they have a special ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
towards the ruine of the <hi>Law of sin.</hi> And
then we shall shew the waies, methods and means
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42900:66"/>
which the <hi>Law of sin</hi> useth to divert the mind from
a due attendance unto them. Now these duties
are, first, <hi>Prayer,</hi> especially private prayer: and,
secondly, <hi>Meditation.</hi> I put them together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they much agree in their general nature and
end, differing only in the manner of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
For by <hi>Meditation,</hi> I intend meditating
upon what respect and suitableness there is between
the <hi>Word</hi> and our own <hi>hearts,</hi> to this end, that they
may be brought to a more exact conformity. It
is our pondering on the truth as it is in <hi>Jesus,</hi> to
find out the image and representation of it in our
own hearts; and so it hath the same intent with
Prayer, which is to bring our souls into a frame in
all things answering the mind and will of God.
They are as the blood and spirits in the veins, that
have the same life, motion and use. But yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
persons are generally at a great loss in this
duty of <hi>Meditation,</hi> having declared it to be of so
great efficacy, for the controlling of the actings of
the <hi>Law of sin,</hi> I shall in our passage give briefly
two or three rules for the directing of <hi>Believers</hi>
to a right performance of this great duty, and they
are these.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Meditate of God with God;</hi> that is, when
we would undertake thoughts and <hi>meditations</hi> of
God, his Excellencies, his Properties, his Glory,
his Majesty, his Love, his Goodness, let it be done
in a way of <hi>speaking unto God,</hi> in a deep humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and abasement of our souls before him. This,
will fix the mind, and draw it forth from one
thing to another, to give glory unto God in a due
manner, and affect the soul until it be brought
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42900:67"/>
into that holy admiration of God and delight in
him, which is acceptable unto him. My meaning
is, that it be done in a way of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praise,</hi>
speaking unto God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Meditate on the Word in the Word:</hi>
that is, in the reading of it, consider the sense in
the particular passages we insist upon, looking to
God for help, guidance and direction in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his mind and will therein, and then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to have our hearts affected with it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What we come short of in evenness
and constancy in our thoughts in these things, let
it be made up in frequency. Some are discouraged
because their minds do not regularly supply them
with thoughts to carry on their <hi>meditations,</hi>
through the weakness or imperfection of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.
Let this be supplied by <hi>frequent</hi> returns
of the mind unto the subject proposed to be medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
upon, whereby new senses will still be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
unto it. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>These duties, I say, amongst others (for we have
only chosen them for an instance, not excluding
some others from the same place, office and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
with them) do make an <hi>especial opposition</hi> to
the very being and life of Indwelling-sin, or rather
<hi>faith</hi> in them doth so. They are perpetually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
its utter ruine. I shall therefore upon this
<hi>instance</hi> in the pursuit of our present purpose do
these two things.</p>
            <p>First, Shew the suitableness and <hi>usefulness</hi> of this
duty, or these duties, (as I shall handle them joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
unto the ruining of sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Shew the <hi>means</hi> whereby the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42900:67"/>
of sin endeavours to <hi>draw off the mind</hi> from
a due attendance unto them.</p>
            <p>For the first observe,</p>
            <p>First, That it is the proper work of the soul in
this duty, to consider all the <hi>secret workings</hi> and
actings of sin, what advantages it hath got, what
temptations it is in conjunction withall, what
harm it hath already done, and what it is yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ready to do. Hence <hi>David</hi> gives that title unto
one of his Prayers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. <hi>A prayer of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
when he is over-whelmed, and poureth out
his complaint before the Lord.</hi> I speak of that
prayer which is attended with a due consideration
of all the wants, straits and emergencies of the soul.
Without this, Prayer is not Prayer; that is, what
ever shew or appearance of that duty it hath, it is
no way useful, either to the glory of God, or the
good of the souls of men. A cloud it is without
water, driven by the wind of the breath of men.
Nor was there ever any more present and effectual
poison for souls found out, than the binding of
them unto a constant form and usage of I know
not what words in their prayers and supplications,
which themselves do not understand. Bind men so
in their trades, or in their businesses in this world,
and they will quickly find the effect of it. By this
means are they disenabled from any due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of what a present is good for them, or evil
unto them, without which, to what use can prayer
serve, but to mock God, and delude mens own
souls? But in this kind of Prayer which we insist
on, the Spirit of God falls in to give us his assistance,
and that in this very matter of <hi>finding out</hi> and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42900:68"/>
discovering the most secret actings and workings
of the Law of sin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>We know not what
to pray for as we ought, but he helps our infirmities:</hi>
he discovers our wants unto us, and wherein chiefly
we stand in need of help and relief. And we find it
by daily experience, that in prayer, Believers are
led into such discoveries and convictions of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
deceitful work of sin in their hearts, as no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
could ever have led them into. So
<hi>David, Psal.</hi> 51. designing the confession of his
actual sin, having his wound in his prayer searched
by the skilful hand of the Spirit of God, he had a
discovery made unto him of the root of all his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
in his <hi>original corruption, vers.</hi> 5. The
Spirit in this duty is as the <hi>candle of the Lord</hi> unto
the soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enabling it to search all the inward parts of
the belly. It gives a holy spiritual light into the
mind, enabling it to search the deep and dark re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
of the heart, to find out the subtil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
machinations, figments and imaginations
of the Law of sin therein. What ever notion
there be of it, what ever power and prevalency in
it, it is laid hand on, apprehended, brought into
the presence of God, judged, condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed.
And what can possible be more effectual
for its ruine and destruction? For together with
its discovery, application is made unto all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
which in Jesus Christ is provided against it, all
ways and means whereby it may be ruined. Hence
it is the duty of the mind, <hi>to watch unto prayer,</hi>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. To attend diligently unto the estate of
our souls, and to deal fervently and effectually
with God about it. The like also may be said of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42900:68"/>
               <hi>Meditation,</hi> wisely managed unto its proper end.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In this duty there is wrought upon
the heart a deep full sense of the <hi>vileness of sin,</hi>
with a constant renewed detestation of it, which, if
any thing, undoubtedly tends to its ruine. This is
one design of prayer, one end of the soul in it,
namely to draw forth sin, to set it in order, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it unto it self in its vileness, abomination and
aggravating circumstances, that it may be loathed,
abhorred, and cast away as a filthy thing; as <hi>Isa.</hi>
30. 22. He that pleads with God for sins remission,
pleads also with his own heart for its detestation.
<hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 3. Herein also sin is <hi>judged</hi> in the Name
of God; for the soul in its confession subscribes
unto Gods detestation of it, and the sentence of
his Law against it. There is indeed a <hi>course</hi> of
these duties, which convinced persons do give up
themselves unto, as a mere covert to their lusts:
they cannot sin quietly, unless they perform duty
constantly. But that Prayer we speak of, is a thing
of another nature, a thing that will allow no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
with sin, much less will serve the ends of
the deceit of it, as the other formal prayer doth.
It will not be <hi>bribed</hi> into a secret compliance with
any of the enemies of God, or the soul, no not for a
moment. And hence it is, that oftentimes in this
duty, the heart is raised to the most sincere effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
sense of sin, and detestation of it, that the soul
ever obtains in its whole cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of obedience. And
this evidently tends also to the <hi>weakning</hi> and ruine
of the Law of sin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This is the way appointed and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

of God to obtain strength and power against
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42900:69"/>
sin. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Doth any man lack, let him ask of
God.</hi> Prayer is the way of obtaining from God by
Christ a supply of all our wants, assistance against
all opposition, especially that which is made against
us by sin. This, I suppose, need not be insisted on;
it is in the notion and practice clear to every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.
It is that wherein we <hi>call,</hi> and upon which
the Lord Jesus comes in to our <hi>succour,</hi> with suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
help in a time of need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Faith in Prayer <hi>countermines</hi> all the
workings of the deceit of sin; and that because the
soul doth therein constantly engage it self unto
God to oppose all sin whatsoever. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 106.
<hi>I have sworn, and I will perfom it, that I will keep
thy righteous judgments.</hi> This is the language of
every gracious soul in its addresses unto God: the
inmost parts thereof engage themselves to God to
cleave to him in all things, and to oppose sin in all
things. He that cannot do this, cannot pray. To
pray with any other frame, is to flatter God with
our lips, which he abhorreth. And this exceedingly
helps a Believer in <hi>pursuing sin</hi> unto its ruine.
For,</p>
            <p>First, If there be any secret lust that lies lurking
in the heart, he will find it either rising up against
this engagement, or using its <hi>artifices</hi> to secure it
self from it. And hereby it is discovered; and the
conviction of the heart concerning its evil fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
and strengthened. Sin makes the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>discovery</hi> of it self, and never more evidently
than when it is most severely pursued. Lusts in men
are compared to hurtful and <hi>noisome beasts,</hi> or
men themselves are so because of their lusts,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42900:69"/>
               <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 4, 5. Now such beasts use themselves to
their dens and coverts, and never discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
at least so much in their proper nature and
rage, as when they are most <hi>earnestly pursued.</hi> And
so it is with sin and corruption in the heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If any sin be <hi>prevalent</hi> in the soul, it
will weaken it, and take it off from the <hi>universality</hi>
of this engagement unto God, it will breed a
<hi>tergiversation</hi> unto it, a slightness in it. Now when
this is observed, it will exceedingly awaken a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
soul, and stir it up to look about it. As a
<hi>spontaneous lassitude,</hi> or a causeless weariness and
indisposition of the body, is looked on as the sign
of an approaching Feaver, or some dangerous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
which stirs up men to use a timely and
vigorous prevention, that they be not seised upon
by it; so is it in this case. When the soul of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
finds in it self an <hi>indisposition</hi> to make fervent,
sincere engagements of universal holiness unto
God, it knows that there is some prevalent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
in it, finds the place of it, and sets it self
against it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whilst the soul can thus constantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
it self unto God, it is certain that sin can rise
unto no <hi>ruinous prevalency.</hi> Yea, it is a <hi>conquest</hi>
over sin, a most considerable conquest, when the soul
doth fully and clearly, without any secret reserve,
come off with alacrity and resolution in such an
engagement; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 23. And it may upon
such a success triumph in the grace of God, and
have good hope through faith, that it shall have a
final conquest, and what it so resolves, shall be
done; that it hath decreed a thing, and it shall be
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42900:70"/>
established. And this tends to the disappointment,
yea, to the ruine of the Law of sin.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the heart be not deceived by cursed
<hi>hypocrisie,</hi> this engagement unto God will greatly
influence it unto a peculiar diligence and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against all sin. There is no greater evidence of
hypocrisie, than to have the hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> like the <hi>whorish
woman, Prov.</hi> 7. 14. to say, <hi>I have paid my vows,
now I may take my self unto my sin.</hi> Or to be
<hi>negligent</hi> about sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as being <hi>satisfied</hi> that it hath
prayed against it. It is otherwise in a gracious soul.
Sense and conscience of engagements against sin
made to God, do make it universally watchful
against all its motions and operations. On these
and sundry other accounts, doth faith in this duty
exert it self peculiary, to the weakening of the
power, and stopping of the progress of the Law of
sin.</p>
            <p>If then the mind be <hi>diligent</hi> in its watch and
charge, to preserve the soul from the efficacy of
sin, it will carefully attend unto this duty, and the
due performance of it, which is of such singular
advantage unto its end and purpose. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sin puts forth its deceit in its own defence: it
labours to divert and draw off the mind from
attending unto this and the like duties. And there
are, among others, <hi>three engines,</hi> three ways and
means, whereby it attempts the accomplishment
of its design.</p>
            <p>First, It makes advantage of its weariness unto
the flesh. There is an <hi>Aversation,</hi> as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the Law of Sin unto all immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God. Now this duty is such. There
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42900:70"/>
is nothing accompanieth it whereby the carnal part
of the soul may be gratified, or satisfied, as there
may be somewhat of that nature in most <hi>publick
duties,</hi> in most that a man can do, beyond pure
acts of faith and love. No relief or advantage
then coming in by it, but what is purely spiritual,
it becomes wearisome, burdensome to flesh and
blood. It is like travelling alone without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
or diversion, which makes the way seem
long, but brings the Passenger with most speed to
his journeys end. So our Saviour declares, when
expecting his <hi>Disciples</hi> according to their duty
and present distress should have been engaged in
this work, he found them <hi>fast asleep,</hi> Matth. 26.
41. <hi>The Spirit,</hi> saith he, <hi>indeed is willing, but
the flesh is weak:</hi> And out of that weakness grew
their indisposition unto, and weariness of their
Duty. So God complains of his People, Isa. 43.
22. <hi>Thou hast been weary of me.</hi> And it may come
at length unto that height which is mentioned,
Mal. 1. 13. <hi>Ye have said, behold what a weariness
is it, and ye have snuffed at it, saith the Lord of
Hosts.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> suppose that it was the language
of men when they brought their Offerings or
Sacrifices on their shoulders, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>wearyed</hi> them, and they panted and
blowed as men ready to faint under them, when
they brought only the torn, and the lame, and
the sick. But so is this duty oftentimes to the
flesh. And this the deceitfulness of sin makes use
of, to draw the heart by insensible degrees from a
constant attendance unto it. It puts in for the
relief of the weak and weary flesh. There is a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42900:71"/>
complyance between <hi>spiritual flesh,</hi> and <hi>natural
flesh</hi> in this matter; they help one another, and an
aversation unto this duty is the effect of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance.
So it was in the <hi>Spouse, Cant.</hi> 5. 2, 3. She
was asleep drowsing in her <hi>spiritual condition,</hi> and
pleads her <hi>natural unfitness</hi> to rouse her self from
that state. If the mind be not diligently watchful
to prevent insinuations from hence, if it dwell not
constantly on those considerations which evidence
an attendance unto this duty to be indispensible,
if it stir not up the principle of Grace in the
heart to retain its Rule and Soveraignty, and
not to be dallied withal by foolish pretences,
it will be <hi>drawn</hi> off, which is the effect
aimed at.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The deceitfulness of sin makes use of
corrupt reasonings taken from the pressing and
urging <hi>occasions of life.</hi> Should we, sayes it in the
heart, attend strictly unto all duties in this kind,
we should neglect our principal occasions, and be
<hi>useless</hi> unto our selves and others in the world.
And on this general account, particular <hi>businesses</hi>
dispossess particular <hi>duties</hi> from their due place and
time. Men have not leisure to glorifie God and
save their own souls. It is certain, that God gives
us time enough for all that he requires of us in
any kind in this world. No duties need to <hi>justle</hi>
one another, I mean constantly. Especial occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
must be determined according unto especial
circumstances. But if in any thing we take more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us than we have time well to perform it in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
robbing God of that which is due to him, and
our own souls, this God calls not unto, this he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42900:71"/>
blesseth us not in. It is more tolerable that our
duties of holiness and regard to God, should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
upon the duties of our Callings and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
in this world, than on the contrary;
and yet neither doth God require this at our
hands in an ordinary manner or course. How little
then will he bear with that which evidently is so
much worse upon all accounts whatever. But yet
through the deceitfulness of sin, thus are the souls
of men beguiled. By several degrees they are at
length driven from their duty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It deals with the mind to draw it off
from its attendance unto this duty by a tender of
a <hi>compensation</hi> to be made in and by other duties.
As <hi>Saul</hi> thought to compensate his disobedience
by Sacrifice. <hi>May not the same duty performed in
publick, or in the Family suffice?</hi> And if the soul be
so foolish as not to answer, <hi>those things ought to be
done, and this not to be left undone,</hi> it may be
ensnared and deceived. For besides a command
unto it, namely that we should personally watch
unto prayer, there is as hath been declared sundry
advantages in this duty so performed against the
deceit and efficacy of sin, which in the more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
attendance unto it, it hath not. These sin
strives to deprive the soul of by this commutation
which by its corrupt reasonings it tenders unto it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I may add here that which hath place
in all the workings of sin by <hi>deceit,</hi> namely, its
feeding the soul with <hi>promises</hi> and purposes of a
more diligent attendance unto this duty when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
will permit. By this means it brings the
soul to say unto its convictions of duty, as <hi>Felix</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:42900:72"/>
did to <hi>Paul, Go thy way for this time, when I have
a convenient season, I will call for thee.</hi> And by this
means oftentimes the present season and time,
which alone is ours, is lost irrecoverably.</p>
            <p>These are some of the wayes and means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>deceit of sin</hi> endeavours to <hi>draw off the mind</hi>
from its due attendance unto this duty, which is
so peculiarly suited to prevent its progress and
prevalency, and which aims so directly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
at its ruine. I might instance also in other
duties of the like tendency. But this may suffice
to discover the nature of this part of the deceit of
sin. And this is the first way whereby it makes way
for the farther entangling of the <hi>Affections</hi> and
the conception of sin. When sin hath wrought this
effect on any one, he is said to be <hi>drawn away,</hi> to
be diverted from what in his mind he ought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
to attend unto, in his walking before the
Lord.</p>
            <p>And this will instruct us to see and discern
where lyes the beginning of our declensions and
failings in the wayes of God, and that either as to
our general course, or as to our attendance unto
especial duties. And this is of great importance
and concernment unto us. When the beginnings
and occasions of a <hi>sickness</hi> or distemper of body are
known, it is a great advantage to direct in and
unto the cure of it. God to recall <hi>Sion</hi> to himself
shews her where was the <hi>beginning</hi> of her <hi>sin,
Micah</hi> 1. 13. Now this is that which for the most
part is the <hi>beginning of sin</hi> unto us, even the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off the mind from a due attendance in all
things unto the discharge of its duty. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42900:72"/>
care and charge of the soul lyes on the
mind; and if that fail of its duty, the whole is
betrayed, either as unto its general frame, or as
unto particular miscarriages. The failing of the
mind, is like the failing of the <hi>Watch-man</hi> in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi>
the whole is lost by his neglect. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in that <hi>self-scrutiny</hi> and search which we are
called unto, we are most diligently to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
God doth not look at what duties we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
as to their number and tale, or as to their
nature meerly, but whether we do them with
that intention of mind and Spirit which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.
Many men perform duties in a <hi>road</hi> or
course, and do not as it were, so much as think of
them. Their minds are filled with other things,
only duty takes up so much of their time. This
is but an endeavour to mock God, and deceive
their own souls. Would you therefore take the
true measure of your selves: consider how it is
with you as to the duty of your minds which we
have enquired after. Consider whether by any of
the deceits mentioned, you have not been <hi>diverted
and drawn away;</hi> and if there be any decayes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you in any kind, you will find that there hath
been the beginning of them. By one way or other
your <hi>minds</hi> have been made heedless, regardless,
slothful, uncertain, being beguiled and drawn off
from their duty. Consider the charge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23,
25, 26, 27. May not such a soul say, if I had
attended more diligently, if I had considered more
wisely the vile nature of sin, if I had not suffered my
mind to be possessed with vain hopes and foolish
imaginations, by a cursed abuse of Gospel-Grace,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42900:73"/>
If I had not permitted it to be filled with the things
of the world, and to become negligent in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto especial duties, I had not at this day been
thus sick, weak, thriftless, wounded, decayed,
defiled. My careless, my deceived mind, hath been
the <hi>beginning of sin</hi> and transgression unto my soul.
And this discovery will direct the soul unto a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
way for its healing and recovery, which will
never be effected by a multiplying of particular
duties, but by a restoring of the mind, <hi>Psal.</hi>
23. 3.</p>
            <p>And this also doth hence appear to be the great
means of preserving our souls, both as unto their
general frame and particular duties according to
the mind and will of God; namely to endeavour
after a sound and stedfast mind. It is a signal
Grace to have the Spirit of power and love, and
of a sound mind, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. A stable, solid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
mind in the things of God, not easily moved,
diverted, changed, not drawn aside, a mind not
apt to hearken after corrupt reasonings, vain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations,
or pretences to draw it off from its duty.
This is that which the Apostle exhorts Believers
unto, 1 Cor. 15. 38. <hi>Therefore my beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
be stedfast, unmoveable, alwayes abounding in
the work of the Lord.</hi> The <hi>stedfastness</hi> of our minds
abiding in their duty, is the cause of all our <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveableness,</hi>
and fruitfulness in obedience. And so
<hi>Peter</hi> tells us that those who are by any means led
away, or <hi>enticed, they fall from their own stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. And the great blame that is laid
upon Backsliders is, that they are <hi>not stedfast, Psal.</hi>
78. 37. <hi>Their Spirit was not stedfast.</hi> For if the soul
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42900:73"/>
be safe, unless the mind be drawn off from its duty,
the soundness and stedfastness of the mind is its
great preservative. And there are three parts of
this stedfastness of the mind. First, A full purpose of
cleaving to God in all things. Secondly, A daily
renovation and quickning of the heart unto a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of this purpose. Thirdly, Resolutions against
all dalliances or parlies about negligencies in that
discharge; which are not here to be spoken unto.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The Deceit of Sin in drawing off the Mind
from its Attendance unto particular Duties
farther discovered. Several things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Mind of Believers with respect
unto particular Duties of Obedience. The
Actings of Sin in a way of Deceit, to divert
the mind from them.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE have not as yet brought unto an Issue
the <hi>First way</hi> of the working of the deceit
of sin, namely, in its <hi>drawing away of the mind</hi>
from the discharge of its duty, which we insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the longer upon a double account.</p>
            <p>First, Because of its importance and concernment.
If the mind be drawn off, if it be tainted, weakned,
turned aside from a due and strict attendance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its charge and Office, the whole Soul, Will,
and Affections, are certainly entangled and drawn
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42900:74"/>
into sin, as hath been in part declared, and will
afterwards farther appear. This we ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to give diligent heed unto, which is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Apostles Exhortation, Heb. 2. 1. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought to give the more earnest heed to the
things which we have heard, lost at any time we
should let them slip.</hi> It is a failure of our minds, by
the deceitfulness of sin, in losing the life, power,
sense and impression of the <hi>Word</hi> which he cautions
us against. And there is no way to prevent it but by
giving of most <hi>earnest heed</hi> unto the things which
we have heard, which expresseth the whole duty
of our minds in attending unto obedience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because the actings and workings of
the <hi>mind</hi> being spiritual, are such as the <hi>conscience</hi>
unless clearly enlightened, and duly excited and
stirred up, is not affected withal, so as to take
due notice of them. Conscience is not apt to
exercise reflex acts upon the minds failures, as
principally respecting the acts of the whole soul.
When the <hi>Affections</hi> are entangled with sin (of
which afterwards) or the Will begins to conceive
it by its express consent, <hi>Conscience</hi> is apt to
make an uproar in the soul, and to give it no rest
or quiet until the soul be reclaimed, or it self be
one way or other bribed or debauched. But these
neglects of the mind being <hi>spiritual,</hi> without very
diligent attendance, they are seldom taken notice
of. Our <hi>minds</hi> are often in the Scriptures, called
our <hi>Spirits,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Whom I serve in my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
and are distinguished from the <hi>soul,</hi> which
principally intends the Affections, in that distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 23. Sanctifie you wholly, <hi>your
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42900:74"/>
whole spirit and soul,</hi> that is, your mind and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
It is true where the <hi>Spirit</hi> is used to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<hi>spiritual</hi> gifts, it is as unto those gifts opposed
to our <hi>understandings,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 14. 15. Which is
there taken for the first act of the mind in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
perception of things. But as that word is
applyed unto any faculty of our souls, it is the
<hi>mind</hi> that it expresseth. This then being <hi>our Spirit,</hi>
the actings of it are secret and hidden, and not to
be discovered without spiritual wisdom and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
Let us not suppose then that we dwell
too long on this consideration, which is of so great
importance to us, and yet so hidden, and which
we are apt to be very insensible of; and yet our
carefulness in this matter is one of the best evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
that we have of our sincerity. Let us not
then be like a man that is sensible, and complains
of a cut finger, but not of a decay of Spirits tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto death. There remains therefore as unto
this head of our discourse, the consideration of
the charge of the mind in reference unto particular
duties and sins. And in the consideration of it, we
shall do these two things.</p>
            <p>First, Shew what is required in the <hi>mind of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi>
in reference unto particular duties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Declare the way of the working of the
deceit of sin to <hi>draw</hi> it off from its attendance
thereunto. The like also shall be done with respect
unto particular sins, and their avoidance.</p>
            <p>First, For the right performance of any Duty, it
is not enough that the thing it self required be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
but that it be universally squared and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto the rule of it. Herein lyes the great <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the <hi>mind,</hi> namely, to attend unto the <hi>Rule</hi> of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42900:75"/>
duties, and to take care that all the concernments
of them be ordered thereby. Our progress in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
is our <hi>edification</hi> or building. Now it is
but a very little fartherance unto a <hi>building,</hi> that
a man bring wood and stones and heap them up
together without order. They must be hewed and
squared, and fitted by line and rule, if we intend
to build. Nor is it unto any advantage unto our
<hi>edification</hi> in faith and obedience, that we multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
duties, if we heap them upon one another, if
we order and dispose them not according to rule.
And therefore doth God expresly reject a <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of duties</hi> when not universally suited unto
the Rule, Isa. 1. 11. <hi>To what purpose is the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of your Sacrifices;</hi> and v. 14. <hi>They are a
trouble unto me, I am weary to bear them.</hi> And
therefore all acceptable obedience is called a
proceeding according unto rule, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. it is
a <hi>Canonical,</hi> or regular obedience. As <hi>letters in
the Alphabet</hi> heaped together signifie nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they are disposed into their proper order; no
more do our duties without this disposal. That they
be so, is the great duty of the mind, and which with
all diligence it is to attend unto, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 15.
<hi>Walk circumspectly,</hi> exactly, accurately, that is,
diligently in all things, take heed to the Rule of
what you do. We <hi>Walk</hi> in duties, but we walk
<hi>circumspectly</hi> in this attention of the mind.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are some special things which
the Rule directs unto, that the mind is to attend in
every duty; as,</p>
            <p>First, That as to the <hi>matter</hi> of it, it be full and
compleat. Under the Law, no Beast was allowed
to be a Sacrifice that had any member wanting,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42900:75"/>
any defect of parts. Such were rejected as well as
those that were <hi>lame</hi> or <hi>blind.</hi> Duties must be
compleat as to the parts, the matter of them. There
may be such a part of the price kept back, as may
make the tendering of all the residue unacceptable,
<hi>Saul</hi> sparing <hi>Agag</hi> and the fattest of the Cattle,
rendered the destroying of all the rest useless. Thus
when men will <hi>give alms,</hi> or perform other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
but not unto the proportion that the Rule
requireth, and which the mind by diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
unto it might discover, the whole duty is
vitiated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As to the <hi>Principle</hi> of it, namely, that
it be done in faith, and therein by an actual deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of strength from Christ, (<hi>John</hi> 15. 5.)
without whom <hi>we can do nothing.</hi> It is not enough
that the Person be a <hi>Believer,</hi> though that be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
unto every good work, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 10. But
also that faith be peculiarly acted in every duty
that we do. For our whole obedience is the <hi>obedience
of faith, Rom.</hi> 1. 5. that is, which the Doctrine of
faith requireth, and which the grace of faith beareth
or bringeth forth. So Christ is expresly said to be
<hi>our life, Col.</hi> 3. 4. Our spiritual life, that is the
Spring, Author, and Cause of it. Now as in life
natural, no vital act can be performed, but by the
actual operation of the principle of life it self; So
in life spiritual, no spiritually vital act, that is, no
duty acceptable to God, can be performed but by
the actual working of Christ, who is our life.
And this is no other way derived unto us but
by faith. Whence saith the Apostle, Gal. 2. 20.
<hi>Christ liveth in me, and the life which I now lead
in the flesh, is by the faith of the Son of God.</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:42900:76"/>
Not only was Christ his life, a living principle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, but he <hi>led a life,</hi> that is, discharged vital
actions in all duties of holiness and obedience, by
the faith of the Son of God, or in him; deriving
supplies of Grace and strength from him thereby.
This therefore ought a Believer diligently to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto, namely, that every thing he doth to
God, be done in the strength of Christ; which
wherein it consisteth ought diligently to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into by all who intend to walk with God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In this respect unto Rule, the <hi>manner</hi>
of the performance of every duty is to be regarded.
Now there are two things in the manner of the
performance of any duty which a Believer, who is
trusted with spiritual light, ought to attend unto.</p>
            <p>First, that it be done <hi>in the way,</hi> and by the
means that God hath prescribed with respect unto
the ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ward manner of its performance. And this
is especially to be regarded in duties of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God; the matter and outward manner
whereof do both equally fall under his command.
If this be not regarded, the whole duty is vitiated.
I speak not of them who suffer themselves to be
deluded by the <hi>deceitfulness of sin,</hi> utterly to disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the rule of the word in such things, and to
worship God according to their own imaginations;
but of them principally, who although they in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
prosess to do nothing but <hi>what</hi> God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and <hi>as</hi> he requires it, yet do not diligently
attend to the Rule, to make the Authority of God
to be the sole cause and reason both of what they
do, and of the <hi>manner</hi> of the performance of it.
And this is the reason that God so often calls on
his People to <hi>consider diligently</hi> and wisely, that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42900:76"/>
they may do all according as he had commanded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Affections of the heart and mind
in duties belong to the performance of them in the
inward manner. The prescriptions and commands
of God for attendance hereunto are innumerable,
and the want hereof renders every duty an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
unto him. A <hi>Sacrifice</hi> without an heart,
without salt, without fire, of what value is it? No
more are duties without spiritual Affections. And
herein is the mind to keep the charge of God; to
see that the heart which he requires be tendered
to him. And we find also that God requireth
especial Affections to accompany special duties. <hi>He
that gives with chearfulness;</hi> which if they are not
attended unto, the whole is lost.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The mind is to attend unto the <hi>Ends</hi>
of duties; and therein principally the glory of God
in Christ. Several other <hi>ends</hi> will sin and self
impose upon our duties: Especially two it will press
hard upon us with: First, <hi>Satisfaction of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions</hi>
and consciences. Secondly, <hi>The praise of
men.</hi> For self-righteousness and ostentation are
the main ends of Men that are fallen off from God
in all moral duties whatsoever. In their sins they
endeavour for to satisfie their lusts, in their duties,
their conviction, and pride. These the mind of
a Believer is diligently to watch against, and to
keep up in all a single eye to the glory of God, as
that which answers the great and general rule of
all our obedience; <hi>Whatever you do, do it all to the
glory of God.</hi> These and the like things, I say,
which are commonly spoken unto, is the mind of a
Believer obliged to attend diligently and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42900:77"/>
unto, with respect unto all the particular duties
of our walking before God. Here then lyes no
small part of the deceit of sin. Namely, to <hi>draw
the mind off</hi> from this watch, to bring an inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
upon it, that it shall not in these things keep
the watch and charge of the Lord. And if it can do
so, and thereby strip our duties of all their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
which lye in these concernments of them,
that the mind is to attend unto it will not much
trouble it self nor us about the duties themselves.
And this it attempts several wayes.</p>
            <p>First, By perswading the <hi>mind</hi> to content it self
with <hi>generals,</hi> and to take it off from attending
unto things in particular instances. For example;
it would perswade the soul to rest satisfied in a
<hi>general aim</hi> of doing things to the glory of God,
without considering how every particular duty
may have that tendency. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> thought that
he had fulfilled his whole duty, and done the will
of God, and sought his Glory in his war against
<hi>Amalek,</hi> when for want of attendance to every
particular duty in that service, he had dishonoured
God, and ruined himself and his Posterity. And
men may perswade themselves, that they have a
general design for the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> when they have
no active principle in particular duties tending at
all that way. But if, instead of fixing the mind
by faith on the peculiar advancing the glory of
God in a duty, the soul content it self with a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
notion</hi> of doing so, the mind is already diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and draw off from its charge by the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sin. If a man be travelling in a journey,
it is not only required of him, that he bend
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42900:77"/>
his course that way, and so go on, but if he attend
not unto every turning, and other occurrences in
his way, he may wander and never come to his
journeys end. And if we suppose that in <hi>general</hi>
we aim at the Glory of God, as we all prosess to
do, yet if we attend not unto it distinctly upon
every duty that occurs in our way, we shall never
attain the <hi>end</hi> aimed at. And he who satisfies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with this <hi>general</hi> purpose, without acting it in
every <hi>special</hi> duty, will not long retain that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
neither. It doth the same work upon the mind
in reference unto the <hi>principle</hi> of our duties, as it
doth unto the end. Their <hi>principle</hi> is, that they be
done in faith, in the strength of Christ; but if men
content themselves that they are <hi>Believers,</hi> that
they have faith, and do not labour in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
duty to act faith, to lead their spiritual lives
in all the acts of them <hi>by the faith of the Son of
God,</hi> the mind is drawn off from its duty. It is
particular actions wherein we express and exercise
our faith and obedience; and what we are in them,
that we are, and no more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It draws off the <hi>mind</hi> from the duties
before mentioned, by insinuating a secret <hi>content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
unto it from the duty it self performed, as to
the matter of it. This is a fair discharge of a natural
conscience. If the duty be performed, though as to
the <hi>manner</hi> of its performance it come short almost
in all things of the rule, conscience and conviction
will be satisfied. As <hi>Saul,</hi> upon his expedition
against <hi>Amalek,</hi> cries to <hi>Samuel, Come in, thou
blessed of the Lord, I have done the commandment
of the Lord.</hi> He satisfied himself, though he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42900:78"/>
had not attended as he ought to the whole will of
God in that matter. And thus was it with them,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 3. <hi>wherefore have we fasted,</hi> say they, <hi>and
thou regardest it not;</hi> they had pleased themselves
in the performance of their duties, and expected
that God also should be pleased with them. But
he shews them at large wherein they had failed, and
that so far as to render what they had done an
abomination. And the like charge he expresseth
against them, <hi>chap.</hi> 48. 1, 2. This the deceitfulness
of sin endeavours to draw the mind unto, namely
to take up in the performance of the duty it self.
Pray thou oughtest, and thou hast prayed, give
alms thou oughtest, and thou hast given alms; quiet
then thy self in what thou hast done, and go on to
do the like. If it prevail herein, the <hi>mind</hi> is dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from farther attendance and watching unto
duty, which leaves the soul on the borders of many
evils. For,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hence <hi>customariness</hi> in all duties will
quickly ensue, which is the height of sins draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off the mind from duty. For mens minds may
be drawn from all duties, in the midst of the most
abundant performance of them. For in and under
them, the mind may be subject unto an <hi>habitual</hi>
diversion from its charge and watch unto the rule.
What is done with such a frame, is not done to
God, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 25. None of their Sacrifices were to
God, although they professed that they were all
so. But they attended not unto his Worship in
faith, and unto his glory, and he despised all their
duties. See also <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 1. And this is the great
reason why <hi>Professors</hi> thrive so little under the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42900:78"/>
performance of a multitude of duties. They attend
not unto them in a <hi>due manner,</hi> their minds being
drawn off from their circumspect watch, and so
they have little or no communion with God in
them, which is the end whereunto they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
and by which alone they become useful and
profitable unto themselves. And in this manner are
many duties of worship and obedience performed
by a woful generation of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> Formalists,
and profane persons, without either life or light
in themselves, or acceptation with God; their
minds being wholly estranged from a due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
unto what they do, by the power and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As it is in respect of duties, so also it is
in respect of <hi>sins.</hi> There are sundry things in and
about <hi>every sin</hi> that the mind of a <hi>Believer,</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of its <hi>office</hi> and duty is obliged to attend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
unto, for the preservation of the soul from
it. Things they are which God hath appointed and
sanctified, to give effectual rebukes and checks to
the whole working of the Law of sin, and such as
in the Law of grace, under which we are, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
suited and fitted unto that purpose. And
these the <hi>deceit of sin</hi> endeavours by all means to
draw off the mind from a due consideration of, and
attendance unto. Some few of them we shall a little
reflect upon.</p>
            <p>First, The first and most general is the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi>
of God, the great Law-giver, by whom it
is forbidden. This <hi>Joseph</hi> fixed on in his great
temptation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9. <hi>How can I do this great
wickedness and sin against God?</hi> There was in it a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42900:79"/>
great evil, a great ingratitude against man, which
he pleads also and insists upon, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. but that
which fixed his heart and resolution against it, was
the <hi>formality</hi> of it, that it was <hi>sin against God,</hi> by
whom it was severely forbidden. So the Apostle
informs us, that in our dealing in any thing that is
against the Law, our respect is still to be unto the
<hi>Law-giver</hi> and his Sovereignty: <hi>James</hi> 4. 11, 12.
<hi>If thou judge the Law, thou art not a doer of the
Law, but a judge; there is one Law-giver who is
able to save and to destroy.</hi> Consider this always,
there is one <hi>Law-giver,</hi> holy, righteous, armed
with Sovereign Power and Authority; he is able to
save and destroy. Hence sin is called a <hi>rebellion,</hi>
a casting off his yoke, a despising of him, and that
in his Sovereignty, as the great Law-giver; and
this ought the mind always practically to attend
unto, in all the lustings, actings and suggestions of
the Law of sin, especially when advantaged by any
suitable or vigorous temptation. It is <hi>God that hath
forbidden this thing,</hi> the great Law-giver, under
whose absolute Sovereignty I am, in dependance
on whon I live, and by whom I am to be disposed
of, as to my present and eternal condition. This
<hi>Eve</hi> fixed on at the beginning of her temptation,
<hi>God hath said, we must not eat of this tree, Gen.</hi>
3. 3. but she kept not her ground, she abode not
by that consideration, but suffered her mind to be
diverted from it by the subtilty of <hi>Sathan,</hi> which
was the entrance of her transgression; and so it is
unto us all in our deviations from obedience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>deceit of sin,</hi> of every sin, the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi>
appointed unto it in the Law, is another
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42900:79"/>
thing that the mind ought actually to attend unto,
in reference unto every particular evil. And the
diversions from this, that the minds of men have
been doctrinally and practically attended withall,
have been an inlet into all manner of abominations.
<hi>Job</hi> professeth another frame in himself, <hi>chap.</hi> 31.
23. <hi>Destruction from God was a terrour unto me, and
by reason of his highness I could not endure.</hi> Many
evils he had mentioned in the fore-going verses, and
pleads his innocency from them, although they
were such as upon the account of his <hi>Greatness</hi> and
Power, he could have committed easily without
fear of danger from men. Here he gives the reason
that prevailed with him so carefully to abstain from
them, <hi>Destruction from God was a terrour to me,
and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</hi> I
considered, saith he, that God had appointed death
and destruction for the <hi>punishment</hi> of sin, and that
such was his greatness, highness, and power, that
he could inflict it unto the uttermost, in such a way
as no creature is able to abide or to avoid. So the
Apostle directs Believers always to consider what
a <hi>fearful thing it is to fall into the hands of the
living God, Heb.</hi> 10. 31. And that because he
hath said, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will recompence,
ver.</hi> 30. He is a <hi>sin-avenging God,</hi> that will by no
means acquit the guilty; as in the declaration of his
gracious Name, infinitely full of encouragements
to poor sinners in Christ, he addes that in the
close, that he will by no means clear the guilty,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 7. That he may keep upon the minds
of them whom he pardoneth, a due sense of the
punishment that is due from his <hi>vindictive
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42900:80"/>
Justice</hi> unto every sin. And so the Apostle would
have us mind, that even our <hi>God is a consuming
fire, Heb.</hi> 12. 29. that is, that we should consider
his holiness and vindictive Justice, appointing unto
sin a meet recompence of reward. And mens
breaking through this consideration, he reckons
as the height of the aggravation of their sins, <hi>Rom.</hi>
1. 32. <hi>They know that it is the judgment of God,
that they which commit such things were worthy of
death, yet continued to do them:</hi> What hope is there
for such persons? There is indeed relief against this
consideration for humbled believing souls in the
blood of Christ; but this relief is not to <hi>take off the
mind</hi> from it, as it is appointed of God to be a
restraint from sin. And both these considerations,
even the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God, and the <hi>punishment of
sin,</hi> are put together by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.
28. <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not
able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is
able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The consideration of all the <hi>love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of God, against whom every sin is committed,
is another thing that the mind ought diligently to
attend unto. And this is a prevailing consideration,
if rightly and graciously managed in the soul. This
<hi>Moses</hi> presseth on the people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 6. <hi>Do you
thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? Is
not he thy Father that bought thee? Hath he not made
thee, and established thee?</hi> Is this a requital for <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Love,</hi> and all the fruits of it? for the love and
care of a Father, of a Redeemer, that we have been
made partakers of? And it is the same considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which the <hi>Apostle</hi> manageth to this purpose,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42900:80"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Having therefore these promises, dearly
beloved, let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness
of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear
of God.</hi> The receiving of the promises ought to be
effectual, as to stir us up unto all holiness, so to work
and effect an abstinence from all sin. And what
Promises are these? namely that God will <hi>be a
Father unto us, and receive us, chap.</hi> 6. 17, 18.
which compriseth the whole of all the love of God
towards us here, and to eternity. If there be any
spiritual ingenuity in the soul, whilst the mind is
attentive to this consideration, there can be no
prevailing attempt made upon it by the power of
sin. Now there are two parts of this consideration.</p>
            <p>First, That which is general in it, that which is
common unto all believers. This is managed unto
this purpose, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Behold what manner of
love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should
be called the sons of God; therefore the world
knoweth us not because it knew him not. Beloved, now
are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear
what we shall be; but we know that when he shall
appear, we shall be like him for we shall see him as he
is. And every man that hath this hope, purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
even as he is pure.</hi> Consider, saith he, the love of
God, and the previledges that we enjoy by it: <hi>Behold
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon
us, that we should be called the sons of God. Adoption</hi>
is an especial fruit of it, and how great a priviledge
is this? Such love it is, and such are the fruits of it,
that the world knoweth nothing of the blessed
condition which we obtain and enjoy thereby: <hi>The
world knoweth us not.</hi> Nay, it is such love, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42900:81"/>
so unspeakably blessed and glorious are the effects
of it, that we our selves are not able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them. What use then ought we to make of
this contemplation of the excellent unspeakable love
of God? Why saith he, <hi>Every one that hath this
hope purifieth himself.</hi> Every man who being made
partaker of this Love, and thereupon an <hi>hope</hi> of the
full enjoyment of the fruits of it, of being made
like to God in glory, <hi>purifieth himself,</hi> that is, in
an abstinence from all and every sin, as in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words is at large declared.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is to be considered as to such <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
mercies</hi> and fruits of love, as every <hi>ones soul</hi>
hath been made partaker of. There is no <hi>Believer,</hi>
but besides the love and mercy which he hath
in common with all his brethren, he hath also in
the lot of his inheritance, some <hi>inclosures,</hi> some
especial mercies wherein he hath a single propriety.
He hath some <hi>Joy</hi> which no stranger intermedleth
withall, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 10. Particular applications of
covenant love and mercy to his soul. Now these
are all provisions laid in by God, that they may be
born in mind against an hour of temptation, that
the consideration of them may preserve the soul
from the attempts of sin. Their neglect is an high
aggravation of our provocations. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 9.
It is charged as the great evil of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he
had sinned against special mercies, especial intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of love; he sinned after God had appeared
to him twice. God required that he should have
born in mind that <hi>especial favour,</hi> and have made
it an argument against sin. But he neglected<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
and is burdened with this sore rebuke. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42900:81"/>
all especiall mercies, all especial tokens and
pledges of love, are utterly lost and mispent upon
us, if they are not improved unto this end. This
then is another thing, that it is the duty of the mind
greatly to attend unto, and to oppose effectually
unto every attempt that is made on the soul by the
Law of sin.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The considerations that arise from the
blood and mediation of Christ, are of the same
importance. So the <hi>Apostle</hi> declares, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14,
15. <hi>For the love of Christ constraineth us, because
we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were
all dead; and that he died for all, that they which
live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but
unto him which died for them, and rose again.</hi>
There is a constraining efficacy in this consideration,
it is great, forcible, effectual, if duly attented unto.
But I must not here in particular insist upon these
things. Nor,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Shall I speak of the <hi>inhabitation of the
Spirit,</hi> the greatest priviledge that we are made
partakers of in this world. The due consideration
how he is grieved by sin, how his <hi>dwelling place</hi> is
defiled thereby, how his comforts are forfeited,
lost, despised by it, might also be insisted on. But
the instances passed through are sufficient unto our
purpose. Now herein lies the duty of the <hi>mina,</hi> in
reference unto particular sins and temptations. It
is diligently and carefully to attend unto those
things, to dwell constantly upon the consideration
of them, to have them in a continual readiness to
oppose unto all the lustings, actings, warrings, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
and rage of sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:42900:82"/>
In reference hereunto doth <hi>sin</hi> in an especial
manner put forth and act its <hi>deceit.</hi> It labours by all
means to draw off the mind from its <hi>due attendance</hi>
unto these things; to deprive the soul of this great
preservative and antidote against its poison. It
endeavours to cause the soul to satisfie it self with
general <hi>undigested notions about sin,</hi> that it may
have nothing in particular to betake it self unto in
its own defence, against its attempts and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And the wayes whereby it doth this may be
also briefly considered.</p>
            <p>First, It is from the deceit of sin that the mind is
<hi>spiritually slothful,</hi> whereby it becomes negligent
unto this duty. The principal discharge of its trust
in this matter is expressed by <hi>watching,</hi> which is
the great Caution that the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> gave unto his
Disciples in reference unto all their dangers from
sin and Satan, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 37. <hi>I say unto all watch.</hi>
That is, use your utmost diligence and circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that you be not surprised and entangled with
temptations. It is called also <hi>consideration; Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your wayes; consider your latter end;</hi> the want
whereof God complains of in his People, <hi>Dent.</hi>
32. 29. Now that which is contrary to these indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible
conditions of our preservation, is <hi>spiritual
slothfulness,</hi> as the Apostle declares, Heb. 6. 11,
12. <hi>And we desire that every one of you, do shew
the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto
the end, that you be not slothful.</hi> If we shew not
diligence, we are slothful, and in danger of coming
short to inherit the promises; See 2 Pet. 1. 5, 9.
<hi>And besides this giving all diligence, add to your
faith vertue, to vertue, knowledge</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For if these
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42900:82"/>
things be in you and abound, that they make you that
you shall neither be barren, nor unfruitful in the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus. But he that lacketh
these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and
hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins;
wherefore the rather Brethren, give diligence to
make your calling and election sure; for if you do
these things you shall never fall; For so an entrance
shall be administred unto you abundantly into the
everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ,</hi> ver. 9, 10. All this the mind is turned from,
if once by the deceit of sin it be made <hi>slothful.</hi> Now
this sloth consists in three things.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Inadvertency;</hi> it doth not set it self to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and attend unto its special concernments.
The Apostle perswading the <hi>Hebrews</hi> with all
earnestness to <hi>attend diligently,</hi> to consider care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
that they may not be hardened by the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of sin, gives this reason of their danger,
that <hi>they were dull of hearing,</hi> Chap. 5. 11. That
is, that they were <hi>slothful,</hi> and did not attend unto
the things of their duty. A secret <hi>regardlesness</hi> is
apt to creep upon the soul, and it doth not set it
self to a diligent marking how things go with it,
and what is continually incumbent on it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, An <hi>unwillingness to be stirred up unto its
duty,</hi> Prov. 19. 24. <hi>The slothful man hideth his hand
in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his
mouth again.</hi> There is an unwillingness in <hi>sloth</hi>
to take any notice of warnings, calls, excitations,
or stirrings up by the Word, Spirit, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
any thing that God maketh use of, to
call the mind unto a due consideration of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42900:83"/>
condition of the soul. And this is a perfect evidence
that the mind is made <hi>slothful</hi> by the deceit of sin,
when especial calls and warnings, whether in a
suitable word, or a pressing judgement, cannot
prevail with it to pull its hand out of its bosome,
that is, to set about the special duties that it is
called unto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Weak and ineffectual attempts</hi> to recover
its self unto its duty, Prov. 26. 14. <hi>As the door
turneth it self upon its hinges, so doth the slothful
man upon his hed.</hi> In the turning of a door upon its
hinges, there is some motion, but no progress. It
removes up and down, but is still in the place and
posture that it was. So is it with the spiritually
<hi>slothful man</hi> on his bed, or in his security. He
makes some motions or faint endeavours towards
a discharge of his duty, but goes not on. There
where he was one day, there he is the next; yea,
there where he was one year, he is the next. His
endeavours are faint, cold, and evanid; he gets no
ground by them, but is alwayes beginning and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
finishing his work.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Heartlesness upon the apprehensions of
difficulties</hi> and discouragements, Prov. 22. 13. <hi>The
slothful man saith there is a Lyon in the way, I shall
be slain in the Streets.</hi> Every difficulty deters him
from duty. He thinks it impossible for him to
attain to that accuracy, exactness, and perfection
which he is in this matter to press after; &amp; therefore
contents himself in his old coldness, negligence,
rather than to run the hazard of an universal cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection.
Now if the deceit of sin hath once
<hi>drawn away the mind</hi> into this frame, it layes it
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42900:83"/>
open to every temptation and incursion of sin. The
<hi>Spouse in the Canticles</hi> seems to have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
with this distemper, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. And
this puts her on various <hi>excuses</hi> why she cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto the call of Christ, and apply her self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her duty in walking with him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It draws away the mind from its
watch and duty in reference unto sin by <hi>surprisals.</hi>
It falls in conjunction with some urging tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and <hi>surprizeth the mind</hi> into thoughts quite
of another Nature than those which it ought to
insist upon in its own defence. So it seems to have
been with <hi>Peter;</hi> his carnal fear closing with the
temptation wherein Satan sought to winnow him,
filled his mind with so many thoughts about his
own imminent danger, that he could not take into
consideration the love and warning of Christ; nor
the evil whereunto his temptation led him, nor
any thing that he ought to have insisted on for his
preservation. And therefore upon a review of his
folly in neglecting those thoughts of God, and the
love of Christ, which through the assistance of the
Holy Ghost might have kept him from his scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
fall, he <hi>wept bitterly.</hi> And this indeed is
the common way of the working of the <hi>deceit of
sin,</hi> as unto particular evils. It layes hold on the
mind <hi>suddenly</hi> with thoughtfulness about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
sin, possesseth it, takes it up, so that either it
recovers not it self at all to the considerations
mentioned, or if any thoughts of them be sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
the mind is so prepossest and filled, that they
take no impression on the soul, or make no abode
in it. Thus doubtless was <hi>David</hi> surprised in the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42900:84"/>
entrance of his great sin. Sin and temptation did so
<hi>possess and fill his mind</hi> with the present object of
his lust, that he utterly forgot, as it were, those
considerations which he had formerly made use of,
when he so diligently kept himself from his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
Here therefore lyes the great wisdom of
the soul, in rejecting the very first motions of sin,
because by parlies with them the mind may be
drawn off from attending unto its preservatives,
and so the whole rush into evil.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It draws away the mind <hi>by frequency
and long continuance</hi> of its solicitations, making as
it were at last a conquest of it. And this happens
not without an open neglect of the soul, in want of
stirring up it self to give an effectual rebuke in the
strength and by the Grace of Christ unto sin, which
would have prevented its prevalency. But of this,
more shall be spoken afterwards. And this is the
first way whereby the Law of sin acts its deceit
against the soul. It <hi>draws off the mind</hi> from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
unto its charge and Office, both in respect
of duty and sin. And so far as this is done the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is said to be <hi>drawn away, or drawn off.</hi> He is
tempted; every man is tempted, <hi>when he is thus
drawn away</hi> by his own lust, or the deceit of sin
dwelling in him. And the whole effect of this
working of the deceituflness of sin may be reduced
unto these three heads.</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>remission of an universally watchful
frame of Spirit</hi> unto every duty, and against all,
even the most hidden and secret actings of sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The omission of peculiar attending
unto such duties as have an especial respect unto
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42900:84"/>
the weakning and ruine of the whole Law of Sin,
and the obviating of its deceitfulness.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Spiritual sloth, as to a diligent regard
unto all the especial concernments of Duties and
Sins. When these three things, with their branches
mentioned, less or more, are brought about, in,
or upon the soul, or so far as they are so, so far a
man is drawn off by his own lust, or the deceit of
sin.</p>
            <p>There is no need of adding here any directions
for the prevention of this evil, they having suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
been laid down in our passage through the
consideration both of the <hi>duty</hi> of the mind, and of
the <hi>deceit</hi> of sin.</p>

Means of their prevention.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe second thing in the words of the Apostle
ascribed unto the <hi>deceitful working of sin</hi> is its
<hi>enticing.</hi> A man is drawn away and <hi>enticed.</hi> And
this seems particularly to respect the <hi>Affections,</hi> as
drawing away doth the mind. The <hi>Mind</hi> is
drawn away from duty, and the <hi>Affections</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
unto sin. From the prevalency hereof a man is
said to be <hi>enticed,</hi> or <hi>entangled as with a bait;</hi> so
the word imports. For there is an allusion in it
unto the <hi>bait</hi> wherewith a Fish is taken on the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42900:85"/>
hook which holds him to his destruction. And
concerning this effect of the deceit of sin, we shall
briefly shew two things.</p>
            <p>First, What it is to be <hi>enticed,</hi> or to be <hi>entangled</hi>
with the bait of sin, to have the <hi>Affections</hi> tainted
with an inclin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion thereunto, and when they are
so.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What course sin takes, and what way
it proceedeth in, thus to entice, ensnare, or entangle
the soul.</p>
            <p>For the first, First, The Affections are certainly
<hi>entangled</hi> when they stir up <hi>frequent imaginations</hi>
about the <hi>proposed object</hi> which this deceit of sin
leadeth and enticeth towards. When sin prevails,
and the Affections are gone fully after it, it <hi>fills the
imagination</hi> with it, possessing it with Images,
likenesses, appearances of it continually. Such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<hi>devise iniquity</hi> and work evil on their beds,
which they also practise when they are able, when
it is in the <hi>power of their hand, Mic.</hi> 2. 1. As in
particular, <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that they <hi>have Eyes full of
an Adulteress, and they cannot cease from sin,</hi> 2 Pet.
2. 14. That is, their <hi>imaginations</hi> are possest with
a continual representation of the object of their
lusts. And it is so <hi>in part</hi> where the Affections are
<hi>in part</hi> entangled with sin, and begin to turn aside
unto it. <hi>John</hi> tells us that the things that are in the
world, are the <hi>lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
and the pride of life,</hi> 1 Ep. 2. 14. <hi>The lust of the
Eyes is</hi> that which by them is conveyed unto the
soul. Now it is not the <hi>bodily sense</hi> of <hi>seeing,</hi> but
the fixing of the imagination from that sense on
such thing, that is intended. And this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42900:85"/>
the <hi>Eyes,</hi> because thereby things are constantly
represented unto the mind and soul, as outward
objects are unto the inward sense by the Eyes. And
oftentimes the <hi>outward sight of the Eyes</hi> is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of these imaginations. So <hi>Achan</hi> declares
how sin prevailed with him, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7. 21. First <hi>he
saw</hi> the wedge of Gold, and <hi>Babylonish garment,</hi>
and then he coveted them. He rolled them the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
the profit of them, in his Imagination, and
then fixed his heart upon the obt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ining of them.
Now the heart may have a setled, fixed detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sin; but yet if a man find that the <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the mind is frequently solicited by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
exercised about it, such a one may know that his
<hi>Affections</hi> are secretly enticed and entangled.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This entanglement is heightned,
when the <hi>Imagination</hi> can prevail with the mind <hi>to
lodge vain thoughts</hi> in it, with secret delight and
<hi>complacency.</hi> This is termed by <hi>Casuists, Cogitatio
morosa cum delectatione,</hi> an abiding thought with
delight, which towards forbidden objects is in all
cases <hi>actually</hi> sinful. And yet, this may be, when the
<hi>Consent of the Will</hi> unto sin is not obtained; when
the soul would not for the world do the thing,
which yet thoughts begin to lodge in the mind
about. This <hi>lodging of vain thoughts</hi> in the heart
the Prophet complains of as a thing greatly sinful,
and to be abhorred, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. All these thoughts
are <hi>Messengers</hi> that carry sin to and fro between
the <hi>Imagination</hi> and the <hi>Affections,</hi> and still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it, enflaming the Imagination, and more and
more entangling the Affections. <hi>Achan</hi> thinks
upon the <hi>Golden Wedge,</hi> this makes him like it, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42900:86"/>
love it; by loving of it, his thoughts are infected,
and return to the Imagination of its worth, and
goodly shew, and so by little and little the soul is
<hi>enflamed</hi> unto sin. And here if the <hi>Will</hi> parts with
its <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> sin is actually conceived.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Inclinations, or readiness to attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>extenuations of sin,</hi> or the reliefs that are tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
against sin when committed, manifest the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to be entangled with it. We have shewed,
and shall yet farther evidence that it is a great part
of the deceit of sin, to tender lessning and extenuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoughts of sin unto the mind. <hi>Is it not a little
one?</hi> or there is mercy provided, or it shall be in
due time relinquished and given over, is its lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
in a deceived heart. Now when there is a
readiness in the soul to hearken and give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto such secret insinuations arising from this
deceit, in reference unto any sin, or unapprovable
course, it is an evidence that the <hi>Affections</hi> are
enticed. When the soul is willing, as it were to be
tempted, to be courted by sin, to hearken to
its dalliances and solicitations, it hath lost of its
conjugal Affections unto Christ, and is entangled.
This is <hi>looking on the Wine when it is red, when
it giveth its colour in the Cup, when it moveth it
self aright, Prov.</hi> 33. 21. A pleasing contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
on the invitations of sin, whose end the
wise Man gives us, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. When the deceit of
sin hath prevailed thus far on any Person, then he
is <hi>enticed</hi> or <hi>entangled;</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> is not yet come to
the actual conception of this or that sin by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but the whole soul is in a near inclination
thereunto. And many other instances I could
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42900:86"/>
give as tokens and evidences of this entanglement.
These may suffice to manifest what we intend
thereby.</p>
            <p>Our next enquiry is, how, or by what means
the <hi>deceit of sin</hi> proceeds thus to entice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
the Affections; and two or three of its baits
are manifest herein.</p>
            <p>First It makes use of its former prevalency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the mind in <hi>drawing it off</hi> from its watch and
circumspection. Sayes the Wise man, Prov. 1. 17.
<hi>Surely in vain is the Not spread in the sight of any
Bird;</hi> or before the eyes of every thing that hath a
wing, as in the <hi>Original.</hi> If it hath eyes open to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the snare, and a wing to carry it away, it will
not be caught. And in vain should the <hi>deceit of sin</hi>
spread its <hi>snares</hi> and <hi>Nets</hi> for the entanglement of
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l, whilest the Eyes of the mind are intent
upon what it doth, and so stir up the wings of its
<hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> to carry it away and avoid it.
But if the <hi>Eyes</hi> be put out or diverted, the <hi>wings</hi>
are of very little use for escape. And therefore
this is one of the wayes which is used by them who
take <hi>Birds</hi> or Fowls in their Nets, they have false
lights, or shews of things to divert the sight of their
prey; and when that is done, they take the season
to cast their Nets upon them. So doth the deceit of
sin, it first <hi>draws off</hi> and diverts the mind by false
reasonings and pretences, as hath been shewed,
and then casts its Net upon the Affections for their
entanglement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Taking advantage of such seasons, it
proposeth sin as <hi>desirable,</hi> as exceeding satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the corrupt part of our Affections. It gilds
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42900:87"/>
over the object by a <hi>thousand pretences</hi> which it
presents unto corrupt lustings. This is the <hi>laying
of a bait,</hi> which the Apostle in this Verse evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alludes unto. A <hi>bait</hi> is some what desirable and
suitable, that is proposed to the hungry Creature
for its satisfaction, and it is by all Artifices ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
desirable and suitable. Thus is sin presented
by the help of the imagination unto the soul; that
is, sinful and inordinate objects, which the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
cleave unto, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>sented. The Apostle
tells us, that there are <hi>pleasures of sin, Heb.</hi> 11. 35.
which unless they are despis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, as they were by
<hi>Moses,</hi> there is no escaping of sin it self Hence
they that <hi>live in sin,</hi> are said to <hi>live in pleasure,
James</hi> 5. 5. Now this pleasure of sin consisteth in
its <hi>suitableness</hi> to give satisfaction to the flesh, to
lust, to corrupt Affections. Hence is that caution,
Rom. 13. 14. <hi>Make no provision for the flesh to
fulfill the lust thereof.</hi> That is, do not suffer your
minds, thoughts, or affections to fix upon sinful
objects, suited to give satisfaction to the lusts of
the flesh, to nouri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and cherish them thereby. To
which purpose he speaks again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Fulfill
ye not the lusts of the flesh.</hi> Bring not in the pleasures
of sin to give them satisfaction. When men are
under the power of sin, they are said to <hi>fulfill the
desires of the flesh and of the Mind, Eph.</hi> 2. 3. Thus
therefore the <hi>deceit of sin</hi> endeavours to entangle
the <hi>Affections,</hi> by proposing unto them through
the assistance of the <hi>Imagination</hi> that suitableness
which is in it to the satisfaction of its corrupt
lusts, now set at some liberty by the inadvertency
of the mind. It presents its <hi>Wine as sparkling
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42900:87"/>
in the cup,</hi> the beauty of the Adulteress, the riches
of the world unto sensual and covetous persons, and
somewhat in the like kind, in some degrees to
Believers themselves. When therefore, I say, sin
would entangle the soul, it prevails with the <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi>
to solicit the heart, by representing this
false painted beauty, or pretended satisfactoriness
of sin: And then if Satan with any peculiar tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
fall in to its assistance, it oftentimes inflames
all the affections, and puts the whole soul into
disorder.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It <hi>hides the danger</hi> that attends sin, it
covers it as the <hi>hook</hi> is covered with the <hi>bait,</hi> or
the net spread over with meat for the fowl to be
taken. It is not indeed possible that sin should ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deprive the soul of the knowledge of the <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
of it. It cannot dispossess it of its notion or
perswasion that the <hi>wages of sin is death;</hi> and that
it is the <hi>judgment of God, that they that commit sin
are worthy of death.</hi> But this it will do, it will so
take up and possess the mind and affections with
the baits and desirableness of sin, that it shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them from an actual and practical contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of the danger of it. What <hi>Satan</hi> did in and
by his first temptation, that sin doth ever since.
At first <hi>Eve</hi> guards her self, with calling to mind
the <hi>danger of sin;</hi> if we eat, or touch it, we shall
die, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 3. But so soon as <hi>Satan</hi> had filled her
mind with the beauty and usefulness of the fruit to
make on wise, how quickly did she lay aside her
practical prevalent consideration of the danger of
eating it, the curse due unto it; or else relieves
her self with a vain hope and pretence that it
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42900:88"/>
should not be, because the <hi>Serpent</hi> told her so. So
was <hi>David</hi> beguiled in his great transgression, by
the deceit of sin; his lust being pleased and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
the consideration of the guilt and danger of
his transgression was taken away: and therefore
he is said to have <hi>despised the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 9.
in that he considered not the evil that was in his
heart, and the danger that attended it in the
threatning or commination of the Law. Now sin
when it presseth upon the soul to this purpose, will
use a thousand wiles to hide from it the terrour of
the Lord, the end of transgressions, and especially
of that peculiar folly which it solicits the mind
unto. <hi>Hopes of pardon</hi> shall be used to hide it, and
<hi>future repentance</hi> shall hide it, <hi>present importunity</hi>
of lust shall hide it, <hi>occasions and opportunities</hi> shall
hide it, <hi>surprizals</hi> shall hide it, <hi>extenuation</hi> of sin
shall hide it, <hi>balancing of duties</hi> against it shall hide
it, <hi>fixing the imagination</hi> on present objects shall
hide it, <hi>desperate resolutions</hi> to venture the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
for the enjoyment of lust in its pleasures and
profits, shall hide it. A thousand wiles it hath which
cannot be recounted.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Having prevailed thus far, gilding
over the pleasures of sin, hiding its end and demerit,
it proceds to raise <hi>pervers reasonings</hi> in the mind,
to fix it upon the sin proposed, that it may be
conceived and brought forth, the affections being
already prevailed upon; of which we shall speak
under the next head of its progress.</p>
            <p>Here we may stay a little, as formerly, to give
some few directions for the obviating of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
work of the deceitfulness of sin. Would we
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42900:88"/>
not be <hi>enticed</hi> or <hi>entangled,</hi> would we not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the conception of sin, would we be turned
out of the road and way which goes down to
death; Let us take heed of our <hi>Affections,</hi> which
are of so great concernment in the whole course of
our obedience, that they are commonly in the
Scripture called by the name of the <hi>heart,</hi> as the
principal thing which God requires in our walking
before him. And this is not slightly to be attended
unto. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. saith the wise man, <hi>Keep thy
heart with all diligence,</hi> or as in the Original,
above or before all keepings; <hi>Before every watch,
keep thy heart.</hi> You have many keepings that you
watch unto; you watch to keep your lives, to keep
your estates, to keep your reputations, to keep up
your families; but, saith he, <hi>above all these
keepings,</hi> prefer that, attend to that of the heart,
of your affections, that they be not entangled with
sin; there is no safety without it. Save all other
things and lose the heart, and all is lost, lost unto
all eternity. You will say then, what shall we do,
or how shall we observe this duty?</p>
            <p>First, Keep your affections as to their <hi>Object</hi> in
general. This advice the Apostle gives in this very
case, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. his advice in the beginning of that
chapter is to direct us unto the <hi>mortification of sin,</hi>
which he expresly engageth in, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Mortifie
therefore your members which are on the earth.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the working and deceit of sin which wars in
your members. To prepare us, to enable us hereunto,
he gives us that great direction, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Set your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on things above, not on things of the earth.</hi> Fix
your affections on heavenly things, this will enable
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42900:89"/>
you to mortifie sin: fill them with the things that
are above, let them be exercised with them, and so
enjoy the chiefest place in them. They are <hi>above,</hi>
blessed and suitable objects, meet for, and answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto our affections. God himself, in his beauty
and glory; the Lord Jesus Christ, who is <hi>altogether
lovely, the chiefest of ten thousand;</hi> Grace and
Glory, the Mysteries revealed in the Gospel, the
blessedness promised thereby. Were our affections
filled, taken up, and possessed with these things, as
it is our duty that they should be, it is our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
when they are; what access could sin with its
painted pleasures, with its sugred poisons, with its
envenomed baits, have unto our souls? how should
we loath all its proposals, and say unto them, Get
ye hence as an abominable thing? For what are the
vain transitory pleasures of sin, in comparison of
the exceeding recompence of reward which is
proposed unto us? Which argument the Apostle
presses, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As to the <hi>Object of your affections in an
especial manner;</hi> let it be the <hi>Cross of Christ,</hi> which
hath an exceeding efficacy towards the disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole work of Indwelling-sin. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.
14. <hi>God forbid that I should glory, save in the Cross
of our Lord Jesus, whereby the world is crucified
unto me, and I unto the world.</hi> The <hi>Cross of Christ</hi>
he gloried and rejoyced in; this his heart was set
upon, and these were the effects of it; it crucified
the world unto him, made it a dead and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
thing. The baits and pleasures of sin are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
all of them out of the world, and the things
that are in the world, namely the <hi>lust of the flesh,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42900:89"/>
the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.</hi> These are
the things that are in the world; from these doth
sin take all its baits, whereby it enticeth and entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth
our souls. If the heart be filled with the <hi>Cross
of Christ,</hi> it casts death and undesirableness upon
them all, it leaves no seeming beauty, no appearing
pleasure or comeliness in them. Again, saith he,
<hi>It crucifieth me to the world;</hi> makes my heart, my
affections, my desires dead unto any of these things.
It roots up corrupt lusts and affections, leaves no
principle to go forth and make provision for the
flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof. Labour therefore to
fill your hearts with the <hi>Cross of Christ.</hi> Consider
the sorrows he underwent, the curse he bore, the
blood he shed, the cries he put forth, the love that
was in all this to your souls, and the mystery of
the grace of God therein. Meditate on the vileness,
the demerit, and punishment of sin as represented
in the Cross, the blood, the death of Christ. Is
Christ <hi>crucified</hi> for sin, and shall not our hearts be
<hi>crucified</hi> with him unto sin? Shall we give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
unto that, or hearken unto its dalliances,
which wounded, which pierced, which slew our
dear Lord Jesus? God forbid. Fill your affections
with the <hi>Cross of Christ,</hi> that there may be no room
for sin. The world once put him out of the house
into a stable, when he came to save us; let him now
turn the world out of doors, when he is come to
sanctifie us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Look to the <hi>vigour of the affections</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heavenly things; if they are not constantly
attended, excited, directed, and warned, they are
apt to decay, and sin lies in wait to take every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42900:90"/>
against them. Many complaints we have
in the Scripture of those who lost their <hi>first love,</hi> in
suffering their affections to decay. And this should
make us <hi>jealous</hi> over our own hearts, lest we also
should be over-taken with the like back-sliding
frame. Wherefore be jealous over them, often
strictly examine them, and call them to account,
supply unto them due considerations for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
and stirring up unto duty.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The Conception of Sin through its Deceit.
Wherein it consisteh. The consent of the
Will unto Sin. The Nature thereof. Ways
and Means whereby it is obtained. Other
Advantages made use of by the Deceit of
Sin. Ignorance, Errours.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe third success of the deceit of sin in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive
work, is the <hi>Conception of actual sin.</hi>
When it hath drawn the mind off from its duty, and
entangled the affections, it proceeds to <hi>conceive sin</hi>
in order to the bringing of it forth. <hi>Then when lust
hath conceived it bringeth forth sin.</hi> Now the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of sin,</hi> in order unto its perpetration, can be
nothing but the <hi>consent of the Will:</hi> for as without
the <hi>consent of the Will</hi> sin cannot be committed, so
where the Will hath consented unto it, there is
nothing in the soul to hinder its actual accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42900:90"/>
God doth indeed by various ways and
means frustrate the bringing forth of these adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
conceptions, causing them to melt away in the
womb, or one way or other prove abortive, so that
not the least part of that sin is committed which is
<hi>willed</hi> or <hi>conceived;</hi> yet there is nothing in the soul
it self that remains to give check unto it, when once
the <hi>will</hi> hath given its consent. Ofttimes when a
cloud is full of rain, and ready to fall, a wind comes
and drives it away. And when the <hi>Will</hi> is ready to
bring forth its sin, God diverts it by one
wind or other, but yet the cloud was as
full of rain as if it had fallen, and the soul as full of
sin as if it had been committed.</p>
            <p>This <hi>conceiving of lust</hi> or sin then, is its preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in obtaining the <hi>consent of the will</hi> unto its
solicitations. And hereby the soul is deflowered of
its chastity towards God in Christ, as the Apostle
intimates, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2, 3. To clear up this matter
we must observe,</p>
            <p>First, That the <hi>Will</hi> is the Principle, the next
seat and cause of <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>disobedience.</hi> Moral
actions are unto us, or in us, so far good or evil as
they partake of the <hi>consent of the Will.</hi> He spake
truth of old who said, <hi>Omne peccatum est adeò vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarium,
ut non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it peccatum nisi sit voluntarium.
Every sin is so voluntary, that if it be not voluntary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it is not sin.</hi> It is most true of <hi>actual sins.</hi> The forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of their iniquity ariseth from the acts of the
will in them, and concerning them, I mean, as to
the <hi>persons</hi> that commit them; otherwise in it self
the formal reason of sin is its <hi>aberration from the
Law of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:42900:91"/>
Secondly, There is a two-fold <hi>consent of the will</hi>
unto sin.</p>
            <p>First, That which is <hi>full, absolute,</hi> complete, and
upon deliberation. A prevailing consent, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
of the mind being conquered, and no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of grace in the will to weaken it. With this
<hi>consent</hi> the soul goes into sin, as a Ship before the
wind with all its sails displayed, without any check
or stop. It rusheth into sin like the horse into the
battel. Men thereby, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>giving
themselves over to sin with greediness, Ephes.</hi> 4.
19. Thus <hi>Ahabs will</hi> was in the murthering of
<hi>Naboth,</hi> he did it upon deliberation, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
with a full consent; the doing of it gave
him such satisfaction, as that it cured his <hi>malady</hi>
or the distemper of his mind. This is that <hi>consent of
the will</hi> which is acted in the finishing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
of sin, in unregenerate persons, and is not
required to the single bringing forth of sin,
whereof we speak.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a <hi>Consent of the will,</hi> which is
attended with a secret <hi>renitency</hi> and <hi>volition</hi> of the
contrary. Thus <hi>Peter</hi>'s will was in the denying of
his Master. His <hi>will</hi> was in it, or he had not done
it; it was a <hi>voluntary action,</hi> that which he chose
to do at that season. Sin had not been <hi>brought
forth,</hi> if it had not been thus <hi>conceived.</hi> But yet at
this very time there was resident in his will a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
principle of love to Christ, yea, and faith in
him which utterly failed not. The ecafficy of it
was intercepted, and its operations suspended
actually, through the violent urging of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
that he was under; but yet it was in his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42900:91"/>
               <hi>will,</hi> and weakned his consent unto sin, though it
consented: It was not done with <hi>self-pleasing,</hi>
which such full acts of the will do produce.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Although there may be a <hi>predominant
consent in the will,</hi> which may suffice for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of particular sins, yet there cannot be an
<hi>absolute, total, full</hi> consent of the will of a Believer
unto any sin: for,</p>
            <p>First, There is in his <hi>will</hi> a principle fixed on
good, on all good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>He would do good.</hi>
The principle of grace in the <hi>will,</hi> inclines him to
all good. And this in general is pravalent against
the principle of sin, so that the <hi>will</hi> is denominated
from thence. Grace hath the rule and dominion,
and not sin, in the <hi>will</hi> of every Believer. Now that
consent unto sin in the <hi>will,</hi> which is contrary to
the inclination and general prevailing principle in
the same will, is not, cannot be total, absolute and
complete.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is not only a general, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ng,
prevailing principle in the will against sin, but
there is also a secret <hi>reluctancy</hi> in it against its own
act in consenting unto sin. It is true, the soul is not
sensible sometimes of this <hi>reluctancy,</hi> because the
present consent carries away the prevailing act of
the <hi>will,</hi> and takes away the sense of the <hi>lusting of
the spirit,</hi> or reluctancy of the principle of grace in
the will. But the general rule holdeth in all things
at all times, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>The spirit lusteth against the
flesh:</hi> it doth so <hi>actually,</hi> though not always to the
same degree, nor with the same success. And the
prevalency of the contrary principle in this or
that particular act, doth not disprove it. It is so
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42900:92"/>
on the other side, There is no acting of grace in
the <hi>will</hi> but sin lusts against it, although that
lusting be not made sensible in the soul, because
of the prevalency of the contrary acting of grace,
yet it is enough to keep those actings from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in their kind. So is it in this Renitency of
grace against the acting of sin in the soul; though
it be not sensible in its operations, yet it is enough
to keep that act from being full and complete. And
much of spiritual wisdom lies in discerning aright
between the <hi>spiritual Renitency</hi> of the principle of
grace in the will against sin, and the rebukes that
are given the soul by conscience upon conviction
for sin.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Observe, that reiterated repeated acts
of the <hi>consent of the will</hi> unto sin, may beget a
disposition, and inclineableness in it unto the like
acts, that may bring the will unto a <hi>proneness and
readiness</hi> to consent unto sin upon easie sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
which is a condition of soul dangerous, and
greatly to be watched against.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This <hi>consent of the will,</hi> which we have
thus described, may be considered two ways.</p>
            <p>First, As it is exercised about the circumstances,
causes, means and inducements unto sin. Secondly,
As it respects this or that <hi>actual sin.</hi> In the first
sense, there is a virtual consent of the <hi>will</hi> unto sin
in every inadvertency unto the prevention of it, in
every neglect of duty that makes way for it, in
every hearkning unto any temptation leading to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it. In a word, in all the diversions of the
mind from its duty, and intanglements of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
by sin before mentioned. For where there
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42900:92"/>
is no act of the <hi>will formally,</hi> or <hi>virtually,</hi> there is
no sin. But this is not that which we now speak of.
But in particular the <hi>consent of the will</hi> unto this or
that actual sin, so far as that either sin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
or is prevented by other wayes and means
not of our present consideration. And herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the <hi>conceiving of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things being supposed, that which in the
next place we are to consider, is the <hi>way</hi> that the
deceit of sin proceedeth in; to procure the <hi>consent
of the will,</hi> and so to conceive actual sin in the
soul. To this purpose observe,</p>
            <p>First, That the <hi>will is a rational appetite;</hi> Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
as guided by the mind; and an appetite as
excited by the Affections; and so in its operation
or actings hath respect to both, is influenced by
both.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It chuseth nothing, consents to nothing
but <hi>sub ratione boni,</hi> as it hath an <hi>appearance of
good,</hi> some present good. It cannot consent to any
thing under the notion or apprehension of its being
<hi>evil</hi> in any kind. <hi>Good</hi> is its natural and necessary
object, and therefore whatever is proposed unto it
for its consent, must be proposed under an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of being either good <hi>in it self,</hi> or good at
<hi>present</hi> unto the soul, or good so circumstantiate as
it is; So that,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We may see hence the reason why the
<hi>conception of sin</hi> is here placed as a consequent of
the <hi>minds being drawn away,</hi> and the <hi>Affections
being entangled.</hi> Both these have an influence into
the <hi>consent of the will,</hi> and the conception of this or
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at actual sin thereby. Our way therefore here is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42900:93"/>
made somewhat plain. We have seen at large how
the mind is drawn away by the deceit of sin, and
how the Affections are entangled, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
is but the proper effect of these things;
For the discovery whereof we must instance in
some of the special <hi>deceits,</hi> corrupt and fallacious
reasonings before mentioned, and then shew their
prevalency on the <hi>Will</hi> to a consent unto sin.</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Will</hi> is imposed upon by that corrupt
reasoning, that <hi>Grace is exalted in pardon;</hi> and that
mercy is provided for sinners. This first as hath
been shewed, deceives the mind, and that opens
the way to the wills consent, by removing a sight
of <hi>evil</hi> which the will hath an aversation unto.
And this is carnal hearts prevails so far as to make
them think that their <hi>liberty consists in being ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of corruption,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 19. And the poyson of
it doth oftentimes taint and vitiate the minds of
Believers themselves; whence we are so cautioned
against it in the Scripture. To what therefore hath
been spoken before, unto the use and abuse of the
Doctrine of the Grace of the Gospel, we shall add
some few more considerations, and fix upon one
place of Scripture that will give light unto it.
There is a twofold <hi>Mysterie</hi> of Grace; of walking
with God, and of coming unto God. And the
great design of sin is to change the Doctrine and
<hi>Mysterie</hi> of Grace in reference unto these things,
and that by applying those considerations unto the
one, which are proper unto the other, whereby
each part is hindred, and the influence of the
Doctrine of Grace into them for their fartherance
defeated; See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>These things write I
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42900:93"/>
unto you that ye sin not; &amp; if any man sin, we have an
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and he is the propitiation for our sins.</hi> Here is
the whole design and use of the Gospel briefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<hi>These things,</hi> saith he, <hi>I write unto you;</hi> what
things were these? Those mentioned, v. 2. <hi>The life
was manifested, and we have seen it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and shew unto you that eternal life which was
with the Father, and was manifested unto us,</hi> that is,
the things concerning the person and mediations of
Christ; and <hi>v.</hi> 7. that pardon, forgiveness and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
from sin is to be attained by the blood of
Christ. But to what end and purpose doth he write
these things to them, What do they teach, what do
they tend unto? An universal abstinence from sin;
<hi>I write unto you,</hi> saith he, <hi>that you sin not.</hi> This is
the proper, only, genuine end of the doctrine of the
Gospel. But to abstain from all sin, is not our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this world. Chap. 1. 8. <hi>If we say that we have
no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in
us.</hi> What then shall be done in this case? In suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of sin, that we have sinned, is there no relief
provided for our souls and consciences in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?
Yes, saith he, <hi>If any man sin, we have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,
and he is a propitiation for our sins.</hi> There is full
relief in the propitiation and intercession of Christ
for us. This is the order and <hi>method</hi> of the
Doctrine of the Gospel and of the application of it
to our own souls: First, To keep us from sin;
and then to relieve us against sin. But here ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h
the dece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of sin, and puts this <hi>new Wine into
old Bottles,</hi> whereby the bottles are brok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42900:94"/>
the Wine perisheth as to our benefit by it. It
changeth this <hi>method</hi> and order of the application
of Gospel-truths. It takes up the last first, and
that excludes the use of the first utterly. If any
man sin there is pardon provided, is all the <hi>Gospel</hi>
that sin would willingly suffer to abide on the
minds of men. When we would come to God by
believing, it would be pressing the former part
of being <hi>free from sin,</hi> when the Gospel proposeth
the latter principally, or the pardon of sin for our
encouragement. When we are come to God, and
should walk with him, it will have only the latter
proposed, that there is pardon of sin, when the
Gospel principally proposeth the former, of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves from sin. The Grace of God bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
salvation having appeared unto us to that end
and purpose. Now the mind being entangled with
this deceit, drawn off from its watch by it, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the true ends of the Gospel, doth seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
wayes impose upon the <hi>will</hi> to obtain its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p>First, By a sudden <hi>surprizal</hi> in case of temptation.
Temptation is the representation of a thing as a
<hi>present good,</hi> a particular good, which is a real
evil, a general evil. Now when a temptation armed
with opportunity and provocation, befalls the soul,
the principle of Grace in the <hi>will</hi> riseth up with a
rejection and detestation of it. But on a sudden
the <hi>mind</hi> being deceived by sin, breaks in upon the
<hi>will,</hi> with a corrupt fallacious reasoning from Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Grace
and Mercy, which first staggers, then
abates the wills opposition, and then causeth it to
cast the scale by its consent of the side of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42900:94"/>
presenting evil as a present good; and sin in
the sight of God is conceived, though it be never
committed. Thus is the seed of God sacrificed
to <hi>Moloch,</hi> and the weapons of Christ abused to
the service of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It doth it insensibly. It insinuates the
poyson of this corrupt reasoning by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
untill it hath greatly prevailed. And as the
whole effect of the Doctrine of the Gospel in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and obedience, consists in the souls being cast
into the frame and mould of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. So the
whole of <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the Gospel, is principally
the casting of the soul into the mould of this false
reasoning, that sin may be indulged unto upon the
account of Grace and pardon. Hereby is the soul
gratified in sloth and negligence, and taken off
from its care, as to particular duties and avoidance
of particular sins. It works the soul insensibly off
from the mysterie of the Law of Grace, to look
for salvation as if we had never performed any
duty, being after we have done all unprofitable
servants, with a resting on Soveraign Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
through the blood of Christ, and to attend unto
duties with all diligence as if we looked for no
mercy; that is with no less care, though with more
liberty and freedom. This the deceitfulness of sin
endeavoureth by all means to work the soul from,
and thereby debaucheth the <hi>will</hi> when its consent
is required unto particular sins.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The deceived <hi>mind</hi> imposeth on the
<hi>will</hi> to obtain its consent unto sin, by proposing
unto it, the advantages that may accrew and arise
thereby, which is one <hi>Medium</hi> whereby its
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42900:95"/>
self also is drawn away. It renders that which is
<hi>absolutely evil,</hi> a present <hi>appearing good.</hi> So was it
with <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3. laying aside all considerations of
the Law, Covenant, and threats of God, she all at
once reflects upon the advantages, pleasures and
benefits which she should obtain by her sin, and
reckons them up to solicit the consent of her
will. <hi>It is,</hi> saith she, <hi>good for food, pleasant to the
Eyes, and to be desired to make one wise.</hi> What
should she do then but eat it; her will consented
and she did so accordingly. Pleas for Obedience
are laid out of the way, and only the pleasures of
sin are taken under consideration. So saith <hi>Ahab,</hi>
1 King. 21. <hi>Naboth's Vineyard is near my house,
and I may make it a Garden of Herbs,</hi> therefore I
must have it. These considerations a deceived
mind imposed on his <hi>Will;</hi> until it made him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
in the pursuit of his covetousness through
perjury and murther, to the utter ruine of himself
and his Family. Thus is the guilt and tendency
of sin hid under the covert of advantages and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and so is conceived or resolved on in the
soul.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As the <hi>mind</hi> being <hi>withdrawn,</hi> so the
<hi>Affections</hi> being <hi>enticed</hi> and entangled, do greatly
farther the conception of sin in the soul by the
<hi>consent of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e will;</hi> and they do it two waies.</p>
            <p>First, By s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me hasty <hi>impulse and surprisal;</hi> being
themselves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>red up, incited, and drawn forth by
some violent provocation, or suitable temptation,
they put the whole soul as it were into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion,
and draw the will into a consent unto
what they are provoked unto and entangled
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42900:95"/>
withal. So was the case of <hi>David</hi> in the matter of
<hi>Nabal.</hi> A violent provocation from the extream
unworthy carriage of that foolish Churle, stirs him
up to wrath and revenge, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 13. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
upon it, to destroy an whole Family, the
Innocent with the Guilty, <hi>ver.</hi> 33, 34. Self-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and murther, were for the season conceived,
resolved, consented unto, until God graciously
took him off. His entangled, provoked Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
surprised his <hi>Will</hi> to consent unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of many bloody sins. The case was the
same with <hi>Asa</hi> in his <hi>anger,</hi> when he smote the
Prophet, and with <hi>Peter</hi> in his <hi>fear</hi> when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
his Master. Let that soul which would take
heed of conceiving sin, take heed of entangled Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
For sin may be <hi>suddenly</hi> conceived, the
prevalent consent of the will may be suddenly
obtained, which gives the soul a fixed guilt,
though the sin it self be never actually brought
forth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Enticed Affections procure the <hi>consent
of the will by frequent solicitations,</hi> whereby they
get ground insensibly upon it, and Enthrone them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Take an Instance in the Sons of <hi>Jacob,
Gen.</hi> 37. 4. They <hi>hate</hi> their Brother, because their
Father loved him. Their Affections being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed,
many new occasions fall out to <hi>entangle</hi> them
farther, as his <hi>Dreams</hi> and the like. This lay
rankling in their hearts, and never ceased solicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>wills,</hi> until they resolved upon his death.
The unlawfulness, the unnaturalness of the
action, the grief of their aged Father, the guilt of
their own souls, are all laid aside; that hatred and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42900:96"/>
envy that they had conceived against him ceased
not until they had got the consent of their wills to
his ruine. This gradual progress of the prevalency
of corrupt Affections to solicite the soul unto sin
the Wise Man excellently describes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 31,
32, 33, 34, 35. And this is the common way of
sins procedure in the destruction of souls which
seem to have made some good Engagements in the
wayes of God. When it hath entangled them with
one temptation, and brought the will to some liking
of it, that presently becomes another temptation,
either to the neglect of some duty, or to the
refusal of more light; and commonly that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
men fall off utterly from God, is not that
wherewith they are first entangled. And this
may briefly suffice for the third <hi>Progressive Act</hi>
of the deceit of sin. It obtains the <hi>wills con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
unto its conception, and by this means are
multitudes of sins <hi>conceived in the heart</hi> which
very little less defile the soul, or cause it to
contract very little less guilt, than if they were
actually committed.</p>
            <p>Unto what hath been spoken concerning the
<hi>deceitfulness</hi> of <hi>indwelling-sin</hi> in general, which
greatly evidenceth its <hi>power</hi> and efficacy, I shall
adde as a close of this discourse, one or two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ways of its deceitful actings, consisting in
advantages that it maketh use of, and means of
relieving it self against that disquisition which is
made after it by the Word and Spirit for its ruine.
One head only of each sort we shall here name.</p>
            <p>First, It makes great advantage of the <hi>darkness
of the mind,</hi> to work out its design and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42900:96"/>
The <hi>shades of a mind</hi> totally dark, that is,
devoid utterly of saving grace, are the proper
working place of sin. Hence the effects of it are
called, the <hi>works of darkness, Ephes.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi>
13. 12. as springing from thence. Sin works and
brings forth by the help of it. The working of lust
under the covert of a <hi>dark mind,</hi> is as it were the
upper Region of hell; for it lies at the next door to
it for filth, horrour, and confusion. Now there is
a <hi>partial darkness</hi> abiding still in Believers; they
<hi>know but in part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. Though there be
in them all a principle of saving light, the day-star
is risen in their hearts, yet all the <hi>shades of darkness</hi>
are not utterly expelled out of them in this life.
And there are two parts, as it were, or principal
effects of the <hi>remaining darkness</hi> that is in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
First, <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or a nescience of the will
of God, either <hi>Juris</hi> or <hi>Facti,</hi> of the Rule and
Law in general, or of the reference of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
fact that lies before the mind unto the Law.
Secondly, <hi>Errour</hi> and mistakes, positively taking
that for truth which is falshood, and that for <hi>light</hi>
which is <hi>darkness.</hi> Now of both these doth the <hi>Law
of sin</hi> make great advantage for the exerting of its
power in the soul.</p>
            <p>First, Is there a remaining ignorance of any
thing of the will of God, sin will be sure to make
use of it, and improve it to the uttermost. Though
<hi>Abimelech</hi> were not a <hi>Believer,</hi> yet he was a person
that had a <hi>moral integrity</hi> with him in his ways and
actions; he declares himself to have had so, in a
solemn appeal to God the searcher of all hearts,
even in that wherein he miscarried, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 5.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42900:97"/>
But being ignorant that <hi>fornication</hi> was a sin, or so
great a sin, as that it became not a morally honest
man to defile himself with it, lust hurries him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that intention of evil in reference unto <hi>Sarah,</hi>
as we have it there related. God complains that
his people <hi>perished for lack of knowledge,</hi> Hos. 4. 6.
Being ignorant of the mind and will of God, they
rush'd into evil at every command of the Law of
sin. Be it as to any duty to be performed, or as to
any sin to be committed, if there be in it darkness
or ignorance of the mind about them, sin will not
lose its advantage. Many a man being ignorant
of the duty incumbent on him for the <hi>instruction
of his family,</hi> casting the whole weight of it upon
the publick teaching, is by the <hi>deceitfulness of sin</hi>
brought into an habitual sloth and negligence of
duty. So much <hi>ignorance</hi> of the Will of God and
duty, so much advantage is given to the Law of
sin. And hence we may see what is that true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which with God is acceptable; how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
doth many a poor soul, who is low as to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
knowledge, yet walk with God? It seems
they know so much, as sin hath not on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
much advantage against them; when others
high in their notions, give advantage to their
lusts even by their <hi>ignorance,</hi> though they know
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itnot.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Errour</hi> is a worse part or effect of
the minds darkness, and gives great advantage to
the Law of sin. There is indeed <hi>ignorance</hi> in every
<hi>error,</hi> but there is not <hi>error</hi> in all <hi>ignorance,</hi> and
so they may be distinguished. I shall need to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie
this but with one consideration, and that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42900:97"/>
is, of men, who being zealous for some <hi>error,</hi> do
seek to suppress and persecute the truth. Indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-sin
desires no greater advantage. How will
it every day, every hour pour forth wrath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings,
hard speeches; breathe revenge, murther,
desolation, under the name perhaps of zeal. On
this account we may see poor creatures pleasing
themselves every day, as if they vaunted in their
excellency, when they are foaming out their
own shame. Under their real darkness and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
zeal, sin sits securely and fills Pulpits,
Houses, Prayers, Streets, with as bitter fruits of
envy, malice, wrath, hatred, evi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urmises, false
speakings, as full as they can hold. The common
issue with such poor creatures, is, the holy blessed
meek Spirit of God withdraws from them, and
leaves them visibly and openly to that evil, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
wrathful, worldly spirit, which the Law of
sin hath cherished and heightned in them. Sin
dwells not any where more secure, than in such a
frame. Thus I say, it lays hold in particular of
advantages to practise upon, with its deceitfulness,
and therein also to exert its power in the soul,
whereof this single instance of its improving the
darkness of the mind unto its own ends, is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
evidence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It useth means of relieving it self
against the pursuit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is made after it in the heart
by the Word and Spirit of grace. One also of its
wiles, in the way of instance, I shall name in this
kind, and that i; the <hi>alleviation of its own guilt.</hi> It
pleads for it self, that it is not so bad, so filthy,
so fatal as is pretended; and this course of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42900:98"/>
extenuation it proceds in two ways. First, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely;</hi>
many secret pleas it will have that the evil
which it tends unto is not so pernicious as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is perswaded that it is, it may be ventured
on without ruine. These considerations it will
strongly urge, when it is at work in a way of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal,
when the soul hath no leisure or liberty to
weigh its suggestions in the ballance of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
and not seldom is the <hi>will</hi> imposed on
hereby, and advantages gotten to shift it self from
under the sword of the Spirit. It is not such but
that it may be let alone, or suffered to die of it
self, which probably within a while it will do; no
need of that violence which in mortification is to
be offered; it is time enough to deal with a matter
of no greater importance hereafter; With other
pleas like those before-mentioned. Secondly,
<hi>Comparatively,</hi> and this is a large field for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and subtilty to lurk in. Though it is an evil
indeed to be relinquished, and the soul is to be
made watchful against it, yet it is not of the
magnitude and degree; as we may see in the lives
of others, even Saints of God, much less such as
some Saints of old have fallen into. By these and the
like pretences, I say, it seeks to evade and keep its
aboad in the soul when pursued to destruction.
And how little a portion of its deceitfulness is it that
we have declared?</p>

         <div n="13" type="chapter">
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:42900:98"/>
            <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Several waies whereby the bringing forth of
conceived Sin is obstructed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BEfore we proceed to the remaining evidences
of the power and efficacy of the <hi>Law of sin,</hi>
we shall take occasion from what hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
to divert unto one consideration that offers
it self from that Scripture, which was made the
bottom and foundation of our discourse of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>deceitfulness of sin;</hi> namely <hi>James</hi> 1. 14.
The Apostle tells us that <hi>lust conceiving brings
forth sin;</hi> seeming to intimate, that look what sin is
conceived, that also is brought forth. Now
placing the conception of sin, as we have done, in
the <hi>consent of the Will</hi> unto it, and reckoning, as we
ought, the bringing forth of sin to consist in its
<hi>actual commission,</hi> we know that these do not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follow one another. There is a world of
sin conceived in the womb of the wills and hearts
of men, that is never brought forth. Our present
business then shall be to enquire whence that comes
to pass. I answer then;</p>
            <p>First, That this is not so, is no thanks to sin,
nor the Law of it. What it conceives, it would
bring forth; and that it doth not, is for the most
part but a small abatement of its guilt. A <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
will</hi> of actual sinning, is actual sin. There is
nothing wanting on sins part, that every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42900:99"/>
sin is not actually accomplished. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
and prevention lies on another hand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are two things that are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in the creature that hath <hi>conceived sin,</hi> for
the bringing of it forth. First, <hi>Power.</hi> Secondly,
<hi>Continuance in the will of sinning,</hi> until it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated
and committed. Where these <hi>two</hi> are,
actual sin will unavoidably ensue. It is evident
therefore, that that which hinders conceived sin
from being brought forth, must affect either the
<hi>power</hi> or the <hi>will</hi> of the sinner. This must be from
God. And he hath two waies of doing it. First, by
his <hi>Providence,</hi> whereby he obstructs the <hi>power</hi> of
sinning. Secondly, By his <hi>Grace,</hi> whereby he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
or changes the <hi>will</hi> of sinning. I do not
mention these waies of Gods dispensations thus
distinctly, as though the one of them were alwaies
without the other; for there is much of <hi>grace</hi> in
providential administrations, and much of the
<hi>wisdom</hi> of providence seen in the dispensations of
grace. But I place them in this distinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they appear most eminent therein. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in outward acts respecting the power of the
creature, Grace common or special in internal
efficacie, respecting his will. And we shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the first.</p>
            <p>First, When sin is conceived, the Lord obstructs
its production by his providence in taking away, or
taking short that <hi>power</hi> which is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for its bringing forth or accomplishment. As,</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Life</hi> is the foundation of all power, the
principle of operation. When that ceaseth, all
power ceaseth with it. Even God himself, to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42900:99"/>
evince the everlasting stability of his own power,
gives himself the title of the <hi>living God.</hi> Now he
frequently obviates the power of exerting sin actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
by cutting short and taking away the <hi>liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> of
them that have conceived it. Thus he dealt with
the Army of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> when according as he had
purposed, so he threatned that <hi>the Lord should not
deliver Jerusalem out of his hand,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 35.
God threatens to cut short his <hi>power,</hi> that he should
not execute his intendment, <hi>chap.</hi> 19. 28. which he
performs accordingly, by taking away the <hi>lives of
his souldiers,</hi> ver. 35. without whom it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that his conceived sin should be brought forth.
This providential dispensation in the obstruction of
conceived sin, <hi>Moses</hi> excellently sets forth in the
case of <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 15. 9. 19. <hi>The enemy said, I
will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my
lusts shall be satisfied upon them: I will draw my
sword, my hand shall destroy them. Thou didst
blow with thy wind, the Sea covered them, they
sank as lead in the mighty waters.</hi> Sins concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is fully expressed, and as full a prevention is
annexed unto it. In like manner he dealt with
the Companies of <hi>Fifties</hi> and their <hi>Captains,</hi> who
came to apprehend <hi>Elijah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 10, 11. <hi>Fire</hi>
came down from Heaven and consumed them,
when they were ready to have taken him. And
sundry other instances of the like nature might be
recorded. That which is of universal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we have in that great <hi>providential alteration,</hi>
which put a period to the lives of men. Men living
<hi>hundreds of years,</hi> had a long season to bring
forth the sins they had conceived; thereupon the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42900:100"/>
earth was filled with violence, injustice, and rapine,
and all <hi>flesh corrupted their waies,</hi> Gen. 6. 12, 19. To
prevent the like inundation of sin, God shortens
the course of the pilgrimage of men in the earth,
and reduces their lives to a much shorter measure.
Besides this general Law, God daily thus cuts off
persons, who had conceived much mischief and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
in their hearts, and prevents the execution
of it. <hi>Blood-thirsty and deceitful men do not live
out half their days.</hi> They have yet much work to do,
might they have but space given them to execute
the bloody and sinful purposes of their minds. The
<hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 146. 4. <hi>In the day that the
breath of man goeth forth, his thoughts perish:</hi> he
had many contrivances about sin, but now they are
all cut off. So also, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 12, 13. <hi>Though a sinner
do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged;
yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that
fear God, which fear before him; but it shall not be
well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his
daies, which are as a shadow, because he feareth
not before God.</hi> How long soever a wicked man
lives, yet he dies <hi>judicially,</hi> and shall not abide
to do the evil he had conceived.</p>
            <p>But now seeing we have granted, that even
<hi>Believers</hi> themselves may conceive sin through the
power and the deceitfulness of it, it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
whether God ever thus <hi>obviates</hi> its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
and accomplishment in them, by cutting
off and taking away their lives, so as that they shall
not be able to perform it: I answer,</p>
            <p>First, That God doth not <hi>judicially</hi> cut off and
take away the life of any of <hi>his,</hi> for this end and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42900:100"/>
purpose, that he may thereby prevent the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or bringing forth of any particular sin that he
had conceived, and which without that <hi>taking
away</hi> he would have perpetrated. For,</p>
            <p>First, This is directly contrary to the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
end of the <hi>patience of God</hi> towards them,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. This is the very end of the <hi>long-suffering
of God towards Believers,</hi> that before they depart
hence, they may come to the <hi>sense, acknowledgment,</hi>
and repentance of every known sin. This is the
constant and unchangeable rule of Gods patience
in the Covenant of Grace; which is so far from
being in them an incouragement unto sin, that it
is a motive to universal watchfulness against it,
of the same nature with all Gospel-grace, and of
mercy in the blood of Christ. Now this dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof we speak, would lie in a direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
unto it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This also flows from the former, that
whereas <hi>conceived sin</hi> contains the whole nature of
it, as our Saviour at large declares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. And
to be cut off under the guilt of it, to prevent its
farther progress, argues a continuance in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of it without repentance; it cannot be but
they must perish for ever who are so <hi>judicially</hi> cut
off. But God deals not so with his, he casts not
off the people whom he did fore-know. And
thence <hi>David</hi> prays for the patience of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned,
that it might not be so with him,
<hi>Psa.</hi> 39. 13. <hi>O spare me that I may recover strength,
before I go hence and be no more.</hi> But yet,</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are some cases wherein God
may, and doth take away the <hi>lives of his own</hi> to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42900:101"/>
prevent the guilt that otherwise they would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in; As,</p>
            <p>First, In the coming of some great temptation
and tryal upon the world. God knowing that
such and such of his would not be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it, and hold out against it, but would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
him, and defile themselves, he may, and
doubtless often doth take them out of the world,
to take them out of the way of it. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 1. <hi>The
rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>teous is taken away from the evil to come;</hi> not
only the evil of punishment and judgement, but the
evil of temptations and trials, which oftentimes
proves much the worse of the two. Thus a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in war will call off a souldier from his watch
and guard, when he knows that he is not able,
through some infirmity to bear the stress and
force of the enemy that is coming upon him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In case of their engagement into any
way not acceptable to him, through ignorance,
or not knowing of his mind and will. This seems
to have been the case of <hi>Josiah.</hi> And doubtless the
Lord doth oftentimes thus proceed with his.
When any of <hi>his own</hi> are engaged in waies that
please him not, through the darkness and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their minds, that they may not proceed
to farther evil or mischief, he calls them off from
their station and employment, and takes them to
himself, where they shall erre and mistake no
more. But in ordinary cases, God hath other
waies of diverting his own from sin, than by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of them, as we shall see afterwards.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God providentially hinders the
bringing forth of conceived sin, by taking away,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42900:101"/>
and <hi>cutting short the power of them that had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it;</hi> so that though their lives continue, they
shall not have that <hi>power,</hi> without which it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for them to execute what they had intended,
or to bring forth what they had conceived. Hereof
also we have sundry instances. Thus was the case
with the <hi>Builders of Babel,</hi> Gen. 11. What ever it
were in particular that they aimed at, it was in
the pursuit of a design of Apostasie from God.
One thing requisite to the accomplishing of what
they aimed at, was the <hi>oneness of their language;</hi>
so God sayes, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>They have all one language, and
this they begin to do, and now nothing will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
from them that they have imagined to do.</hi>
In an ordinary way they will accomplish their
wicked design. What course doth God now take to
obviate their conceived sin? doth he bring a flood
upon them to destroy them, as in the old world
sometime before? Doth he send his Angel to cut
them off, like the Army of <hi>Senacherib</hi> afterwards?
Doth he by any means take away their lives?
No, their lives are continued, but he <hi>confounds
their language,</hi> so that they cannot go on with
their work, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. takes away that wherein their
power consisted. In like manner did he proceed
with the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> Gen. 19. 11. they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in, and set upon the pursuit of their filthy
lusts. God smites them with <hi>blindness,</hi> so that they
could not find the door where they thought to
have used violence for the compassing of their ends;
their <hi>lives</hi> were continued, and their will of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but their <hi>power</hi> is cut short and abridged. His
dealing with <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 4. was of the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42900:102"/>
same nature. He <hi>stretched out his hand</hi> to lay hold
of the Prophet, and it withered and became use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
And this is an eminent way of the effectual
acting of Gods providence in the world, for the
stopping of that inundation of sin, which would
overflow all the earth were every womb of it
opened. He cuts men short of their <hi>moral</hi> power,
whereby they should effect it. Many a wretch
that hath conceived mischief against the Church
of God, hath by this means been divested of his
<hi>power,</hi> whereby he thought to accomplish it. Some
have their bodies smitten with diseases, that they
can no more serve their lusts, nor accompany
them in the perpetrating of folly. Some are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the instruments whereby they would
work. There hath been for many daies, sin and
mischief enough conceived, to root out the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the righteous from the face of the earth,

of their prevalency. <hi>Psa.</hi> 64. 6. <hi>They search out ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
they accomplish a diligent search, both the
inward thought of every one of them and the heart
is deep.</hi> All things are in a readiness, the design is
well laid, their counsels are deep and secret. What
now shall hinder them from doing what ever they
have imagined to do? <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. <hi>But God shall shoot at
them with an arrow, suddenly shall they be wounded:
so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon
themselves.</hi> God meets with them, brings them
down, that they shall not be able to accomplish their

               </gap>sign. And this way of Gods preventing sin, seems
to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>at e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st ordinarily, peculiar to the men of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42900:102"/>
world; God deals thus with them every day, and
leaves them to pine away in their sins. They go
all their daies big with the iniquity they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and are greatly burdened that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
be delivered of it. The Prophet tells us, that <hi>they
practise iniquity that they had conceived, because it
is in the power of their hand,</hi> Micah 2. 1. If they
have power for it, they will accomplish it; <hi>Ezek.</hi>
22. 6. <hi>To their power they shed blood.</hi> This is the
measure of their sinning, even their power. They
do many of them, no more evil, they commit no
more sin than they can. Their whole restraint lies
in being cut short in power in one kind or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Their bodies will not serve them for their
contrived uncleannesses; nor their hands for their
revenge and rapine, nor their Instruments for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution;
but they go burdened with conceived
sin, and are disquieted and tortured by it all their
daies. And hence they become in themselves, as
well as unto others, a <hi>troubled Sea that cannot rest,
Isa.</hi> 57. 20.</p>
            <p>It may be also in some cases, under some violent
temptations, or in mistakes, God may thus obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the accomplishment of conceived sin in his own.
And there seems to be an instance of it in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> who had designed against the
mind of God to joyn in affinity with <hi>Ahab,</hi> and to
send his Ships with him to <hi>Tarshish;</hi> but God
breaks his Ships by a wind, that he could not
accomplish what he had designed. But in Gods
dealing with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is in this way, there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
from the same dispensation towards others;
for,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:42900:103"/>
First, It is so onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in cases of <hi>exraordinary temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
When through the violence of temptation,
and craft of Satan, they are hurryed from under
the conduct of the Law of grace, God one way
or other takes away their power, or may do so,
that they shall not be able to execute what they
had designed. But this is an ordinary way of
dealing with wicked men. This hook of God is
upon them in the whole course of their lives; and
they struggle with it, being as a wild Bull in a net,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 20. Gods <hi>Net</hi> is upon them, and they are
filled with fury that they cannot do all the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that they would.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God doth it not to leave them to
wrestle with Sin, and to attempt other waies of its
accomplishment upon the failure of that which
they were ingaged in, but by their disappointment
awakens them to consider their condition, and
what they are doing, and so <hi>consumes sin in the
womb</hi> by the waies that shall afterwards be insisted
on. Some Mens deprivation of power for the
committing of conceived contrived sin, hath been
sanctified to the changing of their hearts from all
dalliances with that or other sins.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God <hi>providentially</hi> hinders the bringing
forth of conceived sin, by opposing an <hi>external
hindering power</hi> unto sinners. He leaves them their
lives, and leaves them power to do what they
intend, only he raiseth up an opposite power to
coerce, forbid, and restrain them. An <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>stance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 35. <hi>Saul</hi> had sworn that
<hi>Jonathan</hi> should be put to death, and as far as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
went on resolutely to have slain him; God
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42900:103"/>
stirs up the spirit of the People, they oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the wrath and fury of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi>
is delivered. So also 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 7, 8, 19.
when King <hi>Vzziah</hi> would have in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
offered Incense contrary to the Law, <hi>Eighty
Men of the Priests</hi> resisted him, and drove him out
of the Temple. And to this head are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
all the assistances which God stirreth up for
deliverance of his People against the fury of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors.
He raiseth <hi>up Saviours</hi> or Believers
<hi>on Mount Sion, to judge the Mount of Edom;</hi> so
Rev. 12. 16. The Dragon, and those acting under
him, spirited by him, were in a furious endeavour
for the destruction of the Church; God stirs up
the <hi>Earth</hi> to her assistance, even men of the world,
not engaged with others in the design of Satan,
and by their opposition hinders them from the
execution of their designed rage. Of this nature,
seems to be that dealing of God with his own
People, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 6, 7. They were in the pursuit
of their iniquities, following after their Lovers;
God leaves them for a while to act in the folly of
their spirits, but he sets a <hi>hedge,</hi> and a <hi>wall</hi> before
them that they shall not be able to fulfill their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
and lusts.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God obviates the accomplishment of
conceived sin, by removing, or taking away the
<hi>ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ects</hi> on whom, or about whom, the sin conceived
was to be committed. <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 11. yields us a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Instance of this issue of Providence: When
the day was coming wherein <hi>Herod</hi> thought to
have slain <hi>Peter</hi> who was shut up in Prison, God
sends and takes him away from their rage and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42900:104"/>
lying in wait. So also was our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself
taken away from the murderous rage of the <hi>Jews</hi>
before his hour was come, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 59. chap. 10, 39.
Both <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>latter</hi> times are full of stories to
this purpose: Prison-doors have been opened, and
poor Creatures appointed to die have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
rescued from the Jaws of death. In the
World it self amongst the men thereof, Adulterers
and Adulteresses, the sin of the one is often hindred
and stifled by the taking away of the other. So
<hi>wings</hi> were given to the <hi>woman</hi> to carry her into
the Wilderness and to disappoint the World in the
execution of their rage, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, God doth this by some eminent <hi>diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
of the thoughts of Men who had conceived
sin; <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 24. The <hi>Brethren of Joseph</hi> cast him
into a pit, with an intent to famish him there;
whilest they were as it seems, pleasing themselves
with what they had done, God orders a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Merchants to come by, and diverts their
thoughts with that new <hi>object</hi> from the <hi>killing,</hi> to
the <hi>selling</hi> of their Brother, <hi>vers.</hi> 26, 27. And how
far therein they were subservient to the infinitely
wise Counsel of God, we know. Thus also when
<hi>Saul</hi> was in the pursuit of <hi>David,</hi> and was even
ready to prevail against him to his destruction.
God stirs up the <hi>Philistins</hi> to invade the Land,
which both diverted his thoughts, and drew
the course of his actings another way, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
27. 27.</p>
            <p>And these are <hi>some of the waies</hi> whereby God is
pleased to hinder the bringing forth of <hi>conceived
sin,</hi> by opposing himself and his Providence to the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42900:104"/>
               <hi>power of the sinning Creature.</hi> And we may a little
in our passage take a brief view of the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to Faith, and the Church of God, which
may be found in this matter. As,</p>
            <p>First, This may give us a little insight into the
ever to be adored Providence of God, by these and
the like waies in great variety obstructing the
breaking forth of sin in the World. It is he who
makes those dams, and shuts up those flood-gates
of corrupted Nature, that it shall not break forth
in a deluge of filthy Abominations to overwhelm
the Creation with confusion and disorder. As it was
of old, so it is at this day; <hi>Every thought and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of the heart of Man is evil, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi>
That all the Earth is not in all places
filled with violence, as it was of old, is meerly
from the mighty hand of God working effectually
for the obstructing of sin. From hence alone it is,
that the High-waies, Streets and Fields, are not all
filled with violence, blood, rapine, uncleanness,
and every villany that the heart of Man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
O the infinite beauty of divine Wisdom
and Providence in the government of the World!
For the Conservation of it asks daily no less pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and wisdom than the first making of it did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we will look to our own Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they will in a special manner inforce us
to adore the wisdom and efficacy of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, in stopping the progress of <hi>conceived
sin.</hi> That we are at peace in our Houses, at rest
in our Beds, that we have any quiet iu our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
is from hence alone: Whose Person
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42900:105"/>
would not be defiled, or destroyed? whose Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
would not be ruined? whose blood almost
would not be shed, if wicked Men had power to
perpetrate all their conceived sin? It may be the
ruine of some of us hath been conceived a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times. We are beholding to this Providence
of obstructing sin, for our Lives, our Families,
our Estates, our Liberties, for whatsoever is, or
may be dear unto us. For may we not say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 57. 4. <hi>My Soul is
among Lyons, and I lie even among them that are set
on fire, even the sons of Men, whose teeth are spears
and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.</hi> And
how is the deliverance of Men contrived from
such Persons, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 6. <hi>God breaks their teeth
in their mouths, even the great teeth of the young
Lyons.</hi> He keeps this fire from burning, or
quencheth it when it's ready to break out into a
flame. He breaks their spears and arrows, so
that sometimes we are not so much as wounded
by them: Some he cuts off and destroyes, some
he cuts short in their power, some he deprives of
the Instruments whereby alone they can work,
some he prevents of their desired opportunities, or
diverts by other objects for their lusts, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
causeth them to spend them among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
one upon another. We may say therefore
with the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 104. 24. <hi>O Lord, how
manifold are thy works, in wisdom hast thou made
them all, the Earth is full of thy Riches;</hi> and with
the Prophet, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>Who is wise and he shall
understand these things, prudent and he shall know
them; all the waies of the Lord are right, and the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42900:105"/>
Just shall walk in them, but the Transgressors shall
fall therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, If these and the like are the ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God obviates the bringing forth of conceived
sin in wicked Men, we may learn hence how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
their condition is, and in what perpetual
<hi>torment</hi> for the most part they spend their daies:
They are like a <hi>troubled Sea,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>that
cannot rest.</hi> As they endeavour that others may
have no peace, so it is certain that themselves have
not any; the principle of sin is not impaired nor
weakned in them, the will of sinning is not taken
away: They have a <hi>Womb of sin</hi> that is able to
<hi>conceive</hi> Monsters every moment. Yea, for the
most part they are forging and framing folly all the
day long: One lust or other they are contriving
how to satisfie; they are either devouring by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and revenge, or vitiating by uncleanness, or
trampling on by ambition, or swallowing down by
covetousness all that stand before them. Many of
their follies and mischiefs they bring to the very
birth, and are in pain to be delivered; but God eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day fills them with disappointment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>shuts up
the womb</hi> of sin. Some are filled with hatred of Gods
people all their daies, and never once have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to exercise it. So <hi>David</hi> describes them,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 59. 6. <hi>They return at evening, they make a
noise like a Dog, and go round about the City.
They go up and down and belch out with their
mouths, swords are in their lips;</hi> Vers. 7. and yet are
not able to accomplish their designs: What tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
do such poor creatures live in? Envy, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
wrath, revenge, devour their hearts by
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42900:106"/>
not getting vent. And when God hath exercised
the other acts of his wise Providence in cutting
short their power, or opposing a greater power
to them when nothing else will doe, he cuts them
off in their sins, and to the grave they go full of
purposes of Iniquity. Others are no less hurryed
and diverted by the power of other lusts which
they are not able to satisfie: This is the sore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
they are exercised with, all their dayes. If
they accomplish their designs, they are more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and hellish than before; and if they do not,
they are filled whith vexation and discontentment.
This is the portion of them who know not the
Lord, nor the power of his grace. Envy not
their condition, notwithstanding their outward
glittering shew, their hearts are full of anxiety
trouble and sorrow.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Do we see sometimes the flood-gates
of Mens lusts and rage set open against the
Church, and interest of it, and doth prevalency
attend them, and power is for a season on their
side, let not the Saints of God despond. He hath
unspeakably various and effectual wayes for the
<hi>stifling of their conceptions</hi> to give them dry breasts
and a miscarrying womb. He can stop their fury
when he pleaseth; <hi>Surely,</hi> saith <hi>David, the wrath
of Man shall praise thee, the remainder of wrath
shalt thou restrain,</hi> Psal. 76. 10. When so much of
their wrath is let out as shall exalt his praise, he
can when he pleaseth set up a power greater than
the combined strength of all sinning Creatures,
and restrain the remainder of the wrath that they
had conceived. He <hi>shall cut off the spirit of Princes,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42900:106"/>
He is terrible to the Kings of the earth,</hi> v. 12. Some
he will cut off and destroy, some he will terrifie
and affright, and prevent the rage of all. He can
knock them on the head, or break out their
teeth, or chain up their wrath, and who can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Those who have received benefit by any
of the waies mentioned, may know to whom
they owe their preservation, and not look on it
as a common thing. When you have <hi>conceived sin,</hi>
hath God weakened your power for sin, or denied
you opportunity, or took away the object of your
lusts, or diverted your thoughts by new Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
know assuredly that you have received
mercy thereby. Though God deal not these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
alwaies in a subserviency to the Covenant
of Grace, yet there is always <hi>mercy</hi> in them, always
a call in them to consider the Author of them.
Had not God thus dealt with you, it may be this
day you ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> been a terrour to your selves, a shame
to your relations, and under the punishment due
to some notorious sins which you had <hi>conceived.</hi>
Besides, there is commonly an <hi>additional guilt</hi> in
sin brought forth, above what is in the meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of it. It may be others would have been
ruined by it here, or drawn into a partnership in
sin by it, and so have been eternally ruined by it, all
which are prevented by these providences, and
Eternity will witness, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> there is a singularity of
mercy in them. Do not look then on any such
things as common accidents, the hand of God is
in them all; and that a merciful hand if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised:
if it be, yet God doth good to others by it,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42900:107"/>
the World is the better, and you are not so wicked
as you would be.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, We may also see hence the great use of
<hi>Magistracie</hi> in the world, that great appointment
of God. Amongst other things, it is peculiarly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to this holy Providence, in obstructing
the bringing forth of <hi>conceived sin;</hi> namely by the
terrour of him that bears the sword. God fixes
that on the hearts of evil men which he expresseth,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>If thou do that which is evil, be afraid,
for the power beareth not the sword in vain, for he
is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath
on them that do evil.</hi> God fixes this on the hearts
of men, and by the dread and terrour of it <hi>closeth
the womb of sin,</hi> that it shall not bring forth. When
there was <hi>no King in Israel,</hi> none to put to rebuke,
and none of whom evil men were afraid, there
was woful work and havock amongst the children
of men made in the world; as we may see in the
last Chapters of the book of <hi>Judges.</hi> The greatest
mercies and blessings that in this world we are
made partakers of, next to them of the Gospel
and Covenant of Grace, come to us through this
channel and conduit. And indeed, this whereof
we have been speaking, is the proper work of
<hi>Magistracy,</hi> namely to be subservient to the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God in obstructing the bringing forth of
conceived sin.</p>
            <p>These then are some of the waies whereby God
<hi>providentially</hi> prevents the <hi>bringing forth of sin,</hi> by
opposing obstacles to the <hi>power</hi> of the sinner. And
by them sin is not consumed, but shut up in the
womb. Men are not burthened <hi>for</hi> it, but <hi>with</hi> it;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42900:107"/>
not laden in their hearts and consciences with its
<hi>guilt,</hi> but perplexed with it <hi>power,</hi> which they
are not able to exert and satisfie.</p>
            <p>The way that yet remains for consideration
whereby God obviates the production of <hi>conceived
sin,</hi> is his working on the <hi>Will</hi> of the sinners, so
making sin to consume away in the womb.</p>
            <p>There are two waies in general whereby God
thus prevents the bringing forth of conceived sin,
by working <hi>on the will of the sinner;</hi> and they are,
first, by <hi>Restraining Grace:</hi> secondly, by <hi>Renewing
Grace.</hi> He doth it sometimes the one way, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the other. The first of these is common to
regenerate and unregenerate persons, the latter
peculiar to believers; and God doth it variously
as to particulars by them both. We shall begin
with the first of them.</p>
            <p>First, God doth this in the way of restraining
grace by some <hi>arrow of particular conviction,</hi> fixed
in the heart and conscience of the sinner, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
unto the particular sin which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
This staggers and changes the mind, as
to the particular intended, causeth the hands to
hang down, and the weapons of lust to fall out of
them. Hereby <hi>conceived sin</hi> proves abortive. How
God doth this work, by what immediate touches,
strokes, blows, rebukes of his Spirit; by what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings,
arguments, and commotions of mens
own consciences, is not for us throughly to find
out. It is done, as was said, in unspeakable variety,
and the works of God are past finding out. But as
to what light may be given unto it from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
instances, after we have manifested the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42900:108"/>
general way of Gods procedure, it shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on.</p>
            <p>Thus then God dealt in the case of <hi>Esau</hi> and
<hi>Jacob. Esau</hi> had long conceived his brothers death,
he comforted himself with the thoughts of it, and
resolutions about it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 41. As is the manner
of profligate sinners. Upon his first opportunity
he comes forth to execute his intended rage, and
<hi>Jacob</hi> concludes that he would <hi>smite the mother
with the children,</hi> Gen. 32. 11. An opportunity is
presented unto this wicked and profane person,
to <hi>bring forth that sin</hi> that had laid in his heart
now <hi>twenty years;</hi> he hath full power in his hand
to perform his purpose. In the midst of this posture
of things, God comes in upon his heart with some
secret and effectual working of his Spirit and
power, changeth him from his purpose, causeth
his conceived sin to melt away, that he falls upon
the neck of him with embraces, whom he thought
to have slain.</p>
            <p>Of the same nature, though the way of it was
peculiar, was his dealing with <hi>Laban</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> in
reference to the same <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 31. 24. By a
dream, a vision in the night, God hinders him
from so much as speaking roughly to him. It was
with him as in <hi>Micah</hi> 2. 1. he had devised evil on
his bed, and when he thought to have practised
it in the morning, God interposed in a dream,
and hides sin from him, as he speaks, <hi>Job</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, 15, 16,
17. To the same purpose is that of the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
concerning the people of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 46. <hi>He
made them to be pitied of all those who carried
them captives.</hi> Men usually deal in rigour with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42900:108"/>
those whom they have taken captive in war. It
was the way of old to rule captives with force and
cruelty. Here God turns and changes their hearts,
not in general unto himself, but to this particular
of respect to his people. And this way in general
doth God every day prevent the bringing forth of
a world of sin. He <hi>sharpens arrows</hi> of conviction
upon the spirits of men, as to the particular that
they are engaged in. Their <hi>hearts</hi> are not
changed as to sin, but their <hi>minds</hi> are altered as to
this or that sin. They break, it may be, the vessel
they had fashioned, and go to work upon some
other. Now that we may a little see into the waies
whereby God doth accomplish this work, we
must premise the ensuing considerations.</p>
            <p>First, That the general <hi>medium</hi> wherein the
matter of <hi>restraining grace</hi> doth consist, whereby
God thus prevents the bringing forth of sin, doth
lie in certain <hi>Arguments</hi> and Reasonings, presented
to the mind of the sinner, whereby he is induced to
desert his purpose, to change and alter his mind,
as to the sin he had conceived. Reasons against it
are presented unto him, which prevail upon him
to relinquish his design, and give over his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
This is the general way of the working
of restraining grace, it is by <hi>arguments</hi> and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
rising up against the perpetration of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That no <hi>Arguments</hi> or Reasonings,
as such, <hi>materially</hi> considered, are sufficient to stop
or hinder any purpose of sinning, or to cause con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
sin to prove abortive, if the sinner have
power and opportunity to bring it forth. They
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42900:109"/>
are not in themselves, and on their own account
<hi>restraining grace;</hi> for if they were, the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Communication of grace, as grace, were
left unto every man who is able to give advice
against sin. Nothing is nor can be called <hi>grace,</hi>
though common, and such as may perish, but with
respect unto its peculiar relation to God. God by
the power of his Spirit making <hi>arguments</hi> and
reasons effectual and prevailing, turns that to be
<hi>grace,</hi> I mean of this kind, which in it self, and in
its own nature was bare reason. And that efficacy
of the Spirit, which the Lord puts forth in these
perswasions and motives is that which we call
<hi>restraining grace.</hi> These things being premised, we
shall now consider some of the <hi>Arguments</hi> which
we find that he hath made use of to this end and
purpose.</p>
            <p>First, God stops many men in their waies upon
the conception of sin, by an argument taken from
the <hi>difficulty,</hi> if not impossibility of doing that they
aim at. They have a mind unto it, but God sets
an hedge and a wall before them, that they shall
judge it to be so hard and <hi>difficult</hi> to accomplish
what they intend, that it is better for them to let
it alone and give over. Thus <hi>Herod</hi> would have
put <hi>John Baptist</hi> to death upon the first provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but he <hi>feared the multitude,</hi> because they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
him as a <hi>Prophet, Matth.</hi> 14. 5. He had
conceived his murder, and was free for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. God raised this consideration in his
heart, If I kill him, the people will tumultuate,
he hath a great party amongst them, and sedition
will arise that may cost me my life, or Kingdom.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42900:109"/>
He <hi>feared the multitude,</hi> and durst not execute the
wickedness he had conceived, because of the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty</hi>
he fore-saw he should be entangled withal.
And God made the argument effectual for the
season; for otherwise we know that men will
venture the utmost hazards for the satisfaction of
their lusts; as he also did afterwards. The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi>
were in the very same state and condition,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 26. they would fain have decried the
Ministry of <hi>John,</hi> but durst not for fear of the
people: and <hi>ver.</hi> 46. of the same Chapter, by the
same argument were they deterred from <hi>killing our
Saviour,</hi> who had highly provoked them by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
setting out their deserved and approaching
destruction. They durst not do it for <hi>fear of a
tumult</hi> among the people, seeing they looked on
him as a Prophet. Thus God over-awes the
hearts of innumerable persons in the world every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and causeth them to desist from attempting
to bring forth the sins which they had conceived.
<hi>Difficulties</hi> they shall be sure to meet withal, yea,
it is likely, if they should attempt it, it would
prove impossible for them to accomplish. We owe
much of our <hi>quiet</hi> in this world, unto the efficacy
given to this consideration in the hearts of men
by the Holy Ghost: Adulteries, rapins, murders,
are obviated and stifled by it. Men would engage
into them daily, but that they judge it impossible
for them to fulfill what they aim at.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God doth it by an Argument taken
<hi>ab incommodo,</hi> from the <hi>inconveniencies,</hi> evils, and
troubles that will befall men in the pursuit of sin.
If they follow it, this or that <hi>inconvenience</hi> will
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42900:110"/>
ensue; this trouble, this evil, temporal or eternal.
And this Argument, as managed by the Spirit of
God, is the great engine in his hand whereby he
casts up banks, and gives bounds to the lusts of
men, that they break not out to the confusion of all
that order and beauty which yet remains in the
works of his hands. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us the general im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of this argument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>For when the
Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the
things contained in the Law, these having not the
Law, are a Law unto themselves, which shew the
work of the Law written in their hearts, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
also bearing witness, and their thoughts the
mean while accusing, or else excusing one another.</hi> If
any men in the world may be thought to be given
up to pursue and fulfill all the sins that their lusts
can conceive, it is those that <hi>have not the Law,</hi> to
whom the written Law of God doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the evil that attends it. But though they
have it not, saith the Apostle, they <hi>shew forth the
work of it,</hi> they do many things which it requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and forbear or abstain from many things that
it forbiddeth, and so shew forth its work and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.
But whence is it that they so do? Why
their <hi>thoughts accuse or excuse them.</hi> It is from the
consideration and arguings that they have within
themselves about sin, and its <hi>consequents,</hi> which
prevail upon them to abstain from many things
that their hearts would carry them out unto. For
<hi>Conscience</hi> is a mans prejudging of himself, with
respect unto the future judgement of God. Thus
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> was staggered in his pursuit of sin, when he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching of righteousness and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42900:110"/>
judgement to come, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. So <hi>Job</hi> tells us,
that the consideration of <hi>punishment from God,</hi>
hath a strong influence on the minds of men to
keep them from sin, <hi>chap.</hi> 31. 1, 2, 3. How the
Lord makes use of that consideration, even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his own, when they have broken the cords
of his love, and cast off the rule of his grace for
a season, I have before declared.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God doth this same work, by making
effectual an <hi>Argument, ab inutili,</hi> from the <hi>unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableness</hi>
of the thing that men are engaged in.
By this were the <hi>Brethren</hi> of <hi>Joseph</hi> stayed from
slaying him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 26, 27. <hi>What profit is it,</hi> say
they, <hi>if we slay our Brother and conceal his blood?</hi>
We shall get nothing by it, it will bring in no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
or satisfaction unto us. And the heads of
this way of Gods obstructing conceived sin, or the
springs of these kinds of Arguments, are so many
and various, that it is impossible to insist particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
upon them. There is nothing present, or to
come, nothing belonging to this life, or another,
nothing desirable or undesirable, nothing good or
evil, but at one time or another, an Argument
may be taken from it for the obstructing of sin.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God accomplisheth this work by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>
taken <hi>ab honesto,</hi> from what is <hi>good</hi> and
<hi>honest,</hi> what is comely, praise-worthy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
unto himself. This is the great road
wherein he walks with the Saints under their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
or in their conceptions of sin. He reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
effectually upon their minds a consideration
of all those springs and motives to obedience,
which are discovered and proposed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42900:111"/>
some at one time, some at another. He minds
them of his own love, mercy, and kindness; his
<hi>eternal Love,</hi> with the fruits of it, whereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have been made partakers. He minds them
of the <hi>blood of his Son,</hi> his Cross, sufferings, tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
undertaking in the work of mediation,
and the concernment of his Heart, Love, Honour,
Name, in their obedience. Minds them of the
<hi>Love of the Spirit,</hi> with all his Consolations which
they have been made partakers of, and priviledges
wherewith by him they have been entrusted.
Minds them of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the glory and beauty of
it as revealed unto their souls. Minds them of the
excellency and comeliness of <hi>Obedience,</hi> of their
performance of that duty they owe to God, that
peace, quietness, and serenity of mind that they
have enjoyed therein. On the other side, he minds
them of being a <hi>provocation by sin</hi> unto the eyes of
his glory, saying in their hearts, <hi>Do not that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
thing which my soul hateth.</hi> Minds them
of their <hi>wounding</hi> the Lord Christ, and putting
him to shame; of their <hi>grieving</hi> the holy Spirit,
whereby they are sealed to the day of redemption;
of their <hi>defiling</hi> his dwelling place. Minds them
of the reproach, dishonours, scandal which they
bring on the Gospel and the profession thereof.
Minds them of the <hi>terrours,</hi> darkness, wounds,
want of peace, that they may bring upon their
own souls. From these and the like considerations
doth God put a stop to the progress of the Law
of sin in the heart, that it shall not go on to <hi>bring
forth</hi> the evil which it hath conceived. I could
give instances in <hi>Arguments</hi> of all these several
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42900:111"/>
kinds recorded in the Scripture, but it would be
too long a work for us, who are now engaged in
a design of another nature. But one or two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
may be mentioned. <hi>Joseph</hi> resists his first
temptation on one of these accounts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9.
<hi>How can I do this great wickedness and sin against
God?</hi> The evil of <hi>sinning against God,</hi> his God,
that consideration alone detains him from the least
inclination to his temptation. It is <hi>sin against God</hi>
to whom I owe all obedience, the God of my life,
and of all my mercies, I will not do it. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
wherewith <hi>Abigail</hi> prevailed on <hi>David,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 31. to with-hold him from <hi>self-revenge</hi>
and murder, was of the same nature, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
that it was from the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 32.
I shall add no more, for all the Scripture motives
which we have to duty, made effectual by grace,
are instances of this way of Gods procedure.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, I confess, God secretly works the
hearts of men by his own finger, without the
use and means of such Arguments as those insisted
on, to stop the progress of sin. So he tells <hi>Abimelech,
Gen.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>I have with-held thee from sinning
against me.</hi> Now this could not be done by any of
the Arguments which we have insisted on, because
<hi>Abimelech</hi> knew not that the thing which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
was sin; and therefore he pleads that in the
<hi>integrity of his heart and innocency of his hands</hi>
he did it, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. God turned about his will and
thoughts, that he should not accomplish his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but by what waies or means is not revealed.
Nor is it evident what course he took in the
change of <hi>Esaus</hi> heart, when he came out against
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42900:112"/>
his Brother to destroy him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 4. whether
he stirr'd up in him a fresh spring of natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
or caused him to consider what grief by
this means he should bring to his aged Father,
who loved him so tenderly; or whether being
now grown great and wealthy, he more and more
despised the matter of difference between him and
his Brother, and so utterly slighted it, it is not
known. It may be God did it by an <hi>immediate</hi>
powerful act of his Spirit upon his heart, without
the actual intervening of any of these or the like
considerations. Now though the things mentioned
are in themselves at other times <hi>feeble</hi> and weak,
yet when they are managed by the Spirit of God
to such an end and purpose, they certainly become
<hi>effectual,</hi> and are the matter of his <hi>preventing
grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, God prevents the bringing forth of
conceived sin by <hi>real spiritual saving grace,</hi> &amp; that
either in the first conversion of sinners, or in the
following supplies of it. This is one part of the
mysterie of his grace and love. He meets men
sometimes in their highest resolutions for sin, with
the highest efficacy of his grace. Hereby he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifests
the <hi>power</hi> of his own grace, and gives the
soul a farther experience of the <hi>Law of sin,</hi> when
it takes such a fare-well of it, as to be changed
in the midst of its resolutions to serve the lusts
thereof. By this he melts down the lusts of men,
causeth them to wither at the root, that they shall
no more strive to bring forth what they have
<hi>conceived,</hi> but be filled with shame and sorrow at
their conception. An example and instance of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42900:112"/>
proceeding of God, for the use and instruction of
all generations we have in <hi>Paul.</hi> His heart was
full of wickedness, blasphemy, and persecution;
his conception of them was come unto rage and
madness, and a full purpose of exercising them all
to the utmost; so the story relates it, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. so
himself declares the state to have been with him,
<hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. In the
midst of all this violent pursuit of sin, a <hi>voice from
heaven</hi> shuts up the womb, and dries the breasts
of it, and he cries, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to
do?</hi> Acts 9. 6. The same person seems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that this is the way of Gods procedure
with others, even to meet them with his <hi>convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grace</hi> in the height of their sin and folly, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
1. 16. For <hi>he himself,</hi> he saies, was a pattern of Gods
dealing with others; as he dealt with him, so also
would he do with some such like sinners. <hi>For this
cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ
might shew forth all long-suffering, as a pattern to
them which should here after believe on him to life
everlasting.</hi> And we have not a few examples
of it in our own daies. Sundry persons on set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
going to this or that place, to deride and
scoff at the dispensation of the Word, have been
met withal in the very place wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to serve their lusts and Satan, and have been
cast down at the foot of God. This way of Gods
dealing with sinners is at large set forth, <hi>Job</hi> 33.
15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite</hi> is another
instance of this work of Gods grace and love. <hi>Paul</hi>
is dragged either <hi>by</hi> him, or <hi>before</hi> him, to plead for
his life, as a setter forth of <hi>strange gods,</hi> which at
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42900:113"/>
               <hi>Athens</hi> was death by the Law. In the midst o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
this frame of spirit God meets with him by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
grace,</hi> sin withers in the womb, and he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
cleaves to <hi>Paul</hi> and his doctrine, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 18--34.
The like dispensation towards <hi>Israel</hi> we have, <hi>Hos.</hi>
11. 7, 8, 9, 10. But there is no need to insist on
more instances of this observation. God is pleased
to leave no Generation unconvinced of this truth,
if they do but attend to their own experiences,
and the examples of this work of his mercy
amongst them. Every day, one or other, is taken
in the fulness of the purpose of his heart to go on
in sin, in this or that sin, and is stopt in his course
by the power of <hi>converting grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, God doth it by the same grace in the
<hi>renewed communications</hi> of it, that is, by special
<hi>assisting grace.</hi> This is the common way of his
dealing with <hi>Believers</hi> in this case. That they also
through the deceitfulness of sin, may be carryed
on to the conceiving of this or that sin, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
declared. God puts a stop to their progress,
or rather to the prevalency of the Law of sin in
them, and that by giving in unto them special
assistances needful for their preservation and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
As <hi>David</hi> saies of himself, <hi>Psa.</hi> 73. 2. <hi>His
feet were almost gone, his steps had well nigh slipt;</hi>
he was at the very brink of unbelieving, despairing
thoughts, and conclusions about Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the government of the world; from
whence he was recovered, as he afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares.
So is it with many a Believer, he is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at the very brink, at the very door of some
folly or iniquity, when God puts in by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42900:113"/>
of <hi>actually assisting grace,</hi> and recovers them
to an obediential frame of heart again. And this is a
peculiar work of Christ, wherein he manifests and
exerts his faithfulness towards his own. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 18.
<hi>He is able to succour them that are tempted.</hi> It is not
an absolute power, but a power cloathed with
mercy, that is intended. Such a power as is put
forth from a sense of the suffering of poor Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
under their temptations. And how doth
he exercise this <hi>merciful ability</hi> towards us? <hi>chap.</hi>
4. 16. He gives forth, and we find in him <hi>Grace
to help in a time of need;</hi> seasonable help and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
for our deliverance, when we are ready to
be over-powered by sin and temptation. When
<hi>lust hath conceived,</hi> and is ready to <hi>bring forth,</hi>
when the soul lies at the brink of some iniquity,
he gives in <hi>seasonable help,</hi> relief, deliverance, and
safety. Here lies a great part of the care and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of Christ towards his poor Saints: he will
not suffer them to be worried with the power
of sin, nor to be carried out unto waies that shall
dishonour the Gospel, or fill them with shame and
reproach, and so render them useless in the world;
but he steps in with the saving relief and <hi>assistance</hi>
of his grace, stops the course of sin, and makes
them <hi>in himself more than conquerors.</hi> And this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
lies under the Promise, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>There
hath no temptation taken you but such as is common
to man, but God is faithful who will not suffer you to
be tempted above that you are able, but will with the
temptation also make a way to escape, that you may
be able to bear it.</hi> Temptation shall try us, it is
for our good; many holy ends doth the Lord
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42900:114"/>
compass and bring about by it. But when we are
tried to the utmost of our ability, so that one as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
more would over-bear us, a <hi>way of escape</hi> is
provided. And as this may be done several waies,
as I have else-where declared, so this we are now
upon is one of the most eminent, namely by <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of grace,</hi> to enable the soul to bear up, resist,
and conquer. And when once God begins to
deal in this way of love with a soul, he will not
cease to add one supply after another, until the
whole work of his grace and faithfulness be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished.
An example hereof we have, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.
17, 18. poor sinners there are so far captivated
to the power of their lusts that the first and second
dealings of God with them are not effectual for
their delivery; but he will not give over, he is in
the pursuit of a design of love towards them, and
so ceaseth not until they are recovered. These are
the general heads of the second way whereby God
hinders the bringing forth of conceived sin, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by working on the <hi>Will</hi> of the sinner. He doth
it either by <hi>common convictions,</hi> or <hi>special grace,</hi> so
that of their own accord they shall let go the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and will of sinning, that they are risen up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And this is no mean way of his providing for
his own glory, and the honour of his Gospel in the
world, whose Professors would stain the whole
beauty of it, were they left to themselves to bring
forth all the evil that is <hi>conceived</hi> in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Besides these <hi>general</hi> waies, there is one yet more
<hi>special,</hi> that at once worketh both upon the <hi>Power</hi>
and <hi>Will</hi> of the sinner; and this is the way of
<hi>afflictions,</hi> concerning which one word shall close
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42900:114"/>
this discourse. <hi>Afflictions,</hi> I say, work by both
these ways, in reference unto <hi>conceived sin.</hi> They
work <hi>providentially</hi> on the <hi>power</hi> of the creature.
When a man hath conceived a sin, and is in full
purpose of the pursuit of it, God oftentimes sends
a <hi>sickness</hi> and abates his strength; or a <hi>loss</hi> cuts him
short in his plenty, and so takes him off from the
pursuit of his lusts, though it may be his heart is
not weaned from them. His <hi>power</hi> is weakned,
and he cannot do the evil he would. In this sense
it belongs to the first way of Gods obviating the
production of sin. Great <hi>afflictions</hi> work some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
not from their own nature immediately and
directly, but from the gracious purpose and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
of him that sends them. He insinuates
into the dispensation of them that of grace and
power, of love and kindness, which shall effectually
take off the heart and mind from sin. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 67.
<hi>Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now have I
learned thy commandments.</hi> And in this way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the predominancy of renewing and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
grace, they belong unto the latter means of
preventing sin.</p>
            <p>And these are some of the ways, whereby it
pleaseth God to put a stop to the <hi>progress of sin,</hi>
both in Believers and Unbelievers, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
we shall instance in; and if we would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
farther to search out his ways unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
yet we must still conclude that it is but a
<hi>little portion which we know of him.</hi>

of sin hath in all Ages given of its power and
efficacy, by the woful fruits that it hath brought
forth, even in Believers themselves. Now these
are of two sorts. First, the great <hi>actual eruptions</hi>
of sin in their Lives. Secondly, Their <hi>habitual
declensions</hi> from the frames, state and condition of
Obedience and Communion with God, which
they had obtained, both which by the Rule of
<hi>James</hi> before unfolded, are to be laid to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this Law of sin, and belong unto the
fourth head of its progress, and are both of them
convincing evidences of its power and efficacy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Consider the fearful <hi>Eruptions</hi> of actual
sins that have been in the Lives of Believers, and
we shall find our Position evidenced. Should I
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42900:115"/>
go through at large with this Consideration, I
must recount all the sad and scandalous failings of
the Saints that are left on record in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But the particulars of them are known to
all; so that I shall not need to mention them, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the many aggravations that in their circumstances
they are attended with: Only some few things
tending to the rendring of our present conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of them useful, may be remarked. As,</p>
            <p>First, They are most of them in the Lives of
men that were not of the <hi>lowest form</hi> or ordinary
sort of Believers, but of men that had a peculiar
<hi>eminency</hi> in them on the account of their walking
with God in their Generation. Such were <hi>Noah,
Lot, David, Hezekiah,</hi> and others. They were
not men of an ordinary size, but higher than their
Brethren by the shoulders and upwards in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
yea in real Holiness. And surely that
must needs be of a mighty efficacy that could hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
such <hi>Giants</hi> in the wayes of God into such
abominable sins as they fell into. An ordinary
Engine could never have turned them out of the
course of their obedience. It was a poyson that
no <hi>Athletick</hi> constitution of spiritual health, no
<hi>Antidote</hi> could withstand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And these very men, fell not into
their great sins at the <hi>beginning of their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
when they had had but little experience of the
goodness of God, of the sweetness and pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Obedience, of the power and craft of sin,
of its impulsions, solicitations and surprizals, but
after a long course of walking with God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with all these things; together with
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42900:116"/>
innumerable motives unto <hi>watchfulness. Noah</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the lives of men in those dayes of the
World, had walked uprightly with God some
<hi>hundreds of years</hi> before he was so surprised as he
was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. Righteous <hi>Lot</hi> seems to have been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of his days, ere he defiled himself
with the abominations recorded. <hi>David</hi> in a short
Life, had as much experience of Grace and Sin,
and as much close spiritual Communion with God
as ever had any of the Sons of men, before he was
cast to the ground by this Law of sin. So was it
with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his degree, which was none of
the meanest. Now to set upon such persons, so
well acquainted with its power and deceit, so
armed and provided against it, that had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
over it for so many years, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
against them, it argues a power and efficacy
too <hi>mighty</hi> for every thing but the spirit of the
<hi>Almighty</hi> to withstand. Who can look to have a
greater stock of <hi>Inherent Grace</hi> than those men
had; to have more experience of God, and the
excellency of his wayes, the sweetness of his love,
and of communion with him than they had; who
hath either better furniture to oppose sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
or more obligation so to do, than they? and
yet we see how fearfully they were prevailed
against.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As if God had permitted their Falls
on set purpose, that we might learn to be wary
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his powerful enemy, they all of them fell out
when they had <hi>newly received great &amp; stupendious
mercies</hi> from the hand of God, that ought to have
been strong Obligations unto diligence and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42900:116"/>
in close obedience. <hi>Noah</hi> was but newly
come forth of that <hi>world of waters</hi> wherein he saw
the ungodly world perishing for their sins, and
himself preserved by that astonishable Miracle
which all Ages must admire: Whilest the Worlds
desolation, was an hourly remembrancer unto him
of his strange preservation by the immediate care
and hand of God, he falls into <hi>Drunkenness. Lot</hi>
had newly seen that which every one that thinks
on cannot but tremble. He saw, as one speaks,
<hi>Hell coming out of Heaven</hi> upon unclean sinners,
the greatest evidence, except the Cross of Christ;
that God ever gave in his Providence of the
Judgment to come. He saw himself and Children
delivered by the special care and miraculous hand
of God; and yet whilest these strange mercies
were fresh upon him, he fell into <hi>Drunkenness and
Incest. David</hi> was delivered out of all his troubles
and had the necks of his Enemies given him round
about, and he makes use of his Peace from a
world of tryals and troubles to contrive <hi>Murder
and Adultery.</hi> Immediately, it was, after <hi>Hezekiahs</hi>
great and miraculos deliverance that he falls into
his <hi>carnal pride and boasting.</hi> I say, their falls in
such seasons, seem to be permitted on set purpose,
to instruct us all in the Truth that we have in
hand; so that no persons, in no seasons, with wht<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
furniture of Grace soever, can promise themselves
security from its prevalency, any other wayes,
than by keeping close constantly to him, who hath
supplies to give out that are above its reach and
efficacy. Methinks this should make us look
about us. Are we better than <hi>Noah,</hi> who had that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42900:117"/>
testimony from God, that he was a <hi>perfect man in
his Generation, and walked with God?</hi> Are we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than <hi>Lot,</hi> whose Righteous Soul was vexed
with the evil deeds of ungodly men, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
commended by the Holy Ghost? Are we more
holy, wise, and watchful than <hi>David,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this testimony, that he was <hi>a man after
Gods own heart?</hi> Or better than <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who
appealed to God himself, that he had served him
uprightly with a perfect heart? and yet what
prevalency this Law of sin wrought in and over
them, we see. And there is no end of the like
examples; they are all set up as <hi>Buoys</hi> to discover
unto us the Sands, the Shelves, the Rocks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they made their shipwrack, to their hazard,
danger, loss, yea and would have done to their
ruine, had not God been pleased in his faithfulness
graciously to prevent it. And this is the first par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of this Evidence of the power of sin, from its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It manifests its <hi>power</hi> in the <hi>habitua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
declensions</hi> from zeal &amp; holiness, from the frame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
state and condition of Obedience and Communion
with God, whereunto they had attained, which
are found in many Believers. <hi>Promises of growt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
and improvement are many, and precious; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>
and unspeakable: Yet it often falls out, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
hereof, decays and declensions are found
upon Professors, yea in and upon many of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>
principally and chiefly be from the strength an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
efficacy of indwelling sin, and is therefore a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:42900:117"/>
evidence thereof; I shall first evince the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it self to be true; namely, That some of the
<hi>Saints themselves</hi> do oftentimes so decline from
that growth &amp; pimrovement in faith, grace, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
which might justly be expected from them;
and then shew that the cause of this evil lies in
that, that we are treating of. And that it is the
cause of <hi>total Apostasie</hi> in unsound Professors, shall
be after declared. But this is a greater work
which we have in hand. The prevailing upon
<hi>true Believers</hi> unto a sinful declension &amp; <hi>gradual
Apostasie,</hi> requires a putting forth of more strength
and efficacy, than the prevailing upon <hi>unsound
Professors</hi> unto <hi>total Apostasie.</hi> As the wind which
will blow down a <hi>dead tree</hi> that hath no root, to
the ground, will scarcely shake or bow a living
<hi>well-rooted tree.</hi> But this it will do. There is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made in the Scripture of the First wayes of
<hi>David,</hi> and they are commended above <hi>his later,</hi>
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 3. The <hi>last wayes</hi> even of <hi>David</hi>
were tainted with the power of <hi>In-dwelling Sin.</hi>
Though we have mention only of the actual
eruption of sin, yet that uncleanness, and <hi>pride</hi>
which was working in him in his Numbring of
the People; were certainly rooted in a <hi>declension</hi>
from his first frame. Those rushes did not grow
without mire. <hi>David</hi> would not have done so in
his <hi>younger days,</hi> when he followed God in the
wilderness of temptations and tryals, full of faith,
love, humility, brokenness of heart, zeal, tender
affection unto all the Ordinances of God, all
which were eminent in him. But his strength is
impaired by the efficacy and deceitfulness of sin;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42900:118"/>
his <hi>Locks</hi> cut, and he becomes a prey to vile Lusts
and Temptations. We have a notable Instance
in most of the Churches that our Saviour awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
to the consideration of their condition, in the
Revelations: We may single out one of them:
Many good things there were in the Church of
<hi>Ephesus, Chap.</hi> 2. 2, 3. for which it is greatly
commended; but yet it is charged with a <hi>decay,</hi>
a <hi>declension,</hi> a gradual falling off and Apostasie,
<hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>Thou hast left thy first Love, remember
therefore whence thou art fallen, and do thy first
works.</hi> There was a decay both <hi>Inward</hi> in the
frame of heart, as to faith, and love, and <hi>outward</hi> as
to obedience and works, in comparison of what
they had formerly, by the testimony of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The same also might be shewed concerning
the rest of those <hi>Churches,</hi> only one or two of them
excepted. <hi>Five</hi> of them are charged with decays
and declensions. Hence there is mention in the
Scripture of the <hi>Kindness of Youth,</hi> of the <hi>Love
of Espousals,</hi> with great commendation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.
2, 3. of our <hi>first Faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 12. of the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our confidence, Heb.</hi> 3. 14. And cautions are
given, that we <hi>lose not the things that we have
wrought,</hi> 2 <hi>John</hi> 8. But what need we look
back or search for Instances to confirm the truth
of this Observation? An <hi>habitual declension</hi> from
first Ingagements unto God, from first Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Communion with God, from first strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Duties of Obedience, is ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
amongst Professors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Might we to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
take a general view of the Professors in these
Nations, among whom the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of us
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42900:118"/>
will be found in part or in whole, in somewhat
or in all, to fall, we might be plentifully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the truth of this Observation. Is their
<hi>Zeal</hi> for God as warm, living, vigorous, effectual,
solicitous, as it was in their first giving themselves
unto God? Or rather, is there not a common,
slight, selfish frame of spirit in the room of it come
upon most Professors? iniquity hath abounded,
and their love hath waxed cold. Was it not
of old a burthen to their spirits to hear the Name,
and wayes, and Worship of God blasphemed
and profaned? could they not have said with the
Psalmist, <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. 136. <hi>Rivers of water run down
our eyes because men keep not thy Law?</hi> Were not
their souls solicitous about the Interest of Christ
in the World, like <hi>Eli</hi>'s about the Ark? Did they
not contend earnestly for the <hi>Truth once delivered
to the Saints,</hi> and every parcel of it? especially
wherein the grace of God, and the glory of the
Gospel was especially concerned: Did they not
labour to judge and condemn the World by an
<hi>holy</hi> and <hi>separate</hi> conversation? And do now the
generality of Professors abide in this frame? have
they grown, and made improvement in it? or is
there not a coldness and indifferency grown upon
the spirits of many in this thing? Yea, do not
many despise all these things, and look upon their
own former Zeal, as folly? May we not see many
who have formerly been of esteem in ways of
Profession, become daily a scorn and reproach
through their miscarriages, and that justly, to the
men of the World? Is it not with them as it
was of old with the Daughters of <hi>Sion, (Isa.</hi> 3. 24.)
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42900:119"/>
when God judged them for their sins and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness?
Hath not the World, and <hi>self</hi> utterly
ruined their Profession? and are they not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of the things wherein they have formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
a singular concernment? Yea, are not <hi>some</hi>
come partly on one pretense, partly on another,
to an open <hi>enmity</hi> unto, and hatred of the wayes
of God? they please them no more, but are evil
in their eyes. But not to mention such <hi>open Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi>
any farther, whose Hypocrisie the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ortly judge; how is it with the
best? are not almost all men grown cold and slack
as to these things? are they not less concerned in
them than formerly? are they not grown weary,
selfish in their Religion, and so things be <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
well</hi> at home, scarce care how thy go abroad
in the world? At least do they not prefer their
ease, credit, safety, secular advantages before these
things? A frame that Christ abhors, and declares,
that those in whom it prevails are none of his:
Some indeed seem to retain a good zeal for Truth,
but wherein they make the fairest appearance,
therein will they be found to be most abominable:
They cry out against <hi>Errors,</hi> not for Truth, but
for Parties and Interests sake. Let a man be on
their <hi>Party,</hi> and promote their Interest, be he
never so <hi>corrupt</hi> in his Judgment, he is embraced,
and it may be admired. This is not <hi>zeal for God,</hi>
but for a mans self. It is not <hi>the Zeal of thine
House hath eaten me up,</hi> but, <hi>Master, forbid them
because they follow not with us.</hi> Better it were
doubtless for men never to pretend unto any <hi>Zeal</hi>
at all, than to substitute such warthful selfishness
in the room of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:42900:119"/>
Secondly, Is mens <hi>delight</hi> in the Ordinances
&amp; Worship of God the same as in former days?
Do they find the same sweetness and <hi>relish</hi> in them
as they have done of old? How <hi>precious</hi> hath the
<hi>Word</hi> been to them formerly? What joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
have they had in attendance thereon? How
would they have run and gone to have been made
partakers of it, where it was dispenced in its power
and purity, in the <hi>evidence and demonstration</hi> of
the Spirit? Did they not call the <hi>Sabbath</hi> their
delight, and was not the approach of it a real joy
unto their Souls? Did they not long after the
converse and communion of Saints? and could
they not undergo manifold perils for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it? And doth this frame still abide upon
them? are there not decays and declensions to
be found amongst them? May it not be said,
<hi>Gray hairs are here and there upon them, and they
perceive it not?</hi> Yea, are not men ready to say with
them of old, <hi>What a weariness is it? Mal.</hi> 1. 3.
It is even a <hi>burthen and a weariness</hi> to be tied up
to the observation of all these Ordinances. Wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
need we be all out so strict in the observation of
the <hi>Sabbath?</hi> What need we hear so often? What
need this distinction in hearing? Insensibly a great
disrespect, yea, even a contempt of the pleasant
and excellent ways of Christ and his Gospel, is
fallen upon many Professors.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, May not the same conviction be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
carried on, by an enquiry into the <hi>universal
course of obedience,</hi> and the performance of duties
that men have been engaged in. Is there the same
<hi>conscientious tenderness of sinning</hi> abiding in many
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42900:120"/>
as was in dayes of old? the same exact perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of <hi>private duties?</hi> The same love to the
brethren? the same readiness for the Cross? the
same humility of mind and spirit? the same self-denial?
The steam of mens lusts, wherewith the
air is tainted, will not suffer us so to say.</p>
            <p>We need then go no farther than this wretched
Generation wherein we live, to evince the truth
of the observation laid down, as the foundation of
the instance insisted on, the Lord give repentance
before it be too late.</p>
            <p>Now all these <hi>declensions,</hi> all these decays that
are found in some Professors, they all proceed from
this root and cause, they are all the product of
<hi>Indwelling sin,</hi> and all evince the exceeding power
and efficacy of it. For the proof whereof I shall
not need to go farther than the <hi>general rule</hi> which
out of <hi>James</hi> we have already considered; namely
that <hi>lust</hi> or indwelling sin, is the cause of all <hi>actual</hi>
sin, and all habitual declensions in Believers. This
is that which the Apostle intends in that place to
teach and declare. I shall therefore handle these
two things, and shew, First, That this doth evince
a great <hi>efficacy and power</hi> in sin. Secondly, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the ways and means whereby it <hi>brings forth</hi>
or brings about this cursed effect; all in design of
our general end, in calling upon and cautioning
Believers to avoid it, to oppose it.</p>
            <p>First, It appears to be a work of great <hi>power
and efficacy,</hi> from the provision that is made against
it, which it prevails over. There is in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace plentiful provision made, not only
for the preventing of <hi>declensions</hi> and decays in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42900:120"/>
but also for their continual carrying on
towards perfection. As,</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Word</hi> it self, and all the Ordinances
of the Gospel, are appointed and given unto us
for this end, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. That
which is the end of giving <hi>Gospel Officers</hi> to the
Church is the end also of giving all the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
to be administred by them. For they are
given <hi>for the work of the ministry,</hi> that is, for the
administration of the Ordinances of the Gospel.
Now what is, or what are these ends? They are
all for the preventing of decays and <hi>declensions</hi> in
the Saints, all for the carrying them onto Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
so it is said, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. In general it is <hi>for the
perfecting of the Saints,</hi> carrying on the work
of grace in them, and the work of holiness and
obedience by them; or for <hi>the edifying of the body
of Christ,</hi> their building up in an-encrease of faith
and love, even of every true member of the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
body. But how far are they appointed thus
to carry them on, thus to build them up? Hath
it bounds fixed to its work? doth it carry them
so far, and then leave them? No, saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>verse</hi> 13. The dispensation of the Word of the
Gospel, and the Ordinances thereof, is designed
for our help, assistance, and furtherance, until the
whole work of faith and obedience is consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.
It is appointed to <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> that
faith, knowledge, and growth in grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which is allotted unto us in this world. But
what and if oppositions and temptations do lie in
the way, <hi>Satan</hi> and his instruments working
with great subtilty and deceit? Why <hi>verse</hi> 14.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42900:121"/>
these <hi>Ordinances</hi> are designed for our safe-guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and deliverance from all their attempts and
assaults, that so being preserved in the use of them,
<hi>or speaking the truth in love, we may grow up unto
him in all things who is the head, even Christ Jesus.</hi>
This is in general the use of all <hi>Gospel Ordinances,</hi>
the chief and man end for which they were <hi>given</hi>
and appointed of God; namely to preserve Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
from all <hi>decays</hi> of faith and obedience, and
to carry them on still towards <hi>perfection.</hi> These are
means which God, the <hi>good Husbandman,</hi> makes
use of, to cause the <hi>Vine</hi> to thrive and bring forth
fruit. And I could also manifest the same to be the
especial end of them distinctly. Briefly, the <hi>Word</hi>
is <hi>milk</hi> and <hi>strong meat,</hi> for the nourishing and
strengthning of all sorts, and all degrees of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
It hath both <hi>seed</hi> and water in it, and
manuring with it, to make them fruitful. The
Ordinance of the <hi>Supper</hi> is appointed on purpose
for the <hi>strengthning</hi> of our faith in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the death of the Lord, and the exercise of
love one towards another. The <hi>communion of
Saints</hi> is for the edifying each other in faith, love,
and obedience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is that which adds weight to
this consideration. God suffers us not to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful</hi>
of this assistance he hath afforded us, but
is continually <hi>calling upon us</hi> to make use of the
means oppointed for the attaining of the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
He shews them unto us, as the <hi>Angel</hi>
shewed the water-spring to <hi>Hagar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Commands,
Exhortations, Promises, Threatnings, are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to this purpose; see them summed up,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42900:121"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1. He is continually saying to us, Why will
you die? why will you <hi>wither and decay?</hi> Come
to the <hi>Pastures</hi> provided for you, and your souls
shall live. If we see a <hi>Lamb</hi> run from the fold into
the Wilderness, we wonder not if it be torn and
rent of wild beasts: If we see a <hi>Sheep</hi> leaving its
<hi>green Pastures</hi> and water-courses, to abide in dry
barren <hi>Heaths,</hi> we count it no marvel, nor enquire
farther, if we see him lean and ready to perish.
But if we find <hi>Lambs</hi> wounded in the <hi>fold,</hi> we
wonder at the boldness and rage of the <hi>beasts
of prey,</hi> that durst set upon them there. If we see
<hi>Sheep</hi> pining in <hi>full pastures,</hi> we judge them to be
diseased and unsound. It is indeed no marvel that
poor creatures, who for sake their <hi>own mercies,</hi> and
run away from the pasture and fold of Christ in
his Ordinances, are rent and torn with divers
<hi>lusts,</hi> and do pine away with hunger and famine.
But to see men living under, and enjoying all the
means of spiritual <hi>thriving,</hi> yet to <hi>decay,</hi> not to be
fat and flourishing, but rather daily to pine and
wither, this argues some secret powerful distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
whose poisonous and noxious qualities hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the vertue and efficacy of the means they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.
This is <hi>Indwelling-sin.</hi> So wonderfully power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
so effectually <hi>poisonous</hi> it is, that it can bring
<hi>leanness</hi> on the souls of men in the midst of all
precious means of growth and flourishing. It may
well make us tremble to see men living under, and
in the use of the means of the Gospel, preaching,
praying, administration of Sacrameats, and yet
grow colder every day than other in zeal for
God, more selfish and worldly, even <hi>habitually,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42900:122"/>
to decline</hi> as to the degrees of holiness which they
had attained unto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Together with the dispensation of
the <hi>outward means</hi> of spiritual growth or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
there are also supplies of grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
afforded the <hi>Saints</hi> from their Head,
Christ Jesus. He is the Head of all the Saints. And
he is a <hi>living Head,</hi> and so a living Head, as that
he tells us, that <hi>because he liveth, we shall live also,
Joh.</hi> 14. 19. He communicates of <hi>spiritual life</hi> to
all that are his. In him is the fountain of our life,
which is therefore said to be <hi>hid with him in God,
Col.</hi> 3. 3. And this life he gives unto his Saints,
by <hi>quickning</hi> of them by his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11.
And he continues it unto them, by the supplies
of <hi>living grace</hi> which he communicates unto them.
From these <hi>two,</hi> his <hi>quickning</hi> of us, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
giving out supplies <hi>of life unto us,</hi> he is said to
live in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ
liveth in me.</hi> The <hi>spiritual life</hi> which I have is not
mine own, not from my self was it educed, not
by my self is it maintained, but it is meerly and
solely the work of Christ; so that it is not <hi>I that
live, but he lives in me,</hi> the whole of my life
being from him alone. Neither doth this <hi>living
head</hi> communicate only a <hi>bare life</hi> unto believers,
that they should meerly <hi>live</hi> &amp; no more a poor,
weak, dying life, as it were, but he gives out suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to afford them a strong, vigorous, thriving,
flourishing life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 10. He comes not only that
his sheep may have life, but that <hi>they may have it
more abundantly;</hi> that is, in a plentiful manner,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as that they may flourish, be fat and fruitful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:42900:122"/>
Thus is it with the whole body of Christ and
every member thereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15, 16. <hi>Whereby it
grows up into him in all things, which is the Head,
even Christ; from whom the whole body fitly joyned
together, and compacted, by that which every joynt
supplieth, according to the effectual working in the
measure of every part, maketh increase of the body
unto the edifying of it self in love.</hi> The end of all
communications of grace, and supplies of life from
this living and blessed Head, is the increase of the
whole body, and every member of it, and the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of it self in love. His treasures of grace are
unsearchable, his stores inexhaustible. His <hi>life,</hi>
the fonutain of ours, full and eternal, his <hi>heart</hi>
bounteous and large, his <hi>hand</hi> open and liberal;
so that there is no doubt but that he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
supplies of grace for their increase in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>abundantly</hi> unto all his Saints. Whence then is
it that they do not all flourish and <hi>thrive</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly?
As you may see it oftentimes in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
body, so is it here. Though the seat and rise of
the blood and spirits in <hi>head</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
good and sound, yet there may be a <hi>wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
member</hi> in the body; somewhat intercepts the
influences of life unto it. So that though the <hi>heart</hi>
and <hi>head</hi> do perform their office, in giving of <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies</hi>
no less to that, than they do to any other
member, yet all the effect produced, is meerly to
keep it from <hi>utter perishing;</hi> it grows weak and
decaies every day. The withering and decaying of
any member in Christs <hi>mystical body,</hi> is not for the
want of his communication of grace for an <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
life,</hi> but from the powerful <hi>interception</hi> that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42900:123"/>
is made of the efficacy of it, by the interposition and
opposition of <hi>In-dwelling Sin.</hi> Hence it is that where
<hi>Lust</hi> grows strong, a great deal of Grace will but
keep the Soul alive, and not give it any eminency
in fruitfulness at all. Oftentimes Christ gives very
<hi>much Grace,</hi> where not <hi>many</hi> of its effects do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
It spends its strength, and power, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the continual assaults of violent corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and lusts, so that it cannot put forth its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
vertue towards farther fruitfulness. As a <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Medicine,</hi> that is fit both to check vitious
and noxious humours, and to comfort, refresh
and strengthen Nature, if the evil humour be
strong and greatly prevailing, spends its whole
strength and vertue in the subduing and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, contributing much less to the relief of
Nature than otherwise it would do, if it met not
with such oppositions: So is it with <hi>the eye-salve,</hi>
and the healing grace which we have <hi>abundantly</hi>
from the <hi>wings of the Sun of Righteousness.</hi> It is
forced oftentimes, to put forth its <hi>vertue</hi> to oppose
and contend against, and in any measure subdue
prevailing lusts and corruptions: That the Soul
receiveth not that <hi>strengthening</hi> unto duties and
fruitfulness which otherwise it might receive by
it, is from hence. How sound, healthy, and
flourishing, how fruitful and exemplary in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
might many a soul be, by and with that
grace which is continually communicated to it
from Christ, which now by reason of the power
of in-dwelling sin is only <hi>not dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but weak,
withering and useless. And this, if any thing, is
a notable evidence of the efficacy of <hi>in-dwelling sin,</hi>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:42900:123"/>
that it is <hi>able</hi> to give such a stop, and check to
the mighty and effectual power of Grace, so that
notwithstanding the blessed and continual sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that we receive from our Head, yet many
Believers do <hi>decline</hi> and decay, and that <hi>habitually,</hi>
as to what they had attained unto; their <hi>last
waies</hi> not answering their <hi>first.</hi> This makes the
Vineyard in the very <hi>fruitful hill</hi> to bring forth
so many wilde Grapes. This makes so many
trees barren in fertile fields.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Besides the <hi>continual supplies of Grace</hi>
that constantly according to the tenure of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
are communicated unto Believers, which
keeps them that they thirst no more as to <hi>a total
indigence,</hi> there is moreover <hi>a readiness</hi> in the Lord
Christ to yield peculiar succour to the souls of his,
according as their occasions shall require. The
Apostle tells us, that he is <hi>a merciful High-Priest</hi>
and <hi>able,</hi> (that is <hi>ready</hi> prepared and willing) <hi>to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
them that are tempted,</hi> Heb. 2. 18. And we
are on that account, invited to come <hi>with boldness</hi>
to the Throne of Grace, <hi>that we may obtain mercy,
and find grace to help in time of need;</hi> that is, <hi>grace</hi>
sufficient, seasonable, suitable unto any special
tryal or Temptation that we may be exercised
withal. Our merciful High-Priest is ready to
give out this especial seasonable Grace, over and
above those constant Communications of supplies
of the Spirit, which we mentioned before. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the <hi>never-failing Springs</hi> of ordinary Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
grace, he hath also peculiar refreshing show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for times of drought. And this is exceedingly
to the advantage of the Saints, for their preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42900:124"/>
and growth in grace; and there may very
many more of the like nature be added. But now
I say notwithstanding all these, and the residue of
the like importance, such is the power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>indwelling-Sin,</hi> so great its <hi>deceitfulness</hi>
and restlesness, so many its wiles and <hi>temptations,</hi>
it often falls out that many of them for whose
growth and improvement all this <hi>provision</hi> is made,
do yet as was shewed, go back and <hi>decline,</hi> even as
to their course of walking with God. <hi>Sampsons</hi>
strength fully evidenced it self when he brake <hi>seven
new Withs,</hi> and <hi>seven new Cords,</hi> wherewith he was
bound, as <hi>burning tow, and as thred.</hi> The noxious
humour in the body which is so stubborn, as that
no use of the most soveraign remedies can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
against it, ought to be regarded. Such is this
<hi>indwelling-sin</hi> if not watched over: It breaks all
the cords made to binde it; it blunts the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
appointed to root it up; it resists all healing
Medicines though never so soveraign, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
assuredly of exceeding efficacy. Besides,
Believers have <hi>innumerable Obligations</hi> upon them
from the Love, the Command of God, to <hi>grow in
grace,</hi> to press forward towards perfection, as they
have <hi>abundant means</hi> provided for them so to do.
Their doing so, is a matter of the greatest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
profit, sweetness, contentment unto them in
the world: It is the burden, the trouble of their
Souls, that they do not so do, that they are not
more holy, more zealous useful, fruitful; they
desire it above Life it self; they know it is their
duty <hi>to watch</hi> against this Enemy, to fight against
it, to pray against it, and so they do. They more
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42900:124"/>
desire his <hi>destruction,</hi> than the enjoyment of all this
world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all that it can afford. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this such is the subtilty, and fraud,
and violence, and fury, and urgency, and importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this Adversary, that it frequently prevails to
bring them into the woful condition mentioned.
Hence it is with Believers sometimes as it is with
men in some places at Sea; they have a good and
fair <hi>gale of wind,</hi> it may be all night long; they
ply their <hi>tackling,</hi> attend diligently their business,
and it may be take great contentment to consider
how they proceed in their Voyage: In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or after a season coming to measure what
way they have made, and what progress they have
had, they find that they are much <hi>backward</hi> of
what they were, instead of getting one step <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi>
falling into a swift tide, or current against
them, it hath <hi>frustrated</hi> all their Labours, and
rendered the wind in their Sails almost useless;
somewhat thereby they have born up against the
stream, but have made no progress. So is it with
Believers: They have a good gale of <hi>supplies</hi> of
the Spirit from above, they attend <hi>duties</hi> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
pray constantly, hear attentively, and
omit nothing that may carry them in their <hi>Voyage</hi>
towards Eternity. But after a while, coming
seriously to consider by the examination of their
hearts and waies, what <hi>progress</hi> they have made,
they find that all their assistance, and duties,
have not been able to bear them up against some
<hi>strong tide</hi> or current of <hi>Indwelling-Sin.</hi> It hath
kept them indeed that they have not been driven
and split on <hi>rocks</hi> and <hi>shelves;</hi> it hath preserved

               </gap>hem from gross, scandalous sins, but yet they
have lost in their <hi>spiritual frame,</hi> or gone back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and are intangled under many woful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes;
which is a <hi>notable</hi> evidence of the <hi>Life of
Sin,</hi> about which we are treating. Now because
the end of our discovering <hi>this power of Sin,</hi> is,
that we may be careful to obviate and prevent it
in its <hi>operation,</hi> and because of all the effects that
it produceth there is none more dangerous or
pernicious than that we have last insisted on, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it prevails upon many <hi>Professors</hi> unto an
<hi>habitual declension</hi> from their former wayes and
Attainments, notwithstanding all the sweetness
and excellency which their Souls have found in
them, I shall, as was said, in the next place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
by what <hi>Waies and Means,</hi> and through
what assistance it usually prevails in this kind,
that we may the better be instructed to watch
against it.</p>

               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:42900:125"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> Upon the <hi>first Conversion</hi> and calling of
<hi>Sinners</hi> unto God and Christ, they have usually
many <hi>fresh Springs</hi> breaking forth in their Souls,
and Refreshing showers coming upon them, which
bear them up to an <hi>high rate</hi> of Faith, Love, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
Fruitfulness and Obedience. As upon a
<hi>Land-flood</hi> when many lesser streams run into a
River, it swells over its bounds, and rouls on
with a more than ordinary fulness. Now if these
<hi>Springs</hi> be not kept open, if they prevail not for
the continuance of these showers, they must needs
decay and go backwards. We shall name <hi>one or
two</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>First, They have <hi>a fresh, vigorous sence of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
Mercy.</hi> According as this is in the Soul, so
will its Love and delight in God, so will its Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
be. As, I say, is the sence of Gospel-pardon,
so will be the <hi>life</hi> of Gospel-love. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47.
<hi>I say unto thee,</hi> saith our Saviour of the poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>her sins, which were many, are forgiven, for
she loved much, but to whom little is forgiven, the
same loveth little.</hi> Her <hi>great love</hi> was an evidence
of <hi>great forgiveness;</hi> and her great sence of it. For
our Saviour is not rendring a reason of her <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,</hi>
as though it were for her Love, but of
her <hi>Love,</hi> that it was because of her forgiveness.
Having in the foregoing <hi>Parable</hi> from <hi>Verse</hi> 38.
and onwards, convinced the <hi>Pharisees</hi> with whom
he had to do, that he to whom <hi>most</hi> was <hi>forgiven</hi>
would love most, as <hi>Verse</hi> 43. He thence gives an
account of the <hi>great love</hi> of the Woman springing
from the sence she had of the <hi>great forgiveness</hi>
which she had so freely received. Thus sinners
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42900:126"/>
at their first Conversion are very sensible of great
forgiveness: <hi>Of whom I am chief,</hi> lies next their
heart. This greatly subdues their hearts and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
unto all in God, and quickens them unto all
Obedience; even that such poor cursed sinners as
they were, should so <hi>freely</hi> be delivered and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
The love of God and of Christ in their
<hi>forgiveness,</hi> highly conquers and constrains them
to make it their business to <hi>live unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>fresh taste they have had of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
things,</hi> keeps up such a favour and relish of them
in their Souls, as that worldly Contentments
whereby men are drawn off from close walking
with G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, are rendred sapless and undesireable
unto them. Having tasted of the <hi>Wine</hi> of the
Gospel they desire no other, for they say, <hi>this is
best.</hi> So was it with the Apostles upon that <hi>option</hi>
offered them as to a departure from Christ, upon
the Apostasie of many false Professors; <hi>Will ye go
away also?</hi> Joh. 6. 67. They answer by <hi>Peter, Lord,
to whom shall we go, thou hast the words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life?</hi> Vers. 68. They had such a <hi>fresh sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
and relish of the Doctrine of the Gospel, and
the Grace of Christ upon their Souls, that they
can entertain no thoughts of declining from it.
As a man that hath been long kept in a <hi>dungeon,</hi> if
brought forth on a sudden into the Light of the
Sun, finds so much pleasure and contentment in
it, in the beauties of the old Creation, that he
thinks he can never be weary of it, nor shall ever
be contented on any account to be under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
again. So is it with Souls when first transl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the <hi>marvellous Light</hi> of Christ, to behold
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42900:126"/>
the beauties of the <hi>New Creation.</hi> They see a new
<hi>Glory</hi> in him, that hath quite sullied the desireable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of all earthly diversions. And they see a new
guilt and filth in sin, that gives them an utter ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency
of its old delights and pleasures; and so
of other things.</p>
            <p>Now whilest these and the <hi>like Springs</hi> are kept
open in the Souls of converted sinners, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
them to a vigorous active Holiness. They
can never <hi>do enough for God;</hi> so that oftentimes
their Zeal, as <hi>Saints,</hi> suffers them not to escape
without some blots on their Prudence <hi>as men,</hi> as
might be instanced in many of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of
old.</p>
            <p>This then is the <hi>first,</hi> at least <hi>one way</hi> whereby
indwelling-sin prepares men for <hi>decayes</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clensions
in Grace and Obedience: It endeavours
to <hi>stop</hi> or taint <hi>these springs.</hi> And there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
waies whereby it bringeth this to pass.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It works by <hi>sloth</hi> and <hi>negligence.</hi> It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
in the Soul to a neglect of <hi>stirring up</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
thoughts of, or about the things that so
powerfully <hi>influence</hi> it unto strict and fruitful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
If care be not taken, if diligence and
watchfulness be not used, and all means observed
that are appointed of God, to keep a quick and
living sense of them upon the Soul, they will dry
up and decay, and consequently that Obedience
that should spring from them will do so also. <hi>Isaac
digged Wells,</hi> but the <hi>Philistins</hi> stopt them, and
his Flocks had no benefit by them. Let the heart
never so little di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>use it self to gracious soul-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoughts of the Love of God, the Cross of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42900:127"/>
Christ, the greatness and excellency of Gospel
mercy, the beauties of holiness, they will quickly
be as as much <hi>estranged</hi> to a man, as he can be to
them. He that shuts his eyes for a season in the
Sun, when he opens them again can see nothing
at all. And so much as a man loseth of <hi>faith</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
these things, so much will they lose of
<hi>power</hi> towards him. They can do little or nothing
upon him, because of his unbelief, which formerly
were so exceedingly effectual towards him. So
was it with the <hi>Spouse</hi> in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> chap. 5. 2.
Christ calls unto her, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. with a marvellous
<hi>loving</hi> and gracious invitation unto communion
with himself. She who had formerly been <hi>ravished</hi>
at the first hearing of that <hi>joyful sound,</hi> being now
under the power of <hi>sloth</hi> and carnal ease, returns a
sorry <hi>excusing</hi> answer to his Call, which ended in
her own signal loss and sorrow. <hi>Indwelling-sin,</hi>
I say, prevailing by <hi>spiritual sloth</hi> upon the souls
of men unto an inadvertency of the motions of
Gods Spirit in their former apprehensions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love, and a negligence of stirring up conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
thoughts of <hi>faith</hi> about it, a <hi>decay</hi> grows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
upon the whole soul. Thus God oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
that his people had <hi>forgotten him,</hi> that is,
grew unmindful of his Love and Grace, which was
the beginning of their <hi>Apostasie.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, By <hi>unframing the soul,</hi> so that it shall
have formal, weary, <hi>powerless</hi> thoughts of those
things, which should prevail with it unto <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
in thankful obedience. The Apostle cautions
us, that in dealing with God, we should <hi>use reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and godly fear,</hi> because of his purity, holiness,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42900:127"/>
and Majesty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28, 29. And this is that
which the Lord himself spake in the destruction
of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, I will be sanctified in them
that come to me,</hi> Lev. 10. 3. He will be dealt withal
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in an awful, <hi>holy,</hi> reverent manner. So are we to
deal with all the things of God, wherein, or
whereby we have communion with him. The
soul is to have a great Reverence of God in them.
When men begin to take them into <hi>slight</hi> and
<hi>common thoughts,</hi> not using and improving them
unto the utmost for the ends whereunto they are
appointed, they lose all their beauty, and glory,
and power towards them. When we have any
thing to do wherein faith and love towards God is
to be exercised, we must do it with all our hearts,
with all our minds, strength and souls, not slightly
and <hi>perfunctorily,</hi> which God abhors; he doth not
only require that we bear his Love and Grace in
remembrance, but that, as much as in us lyeth,
we do it according to the worth and excellency
of them. It was the sin of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that he <hi>ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
not again according to the benefits done to him,</hi>
2 Chron. 32. 25. So whilst we consider Gospel
truths, the uttermost endeavour of the soul ought
to be, that we may be changed into the same image
or likeness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. that is, that they may have
their full power and effect upon us. Otherwise
<hi>James</hi> tells us what our <hi>beholding the glory of
the Lord in a glass,</hi> there mentioned by the Apostle,
that is, reading or hearing the mind of God in
Christ revealed in the Gospel, comes unto, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.
<hi>vers.</hi> 23, 24. <hi>It is but like unto a man beholding
his natural face in a glass, for he beholdeth
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42900:128"/>
himself and goeth away, and streight way forgetteth
what manner of man he was.</hi> It makes no impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
upon him, begets no <hi>Idea</hi> nor image of his
likeness in his imagination, because he doth it
only <hi>slightly,</hi> and with a transient look. So is it
with men that will indeed think of <hi>Gospel truths,</hi>
but in a slight manner, without endeavouring
with all their hearts, minds, and strength, to have
them ingrafted upon their souls, and all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of them produced in them. Now this is the
way of <hi>sinners,</hi> in their first <hi>engagements</hi> unto God.
They never think of <hi>pardoning mercy,</hi> but they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to affect their whole souls with it, and do
stir up themselves unto suitable affections and
returns of constant obedience. They think not of
the <hi>Excellency of Christ,</hi> and spiritual things, now
newly discovered unto them in a saving light,
but they press with all their might after a farther,
a fuller enjoyment of them. This keeps them
<hi>humble</hi> and holy, this makes them thankful and
fruitful. But now if the utmost <hi>diligence</hi> and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
be not used to improve and grow in this
Wisdom, to keep up this frame, <hi>indwelling-sin</hi>
working by the <hi>vanity of the minds of men;</hi> will
insensibly bring them to content themselves with
<hi>slight</hi> and <hi>rare</hi> thoughts of these things, without a
diligent sedulous endeavour to give them their
due improvement upon the soul. As men <hi>decay</hi>
herein, so they will assuredly <hi>decay</hi> and decline in
the <hi>power of holiness,</hi> and close walking with God.
The <hi>springs</hi> being stopt or tainted, the streams will
not run so <hi>swiftly,</hi> at least not so <hi>sweetly</hi> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
Some by this means under an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42900:128"/>
profession, insensibly wither almost into
nothing. They talk of Religion and spiritual
things as much as ever they did in their lives, and
perform <hi>duties</hi> with as much constancy as ever
they did, but yet have poor lean starvling souls, as
to any real and effectual communion with God.
By the power and subtilty of <hi>indwelling-sin</hi> they
have grown <hi>formal,</hi> and learned to deal about spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things in an <hi>overly</hi> manner, whereby they
have lost all their life, vigour, favour, and efficacy
towards them. Be alwaies <hi>serious</hi> in spiritual things,
if ever you intend to be bettered by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Indwelling-sin</hi> oftentimes prevailes to
the stopping of these springs of Gospel obedience,
by false and foolish opinions, corrupting the <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi>
of the Gospel. False opinions are the <hi>works
of the flesh.</hi> From the <hi>vanity</hi> and darkness of the
minds of men, with a mixture more or less of
corrupt affections, do they mostly proceed. The
Apostle was <hi>jealous</hi> over his <hi>Corinthians</hi> in this
matter, he was afraid lest their minds should <hi>by any
means be corrupted from the simplicity that is in
Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 2, 3. which he knew would be
attended by a <hi>decay</hi> and declension in faith, love,
and obedience. And thus matters in this case
often fall out. We have seen some, who after they
have received a sweet <hi>taste</hi> of the love of God in
Christ, of the excellency of <hi>pardoning mercy,</hi> and
have walked humbly with God for many years,
in the faith and apprehension of the truth, have
by the corruption of their minds from the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
that is in Christ by false and foolish opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
despised all their own experiences, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42900:129"/>
rejected all the efficacy of truth, as to the farthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their obedience. Hence <hi>John</hi> cautions the
<hi>Elect Lady</hi> and her children to take heed they were
not seduced, <hi>lest they should lose the things that they
had wrought,</hi> 2 Epist. v. 8. lest they should them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cast away all their former obedience as lost,
and a thing of no value. We have innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
hereof in the daies wherein we live. How
many are there, who not many years since put an
unspeakable value <hi>on the pardon of sin in the blood
of Christ,</hi> who delighted in Gospel discoveries of
spiritual things, and walked in obedience unto
God on the account of them, who being <hi>beguiled</hi>
and turned aside from the truth as it is in Jesus,
do despise these <hi>springs</hi> of their own former obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?
And as this is done <hi>grosly</hi> and openly in
some, so there are more <hi>secret</hi> and more <hi>plausible</hi>
insinuations of corrupt opinions, tainting the
springs and fountains of Gospel obedience, and
through the vanity of mens minds, which is a
principal part of indwelling-sin, getting ground
upon them. Such are all those that tend to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation
of <hi>special Grace</hi> in its freedom, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
and the advancement of the wills or the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of men in their spiritual power and
ability: They are all <hi>works of the flesh,</hi> and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
some may pretend an usefulness in them to
the <hi>promotion of holiness,</hi> they will be found to <hi>taint
the springs</hi> of true Evangelical obedience, insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to turn the heart from God, and to bring the
whole soul into a spiritual <hi>decay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is one way whereby <hi>Indwelling-sin</hi>
produceth this pernicious effect, of drawing men
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42900:129"/>
off from the power, purity, and fruitfulness at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
their first conversion, and engagements
unto God, bringing them into <hi>habitual declension,</hi>
at least as unto <hi>degrees</hi> of their holiness and grace.
There is not any thing we ought to be more
watchful against, if we intend effectually to deal
with this powerful and subtile enemy. It is no
small part of the <hi>wisdom of faith,</hi> to observe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gospel truths continue to have the same
<hi>savour</hi> unto, and <hi>efficacy</hi> upon the soul, as formerly
they have had; and whether an indeavour be
maintained to improve them continually as at the
first. A commandment that is alwaies practised,
is alwaies new, as <hi>John</hi> speaks of that of Love.
And he that really improves Gospel truths, though
he hears them a thousand times, they will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<hi>new</hi> and fresh unto him, because they put
him on <hi>newness</hi> of practice. When to another
that grows <hi>common</hi> under them, they are burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and <hi>common</hi> unto him; and he even loaths
the <hi>Manna</hi> that he is so accustomed unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Indwelling-sin</hi> doth this, <hi>by taking men
off from their watch against the returns of Satan.</hi>
When our Lord Christ comes first to take posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of any soul for himself, he binds that <hi>strong
man and spoils his goods;</hi> he deprives them of all
his power, dominion and interest. Satan being
thus dispossest and frustrated in his hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations,
leaves the soul, as finding it newly
mortified to his baits. So he left our Saviour upon
his first fruitless attempts. But it is said, <hi>He left
him only for a season,</hi> Luk. 4. 13. He intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again, as he should see his advantage. So is it
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42900:130"/>
with <hi>Believers</hi> also. Being cast out from his interest
in them, he leaves them for a <hi>season,</hi> at least com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
he doth so. Freed from his assaults and
perplexing temptations, they proceed <hi>vigorously</hi>
in the course of their obedience, and so flourish in
the waies of God. But this holds not; Satan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
again, and if the soul stands not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
upon his <hi>guard</hi> against him, he will quickly get
such advantages, as shall put a notable interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon his fruitfulness and obedience. Hence
some, after they have spent <hi>some time,</hi> it may be
<hi>some years</hi> in cheerful exemplary walking with
God, have upon Satans <hi>return,</hi> consumed all their
latter daies in wrestling with perplexing tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wherewith he hath intangled them. Others
have plainly fallen under the power of his assaults.
It is like a man, who having for a while lived
<hi>usefully</hi> amongst his neighbours, done good, and
communicated according to his ability, distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
to the poor, and helping all round about
him, at length falling into the hands of vexatious,
wrangling oppressive men, he is forced to spend
his whole time and revenue in defending himself
against them at Law, and so becomes useless in the
place where he lives. So is it with many a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever;
after he hath walked in a fruitful course
of obedience to the glory of God, and edification
of the Church of Christ, being afresh set upon by
the <hi>ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rn</hi> of Satan in one way or other, he hath
enough to do all the remainder of his life to keep
himself <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive;</hi> in the mean time a to many graces,
wofully decaying and going backward. Now
this also, though Satan hath an hand in it, is from
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42900:130"/>
               <hi>Indwelling-sin:</hi> I mean, the success is so which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
doth obtain in his undertaking. This encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth
him, maketh way for his return, and gives
entrance to his temptations. You know how it is
with them, out of whom he is cast only by <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
conviction;</hi> after he hath wandred and waited
awhile, he saith, <hi>He will return to his house from
whence he was ejected.</hi> And what is the issue? Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
lusts have prevailed over the mans convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and made his soul fit to entertain <hi>returning
devils.</hi> It is so as to the measure of prevalency,
that Satan obtains against Believers, upon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
administred unto him, by sins disposing the
soul unto an obnoxiousness to his temptations.</p>
            <p>Now the way and means whereby <hi>Indwelling-sin</hi>
doth give advantage to Satan for his <hi>return,</hi>
are all those which dispose them towards a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clension</hi>
which shall afterwards be mentioned. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
is a diligent, watchful, and crafty adversary,
he will neglect no opportunity, no advantage that
is offered unto him. Wherein then soever our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
strength is impaired by <hi>sin,</hi> or which way
soever our lusts press, Satan falls in with that
weakness, and presseth towards that ruine. So
that all the actings of the Law of sin are subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to this end of Satan. I shall therefore only
at present mention one or two, that seem princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to invite Satan to attempt a <hi>return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It intangleth the soul in the things of the
world, all which are so many Purveyors for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had let the people go, he heard
after a while that they were <hi>intangled in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi>
and supposeth that he shall therefore now
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42900:131"/>
               <hi>overtake</hi> them and destroy them. This stirs him up
to <hi>pursue</hi> after them. Satan finding those whom
he hath been cast out from, intangled in the things
of the world, by which he is sure to find an easie
<hi>access</hi> unto them, is encouraged to attempt upon
them afresh; as the <hi>Spider</hi> to come down upon
the strongest flie that is <hi>entangled</hi> in his web. For
he comes by his temptations only to impel them
unto that whereunto by their own lusts they are
enclined, by adding <hi>poison</hi> to their lusts, and <hi>paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to the <hi>objects</hi> of them. And oftentimes by this
advantage he gets so in upon the souls of men,
that they are never well free of him more whilst
they live. And as mens <hi>diversions</hi> increase from the
world, so do their <hi>entanglements</hi> from Satan.
When they have more to do in the world than
they can well manage, they shall have more to
do from Satan than they can well withstand.
When men are made spiritually <hi>faint,</hi> by dealing
in and with the world, Satan sets on them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Amalek</hi> did on the faint and weak of the people
that came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It produceth this effect by <hi>making
the soul negligent,</hi> and taking it off from its watch.
We have before shew'd at large that it is one main
part of the <hi>effectual deceitfulness of Indwelling sin,</hi>
to make the soul <hi>inadvertent,</hi> to turn it off from the
diligent watchful attendance unto its duty, which
is required. Now there is not any thing in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
whereunto diligence and watchfulness is
more strictly enjoyned; than the <hi>returning assau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts</hi>
of Satan, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Be sober, be vigilant;</hi> and
why so? <hi>because of your adversary the Devil.</hi> Unless
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42900:131"/>
you are exceeding <hi>watchful,</hi> at one time or other
he will surprize you. And all the injunctions of
our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> to <hi>watch,</hi> are still with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
unto him, and his temptations. Now when
the soul is made <hi>careless</hi> and inadvertent, forgetting
what an enemy it hath to deal withal, or is lifted
up with the <hi>successes</hi> it hath newly obtained against
him, then in Satans time to attempt a re-entrance
of his old <hi>habitation;</hi> which if he cannot obtain,
yet he makes their lives uncomfortable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and unfruitful to others, in weakening their
<hi>root,</hi> and withering their <hi>fruit</hi> through his poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
temptations. He comes down upon our duties
of <hi>obedience,</hi> as the fowls upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> sacrifice,
that if we watch not, as he did, to drive them
away, [for by resistance he is overcome and put
to flight] he will <hi>devour</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> takes advantage to put
forth its efficacy and deceit, to with-draw men
from their <hi>primitive zeal</hi> and holiness, from their
<hi>first faith, love,</hi> and works by the <hi>evil examples of
Professors</hi> amongst whom they live. When men
first engage into the ways of God, they have a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
esteem</hi> of those whom they believe to have
been made partakers of that mercy before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
these they love and honour, as it is their
duty. But after a while they find many of them
walking in many things <hi>unevenly, crookedly,</hi> &amp; not
unlike the men of the world. Here <hi>sin</hi> is not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its advantage. Insensibly it prevails with
men to a compliance with them. This way, this
course of walking, doth <hi>well enough</hi> with others,
why may it not do so with us also? Such is the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42900:132"/>
inward thought of many, that works effectually
in them. And so through the craft of <hi>sin,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of Professors corrupt one another. As a
<hi>stream</hi> arising from a clear spring or fountain,
whilst it runs in its own peculiar channel, and
keeps its water unmixed, preserves its purity and
cleanness, but when it falls in its course with
other streams that are <hi>turbid</hi> and <hi>foul,</hi> though run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the same way with it, it becomes <hi>muddy</hi> and
<hi>discoloured</hi> also. So is it in this case. Believers come
forth from the spring of the <hi>New birth</hi> with some
purity and cleanness, this for a while they keep in
the course of their private walking with God;
but now when they come sometimes to fall into
<hi>society</hi> with <hi>others,</hi> whose profession flows &amp; runs
the same way with theirs, even towards heaven,
but yet are <hi>mudded</hi> and <hi>sullied</hi> with sin and the
world, they are often corrupted with them, and
by them, and so decline from their first purity,
faith, and holiness. Now lest this may have been
the case of any who shall read this discourse, I
shall add some few cautions that are <hi>necessary</hi> to
preserve men from this infection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In the <hi>body of Professors</hi> there is a great
number of <hi>hypocrites.</hi> Though we cannot say of
<hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> man, that he is so, yet that some there
are, is most certain. Our Saviour hath told us that
it will be so to the end of the world. All that
have <hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Lamps,</hi> have it not in their <hi>ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</hi>
Let men take heed how they give themselves
up unto a <hi>conformity</hi> to the Professors they meet
withal, lest instead of <hi>Saints</hi> and the best of men,
they sometimes propose for their example <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:42900:132"/>
which are the <hi>worst,</hi> and when they think
they are <hi>like</hi> unto them who bare the <hi>image of
God,</hi> they conform themselves to those, who bare
the <hi>Image of Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You know not what may be the <hi>present
temptations</hi> of those whose <hi>ways</hi> you observe.
It may be they are under some <hi>peculiar desertion</hi>
from God, and so are <hi>withering</hi> for a season, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he send them some <hi>refreshing powers</hi> from
above. It may be they are intangled with some
<hi>special corruptions,</hi> which is their burthen, tat
you know not of; and for any voluntarily to fall
into such a frame, as others are cast into by the
power of their temptations, or to think that
will suffice in them, which they see to suffice in
others whose distempers they know not, is <hi>folly</hi>
and presumption. He that knows <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi>
a person to be a living Man, and of an healthy
constitution, if he see him go <hi>crawling</hi> up and
down about his affairs, feeble and weak, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
falling, sometimes standing, and making
small progress in any thing, will he think it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for himself to do so also? will he not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether the person he sees, have not lately
fallen into some <hi>distemper</hi> or <hi>sickness,</hi> that hath
weakened him, and brought him into that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
Assuredly he will so do. Take heed,
Christians, many of the Professors with whom ye
do converse are sick, and wounded; the wounds
of some of them do <hi>stink, and are corrupt because
of their folly.</hi> If you have any <hi>spiritual health,</hi> do
not think their weak and uneven walking will be
accepted at your hands; much less <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ink it will
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42900:133"/>
be well for you to become <hi>sick</hi> and to be wounded
also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Remember that of many of the <hi>best
Christians,</hi> the <hi>worst</hi> only is known and seen.
Many who keep up precious Communion with
God, do yet oftentimes by their <hi>natural temper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
of freedom or passion, not carry so glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
as others, who perhaps come short of
them in Grace and the power of Godliness. In
respect of their outward Conversation it may
seem they are scarcely <hi>saved,</hi> when in respect of
their <hi>Faith and Love</hi> they may be eminent. They
may, as the <hi>Kings Daughter,</hi> be all glorious within,
though their <hi>Cloaths be not alwayes of wrought
Gold.</hi> Take heed then that you be not infected
with their <hi>worst,</hi> when ye are not able it may be
to imitate them in their <hi>best;</hi> but to return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Sin doth this work by <hi>cherishing some
secret particular lust in the heart.</hi> This the soul
contends against faintly, It <hi>contends against</hi> it upon
the account of sincerity, it cannot but do so; but it
doth not make through-work vigorously to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
it by the strength and power of Grace. Now
where it is thus with the Soul, an <hi>habitual dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
as to holiness will assuredly ensue. <hi>David</hi> shews
us how in his <hi>first days</hi> he kept his heart close un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, <hi>Psal</hi> 18. 23. <hi>I was upright before him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42900:133"/>
makes him keep <hi>his body in subjection,</hi> that no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
reasonings or vain imagination might take
place in him. But where <hi>indwelling Sin</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
irritated, and given strength unto a <hi>special
lust,</hi> it proves assuredly a <hi>Principal Means</hi> of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
declension. For as an infirmity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in any one vital part, will make the whole
body consumptive, so will the <hi>weakness in any one
Grace,</hi> which a perplexing lust brings with it,
make the Soul. It every way weakens spiritual
strength. It weakens <hi>Confidence</hi> in God in Faith
and Prayer. The <hi>knees</hi> will be feeble, and the
<hi>hands</hi> will hang down in dealing with God,
where a galling and unmortified lust lies in the
heart. It will take <hi>such hold upon the soul, that it
shall not be able to look up,</hi> Psal. 40. 12. It darkens
the mind by <hi>innumerable foolish imaginations,</hi>
which it stirs up to make provision for its self.
It <hi>galls</hi> the Conscience with those spots and stains,
which in and by its actings it brings upon the
soul. It contends in the <hi>Will</hi> for Rule and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion:
An <hi>active stirring corruption</hi> would have
the commanding power in the soul, and it is ever
and anon ready to take the Throne. It <hi>disturbs</hi>
the thoughts, and sometimes will even frighten
the soul from dealing with it by meditation, lest
corrupt affections being entangled by it, Grace
loses ground instead of prevailing. It <hi>breaks</hi> out
oftentimes into scandalous sins, as it did in <hi>David</hi>
and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and loads the sinner with sorrow
and discouragemen. By these and the like means it
becomes to the soul like a <hi>moth in a garment,</hi> to
eat up and devour the strongest threeds of it, so
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42900:134"/>
that though the whole hang <hi>loose</hi> together, it is
easily torn in pieces. Though the soul with
whom it is thus, do for a season keep up a <hi>fair
profession,</hi> yet his strength is secretly devoured;
and every temptation tears and rents his <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
at pleasure. It becomes with such Men as it
is with some who have for a many years been of
a sound strong <hi>athletick</hi> constitution. Some secret
<hi>hectical distemper</hi> seizeth on them: For a season
they take no notice of it; or if they do, they think
they shall do well enough with it, and easily shake
it off when they have a little leasure to attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it: But for the present they think as <hi>Sampson</hi>
with his locks cut, they will do as at other times.
Sometimes it may be they complain that they are
not <hi>well,</hi> they know not what aileth them, and
it may be rise violently in an opposition to their
distemper; but after a while <hi>strugling</hi> in vain, the
vigour of their spirits and strength failing them,
they are forced to yield to the power of a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</hi>
And now all they can do is little enough
to keep them alive. It is so with Men brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>spiritual decays</hi> by any secret perplexing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
It may be they have had a vigorous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of obedience and holiness: <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi>
watching its opportunities, by some temptation
or other, hath kindled and inflamed some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
lust in them. For a while it may be they take
little notice of it. Somtimes they <hi>complain,</hi> but
think they will do as in former times, untill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I shall not add any thing here as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
and obviating this advantage of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling-sin,
having elsewhere treated of it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
and apart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It works by <hi>negligence of private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God in Prayer and Meditation.</hi> I have
shewed before how <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi> puts forth its
<hi>deceitfulness</hi> in diverting the soul from watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in and unto these duties. Here if it prevails,
it will not fail to induce an <hi>habitual declension</hi> in
the whole course of Obedience. All neglect of
private duties is principled by a <hi>weariness</hi> of God
as he complaineth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 22. <hi>Thou hast not called
upon Me, thou hast been weary of Me.</hi> Neglect of
invocation proceeds from weariness. And where
there is <hi>weariness,</hi> there will be withdrawing from
that whereof we are weary. Now God alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fountain and spring of spiritual life, if
there be a <hi>weariness</hi> of him, and withdrawing from
him, it is impossible but that there will <hi>a decay</hi>
in the Life ensue. Indeed what men are in <hi>these<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
duties,</hi> I mean as to Faith and Love in them, that
they are and no more. Here lies the root of
their obedience, and if this fail all fruit will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fail. You may sometimes see a <hi>Tree</hi> flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with leaves and fruit goodly and pleasant.
After a while the <hi>leaves</hi> begin to decay, the <hi>fruit</hi>
to wither, the whole to droop. Search, and
you shall find the <hi>root,</hi> whereby it should draw in
moisture and fatness from the Earth to supply the
body and branches with sap and juice for growth
and fruit, hath received a wound, is some way
perished, and doth not perform its duty, so that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42900:135"/>
though the branches are flourishing a while with
what they had received their sustenance being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted
they must decay. So it is here. These
duties of private Communion with God, are the
means of receiving supplies of <hi>spiritual strength</hi>
from him; of sap &amp; fatness from Christ the Vine
and Olive. Whilest they do so, the conversation
and course of obedience <hi>flourisheth</hi> and is fruitful,
all outward duties are chearfully and regularly
performed. But if there be a <hi>wound,</hi> a defect, a
failing in that which should first take in the <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
radical moisture,</hi> that should be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto the whole, the rest may for a season
maintain their station and appearance, but after
a while profession will wither, fruits will decay,
and the whole be ready to die. Hence our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
lets us know, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. what a man is
<hi>in secret,</hi> in these private duties, that he is in the
eyes of God, and no more. And one reason
amongst others is, because they have a more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
acting of <hi>unmixed grace</hi> than any other
duties whatever. In all or most particular duties,
besides the influence that they may have from
carnal respects, which are many, and the wayes
of their insinuation subtile, and imperceptible,
there is an <hi>allay</hi> of <hi>gifts,</hi> which sometime even
devours the pure Gold of Grace which should be
the chief and Principal in them. In these, there is
immediate entercourse between God, and that
which is of himself in the soul. If once sin by
its deceits and treacheries, prevail to take off the
Soul from <hi>diligent attendance</hi> unto Communion
with God, and constancy in these duties, it will
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42900:135"/>
not fail to effect a <hi>declining</hi> in the whole of a
mans obedience. It hath made its entrance, and
will assuredly make good its progress.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Growing in <hi>Notions of Truth without
answerable practice,</hi> is another thing that <hi>Indwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-sin</hi>
makes use to bring the souls of Believers
under a <hi>decay.</hi> The Apostle tells us, that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
puffeth up,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. If it be alone, not
improved in practice, it <hi>swells men</hi> beyond a due
proportion. Like a man that hath a <hi>Dropsie,</hi> we
are not to expect that he hath strength to his
bigness. Like trees that are continually <hi>running
up an head,</hi> which keeps them from bearing fruit.
When once men have attained to this, that they
can entertain and receive <hi>Evangelical truths</hi> in a
new and more Glorious light, or more clear disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
than formerly, or new manifestations of
Truth which they knew not before, and please
themselves in so doing, without <hi>diligent endeavors</hi>
to have the power of those truths and notions
upon their hearts and their souls made conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto them, they generally learn so to dispose
of all truths formerly known, which were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
inlaid in their hearts with more efficacy
and power. This hath proved, if not the <hi>ruine,</hi>
yet the great <hi>impairing</hi> of many in these <hi>days of
light</hi> wherein we live. By this means from hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
close <hi>walking,</hi> many have withered into an
empty, barren, <hi>talking</hi> profession. All things almost
have in a short season become alike unto them:
Have they been true or false, so they might be
debating of them, and disputing about them, all
is well. This is <hi>food for sin,</hi> it hatcheth, increaseth
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42900:136"/>
it, and is increased by it. A notable way it is for
the <hi>vanity</hi> that is in the mind, to exert it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a rebuke from conscience. Whilst men are
talking, and writing, and studying about Religion,
and hearing <hi>Preaching,</hi> it may be, with great <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi>
as those in <hi>Ezekiel chap.</hi> 33. 32. Conscience.
unless throughly awake and circumspect, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with spiritual wisdom and care, will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well pacified, and enter no rebukes or pleas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the way that the soul is in. But yet all this
may be nothing but the acting of that <hi>natural va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
which lies in the mind, and is a principal part
of the sin we treat of. And generally this is so,
when men content themselves, as was said, with
the notions of truth, without labouring after an
experience of the power of them in their hearts,
and the bringing forth the fruit of them in their
lives, on which a <hi>decay</hi> must needs ensue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly, Growth in carnal wisdom</hi> is another
help to sin in producing this sad effect. <hi>Thy wisdom
and thy knowledge,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
thee, Isa.</hi> 47. 10. So much as <hi>carnal wisdom</hi>
increaseth, so much faith decays. The proper
work of it is to teach a man <hi>to trust to and in
himself,</hi> of faith to trust wholly in another. So it
labours to destroy the whole work of faith, by
causing the soul to return into a deceiving <hi>fulness</hi>
of his own. We have woful examples of the
prevalency of this principle of declension in the
days werein we live. How many a poor, humble,
broken hearted creature, who followed after God
in simplicity and integrity of spirit, have we seen,
through the observation of the ways and walkings
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42900:136"/>
of others, and closing with the temptations to
craft and subtilty, which opportunities in the
world have administred unto them, come to be
dipt in a <hi>worldly carnal frame,</hi> and utterly to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their profession. Many are so <hi>sullied</hi> hereby,
that they are not to be known to be the men they
were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly, Some great sin lying long in the heart and
conscience unrepented of,</hi> or not repented of as it
ought, and as the matter requires, furthers <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling-sin</hi>
in this work. The great turn of the
life of <hi>David,</hi> whence his <hi>first ways</hi> carried the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
was in the harbouring his great sin in
his conscience without suitable repentance. It was
otherwise we know with <hi>Peter,</hi> and he had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
issue. A great sin will certainly give a great
<hi>turn</hi> to the life of a Professor. If it be well cured
in the blood of Christ, with that humiliation
which the Gospel requires, it often proves a
means of more watchfulness, fruitfulness, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and contentation, than ever the soul before
obtained. If it be neglected, it certainly <hi>hardens
the heart,</hi> weakens spiritual strength, enfeebles the
soul, discouraging it unto all communion with
God, and is a notable principle of a general decay.
So <hi>David</hi> complains, <hi>Ps.</hi> 38. 5. <hi>My wounds stink
and are corrupt because of my foolishness.</hi> His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
distemper was not so much from his <hi>sin,</hi> as his
<hi>folly,</hi> not so much from the wounds he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
as from his neglect to make a timely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
for their cure. It is like a <hi>broken bone,</hi>
which being well set, leaves the place stronger
than before; if otherwise, makes the man a <hi>Cripple</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:42900:137"/>
all his days. These things we do but briefly name,
and sundry other advantages of the like nature
that <hi>sin</hi> makes use of to produce this effect, might
also be instanced in; but these may suffice unto our
present purpose. What ever it useth, it self is still
the principle; and this is no small demonstration
of its efficacy and power.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The strength of Indwelling-sin, manifested
from its power and effects in persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT is of the power and efficacy of <hi>Indwelling-sin,</hi>
as it remains in several degrees in Believers
that we are treating. Now I have else-where
shewed, that the nature and all the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of it do still remain in them. Though
therefore we cannot prove directly what is the
<hi>strength</hi> of sin in them, from what its <hi>power</hi> is in
those, in whom it is only checked and not at all
weakned; yet may we from an observation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
caution Believers of the real power of that <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
enemy</hi> with whom they have to do.</p>
            <p>If the Plague do violently rage in <hi>one</hi> City, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
multitudes, and there be in <hi>another</hi> an
infection of the same kind, which yet arises not
unto that height and fury there, by reason of
the <hi>correction</hi> that it meets withal from a <hi>better
air,</hi> and remedies used; yet a man may demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42900:137"/>
unto the Inhabitants the force and danger
of that <hi>Infection</hi> got in among them, by the <hi>effects</hi>
that it hath and doth produce among others, who
have not the benefit of the <hi>preventives</hi> and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives
which they enjoy; which will both teach
them to value the means of their preservation,
and be the more watchful against the power of
the infection that is among them. It is so in this
case. Believers may be taught what is the power
and efficacy of that <hi>plague of sin,</hi> which is in and
among them, by the <hi>effects</hi> the same plague pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
in and among others, who have not those
<hi>corrections</hi> of its poyson, and those <hi>preservatives</hi>
from death which the Lord Jesus hath furnished
them withal.</p>
            <p>Having then fixed on the Demonstration of
the power of sin, from the <hi>effects</hi> it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
and having given a double instance hereof in
<hi>Believers</hi> themselves, I shall now farther evidence
the same truth, or pursue the same evidence of
it, by shewing somewhat of the power that it
acteth in them who are <hi>unregenerate,</hi> and so have
not the remedies against it which Believers are
furnished withal.</p>
            <p>I shall not handle the <hi>whole power of sin</hi> in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
persons, which is a very large field,
and not the business I have in hand; but only by
some <hi>few instances</hi> of its effects in them, intimate,
as I said, unto Believers, what they have to deal
withal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then, it appears in the <hi>violence</hi> it offers to
the nature of man, compelling them unto sins,
fully contrary to all the principles of the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42900:138"/>
nature wherewith they are endued from
God. Every creature of God hath in its creation,
a <hi>Law of operation</hi> implanted in it, which is the
rule of all that proceedeth from it, of all that it
doth of its own accord. So the fire ascends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
bodies that are weighty and heavy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend;
the water flows, each according to the
Principles of their nature, which give them the
<hi>Law of their Operation.</hi> That which hinders them
in their operation is force and violence, as that
which hinders a <hi>stone</hi> from descending, or the <hi>fire</hi>
from going upwards. That which forceth them
to move contrary to the Law of their nature, as
a stone to go upwards, or the fire to descend, is
in its kind the greatest <hi>violence,</hi> of which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
are endless. Now that which should take a
great <hi>Milstone,</hi> and fling it upwards into the air,
all would acknowledge to be a matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
force, power, and efficacy.</p>
            <p>Man also hath his <hi>Law of Operation</hi> and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concreated with him. And this may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
two ways; either, first, as it is <hi>common</hi> to
him with other creatures; or as <hi>peculiar,</hi> with
reference unto that special end for which he was
made. Some things are, I say, in this <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
common to man with other creatures;</hi> as to
nourish their young, to live quietly with them of
the same kind and race with them; to seek and
follow after that which is good for them in that
state and condition wherein they are created.
These are things which all <hi>bruit living creatures</hi>
have in the Law of their nature, as Man also hath.</p>
            <p>But now besides these things, man being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42900:138"/>
in an <hi>especial manner</hi> to give Glory to God
by rational and moral obedience, and so to obtain
a reward in the enjoyment of him; there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in the <hi>Law of his creation</hi> that are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to him; as to <hi>love God above all,</hi> to seek the
enjoyment of him as his chiefest Good and last
End, to enquire after his Mind and Will, and to
yield obedience, and the like. All which are
part of the Law of his Nature.</p>
            <p>Now these things are not distinguished so, as
though a man might perform the actions of the
Law of his nature which are common to him with
other creatures, meerly from the <hi>principles of his
nature</hi> as they do; but the <hi>Law of his dependance
upon God,</hi> and doing all things in obedience unto
him, passeth on them all also. He can never be
considered as a <hi>meer creature,</hi> but as a creature
made for the glory of God, by rational moral obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<hi>rational,</hi> because by him chosen, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with reason; and <hi>moral,</hi> because regulated
by a <hi>Law</hi> whereunto Reason doth attend.</p>
            <p>For instance; It is common to man with other
creatures, to <hi>take care for the nourishing of his
children,</hi> of the young helpless ones that receive
their being by him. There is implanted in him, in
the principles of his nature concreated with them,
a love and care for them; so is it with other living
creatures. Now let other creatures answer this
<hi>instinct &amp; inclination,</hi> and be not hardned against
them like the <hi>foolish Ostrich,</hi> unto whom God
hath not imparted this natural wisdom, <hi>Job</hi> 59. 16,
17. they fully answer the <hi>Law of their Creation.</hi>
With Man it is not so; it is not enough for him to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42900:139"/>
answer the <hi>instinct</hi> and secret impulse and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of his nature and kind, as in the nourishing
of his children; but he must do it also in <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to God,</hi> and obey him therein, and doing it
unto his glory; the Law of <hi>Moral Obedience</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
over all his whole being &amp; all his operations;
but in these things lie, as it were, the <hi>whole</hi> of a
man, namely in the things which are implanted
in his nature as a creature, common to him with
all other living creatures, seconded by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or Will of God, as he is a creature capable
of <hi>yielding moral obedience,</hi> and doing all things
for his glory.</p>
            <p>That then, which shall drive and compel a man
to transgress this <hi>Law of his nature,</hi> which is not
only as to <hi>throw milstones upward,</hi> to drive Beasts
from taking care of their young, to take from Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the same kind the <hi>hearding of themselves</hi>
in quietness, but moreover, to cast off what lies in
him his <hi>fundamental dependance on God,</hi> as a
creature made to yield him obedience, must needs
be esteemed of great force and efficacy.</p>
            <p>Now this is frequently done by <hi>Indwelling-sin,</hi>
in persons <hi>unregenerate.</hi> Let us take some few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
            <p>First, There is nothing that is more deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid
in the principles of the natures of all living
creatures, and so of man himself, than a love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and a care for the preservation and nourishing
of their young: many bruit creatures will <hi>die</hi> for
them, some feed them with their own flesh and
blood; all deprive themselves of that <hi>food</hi> which
nature directs them to as their best, to <hi>impart</hi> it
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42900:139"/>
to them; and acting in their behalf to the utmost
of their power.</p>
            <p>Now such is the efficacy, power, and force of
<hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> in man, an <hi>infection</hi> that the nature
of other creatures knows nothing of, that in many
it prevails to stop this fountain, to beat back the
stream of natural affections, to root up the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Law of nature, and to drive them
unto a <hi>neglect,</hi> a destruction of the <hi>fruit of their
own loins. Paul</hi> tells us of the old Gentiles, they
were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 31. <hi>without natural affection;</hi>
that which he aims at is that barbarous custom
among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who oft-times to spare the
trouble in the education of their children, and to
be at liberty to satisfie their lusts, <hi>destroyed their
own children from the womb.</hi> So far did the
strength of sin prevail to obliterate the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to repel the force and power of it.</p>
            <p>Examples of this nature are common in all
Nations; amongst our selves, of <hi>women murdering
their own children,</hi> through the deceitful reasoning
of sin. And herein sin turns the strong <hi>current</hi>
of nature, darkens all the <hi>light</hi> of God in the soul,
controuls all natural <hi>principles,</hi> influenced w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th
the power of the command &amp; will of God. But yet
this <hi>evil</hi> hath, through the efficacy of sin, received
a fearful aggravation. Men have not only <hi>slain,</hi> but
cruelly <hi>sacrificed</hi> their children to satisfie their
lusts. The Apostle reckons <hi>Idolatry,</hi> &amp; so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all <hi>superstition,</hi> among the works of the flesh,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20. that is, the fruit &amp; product of <hi>indwelling
sin.</hi> Now from hence it is that men have offered
that horrid and unspeakable violence to the Law
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42900:140"/>
of Nature mentioned. So the Psalmist tells us,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 37, 38. The same is again mentioned,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 7. 31. and in sundry other places. The whole
manner of that abomination I have elsewhere
declared. For the present it may suffice to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that they took their children and <hi>burnt them
to ashes</hi> in a soft fire; the wicked <hi>Priests</hi> that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in the sacrifice affording them this relief, that
they made a noise and clamour, that the vile
wretches might not hear the woful moans and
cries of the <hi>poor dying tormented Infants.</hi> I suppose
in this case we need no farther evidence. <hi>Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>
can give no rational account, they can only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the secret force of that <hi>little Fish,</hi> which,
they say, will stop a ship in full sail in the midst
of the Sea. And we must acknowledge, that it is
beyond our power to give an account of that <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
force,</hi> and unsearchable deceit that is in this
<hi>inbred</hi> Traitor, Sin; that cannot only stop the
course of nature, when all the <hi>sails</hi> of it that carry
it forward are so filled, as they are in that of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to children; but also <hi>drive it backward</hi>
with such a violence &amp; force, as to cause men so to
deal with their <hi>own children,</hi> as a good man would
not be hired with any reward to deal with his
<hi>dog.</hi> And it may not be to the disadvantage of the
<hi>best,</hi> to know and consider, that they carry that
about them, in them, which in others hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
these effects.</p>
            <p>The like may be spoken of all other sins against
the <hi>prime dictates</hi> of the Law of Nature, that
mankind is or hath been stained and defamed
withal. <hi>Murder</hi> of <hi>Parents</hi> and Children, of Wives
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42900:140"/>
and Husbands, <hi>Sodomy, Incest,</hi> and the like enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
in all which, sin prevails in men against
the <hi>whole Law of their Being</hi> and dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God.</p>
            <p>What should I reckon up the murders of <hi>Cain</hi>
and <hi>Abel,</hi> the treason of <hi>Judas,</hi> with their aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;
or remind the filth and villany of <hi>Nero,</hi>
in whom sin seemed to design an instance of what
it could <hi>debase the nature</hi> of man unto: In a word,
all the studied, premeditated <hi>perjuries;</hi> all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
bloody <hi>revenges;</hi> all the filth and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
all the enmity to God and his ways that is
in the world, is fruit growing from this root
alone.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It evidences its efficacy in keeping
men off from <hi>believing</hi> under the dispensation of
the Gospel. This evidence must be a little further
cleared.</p>
            <p>First, Under the dispensation of the Gospel,
there are <hi>but few that do believe.</hi> So the Preachers
of it complain, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 1. <hi>Who hath believed our
report?</hi> which the Apostle interprets of the <hi>pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi>
of Believers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 38. our Saviour Christ
himself tells us, that <hi>many are called,</hi> the Word is
preached unto many, but <hi>few are chosen.</hi> And so
the Church complains of its number, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 1.
<hi>Few</hi> there be who enter the <hi>narrow gate,</hi> daily
experience confirms this woful observation. How
many Villages, Parishes, yea, Towns may we go
unto, where the Gospel, it may be, hath been
preached many years, and perhaps scarce meet a
<hi>true Believer</hi> in them, &amp; one who shews forth the
death of Christ in his conversation. In the best
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42900:141"/>
places, and most eminent for profession, are not
such persons like the <hi>berries after the shaking of
an Olive-tree,</hi> two or three in the top of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
boughs, and 4 or 5 in the highest branches?</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is proposed to men in the
preaching of the Gospel, as <hi>motives unto Believing</hi>
every thing in conjunction, that <hi>severally</hi> prevail
with men to do what ever else they do in their
lives. What ever any one doth with consideration,
he doth it either because its <hi>reasonable</hi> &amp; <hi>good</hi> for
him so to do, or <hi>profitable</hi> &amp; advantagious, or <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,</hi>
or lastly, <hi>necessary</hi> for the avoidance of evil;
whatever, I say, men do with consideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be good or evil, whether it be in the works
of this life, or in things that lead to another; they
do it from one or other of the reasons or motives
mentioned. And, God knows, oft-times they are
very <hi>poor</hi> and mean in their kind, that men are
prevailed upon by. How often will men for a
very <hi>little pleasure,</hi> a very <hi>little profit,</hi> be induced
to do that which shall imbitter their lives, and
damn their souls. And what industry will they
use to avoid that which they apprehend <hi>evil</hi> or
grievous to them. And any one of these is enough
to <hi>oil the wheels</hi> of mens utmost endeavours, and
set men at work to the purpose.</p>
            <p>But now all these things centre in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of the Gospel, and the <hi>command of Believing;</hi>
and every one of them <hi>in a kind,</hi> that the whole
world can propose nothing like unto it.</p>
            <p>It is the most <hi>reasonable thing</hi> that can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the understanding of a man; that he
who thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ough his <hi>own default</hi> hath lost that <hi>way</hi>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:42900:141"/>
of bringiug glory of God, and saving his own soul,
(for which ends he was made) that he was
first placed in, should accept of, and embrace,
that other, blessed, easie, safe, excellent <hi>way,</hi> for
the attaining the ends mentioned, which God
in infinite Grace, Love, Mercy, Wisdom, and
Righteousness hath found out, and doth propose
unto him. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is the <hi>profitablest</hi> thing that a man
can possibly be invited unto; if there be any <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi>
or benefit, any advantage in the <hi>forgiveness of
sins,</hi> in the love and favour of God, in a blessed
immortality, in eternal glory. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is most <hi>pleasant</hi> also; surely it is a
pleasant thing to be brought out of <hi>darkness into
light,</hi> out of a dungeon unto a Throne, from
captivity and slavery to Satan and cursed lusts, to
the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a
thousand heavenly <hi>sweetnesses</hi> not now to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is surely <hi>necessary,</hi> and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the <hi>command of God,</hi> who hath the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority over us, but also indispensibly so
for the avoidance of <hi>eternal ruine</hi> of body and
soul, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16. It is constantly proposed under
these terms, believe, or you perish under the
weight of the wrath of the great God, and that for
evermore.</p>
            <p>But now notwithstanding that all these consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
are <hi>preached</hi> unto men, and pressed upon
them in the Name of the great God from day to
day, from one year to another; yet, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
observed, very <hi>few</hi> there are who set their
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42900:142"/>
hearts unto them, so as to embrace that which
they lead unto. Tell men <hi>ten thousand times,</hi> that
this is Wisdom, yea, Riches, that all their profit
lies in it, that they will assuredly and eternally pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
&amp; that it may be within a few hours, if they
receive not the Gospel, assure them that it is their
<hi>only interest</hi> and concernment, let them know that
God himself speaks all this unto them; yet all is
one, they regard it not, set not their hearts unto
it, but, as it were, plainly say, <hi>We will have nothing
to do with these things;</hi> they will rather perish in
their lusts than accept of mercy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is <hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> that both disena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
men unto, and hinders them from believing,
&amp; that alone. <hi>Blindness</hi> of mind, stubbornness of the
will, sensuality of the affections, all concur to
keep poor perishing souls at a distance from Christ.
Men are made <hi>blind</hi> by sin, and cannot see his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
<hi>obstinate</hi> and will not lay hold of his
Righteousness <hi>senseless</hi> and take no notice of their
own eternal concernments.</p>
            <p>Now certainly that which can prevail with
men wise and sober, and prudent in other things,
to neglect and despise the love of God, the blood
of Christ, the eternal welfare of their own souls,
upon weak and worthless pretences, must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to have an astonishable force and
efficacy accompanying it.</p>
            <p>Whose heart, who hath once heard of the ways
of God, can but bleed to see <hi>poor souls</hi> eternally
perishing under a <hi>thousand gracious invitations,</hi>
to accept of mercy and pardon in the blood of
Christ? And can we but be astonished at the power
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42900:142"/>
of that principle from whence it is, that they
run headlong to their own destruction? And yet
all this befals them from the power and deceit of
<hi>sin</hi> that dwelleth in them.</p>
            <p>3. It is evident in their <hi>total Apostasies.</hi> Many
Men not really converted, are much wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Word. The Apostle tells us, that they
do <hi>clean escape them that live in Error,</hi> as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.
18. They separate themselves from Idolatry and
false Worship, owning and professing the Truth;
and they also escape <hi>the pollution of the world, ver.</hi>
20. that is, the <hi>corruption that is in the world,
through lust,</hi> as he expresseth it, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verse</hi> 4.
those filthy corrupt and unclean ways, which the
Men of the world, in the pursuit of their lusts, do
walk and live in; these they <hi>escape</hi> from, in the
amendment of their lives, and ordering of their
Conversation according to the Convictions which
they have from the Word. For so he tells us,
that all this is brought about, <hi>through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;</hi> that
is, by the preaching of the Gospel; they are so
far wrought upon, <hi>as to forsake</hi> all ways of false
Worship, to <hi>profess</hi> the truth, to <hi>reform</hi> their
lives, and to walk answerable to the Convictions
that are upon them.</p>
            <p>By this means do they gain the Reputation of
Professors, <hi>They have a Name to live,</hi> Rev. 3. 1.
and are made partakers of some, or all of those
<hi>priviledges</hi> of the Gospel, that are numbred by
the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>It is not my present business to shew <hi>how far,</hi>
or wherein a Man may be <hi>effectually wrought</hi> upon
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42900:143"/>
by the Word, and yet not be <hi>really wrought</hi> over
to close with Christ; or what may be the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
bounds and limits of a <hi>common work</hi> of grace
upon unregenerate Men; It is on all hands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
that it may be carryed on so far, that it
is very difficult to discern between its effects and
productions, and those of that Grace which is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
and saving.</p>
            <p>But now, notwithstanding all this, we see
many of these daily <hi>fall off from God,</hi> utterly and
wickedly some into <hi>debaucherie</hi> and uncleanness,
some to <hi>worldliness</hi> and covetousness, some to be
<hi>Persecutors</hi> of the Saints, all to the perdition of
their own souls. How this comes about, the
Apostle declares in that place mentioned; they
are, saith he, <hi>entangled</hi> again; to <hi>entice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle</hi>
as I have shewed before from <hi>James</hi> 1. 14,
15. is the proper work of <hi>Indwelling Sin;</hi> it is
that alone which <hi>entangles</hi> the Soul; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speaks <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>They are allured from their
whole Profession,</hi> into cursed Apostasie through the
lusts of the flesh.</p>
            <p>It prevails upon them through its deceit and
power to an utter <hi>relinquishment of their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and their whole engagement unto God: And
this several ways evinces the greatness of its
strength and efficacy:</p>
            <p>1. In that it giveth stop or control unto that
<hi>exceeding greatness of power</hi> which is put forth in
the Word, in their Conviction and Reformation.
We see it by experience, that Men are not <hi>easily
wrought</hi> upon by the Word; the most of men can
live under the dispensation of it all the dayes of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42900:143"/>
their lives, and continue as sensless and stupid as
the <hi>seats</hi> they sit upon, or the flint in the Rock
of Stone. Mighty difficulties, and prejudices must
be conquered, great <hi>stroaks</hi> must be given to the
Conscience before this can be brought about. It
is as the stopping of a <hi>River</hi> in his course, and
turning his streams another way; the hindering
of a <hi>stone</hi> in his falling downwards, or the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of the <hi>wild Ass,</hi> when furiously set to
pursue his way, as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 24.
to turn Men from their corrupt ways, sins and
pleasures, to make them <hi>pray, fast, hear,</hi> and do
many things contrary to the Principle of flesh,
which is secretly predominant in them, willingly
and gladly; to cause them to <hi>profess Christ</hi> and
the Gospel, it may be under some tryals and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
to give them <hi>Light</hi> to see into sundry
mysteries, and <hi>gifts</hi> for the discharge of sundry
duties; to make <hi>dead,</hi> blind, sensless Men, to <hi>walk,</hi>
and <hi>talk,</hi> and do all the outward offices and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of living and healthy Men; with the like
attendencies of Conviction and Reformation, are
the effects and products of mighty power and
strength. Indeed the power that the Holy Ghost
puts forth by the word, in the staggering and
<hi>conviction</hi> of sinners, in the <hi>wakning</hi> of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
the <hi>enlightening</hi> of their minds, the
<hi>changing</hi> of their affections, the <hi>awing</hi> of their
hearts, the <hi>reforming</hi> of their <hi>lives,</hi> and <hi>compelling</hi>
them to duties, is unexpressible.</p>
            <p>But now, unto all these is there <hi>check</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol
given by <hi>Indwelling Sin.</hi> It prevails against
this <hi>whole work</hi> of the Spirit by the Word, with
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42900:144"/>
all the advantages of Providential Dispensations,
in Afflictions and Mercies, wherewith it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
When Sin is once enraged, all these
things become but like the withs &amp; cords where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Sampson</hi> was bound before his head was
shaven: Cry but to it, the <hi>Philistines</hi> are upon
thee, here is a <hi>subtle, a suitable temptation,</hi> now
shew thy strength and efficacy, all these things
become like <hi>Towe that have smelt the fire. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
is stifled, <hi>Reputation</hi> in the Church of God
despised, <hi>Light</hi> supplanted, the <hi>impressions</hi> of the
Word cast off, <hi>convictions</hi> digested, Heaven and
Hell are despised; Sin makes its way through all,
and utterly turns the Soul from the good and
right ways of God. Sometimes it doth this
subtilly by <hi>imperceptible degrees,</hi> taking off all
force of former impressions from the Spirit, by the
Word, sullying Conscience by degrees, hardning
the Heart, and making sensual the Affections by
various workings, that the poor <hi>backslider in heart</hi>
scarce knows what he is doing, until he be
come to the very bottom of all impiety, profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and enmity against God. Sometimes falling
in conjunction with some <hi>vigorous temptation,</hi> it
suddenly, and at once plunges the Soul into a
course of alienation from God, and the profession
of his ways.</p>
            <p>2. It takes them off from those <hi>hopes of Heaven,</hi>
which upon their Convictions, Obedience, and
<hi>temporary Faith</hi> or believing, they had attained.
There is a <hi>general hope of Heaven,</hi> or at least of
the escaping of Hell, of an <hi>untroublesome immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
in the most sottish and stupid Souls in the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42900:144"/>
World, who either by tradition or instruction
from the Word, are perswaded that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
state of things to come after this life; but it
is in <hi>unconvinced,</hi> unenlightened Persons, a dull,
senseless, unaffecting thing, that hath no other
hold upon them, nor power in them, but only to
keep them free from the trouble and perplexity
of contrary thoughts and apprehensions. The
matter is otherwise with them who by the
Word are so wrought upon as we have before
declared; their <hi>hope of Heaven</hi> and a blessed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
is oft-times accompanied with great
<hi>joyes,</hi> and exultations, and is a relief unto them,
under and against the worst of their fears and
trials; It is such, as they would not <hi>part withal</hi>
for all the World; and upon all occasions they
retreat in their minds unto it, for comfort and
relief.</p>
            <p>Now all this by the <hi>Power of Sin</hi> are they
prevailed withal to forgo. Let Heaven go if
it will, a blessed Immortality with the enjoyment
of God himself, Sin must be served, and provision
made to fulfil the lusts thereof.</p>
            <p>If a Man, in the things of this World, had
such a hope of a large <hi>Inheritance,</hi> of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as wherein he is satisfied that it will not
fail him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that in the issue he shall surely enjoy
it, and lead an happy and a glorious life in the
possession of it many dayes; if one should go to
him and tell him, It is true, the <hi>Kingdom</hi> you
look for is an ample and honourable Dominion,
full of all good things desirable, and you may
attain it; but come, cast away all hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42900:145"/>
of it, and come joyn with Me in the
<hi>service and slavery</hi> of such or such an oppressing
Tyrant. You will easily grant; he must have
some strange bewitching power with him, that
should prevail with a Man in his wits to follow
his advice.</p>
            <p>Yet thus it is, and much more so in the case
we have in hand. Sin it self cannot deny, but
that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> which the Soul is in
hope and expectation of, is glorious and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
nor doth it go about to convince him, that
his thoughts of it are <hi>vain,</hi> and such as will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, but plainly prevails with him to
cast away his <hi>hopes,</hi> to despise his <hi>Kingdom</hi>
that he was in expectation of, and that upon
no other motive but that he may serve some
<hi>worldly, cruel,</hi> or filthy and sensual lust; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
here lies a secret efficacy, whose depths
cannot be fathomed.</p>
            <p>3. The Apostle manifests the power of the
entanglements of sin in and upon <hi>Apostates,</hi> in
that it turns them off from <hi>the way of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
after they have known it,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. It will
be found at the last day <hi>an evil thing and a bitter,</hi>
that Men live all their days in the service of sin,
self, and the World, refusing to make any <hi>trial</hi>
of the <hi>ways of God</hi> whereunto they are invited;
though they have no experience of their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
beauty, pleasantness, safety, yet having
evidence brought unto them from God himself,
that they are so, the refusal of them will, I say,
be <hi>bitterness</hi> in the latter end. But their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is yet far worse, who as the Apostle speaks,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42900:145"/>
having <hi>known the way of righteousness,</hi> are by the
power of <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi> turned aside from the
holy Commandment. To leave God for the
Devil, after a Man hath made some trial of <hi>him</hi>
and his service; Heaven for Hell; after a Man
hath had some chearing, refreshing thoughts of
it, the fellowship of the Saints, for an <hi>Alehouse</hi>
or a <hi>brothel-house;</hi> after a man hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto their Communion, and tasted of the
pleasantness of it, to leave walking in pure, clear,
streight paths, to <hi>wallow in mire,</hi> draughts and
filth, this will be for a <hi>lamentation;</hi> Yet this
doth sin prevail upon <hi>Apostates</hi> unto; and that
against all their Light, Conviction, Experiences,
Professions, Engagements, or whatever may be
<hi>strong</hi> upon them to keep them to the known
ways of Righteousness.</p>
            <p>4. It evinces its strength in them by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
with them unto <hi>a total renunciation of
God</hi> as revealed in Christ, and the Power of all
Gospel-Truth, <hi>in the Sin against the Holy Ghost.</hi>
I do not now precisely determine what is the
<hi>Sin against the Holy Ghost;</hi> nor wherein it doth
consist. There are different apprehensions of it;
all agree in this; that by it an end is put to <hi>all
dealings between God and Man in a way of Grace.</hi>
It is a sin unto death. And this doth the hardness
and blindness of many Mens hearts bring them
to; they are by them at length set out of the
reach of Mercy. <hi>They chuse to have no more to do
with God;</hi> and God swears that they shall never
enter into his Rest. So <hi>Sin brings forth death.</hi>
A Man by it, is brought to renounce the End for
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42900:146"/>
which he was made; <hi>wilfully</hi> to reject the Means
of his coming to the enjoyment of God, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
him to his face; and so to perish in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
            <p>I have not mentioned these things, as though
I hoped by them to set out to the <hi>full the power
of Indwelling Sin in unregenerate Men;</hi> only by
a few Instances I thought to give a glimpse of it.
He that would have a fuller view of it, had need
only to <hi>open his eyes,</hi> to take a little view of that
wickedness which <hi>reigneth,</hi> yea <hi>rageth</hi> all the
World over. Let him consider the prevailing
flood of the things mentioned by <hi>Paul</hi> to be <hi>the
fruits of the flesh,</hi> Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. that is, among
the Sons of Men, in all places, Nations, Cities,
Towns, Parishes; and then let him add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
but this one consideration, that the World,
which is full of the steam, filth, and blood of
these abominations, as to their outward actings
of them, is a <hi>Pleasant Garden,</hi> a <hi>Paradise,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the heart of Man, wherein they are all
conceived, and hourly <hi>millions</hi> of more vile abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
which being stifled in the womb, by
some of the wayes before insisted on, they are
never able to bring forth to light. Let a Man
I say using the Law for his Light and Rule, take
this course, and if he have any spiritual discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he may quickly attain satisfaction in this
matter.</p>
            <p>And I shewed in the entrance of this discourse,
how this consideration doth fully confirm the
Truth proposed.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The strength of Sin Evidenced from its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
unto the power of the Law.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE measure of the strength of any <hi>Person,</hi>
or <hi>defenced City,</hi> may be well taken from <hi>the
opposition</hi> that they are able to withstand, and not
be prevailed against. If we hear of a City that
hath endured <hi>a long siege</hi> from a potent Enemy,
and yet is not taken or conquered, whose walls
have endured great <hi>batteries,</hi> and are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished,
though we have never seen the place,
yet we conclude it <hi>strong,</hi> if not impregnable.</p>
            <p>And this Consideration will also evidence the
power and strength of <hi>Indwelling-sin;</hi> it is able <hi>to
hold out,</hi> and not only to <hi>live,</hi> but also to secure
its reign and dominion against very strong <hi>opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
that is made unto it.</p>
            <p>I shall instance only in <hi>the opposition that is made
unto it, by the Law,</hi> which is oft-times <hi>great and
terrible,</hi> alwayes <hi>fruitless;</hi> all its assaults are born
by it, and it is not prevailed against. There are
sundry things wherein the Law <hi>opposeth</hi> it self to
sin, and the power of it. As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It <hi>discovers</hi> it; sin in the Soul is like a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<hi>hectical</hi> distemper in the body; its being <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi>
and unperceived, is one great means of its
prevalency. Or as Traytors in a <hi>Civil State,</hi>
whilest they lye hid, they vigorously carry on their
design. The greatest part of Men in the World,
know nothing of this <hi>sickness,</hi> yea <hi>death</hi> of their
Souls. Though they have been taught somewhat
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42900:147"/>
of the <hi>doctrine</hi> of it, yet they know nothing of its
<hi>power.</hi> They know it not so, as to deal with it
as their mortal Enemy. As a Man, whatever he be
told, cannot be said to know, that he hath an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>hectical Feaver,</hi> if he love his life, and set no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
himself to stop its progress.</p>
            <p>This then the Law doth, it <hi>discovers this enemy;</hi>
it convinceth the soul that there is such a traitor
harbouring in his bosome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>I had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
known sin but by the Law, for I had not known lust,
except the Law had said, Thou shalt non covet.</hi> I
had not known it, that is, fully, clearly, distinctly.
<hi>Conscience</hi> will somewhat tumultuate about it; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
a man cannot know it clearly and distinctly from
thence. It gives a man such a sight of it, as the
blind man had in the Gospel upon the first touch
of his eyes, <hi>He saw men like trees walking,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely,
confusedly; but when the Law comes, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
gives the soul <hi>a distinct sight of this indwelling-sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Again, <hi>I had not known it,</hi> that is, the <hi>depths</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
it, the root, the habitual inclination of my nature to
sin, which is here called <hi>lust;</hi> as it is by <hi>James,
chap.</hi> 1. 14. I had not known it, or not known it
to be sin, but by the Law.</p>
            <p>This then the Law doth, it draws out this
<hi>Traitor</hi> from its secret lurking places, the intimate
recesses of the soul. A man when the Law comes,
is no more ignorant of his enemy; if the will now
perish by him, it is openly and knowingly; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but say that the Law <hi>warned</hi> him of him, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
him unto him, yea, and raised a <hi>concourse
about him</hi> in the soul of various affections, as an
<hi>Officer</hi> doth, that discovers a <hi>Thief</hi> or <hi>Robber,</hi>
calling out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or assistance to apprehend him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:42900:147"/>
Secondly, The Law not only <hi>discovers</hi> sin, but
discovers it to be a very <hi>bad inmate,</hi> dangerous,
yea, pernicious to the soul. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>Was then
that which is good</hi> (that is, the Law) <hi>made death
unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear
sin, working death in me by that which is good, that
sin by the commandment might become exceeding
sinful.</hi> There are many things in this <hi>verse</hi> wherein
we are not at present concerned; that which I only
aim at, is, the <hi>manifestation</hi> of sin by the Law; it
<hi>appears to be sin;</hi> and the manifestation of it in its
own colours; it appears to be <hi>exceeding sinful.</hi>
The Law gives the soul to know the <hi>filth</hi> and <hi>guilt</hi>
of this <hi>Indwelling-sin,</hi> how great they are, how
vile it is; what an abomination, what an enmity to
God, how hated of him, the soul shall never more
look upon it as a <hi>small matter,</hi> what thoughts
soever it had of it before, whereby it is greatly
surprized.</p>
            <p>As a man that finds himself somewhat distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
sending for a <hi>Physician</hi> of skill, when he
comes, requires his judgement of his distemper.
He considering his condition, tells him, Alas, I
am sorry for you, the case is far otherwise with
you than you imagine, your <hi>disease is mortal,</hi> and
it hath proceeded so far pressing upon your spirits,
and infecting the whole <hi>mass of your blood,</hi> that I
doubt unless most effectual remedies be used, you
will live but a very few hours.</p>
            <p>So is it in this case, a man may have some <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
in his mind and conscience about <hi>Indwelling-sin;</hi>
he finds all not well, as it should be with him, more
from the <hi>effects</hi> of sin, and its continual eruptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
than the nature of it, which he hopes to wrestle
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42900:148"/>
withall: but now when the <hi>Law</hi> comes, that lets
the soul know, that its disease is <hi>deadly and mortal,</hi>
that it is exceding sinful, as being the root and
cause of all his alienation from God; and thus also
the Law proceeds against it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Law <hi>judgeth the person,</hi> or lets
the sinner plainly know what he is to <hi>expect</hi> upon
the account of this sin. This is the Laws proper
work, its <hi>discovering</hi> property is but <hi>preparative</hi>
to its <hi>judging.</hi> The Law is it self, when it is in
the Throne. Here it minceth not the matter with
sinners, as we use to do one with another, but
tells him plainly, <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> in whom this
exceeding sinful sin doth dwell, and you must
answer for the guilt of it. And this, methinks,
if any thing, should <hi>rouze up a man</hi> to set himself
in opposition to it, yea, utterly to destroy it. The
Law lets him know that upon the account of this
sin, he is obnoxious to the curse and wrath
of the great God against him; yea, pronounceth
the sentence of <hi>everlasting condemnation</hi> upon
him upon that account: abide in this state and
perish, is its language. It leaves not the soul
without this <hi>warning</hi> in this world, and will leave
it without <hi>excuse</hi> on that account in the world to
come.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Law so follows on its sentence,
that it <hi>disquiets</hi> and affrights the soul, and suffers
in not to enjoy the least <hi>rest</hi> or quietness in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
its sinful inmate. When ever the soul hath
indulged to its commands, made provision for it,
immediately the Law <hi>flies upon it,</hi> with the wrath
and terrour of the Lord, makes it quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
It shall h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve no rest, but is like a poor beast th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42900:148"/>
hath a deadly arrow sticking in its sides, that makes
it restless where ever it is, and whatever it doth.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Law stays not here, but also it
<hi>slays</hi> the soul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 3. that is, by its conviction
of the nature, power, and desert of this <hi>indwelling-sin,</hi>
it deprives him in whom it is of all that life of
<hi>self-righteousness and hope,</hi> which formerly he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
himself withall: It leaves him as a poor,
dead, helpless, hopeless creature. And all this in
the pursuit of that opposition that it makes against
this sin. May we not now expect, that the power of
it will be <hi>quelled,</hi> and its strength broken; that it
will <hi>die</hi> away before these strokes of the Law of
God; but the truth is, such is its power and strength,
that it is quite otherwise; like him whom the <hi>Poets</hi>
feign to be born of the Earth, when one thought to
slay him by casting him on the ground, by every
fall he recovered new strength, and was more
vigorous than formerly: So is it with all the falls
and repulses that are given to <hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> by the
Law. For,</p>
            <p>First, It is not <hi>conquered.</hi> A conquest infers two
things in respect of the conquered: First, <hi>Loss of
Dominion;</hi> and, secondly, <hi>loss of strength.</hi> Where
ever any one is <hi>conquered,</hi> he is dispoiled of both
these. He loseth both his authority and his power.
So the strong man armed, being prevailed against,
he is <hi>bound,</hi> and his <hi>goods</hi> are spoiled. But now
neither of these befalls <hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
of the Law; it loseth not one jot of its
<hi>dominion</hi> nor <hi>strength</hi> by all the blows that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto it. The <hi>Law cannot</hi> do this thing, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 3. it cannot deprive sin of its power and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;
for he <hi>that is under the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w is also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:42900:149"/>
sin;</hi> that is, what ever power the Law gets upon
the conscience of a man, so that he fears to sin, lest
the sentence and curse of it should befall him, yet
sin still <hi>reigns and rules</hi> in his heart. Therefore saith
the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Sin shall not have dominion
over you, for you are not under the Law but under
Grace;</hi> intimating plainly that though a Person be
in never so much subjection to the Authority of the
Law, yet that will not exempt and acquit him from
the <hi>dominion of sin.</hi> Yea, the Law by all its work
upon the Soul, instead of freeing and acquitting it
from the reign of sin, and bondage unto it, doth
accidentally greatly increase its misery and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage;
As the sentence of the Judge on the Bench
against a Malefactor adds to his misery. The
Soul is under the <hi>dominion of sin,</hi> and it may be,
abides in its wofull condition in much security;
fearing neither Sin nor Judgement. The Law
setting upon him in this condition by all the wayes
forementioned, brings him into great trouble and
perplexity, fear and terrour, but <hi>delivers him
not at all.</hi> So that it is with the Soul, as it was
with the <hi>Israelites</hi> when <hi>Moses</hi> had delivered his
Message unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> they were so far from
getting liberty by it, that their bondage was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
<hi>and they found that they were in a very evil
case;</hi> Exod. 5. 17. yea and we shall see, that sin
doth like <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> finding its rule disturbed, it
grows more <hi>outragiously oppressive,</hi> and doubles
the bondage of their Souls. This is not then the
work of the Law to <hi>destroy</hi> sin, or deprive it of
that dominion which it hath by nature.</p>
            <p>Nor doth it by all these <hi>stroaks of the Law</hi> lose
any thing of its <hi>strength.</hi> It continues both its
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42900:149"/>
authority and its force; It is neither destroyed,
nor weakned. Yea,</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is so far from being <hi>conquered,</hi> that
it is only <hi>enraged.</hi> The whole work of the Law,
doth only provoke and enrage sin; and cause it as it
hath opportunity, to put out its strength with more
power and vigour and force than formerly. This
the Apostle shews at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>But you will say, Do we not see it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
that many are wrought upon by the <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Law</hi> to a relinquishment of many sins,
and amendment of their Lives, and to a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
against the Eruptions of those other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
which they cannot yet mortifie; and it
cannot be denyed, but that great is the power and
<hi>efficacy</hi> of the Law, when preached and applyed to
the Conscience in a due manner: I answer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is acknowledged, that very great and
effectual is the power of the Law of God. Great
are the effects that are wrought by it; and it shall
surely accomplish every <hi>end</hi> for which of God it
is appointed. But yet the <hi>subduing of sin,</hi> is none of
its work; it is not designed of God unto that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
and therefore it is no dishonour, if it cannot
do that which is not its proper work, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whatever effects it have upon <hi>some,</hi>
yet we see that in the <hi>most,</hi> such is the power and
prevalency of sin, that it takes no impression at all
upon them. May you not see every where men
living many years in Congregations where the
<hi>Law is powerfully preached,</hi> and applyed unto the
Consciences as to all the ends and purposes for
which the Lord is pleased to make use of it, and
not once be moved by it; that receive no more
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42900:150"/>
impression from the stroaks of it, than blows with
a straw would give to an <hi>Adamant.</hi> They are
neither <hi>convinced</hi> by it, nor <hi>terrifyed,</hi> nor <hi>awed,</hi>
nor <hi>instructed,</hi> but continue deaf, ignorant, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
secure, as if they had never been told of the
guilt of sin, or terrour of the Lord. Such as these are
Congregations full of, who proclaim the <hi>trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing
power</hi> of sin, over the dispensation of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When any of the Effects mentioned are
wrought, it is not from the power of <hi>the letter of
the Law,</hi> but from the actual efficacy of the Spirit of
God, putting forth his vertue &amp; power for that end
and purpose; And we deny not but that the Spirit of
the Lord is able to restrain and quell the power of
lust when he pleaseth; and some wayes whereby he
is pleased so to do we have formerly considered. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Notwithstanding all that may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
of the <hi>power of the Law</hi> upon the Souls of
Men, yet it is most evident that Lust is not <hi>conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
nor subdued, nor mortified by it. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Though the <hi>course</hi> of sin may be <hi>repelled</hi>
for a season by the dispensation of the Law, yet the
<hi>Spring</hi> and Fountain of it, is not dryed up thereby,
Though it withdraws and hides it self for a season,
it is as I have elsewhere shewed, but to <hi>shift</hi> out of
a storm, and then to return again. As a <hi>Travailer,</hi>
in his way meeting with a violent storm of thunder
and rain, immediately turns out of his way, to some
House or Tree for his shelter; but yet this causeth
him not to <hi>give over his Journey;</hi> so soon as the
storm is over, he returns to his way and progress
again. So is it with Men in <hi>bondage</hi> unto sin: They
are in a course of pursuing their lusts; the <hi>Law</hi>
meets with them in a storm of thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42900:150"/>
from Heaven, terrifies and hinders them in
their way; this turns them for a <hi>season</hi> out of their
course, they will run to prayer or amendment of
life, for some shelter from the storm of wrath which
is feared coming upon their Consciences. But is
their course stopped, are their Principles altered?
not at all; so soon as the storm is over, that they
begin to wear out that sense and the terrour that
was upon them, they return to their former course,
in the service of sin again. This was the state with
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> once and again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In such seasons sin is not <hi>conquered</hi> but
<hi>diverted.</hi> When it seems to fall under the power
of the Law, indeed it is only <hi>turned</hi> into a new
channell, it is not dryed up. If you go and set a
<hi>damm</hi> against the streams of a River, that you suffer
no water to pass in the old course and channel, but
it breaks out another way, and turns all its streams
in a new course, you will not say you have <hi>dryed up
that River;</hi> though some that come and look into
the <hi>old channel</hi> may think perhaps that the waters
are utterly gone; so is it in this case; the streams of
sin it may be run in open <hi>sensuality,</hi> and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
in drunkenness and vitiousness; the <hi>preaching of
the Law</hi> sets a <hi>damm</hi> against these course; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is terrified, and the Man dares not walk in
the wayes wherein he hath been formerly ingaged;
His <hi>Companions</hi> in sin not finding him in his <hi>old
wayes</hi> begin to laugh at him, as one that is <hi>converted</hi>
and growing precise; Professors themselves begin
to be perswaded, that the work of God is upon his
heart, because they see his old streams dryed up; but
if there have been only a <hi>work of the Law</hi> upon
him, there is a <hi>damm</hi> put to his course, but the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42900:151"/>
               <hi>Spring of sin</hi> is not dryed up, only the streams of it
are turned another way: It may be the Man is
fallen upon other more <hi>secret,</hi> or more <hi>spiritual</hi>
sins; or if he be beat from them also, the whole
strength of lust and sin will take up its residence in
self-righteousness, and pour out thereby as filthy
streams as in any other way whatever. So that
notwithstanding the <hi>whole work of the Law</hi> upon
the Souls of Men, <hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> will keep <hi>alive</hi> in
them still, which is another evidence of its great
power and strength.</p>
            <p>I shall yet touch upon some other evidences of
the same truth, that I have under consideration;
but I shall be brief in them: In the next place then,
the great <hi>endeavours of Men ignorant of the
Righteousness of Christ</hi> for the <hi>subduing</hi> and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of sin, which are all fruitless, do evidence
the great strength and power of it.</p>
            <p>Men who have no <hi>strength against sin,</hi> may yet be
made sensible of the <hi>strength of sin.</hi> The way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
for the most part they come to that knowledge,
is by some previous sense that they have of the
<hi>guilt</hi> of sin. This Men have by the Light of their
Consciences; they cannot avoid it: This is not a
thing in their choyce, whether they will or no, they
cannot but know sin to be evil, and that such an evil
that renders them obnoxious to the Judgement of
God. This galls the Minds and Consciences of
some so far, as that they are kept in awe, and
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re not sin as they would. Being awed with a
sense of the guilt of sin, and the terrour of the Lord,
Men begin to endeavour to <hi>abstain from sin,</hi> at
least from such sins as they have been most terrified
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bout. Whilest they have this design in hand, the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42900:151"/>
strength and power of sin begins to discover it self
unto them; They begin to finde that there is <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them,</hi> that is not in their own power; for
notwithstanding their resolutions and purposes,
they <hi>sin still;</hi> and that so, or in such a manner, as
that their Consciences inform them that they must
therefore perish eternally. This puts them on <hi>self-endeavours</hi>
to suppress the eruption of sin, because
they cannot be quiet unless so they do; nor have any
rest or peace within. Now being ignorant of that
only way whereby sin is to be mortified, that is <hi>by
the Spirit of Christ,</hi> they fix on many wayes in their
own strength to suppress it, if not to slay it; as
being ignorant of that only way whereby Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
burthened with the guilt of sin may be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
that is by the blood of Christ; they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
by many other wayes to accomplish that end
in vain; for no Man by any self-endeavours can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
peace with God. Some of the wayes whereby
they endeavour to suppress the power of sin, which
casts them into an unquiet condition, and their
insufficiency for that end, we must look into.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They will promise and bind themselves by
<hi>Vows</hi> from those sins, which they have been most
liable unto, and so have been most perplexed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
The <hi>Psalmist</hi> shews this to be one great Engine
whereby false and <hi>hypocritical</hi> Persons do endeavour
to extricate and deliver themselves out of trouble
and perplexity; They make <hi>Promises to God;</hi> which
he calls, <hi>flutering him with the lips,</hi> Psal. 78. 36.
So is it in this case; being freshly galled with the
guilt of any sin, that by the power of their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
they, it may be, have frequently been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in, they <hi>vow</hi> and <hi>promise,</hi> that at least for some
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42900:152"/>
               <hi>such space of time</hi> as they will limit, they will not
commit that sin again, and this course of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is prescribed unto them by some who pretend
to direct their Consciences in this Duty. Conscience
of this, now makes them watch over themselves as
to the outward act of the sin that they are galled
with; and so it hath one of these two effects; for
either they do abstain from it for the time they have
prefixed; or they do not: If they do not, as seldom
they do, especially if it be a sin that hath a peculiar
root in their nature and constitution, and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by custom into an habit, if any suitable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
be presented unto them; their sin is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and therewith their terrour, and they are wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
discouraged in making any opposition to sin;
and therefore for the most part after <hi>one</hi> or two
vain attempts, or more it may be, knowing no other
way to mortifie sin, but this of <hi>vowing</hi> against it, and
keeping of that Vow in their own strength, they
give over <hi>all contests,</hi> and become wholly the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of sin, being bounded only by outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
without any serious endeavours for a
recovery. Or <hi>Secondly,</hi> suppose that they have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
in their Resolutions, and do abstain from actual
sins their appointed season; commonly one of these
two things ensue; either they think that they have
<hi>well discharged their Duty,</hi> and so may a little now,
at least for a season, indulge to their corruptions, and
lusts, and so are entangled again in the same snares
of sin as formerly; or else they reckon that their
<hi>vow and promise</hi> hath preserved them, and so <hi>sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to their own net and drag,</hi> setting up a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of their own against the grace of God;
which is so far from weakning <hi>Indwelling-sin,</hi> that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42900:152"/>
it strengthens it in the root and Principle, that it
may hereafter reign in the Soul in security. Or
at the most, the best success that can be imagined
unto this way of dealing with sin, is but the <hi>restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of some outward eruptions of it, which tends
nothing to the weakning of its power; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such persons by all their endeavours are very
far from being freed from the inward <hi>toyling, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
disquieting, perplexing power of sin. And this
is the state of most Men that are kept in <hi>bondage</hi>
under the power of <hi>conviction;</hi> Hell, Death, and
the Wrath of God are continually presented unto
their <hi>Consciences;</hi> this makes them labour with all
their strength against that in sin which most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth
their Consciences, and most increaseth their
fears; that is the <hi>actual eruption</hi> of it; for, for the
most part while they are freed from that, they are
fafe; though in the mean time, sin lye tumultuating
in and defiling of the heart continually. As with
running fores, outward <hi>repelling medicines</hi> may
skin them over, and hinder their corruption from
coming forth; but the issue of them is, that they
cause them to <hi>fester</hi> inwardly, and so prove, though
it may be not so <hi>noysome</hi> and offensive as they were
before, yet far more <hi>dangero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> So is it with this
repelling of the power of co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ption by <hi>Mens
Vows,</hi> and promises against it; <hi>external eruptions</hi>
are it may be restrained for a season; but the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
root</hi> and principle is not weakned in the least.
And most commonly this is the issue of this way;
that <hi>sin</hi> having gotten more strength, and being
enraged by its restraint, breaks all its bounds,
and captivates the Soul unto all filthy abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
which is the Principle as was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42900:153"/>
of most of the <hi>visible Apostasies</hi> which we
have in the World, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghost compares sinners, because of
the <hi>odious,</hi> fierce, poysonous nature of this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling-sin,</hi>
unto <hi>Lyons, Bears,</hi> and <hi>Asps, Isa.</hi> 11. 6,
7, 8, 9. Now this is the excellency of Gospel-grace,
that it changes the <hi>Nature</hi> and inward Principles
of these otherwise passionate and untamed Beasts,
making the <hi>Wolf</hi> as the <hi>Kid,</hi> the <hi>Lyon</hi> as the <hi>Lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
and the <hi>Bear</hi> as the <hi>Cow.</hi> When this is effected,
they may safely be trusted in; a <hi>little Childe may
lead them:</hi> But these <hi>self-endeavours</hi> do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
all change the Nature, but restrain their outwar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
violence: He that takes a <hi>Lyon,</hi> or a <hi>Wolf,</hi> and
shuts him up from ravening, whilest yet his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
violence remains, may well expect that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
one time or other they will break their bonds, and
fall to their former wayes of rapine and violence.
However, shutting them up, doth not as we see,
change their Natures, but only restrain their <hi>rag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
from doing open spoyl. So it is in this case; it is
Grace alone that <hi>changeth the heart,</hi> and takes
away that poyson and fiercerness that is in
them by nature; Mens <hi>self-endeavours</hi> do b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
coerce them as to some outward eruptions.
But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Beyond bare <hi>Vows and Promises</hi> with
some watchfulness to observe them in a rational use
of ordinary means, Men have put, and some do yet
put themselves on <hi>extraordinary wayes</hi> of mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sin. This is the foundation of all that hath <hi>a
shew of Wisdom and Religion</hi> in the Papacy; their
hours of Prayer, Fastings, their immuring and
cloystering themselves, their Pilgrimages, Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:42900:153"/>
and self-torturing Discipline, spring all from
this root. I shall not speak of the <hi>innumerable evils</hi>
that have attended these self-invented wayes of
<hi>Mortification,</hi> and how they all of them have been
turned into means, occasions, and advantages of
sinning; nor of <hi>the horrible hypocrisie</hi> which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
cleaves unto the most of their Observers;
nor of that <hi>superstition</hi> which gives life to them all,
being a thing riveted in the natures of some, and
their constitutions, fixed on others by inveterate
prejudices; and the same by others taken up for
secular advantages; but I will suppose the best that
can be made of it, and it will be found to be <hi>a self-invented
design</hi> of Men ignorant of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of God, to give a check to this power of
<hi>Indwelling-sin</hi> whereof we speak. And it's almost
incredible, what fearfull <hi>self-macerations,</hi> and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
sufferings this design hath carryed Men out
unto: And undoubtedly their <hi>blind zeal and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi>
will rise in judgement, and condemn the
horrible sloth and negligence of the most of them
to whom the Lord hath granted the saving Light
of the Gospel. But what is the end of these things?
The Apostle in brief gives us an account; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.
31, 32. <hi>They attain not the Righteousness aimed at;</hi>
they come not up unto a conformity to the Law;
<hi>sin is not mortified;</hi> no nor the power of it
weakned; but what it loseth in sensual, in carnal
pleasures, it takes up with great advantage, in
blindness, darkness, superstition, self-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and soul-pride, contempt of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and the righteousness of it, and reigns no
less, than in the most proffigate sinners in the
World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:42900:154"/>
Lastly, The strength, efficacy and power of this
Law of Sin, may be farther evidenced from its life
and in-being in the Soul, notwithstanding the
wound that is given unto it, in the first conversion
of the Soul to God; and the continual opposition
that is made unto it by Grace. But this is the
subject and design of another Endeavour.</p>
            <p>It may now be expected, that we should here
adde the especial <hi>Vses</hi> of all this discovery that
hath been made of the <hi>Power, Deceit, Prevalency</hi>
and <hi>Success,</hi> of this great Adversary of our Souls.
But as for what concerns that Humility, self-Abasement,
Watchfulness, Diligence, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
unto the Lord Christ for relief, which
will become those who find in themselves by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
the power of this Law of Sin, have been
occasionally mentioned and inculcated through the
whole preceding Discourse, so for what concerns
the actual <hi>Mortification</hi> of it, I shall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
unto the Reader for his Direction,
another small Treatise written long since unto that
purpose, which I suppose he may do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
together with this, if he find these things to
be his Concernment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Only Wise God our Saviour, be Glory
and Majesty, Dominion, and Power, both
Now and Ever. </hi> Amen.</p>
