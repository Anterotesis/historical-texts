            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WE are a People whom God hath converted to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; a People in whom God hath raiſed up the Seed of his own Life, and cauſed it to reign over the eartly part in our ſelves; a People whom God hath divorced from the ſpirit of whordom, and joyned to his own Spirit. We, many of us, ſought truly and onely after God from our childhood (our conſciences bearing us witneſs in the ſight of God) but the honeſty of our hearts was ſtill betrayed, and we led aſide by the Whoriſh ſpirit, and knew not how to turn to that of God in us, which inclined us toward God. By this means we came to great diſtreſs and miſery beyond all men, not but that all men were in as great a want of God (his Life, Power and Preſence) as we; but the ſence therof was not ſo quickened in others, as in us. Now it pleaſed the Lord at length to pitty us, and to inform our minds towards himſelf, to ſhew us where Life lay, and where Death lay, and how to turn from the one, and to the other; and he gave us his helping hand to turn us. And by being turned to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now mark, we are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have ſhot up out of the old root into another appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as one ſect hath done out of another till many are come up one after another, the ground ſtill remaining the ſame out of which they all grew: but that ground hath been ſhaken &amp; ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deſtroyed &amp; deſtroying, removed and removing in us, and the old root of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> hath been made manifeſt in us, and we have been tranſplanted by the everlaſting power of Life, and a real change brought forth in us out of that ſpirit, wherin the world lives and worſhips, into another ſpirit, into which no

thing which is of the World can enter. And hear we have met with the call of God, the Converſion to God, the Regeneration in God, the Juſtification, the Sanctification, the Wiſdom, the Redemption, the true Life and Power of God, which the World cannot ſo much as bear the name of. And what we are made of God in Chriſt, we know to be truth and no lye: and when we teſtifie of this to the World, in the meaſure of the life of God in us, we ſpeak truth and no lye; though the World which knoweth not the Truth, cannot hear our voice.</p>
               <p>Now our work in the World is, <hi>to hold forth the virtues of him that hath called us</hi> to live like God; not to own any thing in the World which God doth not own: to forget our Country, our Kindred, our Fathers houſe; and to live like perſons of another Country, of another kindred, of another family: not to do any thing of our ſelves, and which is pleaſing to the old nature, but all our words, all our converſation, yea every thought in us to become new. Whatever comes from us, is to come from the new Principle of Life in us, and to anſwer that in others, but we muſt not pleaſe the old nature at all in our ſelves, nor in any elſe. And walking faithfully thus with God, we have a reward at preſent, and a crown in the end, which doth and will countervaile all the reproches and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, we do or can meet with in the World.</p>
               <p>We are alſo to be witneſſes for God, and to propagate his Life in the World; to be inſtruments in his hand, to bring others out of Death and Captivity unto true Life and Liberty: we are to fight againſt the powers of darkneſs every where, as the Lord calleth us forth. And this we are to do in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, according to his will, in his power, and in his love, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and meakneſs. We are not to take wayes according to our own wiſdom (but there muſt be a ſtrict watch, ſet in the Life, leaſt that get up again:) nor muſt we ſpeak ſuch words, as mans wiſdom would call wiſe: nor may we go in our own will to ſeek any, but the Lord muſt go before: nor may we make uſe of our own ſtrength, but feel his arm in our weakneſs: nor may we go forth in that love, ſweetneſs, or meakneſs which is pleaſing to the fleſhly mind: but we muſt be true to God handling the ſword skilfully and faithfully, judging and cutting

The Lord God is rough with the tranſgreſſor, and all along the Scripture heweth and judgeth him: and if we come forth in the ſame ſpirit, we ſhall find the ſame leadings, where we meet with the ſame thing: for the Lord God will never be tender there; nor can that which comes from him, lives in him, is lead by him, be tender there whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now the very root of this ſeverity is good, and of God, and hath love and ſweetneſs at the bottom of it: yea in pitty, love, and bowels do we uſe the ſword. It is in pitty to the poor cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tived creature, that that might be cut down, which keeps it in bonds and captivity. And though we ſeem enemies to all ſorts of men, for the Lords ſake: yet we are not enemies, nor could do the leaſt hurt to them any way, but are true freinds to their ſoules and bodies alſo: and our only controverſie is with that which captives and maks them miſerable: for we fight not at all with fleſh and bloud, but with the principallity and power which led from God, and rules in it againſt God, to the poor creatures ruine and diſtruction. Yea if we had all the powers of the earth in our hands, we could not ſet up our own way, (if, after the manner, of men I may <hi>ſo call it</hi>) or ſo much as diſturb others in their way thereby, but ſhould wait in patience, till God gave us an entrance by his power.</p>
               <p>Now let not men run on in heats againſt us, but let them ſeriouſly conſider, whether we be of God or no: and let them conſider; not with the reaſon and underſtanding which is alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from God, but with the witneſs which lies hid in the heart. There is one great palpable argument that we are of God, which, is this, all the World is againſt us, the Worldly part every where lights with us, the Worldly part in every ſort and Sect of men oppoſeth us, the rage of man every where riſeth up againſt us; But thoſe that are ſo hot againſt us, if at any time they become but meek and calm, patiently conſidering our cauſe, and conſulting there upon with the teſtimony that they, find in their own hearts concerning us, they ſoon become pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94552:5"/>
and ſee that we are no mans enemies, againſt no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Law, not againſt Relations, not againſt Governments, not againſt any thing in the world that is good, but only againſt that which is evil and corrupt. And of a truth, the corruption of things God hath ſhewed unto us, and daily cals us forth after an immediate manner to witneſs againſt.</p>
               <p>Therfore let men be ſober, and take heed what they do, leaſt they be found fighters againſt God: for the reproaches the ſcoffs, with other perſecutions, which ſeem to be caſt at us, light on him. It is not as we are men, but as we are obedient to him, as we ſtand witneſſes for him, that we meet with theſe things. Now, as it is not we our ſelves that do theſe things, but the life and power of God in us; ſo it is not we that are ſtruck at, but the Life and Power: if it were not for that, we might be as acceptable as other men. It is becauſe we are not of the World, but God hath called us out of the World, that we are ſo hated of the world. This is the true cauſe, though the world will no more now acknowledge it, then it would in former ages. Yet I do not ſpeak this for my own ſake, to avoid my ſhare in the Croſs: for <hi>the reproach of Chriſt is our riches,</hi> yea far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er treaſure then is to be found in the pallace of <hi>Egypt</hi>: Yea the Preſence of God, the ſweet power of Life makes up all our loſſes, ſo that we have no cauſe to complain. It is very ſweet, pleaſant, and profitable for us to be found Sufferers for God; but we know it will not be profitable for you to be found Perſecutors: and this is told you in true love and good will, by one who wiſhes no evil to you, for all the evil that ye have exerciſed towards the dear and pretious People of God for theſe many years. O that God would open your eyes, that ye might ſee whom ye have oppoſed, and againſt whom ye have hardened and ſtrengthened your ſelves, that ye might bow to him, and receive life from him, and not periſh in your gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and oppoſition.</p>

And this is the Light, by which ye ſee all the evil Actions which ye have evilly acted, and all the ungodly works which ye have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlyly commited, and all the ungodly thoughts which ye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlyly have thought, and all the hard ſpeaches and ungodly words which ye have ſpoken. The Light wherewith Chriſt hath enlightened you; is that which maketh manifeſt all that is contrary to it. The ſame Light maketh manifeſt the Saviour, from whence it comes: and it maketh manifeſt that Chriſt is the Covenant of Light and Life, by which you come to have peace with God. The ſame Light maketh manifeſt to you (if you love it) that Chriſt is the Mediator between you and God. The ſame Light maketh manifeſt that Chriſt is the Offering for your Sins, and the Sins of the whole World. The ſame Light doth manifeſt that Chriſt is the way, the truth and the Life, and the word of God by which all things were made and Created. And the ſame Light manifeſts that Chriſt is the Wiſdom of God, and Power of God, and Sanctification, and Juſtification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. To Sanctifie, Juſtifie and Redeem from that which the Light manifeſts to be Evil; and that which lets, and keeps in the ſeperation from God.</p>
               <p>And this Light is within, by which all theſe things are ſeen; and you that love this Light you will ſe all theſe things Love mentioned: Chriſt the Mediator, Chriſt the Way, the

And as many of you as receive Chriſt, he will give you power to become Sons of God (mark) ye ſhall have power by which you ſhall know Son-ſhip to ſtand againſt ſin and evil, and become the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>Now if you hate this Light, and go on in ſin, and in evil thoughts, and evil words, works and actions, and do not come to the Light which reproves you, but love Darkneſs rather then Light, it will be Your condemnation. And this is the Light which maketh manifeſt to every one of you what you have done, ſpoke, thought and acted amiſs, and reproves you for it: and if you love the Light, you love Chriſt, and you love your Saviour, Redeemer, Sanctifier and Offering for Sin. And you ſee him who puts an end to ſin, and deſtroyes the Devil who brought it in, and his Works; he that deſtroyeth; and brings in everlaſting Righteouſneſs in you.

               <p>And in this Light and Word, which is in the heart, they ſhould know the <hi>New Covenant</hi> of God, the <hi>Law written in the heart,</hi> and <hi>put in their mindes,</hi> by which they ſhould not have need to ſay one to another, <hi>Know the Lord; for all ſhould know him from the leaſt even to the greateſt.</hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> which <hi>ſhall periſh, and be confounded, and brought to nothing</hi>; and not in that <hi>Wiſdom which cometh down from above, which is pure and peaceable</hi>; but in that <hi>Wiſdom which is from beneath, which is Earthly, ſenſual and Deviliſh,</hi> which will deſtroy them who are not of their <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi>; ſuch are not in the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual underſtanding,</hi> which giveth Dominion over <hi>ſin,</hi> and which giveth a diſcerning by which they can diſcern one thing from another, and are out of that <hi>Knowledge</hi> by which <hi>God is known, which is Life Eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So they who make a <hi>Trade of the Scriptures,</hi> and ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by them, they are ſuch as are out of the <hi>Life,</hi> neither can they bring People to it, and ſo they keep people learning all their Life time; and this is the State of the <hi>Merchants of Babylon,</hi> who are building up and plucking down.</p>
                  <p>Now this is the end and right uſe of <hi>Scripture, viz.</hi> for all to read them, and believe them, and to wait in the <hi>Light,</hi> to feel the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> which was in them, who gave them forth, by which they may know them, and have the <hi>Revelation</hi> of them in themſelves, and ſo feel Chriſt who is the <hi>Voyce</hi> and the <hi>Corner-ſtone,</hi> by which they are fulfilled, and ſo to receive him, and live in him, who fulfills them, who is the end of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and of all <hi>Types, Figures</hi> and <hi>Shadows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So (I ſay) the <hi>Scriptures of Truth</hi> were given forth to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94552:16"/>
believed, read, fulfilled, performed, and that People might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that of which they ſpoke, to wit, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scriptures of Truth</hi> are the <hi>Words of God,</hi> which comes from <hi>God the Father of Truth,</hi> and cannot be broken, but muſt be fulfilled, and he who fulfills them is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by whom all things were <hi>made</hi> and <hi>created</hi>; who is called, <hi>the Word of God.</hi>

                  <p>Now they who turn from the Grace, and walkes deſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt the Spirit of God, they ſet up Teachers according to their own hearts luſts, and ſuch makes Merchandize of them, alwayes learning of them, but never able to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Truth,</hi> but ſtill remains in earthly mindedneſs, covetouſneſs, and temptations, and weakneſſes, where is mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and complaints, and where there are very many mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and complainers, among ſuch as turn from the Grace of God into wantonneſs, and ſet up Teachers (as aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) according to their own hearts luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Adam</hi>) So Chriſt is the <hi>Reſurrestion</hi> unto <hi>Life,</hi> of <hi>Body, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſo renews Man into the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and brings Man into an higher condition than that in which <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood before the <hi>Fall,</hi> even to himſelf, who never <hi>changed,</hi> and never <hi>fell,</hi> nor never will <hi>fall.</hi> And ſo they who forget God and do wickedly, they are <hi>to be turned into Hell</hi>; For they who forget God and do wickedly, they go from the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power of God,</hi> into the <hi>Seperation</hi> from him, and out of his acceptance; for in the <hi>Life</hi> is the acceptance; and ſo the <hi>Power, Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> goeth over them, who go into <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>iniquity,</hi> which leades from God, who was before <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion</hi> was.</p>

                     <hi>Cain</hi> was the <hi>firſt Birth, Eſau</hi> was the <hi>firſt Birth, Iſhmael</hi> was the <hi>firſt Birth; Cain</hi> killed his Brother about <hi>Religion, Iſhmael</hi> was a <hi>Scoffer, Eſau</hi> bore the <hi>Sword,</hi> he deſpiſed his <hi>Birth-right,</hi> he <hi>fought</hi> againſt his Brother <hi>Jacob.</hi> So <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> read your <hi>Reprobation,</hi> the firſt Birth, which is born of the <hi>Eleſh,</hi> for the firſt Birth will perſecute him who is <hi>born</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi>; So the moſt part of Chriſtians are ſeen to be of the firſt Birth, and to remain in the <hi>Reprobation</hi> from God. <hi>Cain</hi> departed from the <hi>Voyce of God,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> from his <hi>Birth-right,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in his <hi>ſcoffing nature,</hi> they went from the <hi>Good,</hi> and ſo from faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was in the <hi>Election.</hi> And ſo they who are in <hi>Cains, Iſhmaels</hi> and <hi>Eſaus</hi> nature, are in the firſt Birth, which is not <hi>Elected.</hi>

                  <p>Now as to the <hi>Love</hi> of God towards one, and his <hi>Hatred</hi> to another, before either had done <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> all this conſiſts in the firſt Birth, who deſpiſed his <hi>Birth-right,</hi> which God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, which was not the <hi>Seed,</hi> unto which the <hi>Love of God</hi> is to for ever.

                  <p>So who knows the <hi>Election,</hi> they muſt know the <hi>Seed,</hi> they muſt know the <hi>Birth</hi> born of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Now if all <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>

And the <hi>Reprobation</hi> is one, which ſtandeth in the unjuſt world, out of the Truth and the Life in diſobedience to the Command of God. Therefore know the one <hi>Reprobation,</hi> and the one <hi>Election,</hi> then ye ſhall know the <hi>Seed,</hi> in which is the Wiſdom of God, and ye ſhall know that which goes from his Voyce, Power and Command, out of the Wiſdom of God; ſo whom God loves, he loves for ever: Know <hi>Jacob,</hi> and know <hi>Eſau. Eſau, Cain</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> were the firſt-born; and is not <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> of the firſt-birth, who Perſecutes, who departs from the good, and deſpiſes the pure, and perſecutes the Birth born of the Spirit, which God hates.

                     <hi>Bread, Water,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are earthly and periſhing things; for the Bread and Wine which Chriſt gave at Supper in the Evening, which the World takes at Noon, thoſe things Chriſt and the Apoſtle gave for a ſhewing forth and a remembrance of his death until he ſhould come. And after ſome of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had receiv'd it, they doubted, <hi>Whether he was the Chriſt or not.</hi> And after the Apoſtle had given the Supper to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, he bad then <hi>Examine themſelves, and ſo to eat in the remembrance of Chriſt.</hi> But in the ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle he bad them <hi>examine themſelves, and try themſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt [except they were Reprobates] were in them or not.</hi> Now they may be <hi>Reprobates,</hi> who have taken the Bread and Wine, and have had the Water; They were <hi>Reprobates</hi> if <hi>Chriſt was not in them</hi>; For Bread and Wine is not the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, which came down from Heaven, which fleſh, whoſoever eates, lives for ever. For People may eat of Bread made of Grain, and may drink Wine make of Grapes, and yet may dye <hi>Reprobates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now they were to take it in <hi>remembrance of his Death,</hi> this was one State, and than they were to come to dye with him and this was a nearer ſtate than the taking of Bread and Wine <hi>in remembrance</hi> of his Death, and then they were to ariſe with him, and then to ſeek thoſe things which were above where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God, but Bread Water and Wine are all earthly things, and they are not Chriſt, and they who have him, they are not <hi>Reprobates,</hi> neither do they need outward things to put them in mind of his Death; whenas they are dead with him, and riſen with him, to live with him. But they who will not dye, and ſuffer with him, ſuch live in the Old Nature, and deſire to have outward things, continually to put them in mind of his Death, and ſuch live in Strife and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

about outward things and ſhaddows and do not come to Chriſt the Subſtance, who was before the world was made in whom there is no ſtrife at all, but only Life and Peace.</p>

                     <hi>XXXII.</hi> Concerning Falſe Prophets and Antichriſts.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Falſe Prophets</hi> and <hi>Antichriſts</hi> are much condemned in this part of the World called <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and they bring the 7th, <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the 24th <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and ſay, that they are but now come.</p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer, that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>They ſhould come,</hi> viz. <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> and <hi>Falſe Apoſtles</hi>; he ſaid to his Diſciples, that <hi>they ſhall come, i. e.</hi> to his Diſciples, and he gave them markes how they ſhould know them; <hi>A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit: nor a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit. —And if it were poſſible they ſhould deceive the very Elect, for they have the Sheeps-cloathing.</hi> And he commanded his <hi>Diſciples that they ſhould not follow them, for they were inwardly ravening Wolves, having the Sheeps cloathing.</hi> And thoſe were <hi>Antichrists</hi> and <hi>Falſe Prophets, falſe Christs</hi> and <hi>Deceivers</hi> who were inwardly ravend from the Light, and ſo from the Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> the true Chriſt. And Chriſt told his Diſciples <hi>thoſe ſhould come,</hi> and before the deceaſe of his Diſciples they came; as we may read
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94552:26"/>
in the firſt <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Chapter,</hi> and fourth <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Little Children, ye have heard that Antichriſt ſhould come, and even now there are many Antichriſts, and falſe Prophets come into the World.</hi> So Chriſt had ſpoken before that they ſhould come, and his Diſciples ſaid that they were already come; who went out from them, inwardly ravend from the Spirit; and this was above ſixteen hundred years ſince. And <hi>John</hi> who ſaw them already come, he directed the Saints to this annointing in themſelves, and ſaid to them, that they had not need that any one ſhould teach them, but as this annointing taught them, they ſhould abide in the Father and in the Son. And ſo thoſe Anti-chriſts, falſe Prophets, Wolves, falſe Chriſts, inwardly ravend, they bear Pryars, Thornes and Thiſtles, which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>ſhall come,</hi> and his Diſciples ſaid they <hi>were come,</hi> and who went out from them into the World. And in the <hi>Revelations</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>The whole World went after them.</hi> So they went out from the Church, Fellowſhip, Goſpel; they went out from the Fellowſhip of the Spirit within, being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vend from it; they went from the annointing within, which ſhould teach them; they went from the Law in the heart, to wit, from the New Covenant; and they went from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom within, and they went from the Word which is in the the heart to obey it, and to do it; they went out from the Light in the heart, which gives the knowledge of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo they loſt the Pearl hid in the Field, <hi>viz.</hi> the World in their hearts. And ſo the falſe Prophets went out from the Diſciples, and, as was ſaid before in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> its ſaid, <hi>the whole World went after them.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> wrote to the ſeven Churches which erred, by permitting <hi>Jezabel</hi> to teach, and to ſet up Idols, and ſuch who ſaid they were <hi>Jews,</hi> and were not, but were the Synagogues of Satan. So he goes on in the <hi>Revelation</hi> till he comes to the eleventh <hi>Chapter,</hi> where the Witneſſes are ſlain; the two Olives which carried the oyl to the annointing of the Nations, the two Candleſticks which holds the Light. And in the 12th <hi>Chapter,</hi> the Woman, <hi>viz.</hi> the true Church, fled into the Wilderneſs, prepared for her of God, that there ſhe ſhould be nouriſhed, <hi>for a time, times, and half a time.</hi> And in the 13th <hi>Chapter, The Dragon gives his Power to the Beaſt, and the Beaſt with the Dragons power makes

And <hi>ſhe drank the blood of the Saints and Martyrs,</hi> who were not inwardly ravend, and who could not drink of her Cup. Yea, <hi>ſhe drank the blood of the Saints and Prophets who kept the Teſtimony of Jeſus, who were not inwardly ravend.</hi> And ſo ſuch doings and works they have ſet up for the ſpace of fifteen hundred years, <hi>viz.</hi> Killing and murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and they have diſperſed themſelves into all Nations, as the Apoſtles they were to go into all Nations. And ſuch works the Wolves have wrought in the Sheeps cloathing, yea thoſe who are inwardly ravend from the Spirit of God, whoſe fruits are Brambles, Bryars and Thorns, and ſuch like works thoſe Raveners have done ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, being ravend from their Life and Power; having the Words of the Sheep, the Scriptures, but not in the Power and Life which gave them forth; therefore Bryars and Thorns appear: who devour and kill the Lambs, and compels them to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and uſe violence upon them and their outward things about Religion, which was not the work of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
                  <p>And ſo <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Again the Beaſt and the Dragon, and the Falſe Prophets (which hath deceived the Nations which Chriſt ſaid ſhould come,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaid <hi>was come</hi>; who went out from them; from which time the World hath gone after them, for the ſpace of fifteen hundred years) <hi>is to be taken: Which Beaſt and falſe Prophet ſhall be taken and cast into the Lake of fire, and the Nations ſhall be deceived no more, and the Whore the great Whore, which hath compelled the Nations to drink the

                  <p>And ye are to be redeemed from Tongues, and <hi>Tongues ſhall ceaſe,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) and ſo from this Worlds <hi>Original,</hi> the beginning of which is <hi>Babel,</hi> and which keeps in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Saints are redeemed. And this hath been ſet up as an <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> among them who are alienated from the Spirit of God, in <hi>Babel,</hi> where the <hi>Original</hi> of Tongues was in the dayes of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that <hi>Heretick,</hi> who began to build <hi>Babel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Tongues</hi> do not make any man a Divine, neither a Miniſter of Chriſt, for that which makes a man Divine (as they ſay) is the <hi>Word</hi> (which redeems out of <hi>Tongues</hi>) which was before <hi>Babel</hi> was, and in the beginning before the <hi>Fall,</hi> which knocks down all that which corrupts mans Nature, and renews again into the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whoſoever are Miniſters of the Word, and Preachers of the Goſpel, they are in the Power and in the Word which was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94552:29"/>
before <hi>Tongues</hi> were; This <hi>Word</hi> brings into the <hi>Church-Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,</hi> which is in God, into which they are not brought by the Worlds <hi>Original,</hi> which they call the <hi>Tongues,</hi> which ſhall ceaſe, and out of whom we are redeemed; neither do they bring into Fellowſhip with God, neither into his Worſhip, nor further than <hi>Babel,</hi> where the Tongues ſtop.</p>
                  <p>But who comes to the Word of God and the Goſpel, they come to that which was before many Tongues were, and ſhall remain when they ſhall all paſs away.</p>

                     <hi>XXXVIII.</hi> Concerning OATHES.</head>
                  <p>The Spirit of Chriſt, the Spirit of the Apoſtles, of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs is riſen again, which gives Teſtimony againſt <hi>Swearing and Oathes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were no <hi>Oaths</hi> at all impoſed upon Man before the <hi>Fall,</hi> but only ſince the <hi>Fall,</hi> for under the Law after the <hi>Fall</hi>; and among the <hi>Jews; Oaths</hi> and <hi>Commandments</hi> were given. To which Chriſt (by whom the World was made, which was before the <hi>Fall,</hi> which is the Oath of God, which Oathes in the <hi>Fall</hi> were <hi>Types</hi>) who put an end to ſtrife, and brings into quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace, and bindes to God without <hi>Oathes,</hi> which Chriſt put an end to.</p>
                  <p>And, Chriſt himſelf, <hi>the Oath of God,</hi> puts an end to all <hi>Oaths,</hi> and brings into the Land of quietneſs and reſt, the Spiritaul <hi>Canaan,</hi> and puts and end to ſtrife, and deſtroyes the Devil the Author of ſtrife, he who is the Reſt, the Way, Truth and the Life, who brings again to God, and is the Covenant of God in man, hath peace with God, which deſtroyes that which led from God and from Chriſt; and he himſelf ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, nor by the Earth, nor by any other Oath.</hi> He who reſtores man into that ſtate in which he was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning before the <hi>Fall,</hi> who reſtores into the Image of God. And ſo in the <hi>Reſtauration</hi> there are no <hi>Oathes</hi> to be uſed, nor <hi>Swearing,</hi> according to his own Doctrine; But <hi>Yea, yea, nay, nay,</hi> was to be uſed among men in all their Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and what is more then this, is evil; So that <hi>Swearing</hi> now is evil. And this is the Doctrine of him who reſtores People
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94552:29"/>
into that ſtate in which man was in in the beginning; who is the Subſtance, who put an end to <hi>Figures.</hi> And his Diſciple <hi>Jeams</hi> in the 5th <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> who followed his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel (who is an Everlaſting Counſellor) ſaith, <hi>Above all things, my brethren, Swear not, neither by Heaven, nor by Earth, nor by any other Oath, leſt you fall into Condemnation: but let your yea, be yea, and your nay, be nay.</hi> And this was the manner among them who followed the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Command of Chriſt</hi> in the Reſtauration, who were built upon the true <hi>Foundation,</hi> which was firſt laid in the Primitive times among the true Brethren; and was publickly held forth which Manner and Cuſtome, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Command of Chriſt Jeſus and the Apoſtles in the Primitive times, many of the Martyrs followed, held forth, and practiſed among thoſe who were Degenerated and Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed from the Life and Power of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they profeſs the Words. And now the Spirit of Chriſt is riſen again, and of the Apoſtles, and Saints as in the Primitive times, and the Spirit of the Martyrs, who bear witneſs againſt all <hi>Oathes</hi> and all ſort of <hi>Swearing</hi> whatſoevever, that were uſed among the <hi>Heathens, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtatized Chriſtians,</hi> both privately and publickly, and bindes to <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Communication, as Chriſt and the Apoſtles taught, and and the Saints and Martyrs practiſed, knowing, <hi>that whatſoever is more than yea, and nay, is evil</hi>; and <hi>ſuch who Swear,</hi> are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> according to Chriſt and the Apoſtles <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So we ſay again, <hi>That the Spirit of Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and Martyrs is riſen again, who hath been dead, and is dead, in and among the Apoſtates, who have the Form, but deny the Power, from whom we have turned away.</hi> But now its ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

whom the Angels (which ſware) worſhip, for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> who is Lord and Maſter, ſo it is better to obey him than man, and in all your <hi>Communication</hi> let your <hi>yea, be yea,</hi> and your <hi>nay, be nay; for whatſoever is more than this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Evil,</hi> ſaith he who reſtores, even Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And in the ſecond <hi>Example,</hi> conſider the Apoſtles, who did according to the Command and Doctrine of Chriſt, who ſaid, <hi>Above all things, my Brethren, Swear not at all, leſt ye fall into condemnation,</hi> Jam. 5. <hi>But let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay, in all your Communication.</hi>

               <head>Concerning the WORD of GOD, and the Original, what it is.</head>
               <p>BLeſſed are all thoſe whoſe mindes are ſtaid upon the Lord, for they ſhall be kept in perfect peace; ſo where the mind is ſtaid upon the Lord, there is a perfect peace, for it is a whole peace which cannot be broken: So here is not only a perfect peace, but a bleſſing; a perfect peace which comes from the God of all peace, that bruiſeth the Serpents head under your feet, (the troubler) and the bleſſings which comes from the bleſſed God. So all imperfect peace may be broken, that is when the mind is ſtaid upon any Creature, or in any Creature (and not upon the Creator) or in any outward things. Goods, Houſes, Lands or Inventions of the Vanities, in the fooliſh vain Faſhions, which the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life go into, which will defile it and corrupt it, when any of theſe things
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94552:30"/>
fail, and are not according to your mind, it being in them, then your peace is broken, and you are croſs, and brickle, and envy gets up; ſo this is not a perfect peace, but is a broken peace, and then you have the trouble and not the bleſſing; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe your minds are in the Creatures, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, and are not ſtaid upon the Creator, where the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace is, and the bleſſing, where nothing can get betwixt you and the Lord. And this is below <hi>Job</hi> to have the mind in the Creatures, and viſible things, for when you are tried, and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures fail you, you are croſt, and troubled, that ſhews an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate; for God ſaid, <hi>that</hi> Job <hi>was a perfect man</hi>: and when that the Lord ſuffered him to be tried, and when that his Goods and Houſes were thrown down, and driven a way, and ſervents killed, he ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be the name of the Lord, for the Lord gave and the Lord taketh</hi>; here his mind was ſtayed upon the Lord, and he retained his peace. And when that his Children were deſtroyed, and his wife ſaid to him, <hi>what, doſt thou continue in thy Integrity ſtill? Curſe God and dye</hi>; he rebukes her, and calls her, <hi>A fooliſh woman</hi>: and ſaid unto her, <hi>Shall I receive good of the Lord and not evil? Naked came I out of my Mothers womb, and naked I muſt return again.</hi> Here <hi>Job</hi> kept his integrity ſtill, and did not all this while offend with his Lips. Now many of you who think your ſelves high, and above <hi>Job,</hi> if that your Goods and Children ſhould be after the ſame manner taken away (whoſe mind is in them) you would be found in a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled brickle ſtate, far below <hi>Job.</hi> And when that <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends came to reaſon with him, who kept his integrity, and would no way yeeld to them, they called him an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and ſaid, he denyed Prayer, and filled his Belly with <hi>East-wind,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>what ſhall mortal man be more pure than his Maker? Shall man that is born of a woman be Just? God chargeth his Angls with folly, and the Heavens are not clear in his ſight.</hi> And theſe are the Scriptures the Prieſts uſe to bring againſt Friends (who keep there Integrity) as <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends did againſt him; but at the laſt the Lord commanded <hi>Job</hi> to offer a Sacrifice for his Friends, becauſe they had ſinned, and ſpoken not right, as <hi>Job</hi> had, who was perfect and kept his Integrity. And the Apoſtle ſaid to the Saints, <hi>That he had learned in all conditions to be content.</hi> Mark, <hi>in all conditions,</hi> but this was when he was <hi>Paul,</hi> not when he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94552:31"/>
was <hi>Saul,</hi> running up and down with his packet of Letters, halling the Saints before the Rulers like a <hi>Paritor</hi>; then he was not content, neither with his own condition, nor others: But when he came to learn of Chriſt, which deſtroys the Devil and his works, which teacheth to know all things, then in all things he learned to be content; ſo that you know that there is <hi>learning, learneth,</hi> and <hi>learned</hi>; as a Child when he is learning, learneth, and learned is three ſtats; ſo <hi>Paul he had learned in all conditions to be content</hi>; and who was his <hi>School-Maſter</hi> but Chriſt, by whom all things were made, <hi>not of man, nor by man</hi> (out of the Truth;) ſo while he learned of men, and by men, he was not content, neither are any others.</p>
               <p>Therefore all are to learn of Chriſt the Light, the Life, and the Truth, that you may come to that condition, <hi>to have learned in all conditions to be content, and not to truſt in uncertain Riches, for they have wings and will flee away</hi>; and ſo he is never coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a wiſe man that will put any confidence in that which will flee away from him: for thoſe are the Heirs of the Earth and the World that l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo therefore mind every one Gods word <hi>in your Hearts, and in your Mouthes, and obey it and do it</hi>; and be not of them that are ſaying in their hearts, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend or deſcend to fetch him from above</hi>? Keep down that ſayer under reproof, and then your eares will be open to that which the righteouſneſs of Faith ſaith, <hi>The Word is nigh thee, in thy heart, and in thy mouth, ſo thou needest not to ſay, who ſhall aſcend or deſcend,</hi> and that was the Word which the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God preached, and do preach, and rebuke the Gainſayer.</p>
               <p>And ſo all people ſeeing the Devil hath made the World like a Wilderneſs, and there is ſo many wayes in it, that they do not know which way to come out, nor which to follow: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is my Anſwer to you all, Take <hi>Davids</hi> Lanthorn and Candle; you may ſay, What is that, and where is it?

uſe to carry Lanthorns and Candles in the day time, but in the night.</p>
               <p>I ſay, you be in the Night of Darkneſs, and therefore the Word is called a Lanthorn and Candle to you, by which you may ſee the Way of the Lord which is perfect, from all mens wayes which are imperfect; by which ye may ſee the path of the juſt to be a ſhining Light, from all the unjuſt paths that be in the Darkneſs; for by this Word did <hi>David</hi> come to outſtrip his Teachers, who was made wiſer then them all, ſo it will you, if you obey it; for by this Word he ſaw Chriſt, and called him Lord: therefore he loved the Word and hid it in his heart; for by it he ſpake ſo many glorious expreſſions, which the World ſince hath turned into Meeter, and made Songs or Ballads of them; and this was the Word that came to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which made him forſake his National Religion and Worſhip, and Obey the Lord; and this was the Word that came to <hi>Jacob</hi> the Shepherd; by which he ſaw Chriſt, and Propheſied of him to his Sons on his Death-bed, when he ſaid to <hi>Judah, The Law ſhould not depart from betwixt his feet till</hi> Shilo <hi>came,</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>and the gathering of all Nations ſhould be to him,</hi> as it is at this day, the gathering is to Chriſt, and this was the Word that came to <hi>Moſes</hi> the Shepherd, when he was keeping ſheep, which he Obeyed, and went to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and brought the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi>; by which Word he was made a Miniſter; and when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were come out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Wilderneſs, told them, <hi>They need not go for the Word beyond the Seas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for it was nigh them, in their hearts and mouths, to obey it and do it.</hi> And this was, the Word that made <hi>Moſes</hi> a Prophet, who prepheſied of Chriſt, and ſaid, <hi>Like unto him God would raiſe up a Prophet, him ſhould they hear in all things</hi>: mark, (in all things) we are to be ordered both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, for hearing Chriſt, by whom all things were made; <hi>And every one that would not hear this Prophet</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>ſhould be cut off</hi>; for how ſhould they continue or reign?</p>
               <p>And this was the Word that came to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and made him a Prophet, who ſpake to <hi>Ely</hi> the Prieſt, and reproved his Sons, and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>: and this was the Word that made <hi>Saul</hi> to Propheſie, and <hi>Balaam,</hi> though they erred from it: And

this was the Word that made all the Prophets to propheſie, and to reprove the kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their Prieſts, of their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatrous ways, in ſeting up Groves, and Images in High places; and reproved all their Monthly Prognoſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who ſpoke and acted from them, and not from the Lord.</p>
               <p>And this was the Word that came to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> by which he Propheſied of Chriſt, and of his Preaching, and of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and by which Word he reproved the Shepherds, which were <hi>as greedy dumb Dogs, could never have enough, ſeeking their gain from their Quarter:</hi> and by this Word he ſaw, <hi>that all the Children of God ſhould be taught of God, and eſtabliſhed in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Peace</hi>; and though many tongues ſhould riſe up in Judgment againſt them, yet thoſe that were taught of God ſhould condemn them all, this power ſhould be given to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And many weapons formed againſt them ſhould not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, God would reſtrain them: And alſo he ſaw them that were <hi>caſt out, that trembled at Gods Word,</hi> to whom <hi>God would appear to their Glory, and to the ſhame and to the confounding of them that caſt them out for his Names ſake,</hi> as it is at this day.</p>
               <p>And this was the Word of God that made <hi>Jeremiah</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, by which he ſaw the New Covenant, by which Word he was ſaid to reprove the People and Princes, of the <hi>filthy and horrible thing commited in the Land, that the Priests Preached for Hire, and the Prophets propheſied falſly:</hi> and for reproving them for their Superſtition and Idollatry, <hi>they struck him, and put him in the Stocks, and Priſon, and perſecuted him in the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi> till his Perſecutors were carried into Captivity. And by the Word <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaw the number of Seventy yeares of his Perſecutors being in <hi>Babylons</hi> Captivity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elijah</hi> by the Word was made a Prophet, and by the Word reproved <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel</hi> for their Idolatry, and worſhiping of Images. For which Words ſake they perſecuted him, and the reſt of the Prophets; and was not he fed of the Ravens by the River; And did not they ſeek to take away his Life; and did not he think all the Lords Prophets had been killed, and he left alone? yet did not the Lord ſay to him, <hi>he had reſerved ſo many Thouſands that had not bowed the knee to</hi> Baal? And <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Plowman by the Word was made a Prophet, and forſook his Plough; and by the Word reproved the Idollatry in his Age of Prieſts and People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:94552:32"/>And by the Word was <hi>Ezekiel</hi> made a Prophet, by which Word he reproved the Shepherds of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that made a prey upon the people, and taught them for the Fleece; and by the Word he ſaw that God would bring the people from them, that they ſhould be made a pray upon no longer; and would gather them from their Mouths, and ſet one Shepherd over them, Chriſt, which is witneſſed; and by the Word he reproved falſe Prophets, that taught for handfuls of Barly, and peices of Bread, and daubed with untempered Morter, and ſewed Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows under the Armholes; and by the Word he ſaw the Patern of the Temple, and the return of the Jews.</p>
               <p>And by the Word <hi>Daniel</hi> was made a Prophet, and ſaw Chriſt and his Kingdom, and how the Saints ſhould take his Kingdom; and by the Word he ſaw ſuch that ſhould riſe up againſt the People of God; and by the Word he numbred the yeares of Chriſt to his time 499 yeares, and of his, Death and how he ſhould end the Sacrifices; and how that Chriſt ſhould bring up Everlaſting Righteouſneſs, and put an end to Sin and end the Prophets, and Seal up their Viſions.</p>
               <p>And by the Word <hi>Micah</hi> was made a Prophet, by which he cryed againſt the Prieſts <hi>that preached for Hire, and the Prophets that propheſied for Money, and the Judges that judged for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſuch as preached Peace to the people, that put in their mouths,</hi> (like the Prieſts in theſe times) <hi>and when they did not, they prepared war againſt them, and chopt their fleſh and, gnawed their Bones,</hi> (as the Prieſts in this day and time have done) but <hi>Micah</hi> ſaw by the Word that the Sun was gon down upon ſuch Prophets and Prieſts, and they ſhould have no Viſion nor Anſwer from God; therefore ſuch are againſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Viſions, on whom the Sun is ſet, and gon down upon, and then the Night comes upon them.</p>
               <p>And by the Word was <hi>Amos</hi> the Herdsman made a Prophet, who was a gatherer of Fruits, and likewiſe all the reſt of the Prophets, who ſpoke forth Divine things and reproved the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Idolatry in their time and day. And by the Word did all the Prophets ſpeak forth Divine things, which Word brought them into the Divine Nature and Mind, which Word Hammered and Cut down that which corrupted their natures;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94552:33"/>
and this was the Word that made ſo many Fiſher-men Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel, which is the Power of God.</p>
               <p>And this was the Word which made <hi>Matthew</hi> the Toll-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, <hi>Luke</hi> the Phyſitian, and <hi>Paul</hi> the Tent-maker, Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpel and Power of God.

And now the Prieſts and proud Prelates, and Biſhops, and Popes, though you have made a trade of the Saints words, and the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets words, and gotten a deal of money by them, (which were fiſhermen and ſhepherds words, from the Word) Yet nevertheleſs if a company of Shepherds, Herdſmen, Fiſhermen, Tent-makers, and Toll-gatherers ſhould come amongſt you to Preach, you would ſay, <hi>Away with theſe Mechanick Fellows, they have not ſerved ſeaven yeares Apprentiſhip at the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which we have ſet up to make Miniſters; therefore they are not to ſet up, becauſe they have not ſerved their Apprentiſhips.</hi>

Away with you to Work, and away with your Colledges: for our Brother <hi>Paul</hi> the Tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker ſaid, If <hi>you will not work you muſt not eat.</hi> For, would you own Chriſt if he had come in your day? who was called, <hi>A Carpenters Son.</hi> You Popes with your Triple Crowns, and you Lord Biſhops with your Coaches and fat Horſes, and gorgeous Aparrel, with your Black Coats, and white Coats, and Girdles; Are you like to entertain him who is called, <hi>A Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters Son</hi>? or to caſt him and his mother into the Manger in your Stables?</p>
               <p>This was the Word by which <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt ſaw Chriſt, which did <hi>enlighten every man that came into the world,</hi> and ſaw
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94552:33"/>
how <hi>he became fleſh,</hi> and <hi>came to his own, and his own did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him: but to as many as received</hi> Chriſt the Light, <hi>to them he gave power to become the Sons of God</hi>; which all they that are Miniſters of the Letter, made by the ſeven years Colledges, and not the Word, hate the Light.</p>
               <p>And by this Word, the Miniſter of the Word preacheth Chriſts Word, Life, Death and Reſurrection: And therefore as <hi>John</hi> ſaith in his Epiſtle, <hi>That which our Eyes have ſeen, our Hands have handled, and our Ears have heard of the Word of Life, do we preach unto you; that which was from the beginning, in the beginning was the Word,</hi> though ſince the beginning were the words and letters: for the Scriptures of Truth are the words of God, and the words of Chriſt; and <hi>he that adds to theſe words</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations) God ſhall add unto him the plagues, that are written in this book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the <hi>Word was in the beginning,</hi> and Chriſts Name is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>The Word of God,</hi> but Chriſt is neither called Scriptures nor Writings, for Scriptures ſignify Writings. So, <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> ſince the beginning were Writings and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> ſince the beginning were all falſe Wayes, falſe Churches, falſe Teachers; and in the Word ye comprehend them all. The Prieſt ſaith, That <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> were the Original, the many Languages, and the many Languages began at <hi>Babel,</hi> which <hi>Nimrod the Hunter before the Lord,</hi> (began to build) after God had deſtroyed the Old World with water: then would he go build a Tower which ſhould reach to Heaven; then God came down and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded them into many Languages: ſo he hunted before the Lord, but the Lord followed him, and confounded him in all his work, as he will do all the Builders that run before him; and ſo all the Prieſt that have gotten the many Languages, which began at <hi>Babel,</hi> they tell ſimple ignorant people, that they have the Original, and are the Orthodox men, and get in a different habit from them, and ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi> are a ſimple people, and deſpiſe the Learned Orthodox men who have the Original.</p>
               <p>Give ear O people, if theſe Languages which came up at the confounding of <hi>Babel</hi> are the Prieſts Original that makes them Orthodox and Divine, then Pilate that crucified Chriſt was as good an Orthodox Divine as they: for when he crucified Chriſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94552:34"/>
he writ a Paper in <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> and ſet a top of him, he was as ignorant of Scripture and of Orthodox and Divine matters as you, and you as he; and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That Tongues muſt ceaſe,</hi> then that which makes Orthodox men and Divine, as you ſay, muſt ceaſe, according to the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and ſo then Tongues neither are the Original, nor make Orthodox nor Divine: and <hi>John</hi> that gave forth the <hi>Revelations</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Whore and the Beaſt</hi> are <hi>ſet upon Tongues, and the Everlaſting Goſpel muſt be preached again to all Kindreds and Tongues</hi>; which were before <hi>Babel</hi> was, who was the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner of Tongues.</p>
               <p>Now it is clear that the Goſpel muſt be preached to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Tongues, and that Tongues are not the Original, neither do they make Divines or Orthodox men; but it is clear that it is the Word which was in the beginning which makes Divines; yea, Tradeſmen, which are baſe and contemptible in the eyes of the proud, and them that have gotten <hi>Babels</hi> Tongues, who are confounded by the miniſters of the Word, which was in the beginning before <hi>Babel</hi> was; for all the Earth was of one Language and Speech before <hi>Babel.</hi> And you that call your ſelves Orthodox men made by Tongues, and ſay that is your Original, who are ſo blind and cannot ſee that there was an Original before <hi>Babel</hi> was; for did not <hi>Enoch</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> who propheſied in the Old World before it was deſtroyed, and long before <hi>Babel</hi> was, concerning the coming of Chriſt in Ten thouſand of his Saints, as in <hi>Jude</hi>; and <hi>Lamech</hi> propheſied in the Old World concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> and others might be inſtanced, before your Tongues which you call your Original were: and ſo we ſay that the Word of God is the Original, which doth fulfil the Scriptures, and the Word is it which makes Divines, which is called a <hi>Hammer,</hi> but it is a living Hammer, and a <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> but a living Sword and a Fire, to hammer, cut, and burn up that which ſeparated and kept man from God, by which Word man is reconciled again to God, which is called The <hi>word of Reconciliation</hi>; by this word are men and women ſanctified and made clean, and this is the Word that makes both men and woman Divines, and brings them into the Divine Nature, which hammers and cuts down that which corrupted their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;

            <head>CONCERNING The SUM or SUBSTANCE OF OUR RELIGION, Who are called QUAKERS, And the Exerciſe &amp; Travels of our Spirits therein.</head>
            <p>THIS is the Sum or Subſtance of our Religion, to wit, to feel and diſcern the two Seeds: the Seed of Enmity, the Seed of Love; the Seed of the Fleſh, the Seed of the Spirit: the Seed of <hi>Hagar,</hi> the Seed of <hi>Sarah</hi>; the Seed of the Egyptian womb, the holy Seed of <hi>Iſrael</hi>: and to feel the Judgments of God adminiſtred to the one of theſe, till it be brought into bondage and death; and the other raiſed up in the Love and mercy of the Lord to live in us, and our Souls gathered into it, to live to God in it.</p>
            <p>Now when the Light of Gods holy Spirit breaketh in upon man, and his quickning vertue is felt; then life enters into that which was ſlain, and there is a deſire begotten in the heart to travel out of the Egyptian ſtate, into the good Land; that the Soul which came from God, might return back again to him (out of the ſinfull, wandring, miſerable, loſt eſtate) and might live and walk with him, in the purity, vertue and power of his own Life and Spirit.</p>
            <p>But then the other birth ſtrives for its life, and <hi>Pharoaoh</hi> (the King of <hi>Egypt</hi>) takes part with his Egyptians againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and there is no help to the poor ſoul, but as God pours out his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94552:52"/>
Judgments upon that hard nature and ſpirit in man, which is of the Birth of the Fleſh, and receives the influences and ſtrength of its father, which harden it againſt the true Seed. And now what a condition is this poor Soul in! the Light of Gods Spirit giveth it the ſence of its ſtate, and the quicknings of Life make it ſenſible of its bondage, there are alſo ſome deſires and longings after deliverance: but this doth but provoke the Enemy, and the Soul being yet in his Territories, and under his power, he dealeth the more hardly with it, increaſing its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and oppreſſions daly. And O the out-cries of the Soul in this ſtate! how is its ſpirit pained, anguiſhed and vexed within it, ſo that it could almoſt many times chuſe rather to lie ſtill in <hi>Egypt</hi> then undergo the heavy burdens, oppreſſions, fears and dangers, that it daily meets with in this ſtate.</p>
            <p>Yet there is a Secret hope, ſpringing up in the heart from the true Seed, which often encourageth it to truſt him, and wait upon him who hath viſited, in his pure miniſtration of Judgment. For this is felt many times (as the Soul is made truly ſenſible by the Lord) that the Judgment is not to the Seed, not to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>; but to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egyptians</hi>: and by every ſtroke of Gods wrath upon them, the Seed is eaſed, and its deliverance working out.</p>
            <p>And ſo at laſt when the Judment is finiſhed in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the ſtrength of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egyptians</hi> broken, their firſt-born ſlain, out comes <hi>Iſrael,</hi> out of the Dark Land, out of the Houſe of Bondage, to travel towards its reſting place. Then the Paſchal Lamb is known and fed on; yea it is becauſe of the Blood of the Lamb, ſprinkled upon the Door-poſts, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> is paſſed over and ſaved, in the day of <hi>Egypts</hi> viſitation. O who can read this truly, that hath not felt and been a living witneſs thereof!</p>
            <p>But now, when the ſeed is come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> there is not the end, but rather the beginning of its Travels. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egyptians</hi> (with their Horſes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ord, and wait to ſee his Salvation. Then ſhall the Sea be divided, which ſtopped <hi>Iſraels</hi> courſe, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with his <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the ſoul in this appearance of dreadful opprſſieng power
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94552:52"/>
be deſtroyed and ſeen no more. Yet in the willdernes in the paſſage through the entangelements to the holy Land, there are many ſtraits, trials and ſore Enemies to be met with, who will ſtrive by open force and alſo with enchantements to betray <hi>Iſrael</hi>: ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> there is a part yet unbrought down, yet unwrought out, at which they will be ſtriving to enter the mind. And as <hi>Iſrael</hi> forgets his God, walking out of his Counſel, hearkning to that which his ear ſhould be ſhut againſt, and ſo joyning to the contrary Seed; the Plagues, the Judgments, the Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and wo will be felt by him, and many Carkaſes may fall there.</p>
            <p>So that there may be a great outcry in the heart, <hi>Who can ſtand before this holy Lord God? ſhall we be conſuming with dying?</hi> yes there is ſomewhat muſt be conſumed with dying. Yea, if a man came ſo far, as to witneſs dominion and victory over his Souls Enemies, the evil Seed brought into death in him, and a poſſeſſion and inheritance in the pure reſt of Life: yet if that part be not kept in the death, if there be not a praying and watching to the Preſerver of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (in the pure fear and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility) the Enemy will be ſowing to the Fleſh again; he will be getting ſome of his corrupt Seed into the heart again (if the Soul do but ſleep and become negligent) and ſo corruption will take root again, and the contrary Birth grow up again, and the Foxes break into the Vineyard and ſpoil the tender grapes.</p>
            <p>So that this is our Religion, to witneſs the two Seeds, with the Power of the Lord bringing down the one, and bringing up the other: and then to witneſs and experience daily the ſame Power, keeping the one in Death and the other in Life, by the holy miniſtration of Gods pure living Covenant. And ſo, to know God in this Covenant (in this Covenant which lives, gives Life and Keeps in Life) and to walk with God and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſerve him therein, even in his Son, in the Light of his Son, in the Life of his Son, in the vertue and ability which flows from his Son into our Spirits, this is our Religion, which the Lord our God in his tender mercy hath beſtowed upon us: And indeed we find this to be a pure, living and undefiled Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion before God, daily witneſſing his acceptance of it in and through his Son, whoſe Name is here known and confeſſed,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94552:53"/>
worſhipped and honoured, according to the very heart of the Father.</p>
            <p>This may be further illuſtrated, and perhaps made more manifeſt to ſome, by a Scripture or two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.</p>
            <p>Here are the two Seeds (the Seed of the Serpent, the Seed of the woman) whoſe ſtriving and fight is in man, when God awakens the Soul, the one whereof hath a nature, a deſire or luſt contrary to the other. Now as the one of theſe prevails in any heart; ſo the other goes down. As the one gains Life and Power: ſo the other is brought into Death and Captivity: ſo that this is it every one is to wait for, after they once come to the ſenſible knowledge and experience of theſe two, to feel the Fleſh brought down, the luſts of it denied, the Judgments of the Lord adminiſtred to it; that ſo the other may come up to live, thrive and prevail in the Soul, and ſo the Soul witneſs Salvation and Redemption under its ſhadow. Thus <hi>Sion is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with Judgment, and her Converts with Righteouſneſs. Iſa.</hi> 1.27. What is <hi>Sion</hi>? Is it not the holy Hill of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Son is ſet King to reign, whereon the holy City is to be built, and God to be worſhipped in Spirit. What condition is <hi>Sion</hi> in, when God viſits her to redeem her? Is ſhe not laid waſt, deſolate, lying in the duſt: (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.13, 14.) Well: how will God redeem her? <hi>Zion ſhall be redeemed with Judgement and her Converts with Righteouſneſs.</hi> By bringing Judgements upon that which keeps her under, upon her Enemies the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Seed, God redeems her: and by bringing forth Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (the righteous Life and Spirit of his own Son) in thoſe whoſe minds are turned to her, whoſe faces are ſet <hi>Sion</hi>-ward, thus God redeems her Converts. Yes, yes, it is truly felt and witneſſed. The living Righteouſneſs of Chriſt revealed in the heart, and having power there, ſets free from all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which was there before. And then, when the unrighteous one is caſt out, and the righteous one is revealed, and the Soul united to him, and receives virtue and power from him; then he becomes a Servant of Righteouſneſs, and doth not commit ſin, but doth righteouſneſs; <hi>And he that doth righteouſneſs is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94552:53"/>
righteous, even as he is righteous,</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3.7. For how can it be otherwiſe, when the righteous Life is revealed and brought up into dominion in him? How can the ſame righteous Spirit and Life (revealed in the members, as was in the head) but live and act after the ſame manner in the members, as it did in the head? (O that men were turned to that, which would give them the certain knowledge and ſenſible experience of this!) Now this is exceeding comfortable and precious to them that are in the true travel towards it: much more to them that enjoy it.</p>
            <p>This is the ſum of all, even to know and experience what is to be brought down into death, and kept in death, what to be brought up out of the grave, to live to God and reign in his dominion, and what to be kept in ſubjection and obedience to him who is to reign. Now to experience it thus done in the heart; the Fleſh brought down, the Seed of Life raiſed, and the Soul ſubject to the pure heavenly Power, whoſe right it is to reign in the heart in and by the Seed, this is a bleſſed ſtate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for here the work is done: here the Throne of God is exalted, and his King reigns in righteouſneſs and peace, and all his Enemies are under his feet; and this Soul, this true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> this redeemed one may wear the white Robe, and ſerve God in righteouſneſs and holineſs without fear of his Enemies (keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and to the Covenant, which miniſters Life and Power abundantly) all the dayes of his life. For that was to be the outward ſtate of the outward <hi>Iſrael,</hi> keeping to God in the outward Covenant and it is to be the inward ſtate of the inward <hi>Iſrael,</hi> keeping to God in the inward Covenant, which is a pure Covenant of life and Peace, of all inward and ſpiritual bleſſings and mercies in Chriſt, wherewith the Souls are bleſſed that are obedient to God, and walk humbly with him in this Covenant. And I beſeech you to conſider (O tender people, who are grieved becauſe of ſin and corruption in your hearts, and would fain witneſs victory and dominion over it, in the Name and Strength of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) whom did that propheſie of <hi>Zachary (Luke</hi> 1.71, 72, 74, 75.) concern? what was that holy Covenant? who were to be ſo redeemed? who were the <hi>Iſrael</hi> that was to inherit this promiſe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:94552:54"/>All the Promiſes are yea and amen in Chriſt to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. Why ſhould not the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God hope to enjoy this? even ſo to be acquainted with Gods holy Spirit, and to wait upon him, that they may witneſs it granted to them, that they being delivered out of the hands of their Enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him (whoſe eyes are piercing, and behold no iniquity) all the dayes of their lives? Surely they who witneſs that promiſe (menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.8.) fulfilled to them, cannot fall ſhort of this. And truly, the Children of the New Covenant can never come throughly to live to God, till they witneſs the inward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the Heart, ſo as to love the Lord with all the Heart and Soul, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. Now, where it is ſo, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Luſt can find no place of entrance: and how then ſhould they be able to ſow their Seed and bring forth ſin? Out of the evil heart proceeds all evil: but out of that heart which is throughly Circumciſed, to love the Lord God wholly, evil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed.</p>
            <p>If Luſt be not conceived, it cannot bring forth Sin: and where the Womb, which conceived it, is kept dry and barren, it cannot conceive again.</p>
            <p>And is not this the Promiſe of the Goſpel, That the Womb which was once barren, ſhall be very fruitful and bear abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but the other grow feeble, and be able to bear no more? Oh that People had experience of Gods Power, and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve therein! what ſhould ſtand in the way of it?</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin of old, when they looked at their Enemies, and ſaw their footing and ſtrength in the Land, which God had promiſed to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed for an Inheritance, they could not believe that they ſhould be overcome.</p>
            <p>O take heed of the ſame unbelief now.</p>

               <p>Now this ſhould be mans work, even to return to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: to come back out of the prodigal loſt ſtate, to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, where there is ſufficiency and fulneſs of true Bread and Water of Life, to ſatisfie every hungry and thirſty Soul.</p>
               <p>The Way whereby a man muſt come, the Truth wherein he muſt be renewed, and the Life wherewith a man muſt be quickned, is Chriſt, the Son of the Living God: and he muſt know him as the Son of the Living God, and feel him revealed in him, and received by him, and ſo walk in him the Way, in him the Truth, in him the Life, if ever he come to the Father. He muſt not reſt in the deſcription of things; but feel and know, receive and walk in the <hi>Thing,</hi> which by the Spirit of the Lord hath been often formerly, and is ſtill deſcribed, in what words, and by what means the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit pleaſeth But to receive all the deſcriptions of him that were formerly given forth, or all the deſcriptions that are now given forth, that will not do; but the Soul that will live by

him, muſt receive him and feel the ingrafting into him, the holy Root, the living Word of Gods eternal Power, and muſt feel this Word ingrafted into his heart, ſo that there be a real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming one in nature and Spirit with him. And then he is truly in the Vine, in the Olive-tree, and partakes of the vertue and ſap thereof, he abiding therein and walking in the Spirit, Life and power thereof.</p>
               <p>Now hear a man walks not, nor cannot walk in the oldneſs of the Letter; but in the newneſs of the Spirit only, <hi>Paul,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his knowledge of the Scriptures, walked but in the oldneſs of the Letter, before Chriſt was revealed in him. And thoſe in the Apoſtles dayes, who had got the form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but turned from and denied the power, they walked but in the oldneſs of the Letter. Yea, the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> (for the moſt part) and the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who had received the right order and ordinances, and the true deſcriptions of things, and though they were full and rich and wanted nothing, they walked but according to the oldneſs of the Letter, and not in the newneſs and power of the Spirit of Life, But alas, how far are many (who pretend to Chriſt in this day) from this ſtate! who never came ſo far as to walk in the oldneſs of the Letter, from a true underſtanding thereof; but have only learned and continued to walk in the oldneſs of their own apprehenſions and conceivings upon the Letter.</p>
               <p>Can theſe, in this ſtate, poſſibly underſtand Truth, or know the inward ſpiritual, precious appearances thereof, either in their own hearts or others? Surely no. Why ſo? Why this is the reaſon; becauſe the meaſure the appearances of Truth (either in themſelves or others) by their own old apprehenſion and conceivings upon Scriptures concerning Truth, which is not the proper meaſure of it. Now all ſuch are yet in darkneſs, let them pretend what they will, and grow never ſo high in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerg, exerciſes and experiences after this manner: and ſo the beſt, zealouſeſt and moſt knowing of them in this ſtate, are but blind leaders of the blind, and (thus going on) ſhall moſt certainly fall into the Ditch of perdition. O that men could feel that which makes rightly ſenſible, and might lay it to heart! For no man can confeſs Chriſt (how then can he receive him and walk in him?) but by the holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:94552:55"/>And he that knoweth not the Spirit rightly, knoweth not Chriſt rightly: and he that doth not know him rightly, doth not confeſs him rightly: and none can know him rightly, but by the revelation of the Father inwardly. The miſtery muſt be opened within, or there is no true knowing. The miſtery of deceit is diſcovered within; and the miſtery of Life is diſcovered within alſo. And though the heart of man (in the unregenerate eſtate) is deceitfull above all things, and deſpeartely wicked, and no man of himſelf can ſearch or know it: yet that is not the ſtate of the true <hi>Jſraelites</hi> whom God hath cleanſed, and taught to deny themſelves daily; but they have boldneſs before that God who hath ſearched them, and removed from them the iniquities which he found therein. Yea, whoever witneſſeth Chriſt revealed within, ſhall find him revealed within for this very end, to deſtroy the works of the Devil there: and he is a powerfull Saviour of the Soul from ſin, and a powerfull De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of the works of the Devil within.</p>
               <p>Now concerning reading the Scriptures, mind this. It is ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that when they read <hi>Moſes</hi> (or in reading the Old Teſtament) the vail was upon their heart, which vail is done away in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14, 15. O conſider ſeriouſly, is the vail done away from thee? Doſt thou read the Scriptures with the unvailed eye? doſt thou read in the Anointing, in Chriſts Spirit, in the pure heavenly Wiſdom of the divine Birth? It was promiſed of old, that God would take away the face of the covering caſt over all people, and the vail ſpread over all Nations. Doſt thou witneſs this Promiſe fulfilled to thee? doſt thou know the difference between reading the Scriptures with the vail on thee, and with the vail off? Are the Scriptures opened and unlocked to thee by the key of <hi>David,</hi> ſo that thou readeſt and underſtandeſt them in the Light and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Gods holy Spirit; or is thy own underſtanding and will at work of it ſelf, in ſearching into the Scriptures? If the wrong birth, the wrong wiſdom, the wrong underſtanding be at work; it can gather but that which will feed and ſtrengthen it ſelf: and if thou beeſt not in Chriſt, and doſt not read in Chriſt, the vail is not taken away from thee: (for the vail is only done away in him:) but thou readeſt and walkeſt in the oldneſs of thy apprehenſions upon the Letter, and not in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94552:56"/>
the newneſs of the Spirit; and ſo knoweſt neither the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures nor the Power of God, what ever thou profeſſeſt to men, or dreameſt concernning thy ſelf. For it is no other indeed: Thy knowledge, thy apprehenſions, thy faith, thy hope, thy peace, thy joy (being out of the compaſs of the pure living Truth, in which the Subſtance, the vertue, the kernel of all is compriſed and comprehended for ever) are but as ſo many dreams.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> that men that are any whit tender, and have any ſincere deſires in them towards the Lord, could read that one Scripture (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.3, 4.) ſenſible and experimentally. <hi>O ſend out thy Light and thy Truth; let them lead me, let them bring me unto thy holy Hill, and to thy Tabernacles.</hi> (what, did not <hi>David</hi> know how to go to the Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then may men go unto the Altar of God unto God their exceeding joy, and witneſs his Hill and Houſe their dwelling-place, when God by his Light and Truth, ſent forth from him into them, leads them thither.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures are words, whoſe chief end drift, and ſervice is, to bring men to the Word from which the Scriptures came. And when men are there; then they are in the Life of the Scriptures, and witneſs the fulfilling of the Scriptures, even the executing of the righteous judgments of God upon that ſpirit, mind and nature in them, which is contrary to his image; and the fulfilling of the Promiſes and ſure Mercies, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt the Seed, and to them who are gathered into, and abide in Chriſt the Seed. Here's the Covenant, the new Covenant, That which is ſaid, or thoſe things which are ſaid concerning the Covenant in the Scriptures, are but deſcriptions of the new Covenant: but Chriſt within, the Hope of glory, the Spirit within, the Fear within, the Power of Life within, breaking down and reigning over the power of ſin and death (ſo that the Lord is ſerved in the dominion and power of his own Life, in righteouſneſs and holineſs before him, out of the fear of ſin and death, all the dayes of our lives; ſo that capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity can lead captive nor break the Souls peace no more, nay not ſo much as make afraid thoſe, that keep their Habitation on Gods holy Mountain) here is the Covenant indeed: the

ſtrength and vertue whereof is witneſſed in the Soul, as the Soul feels the power of Life revealed in it, and is made ſubject by the power to Chriſt who reigns in righteouſneſs, love, mercy and Peace, in the hearts of thoſe whom he redeems out of the earthly nature and ſpirit, up to the Mind and Spirit of his Father. And here the Pſalms, Hymns and ſpiritual Songs, the pure Songs, (the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Song of the Lamb) are ſung to the Father of Spirits, to the Redeemer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which never were ſung, nor can be ſung in any part of <hi>Babylon</hi>: but all thoſe Songs are but Dreames of the night, which will be turned into howling and bitter lamentation, when the whore (that which hath whored from God, and is not in the wiſdom of his Spirit, what ever ſhe may pretend) is ſtripped, and the nakedneſs of her Profeſſion and Religion (with all her Duties and Ordinances, as ſhe calls them) made manifeſt.</p>

O how is God glorified, and how is Redemption and real Salvation of the Soul witneſsed in this diſpiſed Diſpenſation of Truth, which God hath held forth in theſe latter dayes! Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord, who hath hid this pure diſpenſation of Life from the eye of the prudent, worldly wiſe part in every man, revealing it only to the babiſh ſimplicity which is of his Son, and which lives in him and by him.</p>

               <head>Concerning Chriſts being manifeſted without, and His being alſo manifeſted within, and how both are owned by them that know the Truth.</head>
               <p>IT is objected againſt us, who are called <hi>Quakers, That we deny Chriſt (and look not to be ſaved by him) as he was manifeſted without us, but look only to be ſaved by Chriſt in us.</hi> To which this is in my heart to anſwer to ſuch as ſingly deſire ſatisfaction therein.</p>
               <p>We do indeed expect to be ſaved (yea and not only ſo, but do already in our ſeveral meaſures witneſs Salvation) by the revelation and operation of the Life of Chriſt, within us; yet not without relation to what he did without us. For all that he did in that Body of Fleſh, was of the Father, and had its place
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94552:57"/>
and ſervice in the Will and according to the Counſel of the Father. But the knowledg and beliefe of that, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, hath been very much held in the unrighteouſneſs, and in the ſeparation from the inward work of the Power and Life of Chriſt in the heart: which, as ſo held, cannot ſave any. But whoever feels the Light and Life of Chriſt revealed in him, and comes into union with God there-through; he feels the work of Regeneration, of Sanctification, of Juſtification, of Life and Redemption; and ſo comes to reap benefit inwardly, and to partake of the bleſſed fruits of all that Chriſt did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. Yea, he that is thus one with Chriſt in the Spirit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exclude himſelf, nor is excluded by God from the advantage of any thing, nor every thing Chriſt did in that body of Fleſh.</p>
               <p>This indeed is the main thing, to witneſs Salvation wrought out in the heart: to witneſs the eternal Power and Arm of the Lord, laying hold on the Soul to ſave it; and not only laying hold on it to ſave it, but to witneſs the working out and the effecting of the Salvation, as really in the Subſtance, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old did in the ſhadow. For as they witneſſed <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> outwardly: ſo the true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> (the inward <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> the ſpiritual <hi>Iſraelite</hi>) is to witneſs that which is the Subſtance of theſe, even the Son of God revealed inwardly. Now they were not ſaved outwardly by a ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So to the inward <hi>Iſrael</hi> Chriſt is given for a Leader and Commander, who appears to the diſtreſſed, embondaged Soul in <hi>Egypt,</hi> brings out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo leads on towards the good Land and into it. Now, as the Soul followes; as the Soul believes in his Appearances, and obeys his voice in the holy pure Covenant of Life; ſo he works out the Redemption thereof. But as unbelief and diſobedience gets up, and the heart is heardened at any time againſt his Voice and Counſel, and the ear open to the temtaptions of the Enemy; the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereby goes backward, and the diſtreſs and captivity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again. This is witneſſed, known and experienced by ever, true Traveller towards <hi>Sion.</hi> Therefore the main thing requiſite is to abide in the ſence of the Redeemers Power, as alſo in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94552:58"/>
waiting for his motions and apperances, and in the Faith and Obedince thereof. For ſin gathers ſtrength and is brought forth by letting in and giving way to the motions thereof: and ſo alſo Holineſs and Righteouſneſs is brought forth and getteth ground in the mind, by harkening and giving up to the ſtirrings and movings of Gods holy Spirit. Therefore it is of great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to every true Traveller, to come to a right underſtanding and diſtinguiſhing of theſe: and then that the heart be kept with all diligence, becauſe out of it are the iſſues both of life and and death. And moſt happy is he, who knows the iſſues of death ſtopped and the iſſues of Life opened, and whoſe ſpirit is naked and open before the Lord, for Life to ſpring up in him and iſſue forth through him at its pleaſure. O it is a precious ſtate to witneſs Captivity led Captive by Life, and the power of Life reigning over it. And truly, there is as real deliverance witneſſed inwardly, by thoſe that wait upon the Lord and are faithfull to the leadings of his holy Spirit, as ever there was by the <hi>Jews</hi> outwardly, in their faithfull following <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi>: and Chriſt is as truly an Healer of his People, in this miniſtration of Life to them by his holy Spirit, as ever he was an Healer of Perſons out wardly in the dayes of his Feſh. That (with the other Miracles which he wrought then) was but a ſhadow of what he would work and perform inwardly in the day of his Spirit and holy Power: and ſhall he or can he (to thoſe that faithfully wait upon him) fall ſhort in the one, of what he ſhadowed out in the other? Nay ſurely, it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his heart, and he will not fail to perform it, to ſave to the very utmoſt all that come to God by him and abide in his holy, pure, righteous, living Covenant. Here is the skill of Chriſtianity, to abide in him: and here the living Virtue and pure Power is felt, which overcometh all, but nothing can overcome it; but Victory, Dominion, Glory, Majeſty and Power is ſung unto him, who is King of Saints, who reigns in righteouſneſs, and who eſtabliſheth Peace and Truth within his Borders.</p>

               <head>A few words concerning the the Principle of Truth, What it is, How it may be diſcerned, and how it may be purchaſed and poſſeſſed.</head>
               <p>QUeſt. 1. <hi>What is the Principle of Truth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the Light which reproves and makes ſin manifeſt. <hi>Whatſoever doth make manifeſt is Light</hi>: Wherefore he ſaith, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ariſe from the dead,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.13.14. There is no other way of awaking out of ſleep and ariſing from the the dead, but by the Light which makes ſin manifeſt. And, O how pretious is that Light!</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How may the Principle of Truth be diſcerned?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By its piercing, quickning nature, which diſcovereth it ſelf in its appearances and operations. For it appears and works, not like mans reaſon, or like motions of his mind which he takes into his underſtanding part: but it appears and works livingly, powerfully and effectually in the heart.</p>
               <p>Mans reaſon is corrupt, dark, impure ſince the fall; and in the hand and under the power of the wicked one. Its nature is to hide and cover ſin, not to diſcover it. Now the Light of the Law which diſcovers ſin, ariſeth not hence. Who can bring the clean pure light of the Law, out of the unclean, impure Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of man? The Light indeed may ſhine in the Darkneſs; but it is no part of it, but of another nature and deſcent. It is from Gods Spirit, and given to man in his love unto him, to lead him out of his dark wayes and ſpirit, into the pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and way of Holineſs. For the Light which diſcovers ſin, is all holy and pure, like the Fountain from whence it comes. Now a man that is acquainted both with Reaſon and with this Light, he can diſtenguiſh the Nature and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of both. For there is a great difference between TRUTH held in the Reaſoning part, and TRUTH held in its own Principle. It is very powerful in the one: it effecteth little in the other. In the pure quickenings of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94552:59"/>
Life this diſtinction is perceived and alſo held. Therefore our advice is to all men, to retire from all mortality, that they may come to feel the Spring of Life in themſelves (and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpringing therefrom into them to quicken them) and to wait to have their underſtandings opened and kept open by that; that ſo they may receive, retain, and not again loſe the capacity of underſtanding the things of Gods Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 3 <hi>How may this Principle (Seed or Pearl) be purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and poſſeſſed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By dying to a mans own wiſdom and will. There is not another way. For the Light is wholly contrary to man, as he ſtands, in the alienation from God. It croſſeth his ſpirit, his thoughts, his deſires, his knowledge, his reaſon, his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; even all that is of himſelf. He muſt therefore con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ult with none of theſe, but prefer the little, pure Demonſtration of the Light of Chriſts Spirit above all theſe, and ſtand in the parting with and loſs of them all for ever. O this is an hard ſaying, who can bear it? Surely none but thoſe that are taught and learn of the Father, can thus come to give up to and follow the Light of the Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfest, converting</hi> (or reſtoring) <hi>the Soul (Pſal.</hi> 19.7.) What Law was this, or what Law is this? Was it the Law of workes in the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi>? or is it the Law of Faith in the hand of Chriſt? Doth not Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten every man that cometh into the World? Would not God have all men to be ſaved? and doth he not give to all, a proportion of the true Light whereby they may be ſaved? And it is not the property of this Light to convert to God? Can any man receive this and be united to this, and it not change his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo that he muſt needs have a new nature, and from that new nature do that naturally, which the <hi>Jews</hi> by all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with-out this, could never do?</p>
               <p>Can any thing convert fallen man to God, but Chriſt? hath any thing power to convert to God, but his pure Law of Life? Can Chriſt and his Light be ſeprated? Can any man receive his Light and be united thereto, and not receive him? O that mens hearts and underſtandings were opened by the Spirit and Power of the Lord! For this is a direct riddle to all men, who have not Gods Heifer to Plow with, to underſtand it by.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94552:59"/>
And ſo for want of a true underſtanding, it is deſpiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected among the Builders: but with us it is elect and precious, choſen of God, and precious in the eye of our Souls.</p>
               <p>Now this doth not exclude or make void any thing, that Chriſt did in his Body of Fleſh here on Earth, or that he doth in Heaven for his: but this brings unto a Right, and into a Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of his Purchaſe. For all that are in the Darkneſs, and walk in the Darkneſs, have nothing to do with Chriſt in truth and reallity, what ever they may profeſs, and what hopes ſoever they may feed themſelves with: but all that are in any meaſure of his Light, and walk therein, they are ſo far of him, and have a right to and ſhare in all that he did in and from the ſame Light and Spirit.</p>
               <p>And this I dare poſitively hold forth as a ſtanding Truth, which hath been ſealed unto me by conſtant experience: that no man can fall in with, and obey the Light wherewith he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, but he muſt deny himſelf, and take up a Croſs to his own wiſdom and will, which Croſs is the Croſs of Chriſt, which is the Power of God to the Salvation of the Soul. And he that takes it up daily and waits upon the Lord therein, ſhall witneſs the power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to the redemption of his Soul: ye then he ſhall be able in true underſtanding to ſay, This is Light indeed, Life indeed, Power indeed. That powerfull Arm which hath ſaved me from Sin, and breaks the Snares, Devices and Strength of the Enemy before me (delivering me daily when none elſe can, and when my own ſtrength and wiſdom is as nothing) I cannot but call Chriſt, the living Power and Wiſdom of God revealed in me, who will not give his glory to another. For he is the Lord God of pure Power and Life for evermore; and beſide him there is no ſuch Saviour. Yea, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord for ever, the dayes of mourning after Salvation are over with many, and the dayes of reaping and enjoying Salvation are come, which ſhall endure with the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God for evermore, Amen.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WE, who are commonly called <hi>Quakers,</hi> being a People whom the Lord hath gathered (out of the wandrings, out of the many Profeſſions, out of the ſeveral ſcattered eſtates and conditions, wherein his Eye pittied us, and his love found us out) into a meaſure of the eternal reſt; where we have found that Life, that Power, that Manifeſtation of the Eternal Spirits and that redeeming Virtue, which we never were before diſtinctly acquainted with; I ſay, having taſted of this, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known this, having felt this, and come to a real enjoyment of it, in ſome degree, in our ſeveral meaſures; we could not poſſibly conceal this Treaſure, but in bowels of love (and in the movings of the Life and Power of the Spirit) have been drawn to teſtifie of it to them who were left behind, groveling under the burthen of corruption, and crying out becauſe of the ſin and bondage from the powers of darkneſs, who hath in a miſt withheld their eyes from beholding that living Virtue, which is able to ſave (and doth ſave, bleſſed be his Name) therefrom.</p>
               <p>Now this we have often found That this our Teſtimony hath not been received in the ſame Spirit and Love, wherein it hath gone forth; but the Enemy (by his ſubtilty) hath raiſed up jealoſies concerning us, and prejudices againſt us, as if we deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scriptures and Ordinances of God, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> that died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> profeſſing him only in words (to win upon others by) but denying him in reallity and ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>To cleare this latter, (for my heart is only at this preſent drawn out concerning that) we have ſolemnly profeſſed in the ſight of the Lord God (who hath given us the knowledge of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on in Life and Power) theſe two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That we do really in our hearts own that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94552:60"/>
came in the fulneſs of time, in that prepared Body to do the Fathers Will (his coming into the World, Doctrine, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in plainneſs and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of heart, according as it is expreſſed in the Letter of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we own no other Chriſt then that, nor hold forth no other-thing for Chriſt, but him who then appeared and was made manifeſt in fleſh.</p>
               <p>Now it would be nakedly inquired into by Profeſſors, What is the reaſon that their jealouſies ſtill remain concerning us, and why they are ſtill ſo ready to caſt this upon us? Certainly if they did know and own the ſame thing with us, (in the Spirit, and in the Power, in the Life, and in the Love which is of the Truth) this prejudice, and theſe hard thoughts could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. But if they themſelves do not know Chriſt in the Spirit (but only according to a relation of the Letter) no marvel though they miſs both of the Spirit, and of the true intent and meaning of the Letter, and Likewiſe be liable to claſh againſt the Truth, as it is made manifeſt in others.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Lord hath ſhewen me in Spirit ſeveral times, that they themſelves are guilty of that very charge (and that he will ſo implead them at his Judgment Seat) which they caſt upon us, even of denying that <hi>Chriſt</hi> which died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For he that owneth the words of Scripture, as he apprehends or conceives them in the reaſonings of his mind, and doth not wait to have them revealed in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> keeping out of his own reaſonings and conceivings, and waiting patiently till the Lord open the thing in the <hi>Spirit</hi>; he ſetteth up his own conceivings, or an Image in his mind of the mind of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but miſſeth of the thing it ſelf, which alone is known in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by them who wait upon the <hi>Spirit</hi> there to receive it, and are not haſty to ſet up their own reaſonings and imaginations concerning the thing in the mean time.</p>
               <p>No man can in Truth call Jeſus the Lord, but by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> But any man, that is any thing ſerious, and weighs the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the natural part, may ſo learn to acknowledge his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World, and that he is Lord and King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and may thus call him <hi>Lord,</hi> yea, and kindle a great heat in his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94552:61"/>
affections towards him; but all this (out of the <hi>Life,</hi> out of the <hi>Spirit</hi>) is but mans Image, which he forms in his mind, in his reading the Scriptures, and obſerving things therefrom. But the true calling Jeſus <hi>Lord,</hi> is from the feeling of his eternal Virtue in the Spirit, and finding the Scriptures opened to him by the Spirit, in a Principle which is above the Reaſon, comprehends the Reaſon, and confounds and brings it to nothing.</p>
               <p>Again, There is no true Knowledge of Chriſt, no living Knowledge, no ſaving Knowledge which hath the eternal Virtue in it; but that which is received and retained in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Light given by God to the Creature, in the Faith which is the Gift, in the Grace which is ſupernatural and ſpiritual, whereas the reſoning part is but Natural. And ſuch as have received the Spiritual underſtanding, know it to be diſtinct from the Natural; and we experimentally find a very clear diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cttion, between Scriptures ſearched out by the reaſonings of the mind, (and ſo practiſes drawn therefrom) and Scriptures opened by the Spirit, and felt in the Life.</p>
               <p>Now that Profeſſors generally have not received their knowledge of Chriſt from the Spirit, or from Scriptures open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it the Spirit (and ſo know not the thing, but only ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the thing, as mans reaſoning part may drink in from the Letter of the Scriptures) is manifeſt by this, In that they are not able in Spirit and Underſtandind to diſtinguiſh the thing it ſelf, from the Garment wherewith it was cloathed, though the Scriptures be very expreſs therein. Speak of Chriſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Relation of the Letter, there they can ſay ſomewhat: but come to the Subſtance, come to the Spirit of the thing, come to the thing it ſelf; there they ſtutter and ſtammer, and ſhew plainly that they know not what it is.</p>
               <p>Now the Scriptures do expreſly diſtinguiſh between Chriſt and the Garment which he wore; between him that came, and the Body in which he came; between the Subſtance which was vailed, and the Vail which vailed it. <hi>Lo I come; a body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> There is plainly He, and the Body in which he came. There was the outward Veſſel, and the inward Life. This we certainly know, and can never call the bodily Garment <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but that which appeared and dwelt in the Body.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94552:61"/>
Now if ye indeed know the <hi>Chriſt</hi> of God, tell us plainly what that is which appeared in the Body? whether that was not the <hi>Chriſt</hi> before it took up the Body, after it took up the Body, and for ever?</p>
               <p>And then their confining of Chriſt to that Body, plainly manifeſteth that they want the knowledge of him in Spirit. For Chriſt is the Son of the Father, he is the infinite eternal Being, one with the Father, and with the Spirit, and cannot be divided from either; cannot be any where, where they are not; nor can be excluded from any place where they are. He may take up a Body and appear in it, but cannot be confined to be no where elſe but there, no not at the very time while he is there. Chriſt, while he was here on Earth, yet was not excluded from being in Heaven with the Father at the very ſame time, as he himſelf ſaid concerning himſelf, <hi>The Son of Man which is in Heaven, John</hi> 3.13. Nor was the Father excluded from being with him in the Body, but the Father was in him, and he in the Father, whereupon he ſaid to <hi>Philip, He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father.</hi> What, did every one that ſaw that Body, ſee the Father alſo? Nay not ſo, but he that ſaw Chriſt the Son of the living God, whom fleſh and blood revealed not, but the Father only (<hi>Mat,</hi> 16.16, 17.) he ſaw the Father alſo.</p>
               <p>O Frinds, look to your knowledge of Chriſt, and to your Faith and Knowledge of the Scriptures, and to your Prayers alſo; for it is eaſie miſſing of the living ſubſtance in all theſe, and meeting with a ſhaddow, which may pleaſe and make a great ſhew in the earthly part, in the natural underſtanding and affections, but ſatiſfieth not the Soul, or that which is born after the Spirit, but ſtill the cry there goes out (where the Soul is awakned) after Truth, Subſtance, Life, Virtue, from Gods Spirit in the Spirit, which it alone can feed upon.</p>
               <p>Theſe four things following, I am certain of, which he that cometh into the true Light, ſhall infallibly experience them there.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> That nothing can ſave but the knowledge of Chriſt, even of that very Chriſt and no other, who took upon him the prepared Body, and offered it up at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

living Knowledge, Not a knowledge of him after, the Letter, (which the carnal part may get much of, and value it ſelf much by) but a knowledge of him in the Spirit; which is only given to that which is begotten and born of the Spirit, and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by that which abides and remains in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and runs not out into the fleſhly reaſonings, imaginings and concevings, about the things mentioned in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That that man who knoweth not <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor keepeth cloſe to him in <hi>Spirit</hi>; but (through darkneſs and miſguidance of the ſpirit of deceit) called the ſhinings of his Light (his reproofs, his checks for that which is evil, and his ſecret motions to that which is good) natural; This man, though he ſeem to own <hi>Chriſt</hi> never ſo much according to the Letter, yet in Truth denies him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He that denies <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (in his knockings and viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him in his own heart, and before men in the Truths which he holds forth by his Servants and Miniſters of his <hi>Spirit</hi> him will he deny before his Father in Heaven.</p>
               <p>O, I beſeech you, do not trifle about theſe things (for they are exceeding weighty) leſt ye periſh from the way; for miſſing of the Saviour, ye muſt needs alſo miſs of the Salvation. O that ye knew your ſtate, as God knows it to be, and as it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known and felt in the meaſure of his Life and holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> by thoſe whom God hath gathered together, and whoſe eyes he hath opened, and preſerveth open there, Glory be to his Name therefore: <hi>Yea, Glory, Glory, Glory, and everlaſting Praiſes be ſung to him throughout all the holy Land, ye in the very heights of Sion, by the Souls of the Redeemed, from henceforth, and for evermore, Amen: whoſe Mercy, Love, Grace, Wiſdom, Power and rich Goodneſs remaineth and endureth for ever; by and in which the Redeemed live to his Praiſe, who have overcome by the Blood of the Lamb, whoſe Blood they know what it is; and none elſe knoweth it, but they who feel the ſprinkling and virtue of it. Lo this is our God, we have waited for him; and how can we but be glad, and rejoyce in his Salvation! O let all that live by the breath of thy Power, and drink of thy Streams, ſing praiſe unto Thee, and exalt thy great and wonderful Name for ever and ever.</hi>

               <head>A brief Teſtimony for Truth,</head>
               <byline>by <hi>Tho. Tayler.</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>I Shall add ſomewhat of the Teſtimony which is written in my heart, by the finger of Gods Spirit, concerning the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed they have met with many reproaches, and ſore oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions many wayes, ſince they were a People: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all, their Bow abides in ſtrength, and the hands of their arms have been made ſtrong againſt the wicked one, with all his devices in his ſeveral kinds of inſtruments: and their Light is ſtill the ſame and their God the ſame, who bleſſeth them from day to day, even in the midſt of all the revilings, ſlanders, perſecutions and curſes, which they have met with from men without, and in the midſt of all the temptations, inward trials and afflictions alſo, which are often met with inwardly. Yea we know him to be our God and cannot but truſt him, having found him to be faithfull to us hitherto, and knowing his nature to be ſuch, that he cannot but continue his loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and faithfulneſs, to all who are gathered by him in to his holy, inward, ſpiritual Covenant of Life and Peace, and who dwells with him therein. And truly we are fully ſatisfied and at reſt in him, and cannot deſire another, then he who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed our Souls from death, given us Life, brought us out of the Pit wherein was no water, into a large place, ſet our feet upon a rock (a rock indeed) and eſtabliſheth our goings in the path of holyneſs, working all our works in us and for us, by his Spirit and Power. Yea, we have the Witneſs in our hearts, even the Witneſs which never erred nor can deceive, which teſtifieth to and with our ſpirits, our Sonſhip: ſo that we do not imagine our ſelves ſons from apprehenſions upon Scriptures, but we feel our ſelves ſons in the true ſenſibleneſs, and know who <hi>David</hi> is, and reap and inherit the ſure mercies of <hi>David</hi> daily, <hi>O bleſſed be our Father, O bleſſed for ever be the Father of Life, who feeds, who nouriſhes, who waters, Who refreſhes (with the Bread of Life and with the pure living water) his Lambs,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94552:63"/>
his Babes, his plants, his tender ones, of whom he is daily tender, and who are daily tender of his Name and Honour. And if any man preach another God, then he who creates anew in the true Light, and therein puts forth his arm of Salvation; Death, and Deſtruction and the Curſe, are his portion from the hand of the Lord.</hi>

            <head>THE Concluſion.</head>
            <p>GLorious was the Eſtate of the Church, before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, for Purity of Doctrine, for holy Order and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, for Love to God, one to another, and to all men (even of Enemies) for Faith in God, for the Preſence and Power of his Spirit among them (inſomuch as the unbeliever coming among them, might find his heart and ſtate reached to, and be forced to confeſs and report that God was in them of a truth) for ſingleneſs and uprightneſſe of Heart, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and innocency of Spirit and Converſation, for zeal for God and his Truth, ſuffering the ſpoiling of their Goods, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Stripes, and many other wayes, both from the Heathen, and alſo from the profeſſing Jews, who had been the Church once. O what ſhall I ſay concerning the beauty and lovelineſs of that State! Ye that would know it, O wait to feel it in that, which giveth the true ſence of it.</p>
            <p>But over this glorious State, came a dark, thick, corrupt night, wherein the Kernel was loſt, and the Shell defaced; wherein the Houſe, which had been ſwept and garniſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came again recovered and poſſeſſed by the wicked ſpirit. And how great hath this darkneſs been! O what a kind of Church hath appeared in the World, wherein the ſpirit of Enmity hath dwelt and acted in men, under the Name of Chriſtianity!
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94552:63"/>
So that inſtead of loving and ſeeking the good of Enemies, they are ready to rend and tear one another for every little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and will be Lords over mens Faith, requiring men to Practice things in Religeon, before the Spirit of the Lord teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them ſo to do, which the Apoſtles did not. For though they had from God the expreſs knowledge of what was Truth, and could certainly inſtruct and build men up therein; yet they were not Lords over mens Faith; but if men were otherwiſe minded then according to what they knew and taught, they could wait and bear with them, bidding them walk ſo far as they had attained, and God in his due time would reveal the reſt alſo. O that men were come to this Spirit again! Then they would be Chriſtians indeed, and then they might be known to be Chriſts Diſciples, by their loving the Brethren and fellow-Diſciples. But without this love, mens Religion is but as a tinkling Cimbal, making a noiſe and ſound of ſomewhat, but not having the true Nature or Virtue of Religion in it.</p>
            <p>Now will it not be a glorious Day, when the Spirit of the Lord cleanſeth away this thick darkneſs, and cauſeth the Light of his pure Truth to ariſe and appear again? Why there is ſuch a Day to be, wherein the true Church (which was reproached and driven into the Wilderneſs) is to come out of the Wilderneſs again, and her Witneſſes ſtand on their feet again, and her Seed to ſpring up in the Power of Life, following the Lamb, who marcheth on fighting with the Sword of the Spirit (the words of his mouth) conquering and to conqeur thereby the corrupted Antichriſtian World, even as he did at firſt the corrupt Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh World. The Lord will purifie his Temple, and cleanſe the World, by the Plagues of his Angels which he hath prepared, making way for the beauty of his Truth, and the Church of his gathering; wherein he will bring forth his Righteouſneſs, wherein his Power ſhall appear, wherein his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhall be made manifeſt, wherein that which ſhined before in the Primitive Church, ſhall ſhine again in this new-reared Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his, inſomuch as men ſhall be forced to ſay, <hi>This is the Church of Chriſt indeed, God is here of a truth; This is the Goſple-Jeruſalem indeed, which is built upon the holy Hill of</hi> Sion, <hi>in which Innocency, Righteouſneſſe, Truth, Love, Sweetneſſe, Peaceableneſſe, and the gentle Nature and Spirit
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94552:64"/>
of the Lamb lives and reigns; and the Lord bleſs thee, O Habitation of Juſtice, and Mountain of Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now of a truth this Work is begun. The times of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are come from the Preſence of the Lord. The Lord hath heard from Heaven, pitiying the cries of his Seed, and hath viſited their Souls, cauſing the Light of Life (even the pure Light of the everlaſting Covenant) to ſhine upon their Tabernacles. But whoever would know theſe things, and partake of them, muſt come in at the Door, by the Guidance of the Spirit, through the Light which is with him. And he that would enjoy the full Light (even the ſhinings forth of the Sun at noon day) muſt begin with its glimmerings, even that in the heart, which diſcovereth and draweth out of the corrupt ſtate of the World, towards the Father. O hear and live. Do not diſpute about it, but wait to feel it; upon the feeling of it, deſpiſing the ſhame, and taking up, and enduring the Croſs, and ſo bearing the reproach and ſufferings of Chriſt in thy Age and Generation. And as thou obeyeſt, thou ſhalt know of its Doctrine; but out of the pure Faith and Obedience, there is no true, ſound, deep-rooted know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but all of that kind muſt be parted with, for the knowledge which is of the Faith, and which is made manifeſt and increaſed in the Obedience; which knowledge is of a far more excellent Kind and Nature. Then that which thou art to part with for it. The Lord guide thy Mind, and ſtretch forth his Hand to help thee, who from the leaſt touch of a true Nature and Spirit, deſireſt after the pure Truth and Way of eternal Life. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Teſtimony (here held forth) is faithful and true, and (I know) the Witneſs of God in many hearts will anſwer to it; and happy is he that maketh a right uſe of it. For, ſo doing, his Soul will not fall ſhort of the pure living Truth, nor ſet up any thing elſe for Truth which is not.</p>
