            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas this Author, <hi>Henry Adis,</hi> late of <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>
Vpholder, being impriſoned in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
chamber of the Fleet, <hi>by an Arbytrarie power: and moſt
unjuſtly turned out of his houſe, and ruined by that power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Man of our times, the honourable</hi> William Lenthal,
<hi>Eſquire,</hi> not as he is Speaker of the Honourable Houſe
of Commons, but as he is a <hi>Commiſsioner</hi> for the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of the <hi>great Seal, and Master of the Rolls.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
denied the benefit of going abroad with his keeper
<hi>by him</hi> (though petitioned for) ſo that he cannot have
any benefit of his Trade and Cuſtomers, who for the
preſent relief of himſelf, his wife, and three ſmall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
was lately enforced to publish in print ſome of
thoſe Arts which it hath pleaſed God to endow him
with; amongſt which are theſe enſuing, which have been
found very commodious and beneficial to all that have
uſed him therein, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath found out a new way by fire to purge out all
manner of greaſe, wax, oil, or other ſpots of ſweet meats,
Ale, Beer, or Wine, or any other filth or ſoil, out of
wearing apparel, or other things, without ſlabb'ring or
wetting them, ſo that the colour shall not be thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered,
though not in grain, and with that expedition,
that if he have a ſuit over night, it shall (if neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire)
be reſtored by the next morning compleatly
cleanſed, and as well over all the ſuit, as the ſpotted pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
ſo that the whole garment shall be well nigh as
fresh as at firſt: and as ſpeedily all clothes of Leather.</p>
            <p>He alſo cottoneth Friſe, Bayes, or Peniſtone in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
without taking them to pieces: and alſo raiſeth a
wool upon Cloth or Stuffes in ſuits that are not too low
worn upon the thred; ſo that if he have a ſuit but about
<pb facs="tcp:116289:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
half worn, he bringeth it to a very good perfection; yet
if never ſo low worn, he ſo clenſeth and ordreth it, that it
may be long worn with credit.</p>
            <p>By the foreſaid Art he alſo doth as much in Silks,
Sattins, Taffates, and Velvets, as ever was done by any,
to clenſe it from greaſe, wax, or oyl, which he doth in
wearing apparel, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>By which Art alſo he refresheth ſilver and gold lace,
or fringe upon wearing apparel, beds, or other things,
though never ſo black and tarnished, and bringeth it to a
very good luſtre, and to continue long.</p>
            <p>All which by reaſon of the expedition and eaſie charge
hath and will be accounted very commodious for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of all ranks and qualities; eſpecially thoſe who are
deſirous to wear their apparel neat and clean, and are
not willing in theſe diſtracted and hard times to make
new, or beſtow much in altering thoſe they have.</p>
            <p>He alſo ſcoureth, refresheth, and mendeth all ſorts of
Tapeſtry, Turkey-work, or Needle-works, and riddeth
them clean from moths.</p>
