            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AFter ſo many Years treading the Stage, where both in my acting and capering Days (to my Vanity be it ſpoken) I made no inconſiderable Figure; I come at laſt to viſit the Publick in another of my no leſs known Capacities, <hi>viz.</hi> Poetry; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly have turn'd this little Off-ſping, this natural Brat of mine, out into the wide World. I confeſs, indeed, my Talent this way never made any larger Appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, than a Prologue, a Lampoon, a Sonnet or Madrigal, or ſome ſuch ſhorter Poetical Fragment; and when I launch out into ſo Voluminous a Piece, as a whole Play, you may believe that my leiſure for ſo tedious a
<pb facs="tcp:47745:3"/>
ſcrible, proceeds from no common Cauſe. A dull Worlds, want of Buſineſs, and much Idleneſs, with not overſtockt a Pocket, you ſee, Gentlemen, may do much. But now, after expoſing (to uſe <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi>'s Title) my Works in Print, what ſucceſs I am like to meet, now hang me, as great a Fortune-Teiler as I have been, all my Prognoſticks can no more foretell, than <hi>Lily</hi> (with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence be it ſpoken) could divine who ſhit at his Door. My Fate lies in your Hands, and ſo e'en much good may't do the bold Adventurer, the Bookseller. If it finds your favourable Reception, he has his Point, and I my Wiſh.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome over-curious Queriſts now may ask me, with what Confidence, in the Devil's Name, I durſt write a Play. Confidence, ſay they! I ſuppoſe they don't know me that ask that Queſtion: However to ſatisfie any ſuch inquiſitive Gentlemen, in troth I have Acted Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> ſo often, and ſo feel ngly, that I could not poſſibly for-bear
<pb facs="tcp:47745:3"/>
copying after ſo fair an Original. And now if my other Brothers of the Quill picque at me for it, I do not much matter: but if I incur your hard Cenſure, truſt me, Gentlemen, I ſet ſo high a Value upon your Favours, that I proteſt if my Play diſpleaſe you, and you ſhall think fit to exclude me from the <hi>Muſes,</hi> as the Players have done from the <hi>Stage,</hi> it will certainly put me to the charge of a new Recantation to recover your good Graces.</p>
            <p>Well, but if I muſt write a Play, How comes it that I begin my Dramatick Writing no ſooner? And make my firſt Eſſay at theſe elderly Years upon my Back, this <hi>Fumbling Age of Poetry</hi> (as a Reverend elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has it?) Why truly, as old Dr. <hi>Jaſper</hi> ſaid of his Maiden-head, I was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to die in Ignorance, and therefore reſolv'd to take one Touch before I left the VVorld. And this Production therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my very Virgin Iſſue, as ſuch I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to your kind Protection.</p>
            <p>
