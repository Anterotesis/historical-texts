            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> hath given battle to the Lord
<hi>Muskerry's</hi> Army which conſiſted of 1000. horſe
and Dragoons, and neer 2000 foot. My Lord
<hi>Broughill</hi> had but 400. horſe and Dragoons, and
under 600 foot, the charge was bloody on the
Victors ſide; For the Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> had 120<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
horſe-men ſhot, and 30 killed; he charged him that led up the
Iriſh oppoſite wing, and killed him, but the Iriſh did ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
him, that his own Troop that conſiſted of moſt Gent. Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madoes,
was charged in Front, Flank and Rear both by horſe and
foot; Amongſt which my Lord was ſo farre engaged, that they
offered him Quarter, upon the refuſal whereof they cried, kill
the fellow with the Gold lace coate, which in all probability had
been effected if a Reformado Leivtenant of his Troop had not
come in to his reſcue, whoſe horſe was killed on that account, and
himſelf twice ſhot. The Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> got off with a dry Pike
beating by the Pikemen, but his horſe received three ſhots. The
Iriſh loſt 600 men, among which many officers, priſoners but few
are taken, beſides ſome Officers of the field which are now in
<hi>Corke;</hi> the defeated Army had deſigned conjunction with the
<hi>Lemſter</hi> forces and the releif of <hi>Limrick</hi> where the ſiege ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues,

The Lord Deputies deſigne upon <hi>Limrick,</hi> being, as it is
believed, to reduce it by famine, and therefore to prevent them
from all relief, is very diligent. The Toryes do ſo infeſt all parts
of this Dominion, that without parties of horſe all parts are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.
The Plague, I praiſe God, is quite ceaſed at <hi>Youghall,</hi> and

To morrow the Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> goeth again hence into the
field to hinder the Iriſh from gathering in a body again.</p>

God had of late been pleaſed to withdraw his Favour from
us, in many (though ſmall) encounters; I truſt this has taken away
the expectation of relief from <hi>Limbrick,</hi> who my Lo. Deputy the
laſt night did acquaint with our Victory, by 3 peals of Ordnance,
and three volleys of ſmall ſhot round about the Leager. I make
bold alſo to ſend you a Copy of one of thoſe many charmes which
we found quilted in the doublets of many which were kild, that

            <p>THere having been letters intercepted out of <hi>Limerick</hi> from
the Governour, the Biſhop, the Major, and the other prime
men in it, that they were in a very low condition; and that if
not ſuddenly relieved, the Commonalty of the town would
force them to take conditions, conjuring all their friends in
armes over all <hi>Ireland</hi> to march day and night to their relief; I
inſtantly drew all the forces of this County together, hearing
that the Lord <hi>Muskery</hi> was marched out of the County of <hi>Kierry,</hi>
with all the Forces he had there, and was drawing to him all the
men he had in this County, intending a general Randezvouz
with the Forces of <hi>Lei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſter</hi> at <hi>Galbally,</hi> a faſt mountainous
Country, not above 15. mile from <hi>Limerick,</hi> which was the
place they intended to relieve; upon my advance up to <hi>Mallow,
Muskerys</hi> forces not being formed, retired weſtward into the
mountains and woods neer <hi>Driſhane;</hi> the place wherein the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118033:3"/>
beginning of the laſt winter he had defeated a conſiderable Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ours, under the Command of Lieut. Col. <hi>Elſing;</hi> This
made us not credit that their deſigne was for <hi>Limerick,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the deſtroying of our Quarters, and that which inclined
us the more to that faith, was, the certain intelligence we had of
a ſtrong Party of Horſe, being gone over the Black-water only
to that end, for we could not fancy if really they mean't any
high thing, they would voluntarily deny themſelves ſuch an aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
We therefore for the ſecurity of our Quarters div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ded
our ſelves in two parts, yet not ſo far aſunder, but that in ſix
houres we could eaſily joyne, and becauſe thoſe Horſe gone over
the Black-water might be timely looked after, I marched all that
night (which was the moſt tempeſtuous night I ever was in)
in order thereunto. In the morning by dawn of day a in thick
miſt, their body got by us within Musket-ſhot, but a Party of
ours took two Lieutenants of Horſe and ſome Troopers, by
whom we learn't (as the ſame day I did by ſeveral intelligences)
that <hi>Muskery</hi> would inſtantly again come up to <hi>Droumagh,</hi> a
place about 12. miles from <hi>Mallow,</hi> and there would be forming
his Army. This made me ſuddenly again Randezvouz at <hi>Caſtle-lyons,</hi>
where I received Orders from my Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> to make
the fighting or diſperſing of <hi>Muskery's</hi> Army, my only deſigne.
The 21. therefore of this inſtant I marched to <hi>Mallow,</hi> the 22.
(though we knew the enemy had treble our numbers, both in
Horſe and Foot, yet in regard if they were not ſuddenly fought
with, we might be neceſſitated to bring all our intereſt in <hi>Ireland</hi>
to one Caſt.) We reſolved at a Councel of Warre, on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
to go and ſeek them, but we were not three miles on our
March towards them, but a Spy I had ſent out, brought me cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
intelligence, that the enemies Army was three houres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
marched from <hi>Droumagh</hi> towards <hi>Caſtle-liſhin,</hi> one of the
faſteſt places in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and directly in the way to <hi>Limerick,</hi>
which was immediately confirmed by ſome Priſoners our Scouts
brought in. This made us haſten after them, and about the fall of
night we diſcovered the fires of their Campe; about midnight in
an horrid ſtorm of rain and winde, we fell upon their Horſe-guards
and beat them in, at which their Camp took ſo hot an
Alarum, that without giving us leave or time to do any thing elſe,
they drew all away in haſte and diſorder, but through a place
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118033:4"/>
and country that the very Teigs themſelves could hardly march
in but we had this ſatisfaction, that 'twas to the place from
whence they came, which ſecured us from any intent they had
on our freinds before <hi>Limerick.</hi> The 23. we lay within four miles
of their Army again. The 24. we advanced to fight them, but
they retreated over the Black-water to <hi>Driſhane.</hi> The 25. we
followed them over the Black-water, which was much riſen by
the vaſt rain which were fallen, concluding if they would not
fight on that advantage, 'twas in vain any longer to follow them.
beſides, our Men and Horſes were exceedingly harraſt, we had
ſpent all our Bread, and which was worſe, they might by a further
proſecution of them that way, give us the ſlip in the night and get to
<hi>Limericke,</hi> or to a conjunction with their friends, before we could get
up to ours. Theſe and many ſuch other conſiderations made us, after
we were paſt the Black water, and ſaw no Enemy, to return toward
<hi>Mallow,</hi> from whence we intended having breaded our Souldiers,
to march to a Place called <hi>Courtſtowne,</hi> which lay fitly to interpoſe
between <hi>Muskeries</hi> Army and the <hi>Galbally,</hi> and not above one good
daies march from <hi>Limericke.</hi> In proſecution whereof we marched
from the ground we were drawn up in, and our Van was not full half
a mile from it, when our Rear ſent me word, they diſcovered foure
great diviſions of Horſe come down the hill, and that they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
after us. This Alarme made me march back to a faire Moore
I had newly gone over, where I drew up the Van of the Horſe and our
Foot, and went to a riſing ground, from whence I diſcovered all their
Army come down into the Plain and advancing directly towards us,
I knew when once their Foot came into the Plain they would give us
a faire field, and to ſpeak truth they could not then have avoided it.
I gave Major <hi>Wallis</hi> the command of our Left Wing, Maj. <hi>Coppage,</hi>
commanded our Foot, &amp; I our Right wing. Our Word was <hi>Proſperity</hi>
theirs St. <hi>James,</hi> our ſignall white in hats, theirs greene Fearne.
Being drawn up as we deſired, I went to every diviſion of Horſe
and Foot, and encouraged them, but bleſſed be God, they
needed no ſuch thing; for indeed I never ſaw men more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
willing to fight then our men were. In this good temper to
ſave the enemie the labour of coming to us, I advanced to meet
them, and a Regiment of their Foot having ſaluted my wing all
the way they marched to the charge (though God be praiſed
not diſorder'd it, we fired in each others faces, and mingled, I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118033:4"/>
had the happineſſe to kill the Officer which lead the Diviſion I
charged, and after a round diſpute, though we were ſo very
much overnumber'd and winged, that they charged us in Flanck
and Rear, and that their Pikes too galled us exceedingly; yet
after a ſecond charge on one of their rallyed Diviſions, we gave
them a totall route, and carryed all that wing of Horſe and Foot
before us. This was done before our left wing engaged (we it
ſeems marching ſomewhat of the faſtteſt. And though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
when I ſaw our left wing engaged and mingled; and I was
rallying ſome Horſe to go and help them, yet by a great Diviſion
of theirs falling into our Rear, after we had beaten what we
charged in Front, we were neceſſitated to mind our ſelves, and
by that time we had beaten theſe importunate followers, God
was pleaſed to give Major <hi>Walliſ's</hi> wing the like ſucceſſe to what
he had given mine. We had a very fair execution for above
three miles, and indeed it was bloody, for I gave order to kill all
though ſome few Priſoners of good quality were ſaved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All their
Foot field-officers charged on foot with pikes in their hands, ſo
that few of them got off, it too, being farre from any boggs or
woods, which they ſay they elected purpoſely that their men
might have no confidence but in their courages; but we relyed
on a better ſtrength then the Arme of fleſh, and when their
ſtrength failed them, ours did not fail us. Their Prieſts all the
way before they came to fight, encouraged them by ſpeeches, but
eſpecially by ſprinkling holy water on them, and by charmes,
of which I herewith ſend you a coppy, (many of them were
found quilted in the doublets of the dead). Certainly they are a
people ſtrangely given over to deſtruction, who though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
underſtanding enough, let themſelves be ſtill deluded by
rediculous things, and by more rediculous perſons; Had I
been one of the charmed, I would have firſt tryed mine on the
Prieſt which gave it. <hi>Muskery</hi> himſelf got off narrowly.</p>
            <p>The chief of our priſoners are L. Col. <hi>Macgillacudáy</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
young <hi>Muskery's</hi> Regiment, and a man more popular
than <hi>Muskery</hi> himſelf in his own country. Major M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gillariogh</hi>
an old <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldier, Maj <hi>Mac Fivine,</hi> a very leading man in <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
Capt. <hi>Mac Gillacuddy,</hi> brother to the Lieut. Col. Cap. <hi>Seales</hi>
Governour of the Iſland of <hi>Valentia,</hi> Cap. <hi>Suillivane,</hi> Capt. <hi>Clauſly</hi>
with ſome Troopers, and other inferiour Officers. What peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118033:5"/>
of quality are killed we know not, onely one L. Col. <hi>Suggaine</hi> that
ran up and down the field offering <hi>100li.</hi> for his life, neither doe we
know the number of the dead, but this we know, that all the field
was well beſtrewed with dead bodies. I think that there was never
knowne better knocking in <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor ſo faire a field, where all diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
came to handy-blowes, few of our Horſe Officers but are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
or their horſes wounded. My own Horſe was wounded in three
ſeverall places, and I had a good knock with a Pike over my left arm
Lieut. <hi>Inman</hi> under God ſaved my life, but in doing it, had like to
have loſt his owne, being wounded in two places, and his horſe ſhot
under him. We have not loſt above 26 men, all Troopers, and we
have not leſſe then 130 wounded, all Troopers too but ſix. There were
(in this ſignal mercy) many ſweet appearances of providence towards
us, O that our returns were proportionable to their cauſe: But
truly I bleſſe God, I can confidently ſay this, that not the meaneſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
amongſt us, but did with his mouth acknowledge God in the
whole action, and I hope did it too, with, and in his heart.</p>
            <p>We are ſo extreamly ſhattered, that we are come for a few daies to
refreſh and fit ourſelves for a ſecond march.</p>
