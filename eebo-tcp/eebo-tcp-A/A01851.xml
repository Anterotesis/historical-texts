            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

An Ayery one, I terme it, for I judge others by my selfe, who cannot feed by praises. But thus much I must needs say of it, that if ever it were worthy the reading, now the worth of it is mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, the whole being perused by the Author, and some, not deformed peices added, which as they mend the bulke, so they take nothing from the Dignity of the <hi>Poem.</hi> But for this I put my selfe upon my Countrey. Thus farre the Authour thought it not unfit, to please thee and his youth: from hence forward, you must expect
<pb facs="tcp:3364:3"/>
nothing from him, but what shall relish of a bearded and austere Devotion. And this, I trust will be no small incitement to thy approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the worke since it is the last: All men we know, delight in <hi>Benjamin.</hi> One thing I must not forget to acquaint thee with; Some men, (that would be wise without booke,) have excepted against a passage in <hi>Sforza,</hi> concerning <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azzoes</hi> revealing his wives counsells to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, as a thing beyond Probability, or Poetry: but it shewes that they are short of History, for let them read almost the first leafe of <hi>Guicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardin,</hi> or the eighth book of <hi>Comminés,</hi> they shall there find what they carpe at here, and that this fond opennesse, was <hi>Galeazzo's,</hi> and not the Authors weaknesse: I would say somewhat of the <hi>Levite</hi> too, but it needs not, seeing the Authours blasphemy is turned into the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ignorant Detractor. But I beginne to talke rather like a Maker, then a seller of Bookes: I have nothing now more to adde, but this, love the Authour, and me for bringing you acquainted.</p>

                  <l>The thiefe was made the guardian.</l>
                  <l>But can a Wolfe forget to prey?</l>
                  <l>Can Night be lightened into Day?</l>
                  <l>Without respect of lawes or blood,</l>
                  <l>His charge he makes to be his food.</l>
                  <l>With that triumphant he sits downe,</l>
                  <l>Opprest, not honour'd with a Crowne,</l>
                  <l>And on the lesser beasts does try</l>

                  <l>Vengeance and He at once doe wake,</l>

It is to your name that I owe what ever fruits of my spent time shall be preserved, it is to your name that I owe what ever fruits of my former time, being unhappily lost, may have a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of recovery. And could I dedicate any of my remaining Labours with more justice unto any, then to him, by whose friendly care, I dare almost assure
<pb facs="tcp:3364:15"/>
my selfe of them which are remaining? But some perhaps may say for this, that it had beene better if it had beene lost, or at least that these kinde of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are more judiciously supprest then published. Sermons had beene fitter for my setting forth, and to preach more proper then to write. But is not this to preach? I have heard divers speake an houre, who preach not, and there are many, who effectually preach, that are more sparing of their breath. If I make the ambitious see that he climbes but to a fall, the usurper to acknowledge, that blood is but a slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery foundation of power, all men in generall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that the most glorious is not the most safe place: is not this to cry downe Ambition and Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? or is it lesse to shew, then to threaten? and are not men so much moved with the event it selfe, as with the commination of the event? And yet in this age, wherein onely Heresie or Sedition preferre a Boooke, wherein Contradiction is called Learning, and Zeale wonders that she is become Faction, I can expect but a few Readers, whose small number shall be no discouragement at all to me, if that your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall counterpoise them, which is the onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired crowne of</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Odovicke Sforza,</hi> after he had cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly supplanted the Duchesse from the wardship of her sonne <hi>Galeazzo,</hi> as cunningly practizeth to bee the murtherer of him, of whom he would seeme to be the Protector. To this end he was to remove this impediment. <hi>Isabella</hi> daughter to the Prince of <hi>Calabria,</hi> and Grand-childe unto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> was wife to <hi>Galeazzo.</hi> A woman of a spirit as high as her birth, &amp; equall to <hi>Sforza</hi> in all things but the sex: she perceiving the stupidity of her husband, &amp; how that whatsoever she projected for his safety, he discovered to his vncle, for his overthrow, makes her father secretly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the passages, desiring him to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his sonne in law from the usurpation of his Protector. This could not bee so privately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, but that <hi>Sforza</hi> had an incling of it, whether out of his owne reach he guessed it: or by his Nephewes sottishnesse he understood it. To prevent then his owne ruine, whilst hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his Nephewes, hee ventures on those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which the height of feare rather rusheth on, then chuseth, which more expresse and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, then remove, or avoyde a danger. He
<pb facs="tcp:3364:16"/>
knew the French claime to <hi>Naples,</hi> to the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of which hee sollicites the young King; whom either his right, or inconsideratenesse quickly armes unto the action. But before his comming, he by continuall messengers deludes the old King, and makes him beleeve that there was no purpose of his comming, and that the French journey unto <hi>Naples,</hi> as it was onely the childe of rumor, and had no being but from fame, so in a very short space, in the age of a wonder it would vanish and expire. Thus was <hi>Ferdinand</hi> perswaded from his necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, till having certainly understood that all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence would be too late, the French being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy very strong upon his frontires, cheated, not conquered, he dies, and leaves his sonne <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi> heire of his kingdome, and his troubles. The French king being now entred in person into <hi>Italy, Galeazzo</hi> dyes of a poyson at <hi>Pavia,</hi> when <hi>Sforza</hi> has brought this worse poyson into his Country. But the French growing prodigiously victorious, and almost by the very seeing over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming their opposites, <hi>Sforza</hi> begins to be apprehensive of his owne danger, and strives to rid himselfe of these incumbrances, in the which a too much providence had intangled him. A consideration without doubt necessary, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most past the season, it being near unto an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility to expell him now, whom it was farre
<pb facs="tcp:3364:16"/>
from any difficulty at the first not to admit. So that this second resolution did onely proclaime the folly of the first, which either in wisedome he should not have ventured on, or, in honesty not have altred. But howsoever, he enters into a new league with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and gives the French after their victorious returne from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> halfe an overthrow at <hi>Taro.</hi> And now when he thinkes himselfe confirm'd in his Dukedome, when hee as little fear'd ruine, and he deserv'd preservation; the French King dyes suddenly, to whom <hi>Lewis,</hi> the true Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> succeeded: with him <hi>Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaes</hi> late friend, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> conclude a league. Thus <hi>Sforza</hi> being left alone, raiseth two armies under the conduct of the two <hi>Sanseverines,</hi> men, whom he had highly favour'd and advanced. But it is scarce seene, that a faithlesse Master should have a trusty servant, and he that hath no respect to his owne word, shall in the extremest of his necessities, finde all others promises but words. The elder revolts, and the younger, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least shew of resistance, flyes; and <hi>Sforza</hi> himselfe is so closely pursued, that he can scarce get away safe into <hi>Germany.</hi> The French abusing their late victory, the <hi>Millanesi</hi> with a generall consent, recall <hi>Sforza</hi>; who, like a melting snow, overflowes all before him, and recovers most of his Duchy, with the same easinesse that he had
<pb facs="tcp:3364:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lost it. The strength of his Army consisted especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of Swizzers, whom the late overthrow of the warlike Duke of of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and these Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian wars, had raised to the height of admiration. But to be valiant is not to have all vertues: these were as strong in trechery, as in battle, they lead <hi>Sforza</hi> in the habit of a Swizzer into the French campe, through which in the same habit they had promised to conduct him. Thus having beene twice betrayd, and now a prisoner, after a ten yeares harsh confining he dyes in <hi>France,</hi> having liv'd in his misery, longer then in his Duchy, and leaving instruction to succeeding Princes that height should not be their ayme, but integrity; and that they would not (that I may vse the words of our Poet) tempt their starres beyond their light.</p>

                  <p>WOrthy Sir; whilst others are ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of an honourable Dedication, I am thankfull for a friendly one, this in the meane time being mine happy advantage over them, that they expect, but I injoy a Patron. And yet I have not such a scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of great names, to whom I might pretend with as good a confidence as the greatest part of VVriters, but that some of the higher ranke (to whom for their frequent courtesie I confesse my selfe an unequall debtor) might have expected, others almost challenged my Dedication: to whom I know no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of more respect and satisfaction then this,
<pb facs="tcp:3364:58"/>
that I concluded the worke to bee below their notice, how much more their protection; and that I would have others to take notice more of my Friendship, then of my Ambition: But it may bee that some will conceive an Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Friendship, when I of such an infancy in study shall boast the favours of so growne a vertue, and intrude upon his fame. If this be an offence, I must professe I  glory in it, this accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I confesse and am proud of: such is the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of him that is enamoured on vertue, of the man who would bee indeared to heaven, whose desires would not be so good, were they not so high, and the Angells might have stood, had they never known another Pride. But not to insist on that (which neverthelesse I can never too much insist on, the remembrance of our friendship) to whom could I more fitly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a Poeme, then to him that hath shewed such excellency? or a Divine Poem, then to him that hath shewed such Religion in his compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures? Of this truth <hi>Persius</hi> is a witnesse, whom you have taught to speake English with such a grace, that wee can understand when wee heare him, and find no one syllable in his Dialect offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive either to the Elegant, or to the Chast Eare. Of this truth <hi>Iuvenall</hi> may bee a witnesse, whom though wee doe not yet heare in publike bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb facs="tcp:3364:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his expressions by your exact rendring him, yet they that have injoy'd the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your neerer friendship, confidently and upon the hazzard of their understanding affirme, that hee is farre unworthy of such an imprisonment, that hee should bee obscured by that hand which cleared him. But it is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity that is the subject of these verses, and it is Divinity which is the exercise, and glory of your studies, which makes you an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of the Pulpit, nay which makes every place where you will vouchsafe to discourse, to bee a Pulpit, for such is the bounty of your religious conversation, that howsoever the place may bee changed, the Sermon is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. Sermons that at the same time make us devout and witty, which by first winning the Preacher, have the easier Conquest of the Auditory: who are never with lesse difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty intreated to their happinesse, then when they see they doe not goe alone. So that now when I consider what I present, and to whom, I beginne to suspect the lightnesse of my worke, and thinke I have some reason to feare the censure of such a Friend, to whom if I shall bee excus'd, I expect some glory from others, not because the Levite, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>REader, I must first intreat thy Patience, afterward thy Ingenuity; thy Patience, that thou wilt read somewhat before my verses: thy Ingenuity, that thou wilt not censure them the worse, because thou shalt finde them censur'd to thy hand. The purpose of this Poem is Religious Delight, which if thou shalt finde in any place wanting, or disjoyned, understand, that it was either not my intent, or mine Error. And yet I dare affirme no man shall be the worse by it, and that if there be any want, it is more of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light then of the Religion: If I intended excuses, I could tell you, and that truely too; that these verses were not now first made, although they are now first published, and the Composure was a younger mans, though the Edition be a Divines. This I could say, if I thought Poetry incompatible with Divinity, if it were a serious truth, that God could bee onely magnified in Prose: But when I consider that <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> could be both a Poet, and a Saint, and that it was heresie that cast <hi>Tertullian</hi> out of the Church, and not his Verses, I dare acknowledge these for mine owne, and feare not to suffer in that cause, wherein those Worthies were so magnify'd: Especially, since these Essayes (which I feare their weaknesse will too strongly testifie) were not my study, but my Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when in the vacations having for a time inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted my more serious affaires, I chose Poetry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Idlenesse; yet I have not chose Poetry with the
<pb facs="tcp:3364:60"/>
hazard of my Conscience, &amp; so instead of a Divine have writ a superstitious worke; howsoever Malice or Ignorance may wrest a passage unto Popery, I meane that, where <hi>Abraham</hi> prayes for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Israelites: But besides that the Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is generall for the Church, which no judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine but will allow for Orthodox, it is made by him, whom a Popish Divine will deny at that time to bee able to intercede: there was no solliciting of him they saw not, and the holiest of the Patriarchs (as they will tell you) saw not God till after the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I have the more fully exprest my selfe in this, because I would not be esteem'd as one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is too great an harvest) who play the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons with Religion, that will halt betweene two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in spite of the Prophet, at the same time serve God and Baal, who like not Orthodoxe truth, unlesse delivered in hereticall tearmes, &amp; so by a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table new tricke of Iugling, call that Pacification, which is Conspiracy, of whose proficiency in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I can speake little; but this I may most confidently affirme, that (perhaps not after the Apostles mind, yet certainely in his words) they goe on from Faith, to Faith. Of this crime, and of the suspition of it, I trust I am sufficiently acquited: for other errors which Malice ond Curiosity will aboundantly mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, I onely referre my selfe to the truely Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who know that a good Poem is as a good Life, not wherein there are none, but wherin there are the fewest faults.</p>

                  <l>Were mercilesse, and rougher then the way:</l>
                  <l>Men that had onely studied to oppresse,</l>
                  <l>Whose mindes were shut against the harbourlesse:</l>

                  <l>As if they learn't acquaintance with the sky,</l>

                  <l>Might be found hope of rest for them that were</l>
                  <l>But two more then the Family; they tell</l>

                  <l>So might they live at home, and yet away,</l>
                  <l>O the great folly of Magnificence!</l>
                  <l>Houses are little Cities, and from thence</l>
                  <l>Cities are lesser worlds, that man may have</l>

                  <l>But none for any stranger: this truth seemes</l>
                  <l>Too certaine to our Levite, who esteemes</l>

                  <l>Murder in jest, but now they are so fierce</l>
                  <l>As if they would inforce their swords to pierce</l>

                  <l>Like those, which made a Chappell of the bush</l>
                  <l>Whence God did tutor <hi>Moses</hi>; would 'twere found</l>
                  <l>That this place too were such an holy ground:</l>

                  <l>I had a griefe beyond a Cowards feares,</l>

                  <l>I was all Fire, the greedy Element</l>

                  <l>And prove that man was not compos'd of Earth;</l>
                  <l>That he was made of Flames, that past all doubt</l>
                  <l>To dye was nothing, but to be put out.</l>

                  <p>REader, my Profession is not versifying, but this is part of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>s power, that he can transforme a Divine into a Poet, and indeed he that cannot make a verse upon this Argument, is an Argument for verses to be made upon. But thou shalt have nothing of a Poem here besides the Ryme, it being this Kings singularity, that he who writeth his History, shall be thought to write a Poem, and he that would write a Poem of him, cannot but write an History. It is impossible, that invention should exceed his actions, or that a Penne should dare more then <hi>Sweden.</hi> So that now an excuse is needlesse, a Divine may write an History. And why not such a Poem? I am sure a Prince in Israel is fallen, and therefore it can be no shame for David himselfe to follow the Beer. Which I trust thou dost in a true sorrow for him, and an harty prayer to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he would raise up another to perfect, who thus farre hath advanc't this royall instument in his cause.
