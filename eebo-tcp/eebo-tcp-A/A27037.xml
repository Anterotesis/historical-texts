            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sence of the
Subſcribed ARTICLES
OF
RELIGION.</head>
            <p>I Take not this Form of Words called, <hi>The
Articles of the Church of England,</hi> to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
to the ſaid Church; nor any thing
in them to be eſſential to the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which was not ſo from its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, yea
and in every following Age: nor do I take ſuch
Form or Matter to be inſtead of the Scripture and
the ancient Creeds, a neceſſary Rule of Divine
Faith, or neceſſary to the Being of Miniſtry, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip,
and Communion in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
But that they were, ſubordinate to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
and the ſaid Creeds, a laudable Profeſſion
of this Church at the Reformation, that they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expounded
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66284:2"/>
not the Divine Rule by any Hereſie,
thereby to promote our Communion with other
Reformed Churches, and to guide Novices at home
in the Expoſition of the ſaid Rule: Far be it from
us to be of a Religion and Church which is no
older than the ſaid Articles or Common Prayer.
But holding, with excellent <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that <hi>Contra
Rationem nemo ſobrius, &amp; contra Scripturam nemo
Chriſtianus,</hi> ſo alſo that, <hi>Contra Eccleſiam nemo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificus;</hi>
(the Church ſtill being ſuppoſed to be for
Reaſon and Scripture, ſober and Chriſtian) and
wiſhing that God's own Word were taken for the
ſufficient Terms of our Conſent and Concord in
order to Union and Communion, and knowing
that the Ambiguity of words, and our common im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in the Art of Speaking, do leave an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
in the ſence of moſt humane Writings
till explained, and yet ſuppoſing that the Authors
of theſe Articles meant them Orthodoxly, that I
may not ſeem needleſly ſcrupulous, I ſubſcribe
them, and that I may not be unconſcionably raſh
in ſubſcribing, I here tell all whom it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
how I underſtand the words which I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
            <p>Art. 2. <hi>A Sacrifice for all the ſin of man,
Original and Actual.</hi>] Tho' [<hi>Omnibus</hi>] be alſo
in the Latine, [<hi>All</hi>] is left out in K. <hi>James</hi> his
Edition. I ſuppoſe they meant not [<hi>for any mans
final predominant Impenitence, Infidelity, Atheiſm</hi> or
<hi>Vnholineſs;</hi>] but for all ſorts of ſin, on condition
of Faith and Repentance, actually pardoning them
to penitent Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66284:2"/>
Art. 3. <hi>He went down into Hell</hi>] That is,
into <hi>Hades,</hi> the ſtate of ſeparated Souls: Of which
ſee Archbiſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s Anſwer to the Jeſuits.</p>
            <p>Art. 4 <hi>Took again his Body with fleſh
and bones, and all things appertaining
to the perfection of mans Nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he aſcended into Heaven, and there
ſitteth,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>That is, He ſitteth in Heaven with the ſame
Body Glorified, which was fleſh and bones on
Earth, and catechreſtically is by ſome ſo called
now it is a celeſtial, incorruptible, ſpiritual, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Body; but indeed is not now the ſame
thing which we call formally <hi>Fleſh, Bones,</hi> or <hi>Blood,</hi>
nor will admit of the ſame Definition. For,
1. The Scripture ſaith plainly, That <hi>Fleſh and
Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.
50. There is a <hi>natural Body,</hi> and <hi>there is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Body,</hi> verſ. 43, 44. The Context ſheweth
that it is not moral ſinful corruption that is called
<hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> here, but that natural corruptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
which <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> hath. See <hi>Hammond</hi>
on the Text.</p>
            <p>Chriſt's Body will not be worſe than ours (but
ours made like to his, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.) But ours ſhall
not be fleſh, blood, and bones.</p>
            <p>2. When there is not the ſame Form or Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there is not to be the ſame proper formal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination:
But no ſober Philoſopher or Phyſician
ever gave ſuch a Definition of <hi>Fleſh, Blood,</hi> or <hi>Bones</hi>
as will truly agree with Chriſt's glorified Body:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66284:3"/>
The name therefore can be but equivocal.</p>
            <p>3. There is a Symmetry in God's Works, Chriſt
being in his Glorified Humanity advanced above
Angels in Power, is not below them in natural
Perfection: His ſpiritual celeſtial Body is congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to his Soul; and all the Angels obey and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him. When we are the Children of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
we ſhall be equal to the Angels, and
neither marry nor die: and ſo not have bodies of
mortal conſtitution. I dare not ſay that the Sun
or Light is a more Glorious body than Chriſt's;
nor encourage thoſe Diſputers that ask how many
foot long and broad his body is, or the place that
containeth it.</p>
            <p>4. I dare not incur the guilt of contradicting
two General Councils in a matter of Faith, when
they anathematize the Diſſenters, and agree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
tho' diſagreeing in other things, and pleading
the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Scripture.</p>

ſome dark inviſible things, maketh me more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined

God hath two ſorts of Civil Laws: Firſt, ſuch as
are univerſal or common to all Chriſtian Nations
at leaſt: As, That there ſhall be Rulers and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
That Rulers obey and promote the Laws of
God and the Kingdom of Chrſt, and do nothing
againſt them; That they ſeek the common Good,
and rule in Righteouſneſs, and be a Terrour to evil
Works, and encourage Piety and Vertue and Peace;
That they reſtrain Blaſphemy, Perjury, Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Murder, Adultery, Theft, falſe Witneſs, and
falſe Judging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Civil Laws bind all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as the Law of Nature; and all Chriſtian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as the Law of Chriſt: But not as the Laws of

for us as a Price, out Faith being only the requiſite
(yet given) moral qualification for the reception of
the free gift of Pardon, Juſtification and Adoption,

of Chriſt; yet are Chriſt's words true, That by
mens <hi>words they ſhall be juſtified or condemned:</hi> And
all men ſhall be judged according to their works:
And <hi>James</hi> truly ſaith, that <hi>by works a men is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
and not by faith only: Not by works of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66284:5"/>
or of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, nor any that as a price or
commutation do make the reward to be of Debt,
and not of Grace; but by a practical Faith or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity:
ſuch Acts as Faith it ſelf is, and prove
our Belief to be ſuch as Chriſt hath promiſed Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and Salvation to; ſuch as by juſtifying Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to be ſincere, do juſtifie the perſon againſt the
Charge of Infidelity, Hypocriſie, Impenitence and
Ungodlineſs, Chriſtianity is that Faith which <hi>Paul</hi>
oppoſeth to Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art.</hi> 12. Good works ſpring out neceſſarily
of a true and lively Faith, inſomuch that
by them a lively Faith may as evidently be
known as a tree diſcerned by the fruit.</p>
            <p>Expoſ. 1. It is a <hi>Hypothetical neceſſity,</hi> that is here
meant, conſiſtent with freedom. 2. And a <hi>Truth</hi>
of <hi>Evidence,</hi> and not an <hi>equal degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art.</hi> 13. Works done before the Grace of
Chriſt and the Inſpiration of the Spirit,
are not pleaſant to God; foraſmuch as they
ſpring not of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do they make man meet to receive
Grace, or as the Schools ſay, deſerve
Grace of Congruity, yea rather they have
the nature of ſin.</p>
            <p>Expoſ 1. No good is done before all common
Grace. 2. Preparatory Grace uſually goeth before
ſpecial Grace; and thoſe that reſiſt it, are farther
from the Kingdom of God, than they that have it.
And to <hi>him that hath</hi>(by improvement) <hi>ſhall be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66284:5"/>
given:</hi> And <hi>in every nation, he that feareth God, and
worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of him.</hi> Believing
that God is, and that he is the rewarder of them
that diligently ſeek him, is better than nothing, and
than meer ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art.</hi> 14. Voluntary Works, beſides, over
and above God's Commandments, which
they call Works of Supererogation, cannot
be taught without arrogancy and iniquity.</p>
            <p>Expoſ. I ſuppoſe they meant not that voluntary
Canons, Impoſitions, Oaths, and Church-Offices
are ſo bad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art.</hi> 16. Expoſ. I ſuppoſe this Article meaneth
only the <hi>unpardoned Sin</hi> againſt the H. Ghoſt, and
of a total departure from common Grace, and ſome
degree of Habit and Act from ſpecial Grace; but
determineth not the Controverſie, whether any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
and finally fall from ſuch an unconfirmed
Grace as elſe would ſave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art.</hi> 18 They are to be had Accurſed that
preſume to ſay, that every man ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Law or Sect which he profeſſeth,
ſo that he be diligent to frame his life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Law and the Light of
Nature. For holy Scripture doth ſet out
to us only the Name of Ieſus Chriſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
men muſt be ſaved.]</p>
            <p>Expoſ. Some Sects contradict the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
They worſhip Devils, and offer their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66284:6"/>
in Sacrifice to them, and murder the juſt:
This will ſave none. But if the meaning be to
curſe all that hope that ſome are ſaved, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of the Name of Chriſt, and that his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Grace go farther than the knowledge of
his Name, I will not curſe ſuch. All were not
accurſed that hoped well of <hi>Socrates, Antonine, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
Severus, Cicero, Epittetus, Plutarch</hi> &amp;c. There
is no Name that is, no other Meſſiah to be ſaved
by but Chriſt. But, 1. God judgeth men by no
other Law, but that which they were under: And
the Law of Grace made to fallen Mankind in <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Noah,</hi> was not repealed by the <hi>Jews</hi> peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
2. God had more People than the <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Proſelytes</hi> of old. 3. The old <hi>Jews</hi> knew leſs of
Chriſt than his Apoſtles before his Reſurrection.
4. The Apoſtles then believed not his dying for
our ſins, his Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. It's no Chriſtianity now that
believeth not theſe. If I durſt curſe all the World
who now believe no more than the old <hi>Jews</hi> and
the Apoſtles then did, yet durſt I not curſe all
Chriſtians that hope better of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art.</hi> 23. Thoſe we ought to judge law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called and ſent, which be choſen and
called to this work by men, who have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority given them in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
to call and ſend Miniſters into the
Lord's Vineyard.]</p>
            <p>Expoſ. <hi>Given them,</hi> that is, by Chriſt in his
Scripture-Inſtitution, and by thoſe that Chriſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſeth
under him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:66284:6"/>
               <hi>Art.</hi> 25. Sacraments be certain ſure Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and effectual Signs of Grace, and
God's good <hi>Will, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Expoſ. They <hi>ſignifie</hi> what God <hi>offereth:</hi> They
<hi>inveſt</hi> the <hi>true believing Receiver</hi> in the Right of
Pardon, Adoption, and Salvation. They are <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
operative Signs</hi> of exciting and increaſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
Grace in Believers.</p>
            <p>Art. 26. [Nor is the Effect of Chriſt's
Ordinances taken away by their (Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) wickedneſs]</p>
            <p>Expoſ. Sacraments are not void, becauſe a bad
man adminiſtred them; but Prayer, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Example are uſually more effectual from
able godly men, than from the ignorant and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The blind man could ſay, <hi>God heareth not
ſinners; but if any be a Worſhipper of God, and do
his Will, him he heareth.</hi> Pſal 50. To the wicked
ſaith God, <hi>What haſt thou to do to take my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
into thy mouth,</hi> &amp;c. It is a ſin to prefer a bad
man before a better. And it is dangerous to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
men in daily ſin, who uſurp the Sacred
Office of Biſhops or Paſtors, having neither the
Qualifications eſſentially neceſſary thereto, nor
that which is eſſentially neceſſary to a Call.</p>
            <p>The excepted Articles, and thoſe that need no
Expoſition, I paſs by. If I have hit on the true
meaning, I ſubſcribe my Aſſent: and I thank God
that this National Church hath Doctrine ſo ſound,
and pity them that <hi>write, preach,</hi> or <hi>practiſe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66284:7"/>
to the Articles which they ſubſcribe, and
accuſe them that refuſe ſubſcribing them; and
take them for Sinners, who take them not for
their Paſtors, becauſe that their Wickedneſs nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not their Sacramental Adminiſtrations.</p>
