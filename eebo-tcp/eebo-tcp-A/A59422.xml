            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>May it please your Grace,</opener>
            <p>NOthing could ever contribute more to my having a good opinion of my self, than the being favour'd by your Grace: The thought of which has so exalted me, that I can no longer conceal my Pride from the World; but must publish the Joy I receive in having so noble a Patron, and one so excelling in Wit and Judgment; Qualities which even your Enemies could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubt of, or detract from. And which make all good men and men of sence admire you, and none but Fools and ill men fear you for 'em.

            <p>I pretend not of an Epistle to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation upon these and your other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Qualities. For naming the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> is enough: who cannot have greater commendations from me than all who have the honour to know him already give him. Amongst which number I think it my greatest happiness to be one, and can never be prouder of any thing can arrive to me, than of the honour of having been admitted sometimes into your Graces Conversation, the most charming in the World.

            <lg>
               <l>SInce the bare gleanings of the stage are grown</l>
               <l>The only portion for brisk Wits o'th' Town,</l>
               <l>We mean such as have no crop of their own;</l>
               <l>Methinks you should encourage them that sow,</l>
               <l>Who are to watch and gather what does grow.</l>
               <l>Thus a poor Poet must maintain a Muse,</l>
               <l>As you do Mistresses for others use:</l>
               <l>The wittiest Play can serve him but one day,</l>
               <l>Though for three months it finds you what to say.</l>
               <l>Yet you your Creditors of wit will fail,</l>
               <l>And never pay, but borrow on and rail.</l>
               <l>Poor Echo's can repeat wit, though they've none,</l>
               <l>Like Bag-pipes they no sound have of their own,</l>
               <l>Till some into their emptiness be blown.</l>
               <l>Yet—</l>
               <l>To be thought Wits and Judges they're so glad,</l>
               <l>And labour for't, as if they were Wit-mad.</l>
               <l>Some will keep Tables for the Wits o'th'Nation,</l>
               <l>And Poets eat them into reputation.</l>
               <l>Some Scriblers will Wit their whole bus'ness make,</l>
               <l>For labour'd dullness grievous pains will take;</l>
               <l>And when with many Throes they've travail'd long,</l>
               <l>They now and then bring forth a Foolish Song.</l>
               <l>One Fop all modern Poets will condemn,</l>
               <l>And by this means a parlous Judg will seem.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:62074:4"/>Wit is a common Idol, and in vain</l>
               <l>Fops try a thousand wayes the name to gain.</l>
               <l>Pray judge the nauseous Farces of the Age,</l>
               <l>And meddle not with sence upon the Stage;</l>
               <l>To you our Poet no one line submits,</l>
               <l>Who such a Coil will keep to be thought Wits:</l>
               <l>'Tis you who truly are so, he would please;</l>
               <l>But knows it is not to be done with ease.</l>
               <l>In the Art of Judging you as wise are grown,</l>
               <l>As in their choice some Ladies of the Town.</l>
               <l>Your neat shap't <hi>Barbary</hi> Wits you will despise,</l>
               <l>And none but lusty <hi>Sinewy</hi> Writers prize.</l>
               <l>Old English <hi>Shakespear</hi> stomachs you have still,</l>
               <l>And judge as our Fore-fathers writ with skill.</l>
               <l>You Coin the Wit, the Witlings of the Town</l>
               <l>Retailers are, that spread it up and down;</l>
               <l>Set but your stamp upon't, though it be brass,</l>
               <l>With all the Wou'd-be-Wits, 'twill currant pass.</l>

                  <l>Poor <hi>Timon!</hi> I once knew thee the most flourishing man</l>
                  <l>Of all th' <hi>Athenians,</hi> and thou still hadst been so,</l>
                  <l>Had not these smiling, flattering Knaves devour'd thee,</l>
                  <l>And murder'd thee with base ingratitude.</l>
                  <l>His death pull'd on the poor <hi>Evandra</hi>'s too;</l>
                  <l>That Miracle of Constancy in Love.</l>
                  <l>Now all repair to their respective homes,</l>
                  <l>Their several Trades, their bus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ness and diversions;</l>
                  <l>And whilst I guard you from your active Foes,</l>
                  <l>And fight your Battels, be you secure at home.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>May <hi>Athens</hi> flourish with a lasting Peace;</l>
                  <l>And may its wealth and power ever increase.</l>

               <l>IF there were hopes that ancient solid Wit</l>

               <l>Though now no more substantial English Playes,</l>
               <l>Than good old Hospitality you praise;</l>

               <l>While the old English Chine us'd to remain,</l>
               <l>And many hungry onsets would sustain.</l>
               <l>At these thin Feasts each Morsel's swallow'd down,</l>
               <l>And ev'ry thing but the Guests stomach's gone.</l>
               <l>At these new fashion'd Feasts you' have but a Tast,</l>
               <l>With Meat or Wit you scarce can break a Fast.</l>
               <l>This <hi>Jantee</hi> slightness to the French we owe,</l>
               <l>And that makes all slight Wits admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <l>They're of one Level, and with little pains</l>
               <l>The Frothy Poet good reception gains;</l>
               <l>But to hear English Wit there's use of brains.</l>
               <l>Though Sparks to imitate the French think fit</l>
               <l>In want of Learning, Affectation, Wit,</l>
               <l>And which is most, in Cloaths, wee'l ne'r submit.</l>
               <l>Their Ships or Plays o're ours shall ne're advance,</l>
               <l>For our Third Rates shall match the First of <hi>France,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>With English Judges this may bear the Test,</l>
               <l>Who will for <hi>Shakespear's</hi> part forgive the rest.</l>
               <l>The Sparks judge but as they hear others say,</l>
               <l>They cannot think enough to mind the Play.</l>

               <l>Th' admire themselves too much to be in Love.</l>
               <l>Nor Wit, nor Beauty, their hard Hearts can strike,</l>
               <l>Who only their own sence or persons like.</l>
               <l>But to the men of Wit our Poet flies,</l>
               <l>To save him from Wits mortal Enemies.</l>
               <l>Since for his Friends he has the best of those,</l>
               <l>Guarded by them he fears not little Foes.</l>
               <l>And with each Mistress we must favour find,</l>
               <l>They for <hi>Evandra's</hi> sake will sure be kind;</l>
               <l>At least all those to constant Love inclin'd.</l>
