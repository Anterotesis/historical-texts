            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRIGUES OF THE POPISH PLOT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Intend not with a long preamble to trouble the Reader, or to wheedle ignorant unthinking Fops, or malicious ill natur'd Hypocrites into a good Opinion of me; the censure or approbation of both these, I neither dread nor value: it is before the Charitable, Vertuous, and Judicious person I will arraign my self; and waving all excuses, disclose what I know, and then clear my self so far as the subject will bear, and my ability will extend without Rhetorical flourishes; endeavouring to bring my Matter to Words, and not Words to my Matter.</p>
            <p>I lived (after I was burnt out of <hi>Merchant Taylors</hi> School) at <hi>Islington</hi> Twelve Years, where the Company of <hi>Brewers</hi> were my Patrons; who stukk shew'd such favour to me, as I never requested any kindness of them they ever denyed me; and even in my greatest extremity certified for me under their Hands (as shall appear afterwards;) neither even to this day, did they eject me: And the Neighbourhood, consisting most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Ale-men, Cow-men, or Hog-men, I believe never injur'd or defamed me, or will to this hour.</p>
            <p>Two or Three Years after I was at <hi>Islington</hi> came several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons thither and to <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> who set up Schools without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censes, and were backed by two Vicars, which was injurious to the Publick School, and directly against the Canon. I could get little or no remedy against them; the reason I shall rather think, than express. Two of these were Mr. <hi>Robert Ferguson</hi> (a Man since well known for his Treasons) and Mr. <hi>Thomas Singleton,</hi> who is there at this time. One of <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s Boarders dying, I think of the Small Pox, the Vicar buried, or permitted to be buried, without a Word of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> even in his Church. And to the latter of these Worthies, the other Vicar, sent his only Son to be instructed, as he himself had been at the feet of such another <hi>Gamaliel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:110302:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Notwithstanding I suffered much, Teaching the Poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for a very small Salary, and these two Dissenters canting the Rich to themselves, I bore all patiently: and persever'd to discharge my duty justly and honestly, and rubb'd on, doing all the good I could, but harm to no body; which has been, and is a great comfort to me; yet though I believe I can make Panegyricks upon others, I am unskill'd in making one upon my self: Therefore I desist.</p>
            <p>The first time I saw <hi>Titus Oates,</hi> after he went from <hi>Merchant-Taylor</hi>'s School, where he was my Scholar, in the year 1665, was about <hi>Bartholomew-</hi>tide 1676. He was brought to me by Mr. <hi>Matthew Medburne</hi> (who had pick'd him up in the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s Cellar at <hi>Whitehall</hi> that day they came to me) undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly under a fatal Position of the Heavens. <hi>Titus</hi> was in his Canonical Garments: I knew him not, till he told me who he was. To the <hi>Sun-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Aldersgate-street</hi> they had me. Truly <hi>I</hi> was very melancholy, though <hi>I</hi> knew no cause for it. May be it pleased the Almighty Providence, in that little prelude to give me some forebodings of the miseries that were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from this unfortunate renewing of our old acquaintance.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Matthew Medburne</hi> introduced <hi>Oates</hi> into a Club that met at the <hi>Pheasant</hi> in <hi>Fuller</hi>'s <hi>Rents,</hi> at that time kept by one Mr. <hi>Mekins,</hi> consisting of several persons, some <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and some <hi>Protestants;</hi> where <hi>I</hi> never heard any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes about Religion or State Affairs, it being a particular Article of our Club, that all such Discourses should be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon the penalty of Six pence forfeit for every default of that nature by any Member of the Society.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> had almost forgotten to tell the Reader, That before <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> found him at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and brought him into our Society, he had been silenced by the Arch-Deacon of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whom afterwards he indeavoured to have brought into his Plot, as he will justifie for me, having very hardly escaped his snares, all honest and good. Men being ever the greatest mark of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. Upon this silencing having lost his Vicaridge of <hi>Bobbing</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> (where, amongst many other notorious exclamations against him, he was remarkable for petty Thefts, his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Pigs and Hens never escaping his Rapacious Clutches) and also his Faculty from the late Earl Marshal, then Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> being taken from him, he began to rail against the Church of <hi>England;</hi> intending thereby to wind himself into the good opinion of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> which indeed made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110302:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his conversation the more acceptable to <hi>Matthew Medburne,</hi> as being a zealous Romanist.</p>
            <p>By this means he ingratiated himself to <hi>Medburne,</hi> professing himself a convert to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by him was, as aforesaid, introduced into our Club, his Principles and himself being wholly strangers to the rest of the company. And truly, for my part, I had that very indifferent Opinion of him, That I sometimes advised <hi>Medburne</hi> not to repose any confidence in him, remembring his perverse and wicked pranks, when he was a School Boy; which, indeed, was all I knew of him then: for his Suspension and Misdemeanors in <hi>Sussex</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> were then unknown to us both.</p>
            <p>All this while he continued in the habit of a Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Man; and coming one day to see me at <hi>Islington,</hi> after we had dined, we intended to go into <hi>London</hi> to meet <hi>Medburne:</hi> But in our way, passing by <hi>Sadler</hi>'s Musick-House we met Dr. <hi>Slater,</hi> the Vicar of <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> who complemented his seeming Brother Clergy-man very gravely, and desired him to accept of a Glass of Ale with him, upon which, growing more familiar, he desired him to give him a Sermon next <hi>Sunday,</hi> which <hi>Oates</hi> after much entreaty promised. But I took the Dr. aside, and besought him not to accept of it, for some private Reasons I knew, which I did not particularize to him. But he thinking it might be only an Excuse, resolved to accept <hi>Oates</hi>'s proffer, and accordingly <hi>Oates</hi> preach'd; and in his Sermon speaking all along very bitterly against <hi>Calvin,</hi> he call'd him always <hi>Jack.</hi> This Sermon gave very heinous offence to Two great admirers of <hi>Calvin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Barker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Walsh,</hi> then in Commission of the Peace. Who therefore sending for the Dr. gave him a very severe Reprimand, for suffering such a Fellow to appear in his Pulpit. The Dr. to excuse himself, acquainted their Worships, 'Twas I that introduced him; which story, though false, proved very prejudicial to me, these persons being my utter Enemies ever after. This Sermon, by the by, after <hi>Oates</hi>'s Exaltation, and Renown of being a Discoverer, for the credit of the Author, was sold by him to Mr. <hi>Sawbridge</hi> for 40 or 50 Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas; but answered not expectation, for no other fault but the Satyr against their darling <hi>Calvin</hi> in it; which indeed was no small crime in that season; and for which, had not his other Vertues atoned, might have proved very injurious, not only to his Narrative, but, also, his Reputation too, amongst his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Friends and supporters, the Phanaticks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:110302:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Soon after this, <hi>Oates</hi> cast off his Habit, and put himself into a Campagne Coat and a Sword; and being entertain'd by the Jesuites, he was by them sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> where they were soon weary of him, and remitted him to <hi>England;</hi> where applying himself again to the Jesuites, especially to Father <hi>Whitebread</hi> (whom afterwads he so fairly requited) by his Interest he was sent over to St. <hi>Omers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence returning in the year 78, he sculckt about the Town in a Secular Habit, and came to visit me as formerly; being very intimate also, as before, with <hi>Medburne,</hi> who was instrumental in obtaining him some assistance for his relief from persons of Quality of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion. This Familiarity continuing between us, one thing was remarkable, That about that time that we had an account of the Battel of <hi>Mons,</hi> he met <hi>Medburne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Hughes</hi> (who is now living, and a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ready to attest it) and complaining of his extreme necessity, he told them, He had not eaten a bit of Bread in Three Days; upon which, they carryed him into the <hi>Cock</hi> in the <hi>Hay-market,</hi> and made him Eat and Drink, giving him also some Money, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this was the very time, when in his Discovery after he was in the height of his pretended Plot, and daily interested and engaged with so many persons of such great Quality to carry on the Cause of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the middle of <hi>July</hi> till the latter end of <hi>August</hi> I saw him not, and the first week of <hi>September Medburne</hi> and <hi>John Philips</hi> brought him to me at <hi>Islington:</hi> we went to the <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine-Wheel,</hi> where we drank a Bottle or two of Claret, and my Boy brought me some new Acts of Parliament, then newly publish'd. Upon reading of them there happned a very great Debate between <hi>Medburne</hi> and <hi>Titus Oates,</hi> concerning the Three Estates; <hi>Titus</hi> affirming, the King to be one of the Three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and answerable to the other Two which he called the Lords and Commons. <hi>Medburne</hi> contradicted him, and told him he lied; insomuch that they grew to very hard words; <hi>Philips</hi> justifying <hi>Oates,</hi> and I <hi>Medburne:</hi> I showing my reason in the preamble of one of the Acts, wherein 'twas exprest; <hi>Be it Enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majesty, with the Consent and Advise of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons Assembled in Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. urging, That if the King had been One of the Three Estates it would have run thus, Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King, Lords and Commons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here tis observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110302:4"/>
The very time when <hi>Oates</hi> was just upon Discovering a Plot in Zeal for the Preservation of His Majesties Life, he was nevertheless talking Treason against his Prerogative.</p>
            <p>In some few days after this, he came to me again in the Evening, and desired me, with all intreaties imaginable, to write him a Paper of Verses, in <hi>Latin,</hi> upon our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which he intended, as he said, to carry to the Jesuites as his own, to demonstrate his Learning, and try if thereby they would re-entertain him, or get him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some Catholick Family, where he might teach some Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he being then totally destitute of any livelihood. The Verses I made for him, and he fetch'd them the next morning, forcing upon me, as a gift, a pair of Tweezers, which he said he brought out of <hi>Flanders.</hi> He particularly desired me, in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-named Verses, to make a long harangue in the praise of the Virgin <hi>Many,</hi> pretending it would very much please the Jesuites. But truly I thought not fit to do so, and omitted it.</p>
            <p>The next, and last time he came to me was on a <hi>Saturday,</hi> some few days after in <hi>September:</hi> on a <hi>Saturday</hi> which happen'd to be the day before the great noise of the Popish Plot broke out; and <hi>I</hi> invited him to the <hi>Katherine-Wheel,</hi> where he pull'd out a handful of money, which seem'd to be about 30 or 40 shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, offering me the acceptance of it, in return of the many Reckonings <hi>I</hi> had paid for him, and the Treats <hi>I</hi> had made him; but <hi>I</hi> refused it. Then he ask'd me if <hi>I</hi> had heard any thing of a Plot: <hi>I</hi> told him, No: upon which, he said, There had been great complaints at <hi>Whitehall</hi> about a I lot of the Jesuites, against the King. He promised to come and Dine with me next day, but <hi>I</hi> saw him no more till the First day of <hi>November,</hi> when he appear'd at the Lords Bar, and swore falsely against me. The reason why <hi>I</hi> mention these two pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages is this: He told me, after <hi>I</hi> was got into his favour, That he came both those times to me to trapan me. This <hi>I</hi> avoided by the great mercy of God, not my own Prudence, <hi>I</hi> being always too credulous and easie to be imposed upon; never lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Snares for any Man, and thinking no body would lay any for me. If <hi>I</hi> had writ what he desired me of the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, he had made me under my own hand a Papist. If <hi>I</hi> had taken his money he had swore me into his Plot: yet <hi>I</hi> was brought into the Bryars for all this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oates</hi> in the interim had given into the Council, Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Plot, wherein he gave in my Name for meeting at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110302:5"/>
a Club in <hi>Fuller's Rents.</hi> Hereupon the Lord Bishop of <hi>London</hi> sent for me to the Vestry in <hi>Islington</hi> Church. His Lordship ask'd me, How I happn'd to be concern'd in such a Club. I replied, I never had any ill intent in going thither, neither ever saw, or heard any bad Action or Discourse in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; one reason that caused me to be there now and then, was this; The person that kept the House was a Gentleman fallen to decay; having many Children: This being his last shift, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it to be a sort of Charity, when I could spare a six pence to spend it with him, rather than another; especially having the Society of ingenuous Men. His Children likewise I taught, and was not paid, nor ever expected I should: Nor am I to this day. His Lordship seemed to be satisfied. It was then urged against me, by a Doctor there present, That <hi>I</hi> kept company with one <hi>Medburne</hi> a Player, who was a rank Papist; intimating thence, that <hi>I</hi> must be so too; and blundering out the old bald Verse, <hi>Noscitur a Socio qui non dignoscitur a se:</hi> I replied, <hi>I</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned it no crime to keep company with a Man, to whom <hi>I</hi> had seen the greatest Men in the Kingdom speak kindly; and amongst others his Lordships Brother, the Earl of <hi>Northampton;</hi> but if that matter gave offence, <hi>I</hi> would forbear his company. His Lordship ask'd me, If <hi>I</hi> Catechized the Children: <hi>I</hi> assured his Lordship, That <hi>I</hi> had not one in the School but had his Catechism as perfect as <hi>A, b, c;</hi> yet those two Doctors, my Neighbours, had never Catechized since I came thither, which was then Twelve Years. His Lordship was displeased at it; however all things were patch'd up for that time.</p>
            <p>About that time Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> was found dead in a Ditch, near <hi>Primrose Hill,</hi> and the main cry was, That the Papists had murder'd him. This business happen'd well for <hi>Oates,</hi> as he afterwards often told me: He would usually say, <hi>I belive not a Word on't; but my Plot had come to nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; It made well for me; I believe the Council would never have taken any farther notice of me else, if he had not been found: He was a Cowardly Rascal, for when I went with my Depositions to him, he was so frighted, that I believe he beshit himself; for there was such a stink I could hardly stay in the Room.</hi> This Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he would frequently give of that their pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomartyr to Popery; and the very person, whose misfortune, even by his own confession, was the very support of his Pocket.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:110302:5"/>
Notwithstanding this made well for <hi>Otes,</hi> and his future Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue, <hi>Bedloe,</hi> it turn'd to a scurvy account for many honest Men, and put the unthinking Rabble into such a rage, that most of Mankind, except <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> were accounted <hi>Papists;</hi> of which number, I was soon adopted a Member. And a certain Worthy and Learned Vicar sent up and down his Parish for Witnesses, to make out I was such, or something worse: At length, he found Two Men, as honest as himself, to swear a blind sort of Treason against me; The One formerly a Gold-finder, and one of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Jannizaries; the Other a Miscreant, that has scarce been in a Church since he was Christen'd. These Hell-hounds, accompanied with the Noble Vicar, took their way into <hi>Alders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate-</hi>Street, and proffer'd to swear against me before the Lord Bishop of <hi>London;</hi> who generously did refuse to meddle in the Affair. Thus repulsed, they applied themselves, in all Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to <hi>Otes,</hi> the <hi>Saviour of the Nation,</hi> (whom the Vicar had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to mention kindly in a long, swinging thing, he calls a <hi>Prayer)</hi> and, after Three low Reverences, unfolded their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to him in words to this Effect: <q>That <hi>William Smith,</hi> the School-Master of <hi>Islington,</hi> had spoken Treason against his Majesty; that they were ready to aver it: But, he being a Person of greater Authority, it would be much better for him to swear, than for them.</q> (This I had from <hi>Otes</hi>'s own Mouth.) <hi>Otes</hi> readily accepted the Offer; though he knew no more than the Man in the <hi>Moon,</hi> any thing of the matter, but what they told him. Now,—<hi>Actum est de vitâ &amp; sanguine Turni. Otes</hi> with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence procures a Warrant from some Peers, (whose Names I forbear) to Apprehend me, and bring me before the <hi>House of Lords.</hi> This Warrant and Work was recommended to one <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racoal,</hi> a flagitious and profligate Rascal: He, with about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Villains of his own Gang, (who, I believe, would have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd me, had it not been for thirty Souldiers, which, with an Officer of the Guards, attended them) came about One of the Clock in the Night, and, without knocking, broke open my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Door, the other being open to them. They rifled my House, frighted a Child of about Five Years I had, that he dyed soon after. I was carried by these Persons into <hi>Black-Spread-Eagle-Court</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> over against <hi>Somerset-</hi>House, to one Mr. <hi>Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s. This House the Varlet <hi>Sarracoal</hi> had seized upon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a kind of Goal. There was I confin'd in a little Room, in which, I believe, Forty or Fifty smoaked; and though I smoak't my self, I was almost smother'd. Before Morning, <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racoal</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:110302:6"/>
brought in several Persons more: And in the Morning, this impudent Fellow march't us one by one, between two Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetteers, to <hi>Westminster;</hi> and into the Painted-Chamber he brought us; where we were placed upon the Forms, and made a publick Spectacle.</p>
            <p>Now a Porter with a Note in his Hand, would have been enough to have commanded me before the <hi>House of Lords:</hi> But the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Edom,</hi> who managed such like Designs in those Days of Wickedness, knew very well, that their Conspiracy would soon fall to the Ground, unless kept up by needless Noise, Clamours, Tumults, Fears, Jealousies, Shamms, and abominable Lies.</p>
            <p>After about an Hour's space, we were all brought into the <hi>House of Lords</hi> by Sir <hi>George Charnock,</hi> then the Serjeant at Arms attending the <hi>House.</hi> After we had kneeled sometime, the Lord Chancellor bade us rise: And in comes <hi>Otes</hi> very gravely, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Canonical Vestments. He having sworn very profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against two or three, my Turn came. The Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor ask't him, What he had to say against me? <hi>Otes</hi> pretended much Modesty, replying, <hi>He was ashamed to declare the Words I had spoken of the King.</hi> After a seeming reluctancy, he swore, <hi>That I, in Company, refusing to drink the King's Health, wished the King's B—in a cleft Stick.</hi> His Majesty was then present sitting amongst the <hi>Barons,</hi> near the <hi>Barr:</hi> And being pleased to smile at this ridiculous Story, I could hear him say, <hi>I believe, he would drink my Health.</hi> I humbly requested the Chancellor, that I might speak. His Lordship told me, I might speak what I would. I then besought his Lordship, to ask <hi>Otes,</hi> Where and when I spake these Words, and if he heard me? My Lord reminding him, that he was upon his Oath, exactly put these Three Questions to him. To the <hi>First, Otes</hi> answer'd, He knew not where the Words were spoken: To the <hi>Second,</hi> He believed, it was some Years ago. To the <hi>Third,</hi> That he did not hear me speak them, but he could produce those that did hear me. After Leave to speak, I said thus to the <hi>Lords: My Lords, I am very certain, I never spake any such Words in all my Life; for never any such wicked Thought enter'd into my Heart: And if I mistrusted, that my Tongue did, or ever would utter such vile Words concerning my King, I would my self here cut it out, and cast it down at your Lordship's Barr: And as to the King's Health, I am sure, I never deny'd it.</hi> I then made my humble Request to my Lord Chancellor, to ask <hi>Otes,</hi> If I was in the <hi>Plot,</hi> or a <hi>Papist? Otes</hi> answer'd to both in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:110302:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Then he proceeded to swear against one Mr. <hi>Preston;</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he was a <hi>Romish Priest,</hi> and his Confessor. This Mr. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> was known to be so deaf, that he could scarce hear, when he was whoop't and hollow'd to; so that <hi>Otes</hi> and his Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor must have chose <hi>Salisbury-</hi>Plain for their Chappel, unless they had a mind all People should hear them: Yet Mr. <hi>Preston</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Oath lay in <hi>Newgate</hi> two or three Years. Well, we were order'd all to withdraw, and re-placed upon the Benches, in the Painted-Chamber, in worse condition than before; for now we had a Souldier planted betwixt each of us. In an hour's time, the <hi>Lords</hi> Adjourned till Four in the Afternoon; and Sir <hi>Edward Carteret,</hi> the Black Rod, came to us with a Paper in his Hand, importing our Doom: Some were order'd to the <hi>Gate-house;</hi> some to <hi>Newgate;</hi> some discharg'd: I was left among the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whom the Black Rod discharged; telling me, I was his Prisoner. He recommended me to one <hi>Button,</hi> a Messenger, and charged him to treat me civilly; which truly he did. This was on <hi>Fryday</hi> the First Day of <hi>November,</hi> 1678. And notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Latimer,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> (whom with Gratitude I here mention) proffer'd to be bound Body for Body in my behalf, I was kept in Custody; so strong was the Ferment of that Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. In the Afternoon, Dr. <hi>Dean,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> a Minister, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited me; and next Morning, Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi> and Major <hi>Fisher</hi> came to me: And these were all the Friends I saw in this unhappy Juncture.</p>
            <p>All things were in a most violent hurry; and I was in such a great Consternation, that I knew not which way to turn my self, or what to do. Between Seven and Eight at Night, out came my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> in a great Cloak, to warm himself at a Fire in the with-drawing Green-Lobby: By the Messenger's Perswasion, I followed him. I told his Lordship, <hi>I was clearly Innocent of what</hi> Otes <hi>had sworn against me in the Morning; and I hop'd, his Lordship, out of Pity and Commiseration, would stand my Friend.</hi> He told me, <hi>He would not speak for any one, nor be a Friend to any one, that spoke against the King.</hi> I replyed, <hi>His Lordship was too Wise, to believe all Reports to be true. No,</hi> (says he) <hi>I believe not all Reports to be true; and I think, what was spoke of thee in the Morning, was an idle Story: But I have this Afternoon an Account of thee from Dr.</hi> Tonge <hi>and Mr.</hi> Ferguson, <hi>Men that know thee, as well as thou knowest thy self, which will prove of dangerous Consequence to thee.</hi> I desired his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to let me know, what dangerous things they had inform'd against me? He told me, <hi>I had made a Practice of talking for,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110302:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and desending the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>in every Place where I came, which was Treason.</hi> I humbly did beseech him again, to stand my Friend. He reply'd; <hi>If thy Friends can get thee out of these Bryars, Wilt thou be an honest Man?</hi> I told him, <hi>Yes, I would to my Power.</hi> I then told him again, I could justify my self against that which <hi>Otes</hi> had sworn. <hi>But,</hi> (says he) <hi>if thou goest about to justify thy self, thou'lt be utterly lost; for thy Friends had very much ado to keep the House from sending for those Two Persons</hi> Otes <hi>mention'd: Petition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords, to be discharg'd.</hi> And so he left me, promising he would assist me the best he could; which I believe, he did. I shall make a short Observation upon this Dialogue.</p>
            <p>I had not, to my Knowledge, ever before that Day seen <hi>Tonge;</hi> and with <hi>Ferguson</hi> I had never been in Company, save once; and I'm sure, we talk't nothing of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> So that, I believe, these Men were then as busie to bring People into the <hi>Plot,</hi> as <hi>Otes;</hi> and doubtless, were as deeply concern'd. It may be consider'd likewise, that I then was intended for the future Work, because I was to be, in his Lordship's Sense, an <hi>Honest Man;</hi> A term of Art I have had cause to understand the meaning of very well, since. Thus, instead of getting out of the Bryars, I got much faster in.</p>
            <p>I had not stay'd so long, as the Reading this Digression, in the Lobby, but a Prelate repair'd thither to warm himself, as I imagine: I made my Address, as well as I could, to him for his Help and Assistance: It seems, Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> was this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late's great Confident; which, I presume, made me fare the worse. The Prelate told me plainly; <hi>That I, having kept company with so many Papists, and perhaps one my self, must needs either be in the Plot, or know something of it; and that it would be best for me to deal freely with the Lords, they having been so kind to me, as not to commit me to Prison; I might imagine, they meant not to ruin me, but only to make me an Honest Man.</hi> I protested, by all that is Sacred, I knew nothing of any Plot. Here I cannot but remark, that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late was much severer than the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> for now I was a <hi>Papist,</hi> and a <hi>Plotter;</hi> notwithstanding the very Oracle, <hi>Titus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, had upon Oath clear'd me from being either of them, and that but just before, in his <hi>Lordship</hi>'s Hearing.</p>
            <p>This Good Man had certainly read all the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor Prophets,</hi> together with the Book of <hi>Revelations,</hi> with incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judgment, and singular Advantage to himself, else he could never have known more of me, than I knew of my self; and that I must be undone, before I could be made an <hi>Honest Man.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:110302:7"/>
This was a sharp use of an Evening Consolation, and more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere than <hi>Otes</hi>'s Morning-Lecture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> came, and I Petition'd the <hi>House</hi> to be discharged; my Petition was read, an Order being made to this effect; <hi>That my License for teaching School was to be taken from me, and that I was to give an Account of what I could, that might deserve the Favor of the House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, my old Friend, the Vicar afore-mentioned, was not idle; he being all this while as strenuous and sedulous to take away my Livelihood, as others were to take away my Life: He, I say, together with a broken Brewer, introduced one <hi>Clatterbuck</hi> (a Parson's Son) into my House and Imployment, without any Order from the Company of <hi>Brewers,</hi> who are the Patrons; they being of a different Opinion, as this following Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, given at that time, will evince:

            <p>Now the Vicar had atchieved his Design; namely, he had got me fast enough, and almost in as ready a Road to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, as Mr. <hi>Staley:</hi> He had put the afore-said <hi>Clutterbuck</hi> into my Place; yet he ceased not to persecute me still: Trudging to <hi>Brewer's-Hall</hi> to say Grace, and replenish his Gutt, he there
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110302:8"/>
most falsly bespatter'd me in a Fustian-Harangue after Dinner; having not leisure, I suppose, till he had filled his Belly, to rail against, and abuse the Innocent. Yet observe what came of all this: <hi>Clutterbuck</hi> has since spent his Patrimony, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, and ruin'd, by his illiterature and negligence, the <hi>School,</hi> with his own Reputation; and even flown in the Face of his Promoter and Patron, the Vicar.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Afternoon, I was Examin'd by a certain P—. He perswaded me, That I was one of the <hi>Black-Bill-Men,</hi> or one of the <hi>Dagger-Men</hi> of <hi>Drury-Lane.</hi> This struck me into a profound Amazement, I not having heard of any such kind of Creature, till that very minute. But how unknown soever those dreadful Names might be to my self, certainly the Apparition must be not a little terrible, which even Gravity, Learning, and Wisdom was so apprehensive of. However, all I could offer to clear my self from being either of the fore-mention'd dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Things, or any other sort of guilty Person, it all avail'd the little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For now I was not only a <hi>Papist,</hi> but a <hi>Plotter,</hi> and a small <hi>Officer</hi> into the Bargain. Really, I then believed my self gone. In the <hi>Interim,</hi> such speedy Care was taken to send the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Order to <hi>Doctor's-Commons,</hi> as that Night, by the Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Vigilance of Sir <hi>Thomas Exton,</hi> and his careful Register, <hi>Newcourt,</hi> I received a Command, To deliver my License (which I had bought and paid for) to the Messenger, and not to teach School in the Diocess, or any where else.</p>
            <p>My License thus taken from me, it was impossible that I, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Circumstances, should ever be so connived it, as to teach without One; as some others did then, and do so to this Day: Therefore I was, if not in Duty, yet in fear of the Statute, obliged to desist, otherwise I might have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my School, for the Governours thereof never discharged me.</p>
            <p>Here 'tis observable, that my whole Livelihood, and all I had in the World being thus taken from me, and that upon no other ground, than either the fore-mentioned unintelligible Treason, swore to by <hi>Otes,</hi> without either the <hi>How, When,</hi> and <hi>Where</hi> to it, or else, for my being suspected one of the above-named <hi>Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> or <hi>Black-Bill-Men:</hi> either of these <hi>Chymaera's</hi> having Influence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110302:8"/>
enough to undo me. Here was Ruin and Poverty (laid-on) my back, but Two necessary Preparatives, to make me embrace that <hi>Honesty,</hi> that was so requisite to give my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> Satisfaction. A Blow of this kind being but too apt to make Men malleable to Purposes and Impressions, not so easily taken and received in Prosperity.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday-</hi>Night following, the <hi>Lords</hi> discharged me; and in their very Order, as will appear by the <hi>Journal of the House of Lords,</hi> they express'd me a <hi>Protestant,</hi> Yet see, the Caprice of Fortune, and what Fatality attends the Unhappiness of some Men. By this most Just and Generous Acquitment of their <hi>Lordship's,</hi> from the Imputation of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the Dangers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging, I was re-instated into my former Innocence. Nevertheless, though by this Re-instatement, all my Daggering, Black-Billing, Treasoning, and Plotting, wholly disappeared, yet the Guilt vanish't, but the Punishment remain'd: For my License, and my School, were never restor'd me again, though the Phantom that took them from me, was dissolved into Air.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, <hi>Otes</hi> spoke to Major <hi>Fisher,</hi> to find me out and bring me to him, which the Major promised him to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for indeed, the Major then lodg'd in the same House with me, though he did not tell <hi>Otes</hi> so, as suspecting it might be to my prejudice, because <hi>Otes</hi> threatned, it should be the worse for me, if I came not. Considering this Menace, I attended my Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and pray'd his Advice; who counsell'd me to go to <hi>Otes,</hi> but to be cautious of what I said, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, to have a Friend with me, to be Witness (if occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd) of what past between us; and also, to attend his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> again, to give him an account of the Particulars: All which I perform'd; Mr. <hi>Thomas Hughes</hi> (before mentioned in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) being the Friend I made choice of to go along with me.</p>
            <p>We came to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and were permitted to speak with <hi>Otes,</hi> whom we found in his Chamber, and Mr. <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor of the <hi>Temple,</hi> with him. After we had talk't of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Things, <hi>Otes</hi> ask't me, What I knew of <hi>Matthew Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne?</hi> (who was then in Prison, and whom he had preferr'd to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110302:9"/>
be a Captain.) To which I answer'd, <hi>I knew no ill of him.</hi> Then he question'd me, If I had never heard him cry up the <hi>French King</hi> and disparage and speak ill of the King of <hi>England?</hi> I reply'd; <hi>That truly I heard him often applaud and extol the French King; but I never heard him speak an ill Word against our King; but on the contrary, defend him to his Power against others, that spoke reflectingly of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Counsellor <hi>Smith</hi> began to speak; and, in a long Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, told me to this effect: <hi>That he believed, I was an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Man, and that I would do what Service I could to my King and Country, as became a Good Man, and Loyal Subject: And therefore, since it had pleas'd</hi> God <hi>to make Discovery of this Hellish Design and Conspiracy, if I had heard or known any thing done or said tending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I ought to disclose it. And therefore, he prest me very earnestly, to be frank with the Doctor, in my Knowledge and Conversation with</hi> Medburnet <hi>and in the Questions made me by the Doctor, concerning him.</hi> But to all this I still positively Answer'd him, <hi>That I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew any thing at all of a Plot, or any thing against</hi> Medburn. Then <hi>Otes</hi> desir'd me to step in with him into his Closet; where he privately told me, <hi>That if I would appear against</hi> Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, <hi>he could procure an Order from the King to the Brewers, to re-instate me in my School;</hi> which he promis'd to perform, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Condition afore-said. The Answer I made him, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse my self, was, <hi>That the School would be little worth to me now, under my present Aspersions and Circumstances.</hi> Upon this, he offer'd me his Power and Interest, in promising me any thing else I could find convenient; with reiterated Protestations of serving me, and Intreaties to accuse <hi>Medburne.</hi> All this I refused, with a Compliment, <hi>That I would consider of it:</hi> Upon which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into the Chamber, to our Company again: And soon after, parted friendly.</p>
            <p>This Interview was about <hi>Christmas,</hi> in the Year 1678. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which time I saw <hi>Otes</hi> no more, till <hi>June</hi> 1679. though he desired Major <hi>Fisher,</hi> who sometimes visited him, to tell me, He would have me call upon him: And the Reason why I was but a little while troubled with that Importunity from him, was, That Mr. <hi>Medburne</hi> soon after died in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:110302:9"/>
However I cannot omit one divertive story that interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: <hi>Oates</hi> being exalted with his high Dignities and Great Name of, <hi>The Saviour of the Nation,</hi> wanted to know his Coat of Arms; and Major <hi>Fisher</hi> sometimes waiting on him, and being also skill'd in Herauldry, the Doctor communicated himself to the Major for his assistance herein. The Major, to favour so comical a Request of the Doctor, consulted with Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blackamore,</hi> two Herauld-Painters, who readily embraced the search into Records for the Honourable Original of so Illustrious a Personage as <hi>Titus the Famous;</hi> but after diligent and tedious Inquiry, it so fell out that <hi>Titus Oates</hi> was either the First Hero of his Family, or the Heraulds had been unkind in not transmitting his Name and Arms to posterity, for neither could be found. Our Discoverer, it seems, being like the Champion mentioned by <hi>Silius Ita icus,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Ast illi sine Luce Genus, surdumque Parentum</l>
                  <l>Nomen—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>These men being unwilling nevertheless to defeat the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Honourable expectations, or that the Major should lose his Reward expected for this eminent piece of service to him, found out a Coat which they believed no body now could claim, <hi>viz a Chevron between three Crosses Croslet Fitchee.</hi> Being the Atchievement of Sir <hi>Otes Swinford,</hi> Husband to the Lady <hi>Katherine Swinford,</hi> afterwards married to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> This the Doctor believed, and joyfully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and most Triumphantly Engraved it on all his Plate, and in a large Seal Ring, requiting the Major with 20 <hi>s.</hi> but into the Bargain obliged him to bring him his Pedegree, all which he would pay for; but that being as hard to be produced as one of his own Commissions, the Major's non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance quite lost the Doctor's favour.</p>
            <p>But to return to our purpose. In <hi>May</hi> 1679. the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then sitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> I met one Mr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> since Prebendary of <hi>Windsor;</hi> we went into a House to drink toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; after some common discourse, he began to tell me a long story, how the <hi>Saturday</hi> last he had met the Bishop of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>'s Chaplain, who enquired of him concerning me: I asking him for what, and also telling him I knew not the man; He
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110302:10"/>
made answer, That the Parliament being going to try the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> I was wanted to prove <hi>Oates</hi>'s being in Town, for which end he told me the Chaplain had sent for him to enquire me out. I was very much surprized at this, and reminding him of the great Troubles I had lately been in, which he very well knew, I desired to be excused from any such thing, as being mighty unwilling to be brought upon the Stage again. I confest indeed I very well remembred he had been with me several Times that last Summer, as indeed he had; but however I besought him not to desire any such thing of me, expressing my great aversion thereunto; but he urged the great service I should do to the publick, and told me, I should be highly gratified by the Parliament: Nevertheless I persisted in my Denyal, continuing to express several reasons for my dislike in doing any such thing; till at last he plainly told me he had order to bring me, and that if I would not go, he would send for a Constable, and I should not stir from thence till he had sent the Parliament word of me; in which finding him in earnest, rather than be so compell'd, I thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to go quietly along with him; and to <hi>Westminster</hi> we went, and coming to the House of Lords, we sent in to the Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> but he being that day ill of the Gout, and not there, we sent in to the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> who was pleased to come forth to us: we signified to his Lordship the intention of our coming, who was pleased to say, I did ill I had not told him of this thing before; to which I replied, I did not know there was any occasion for my testifying any such thing: My Lord was pleased to say, I had done well if I had come sooner, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing testimony wanting in that point; but now the Papers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Popish Plot being this morning carried down to the House of Commons, the Lords would say nothing to me; we then desired his Lordship to instruct us what we should do, who order'd us to go to the House of Commons, and send in a Note to Sir <hi>Thomas Meers,</hi> letting him know we came from his Lordship. But before we went, his Lordship gave me caution that I did nothing but what was just and honest, and that I should no ways wrong my Conscience. Accordingly we went, and coming into the Lobby, where the Crowd was great, after the Note was sent in, I lost Mr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> whom I then saw no more, but Sir <hi>Thomas Meers</hi> came out to me: I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110302:10"/>
him with the business, he required me to stay in that place till he went back into the House, which he thought would soon adjourn, and return'd to me. I staid a little while, and the House adjourning, he came to me again, and told me I must go to the Secret Committee in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> at Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi>'s House, about six a Clock at night, and in his Name enquire for Sir <hi>Thomas Lee:</hi> But, says he, I shall see him before then, and prepare him to send for you in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, when you come thither.</p>
            <p>At six I went, where I found the Committee sitting, where meeting Mr. <hi>Banister</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> who was order'd to be their Door-keeper; as a confiding man, and signifying my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of speaking with Sir <hi>Thomas Lee,</hi> he went in, and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> immediately came out, and told me I should be presently call'd in, which was done, and the door very carefully shut after me with two Locks, as I remember: Sir <hi>Thomas Lee</hi> sat at the upper end of the Table, I suppose as Chairman, who made an Harangue, much such another as Councellor <hi>Smith</hi> had done before, expressing the great Deliverance this Kingdom had received from the late Discovery, and how it was every mans duty to do all that lay in his power to be instrumental in serving the Nation and the Protestant Religion, &amp;c. He required me to inform him what time <hi>Oates</hi> was with me the Summer before; I answered, several times about <hi>Midsummer</hi> and after, to the best of my Remembrance. Another of the Committee ask'd me if I did not see him in <hi>April,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 5. I told him I could not remember certainly: But they all prest upon me that it must be in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May;</hi> promising me, that if I would tell the Truth, they would endeavour with the King and House of Lords, to have me restored to the place I lost, or a better; urging withal, That if I would not tell the Truth, things would be worse with me, and much more to that threatning purpose. I being apprehensive of danger, and having already suffer'd too much considering too I was not upon my Oath, I ventured to say that truly I thought it might be about <hi>May;</hi> which Sir <hi>Thomas Lee</hi> wrote down, and afterwards required me to subscribe to; which I not suspecting they would ever demand of me, was surprized into, and durst not deny them. They enquired likewise where I lodged, and to find me again wrote down that too, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110302:11"/>
I durst not deny likewise; fearing to be laid by the heels upon refusal. Then they all said we are now ready, and will acquaint the House to morrow morning; and something else they said they would do with the House of Lords, which I cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly remember. VVhen they had put down the place I lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at, one of them stood up and said, <hi>We shall have all the Rogues out of every hole and corner by degrees;</hi> which not a little troubled me (though now too late) to think how they had drawn me in, and before I went out of the Room with what a course appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they treated the tool they had made. However at parting they returned me thanks, and promis'd me also the whole House of Commons would thank me too, and so with much Civility, and many good words, dismist me.</p>
            <p>But the Commons soon afterwards falling upon the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Parliament was Dissolved in some few days after. Upon which I heard no more of this business, and indeed expected to hear no more on't. But in <hi>June</hi> I coming late home one night, found a <hi>Subpana</hi> for me to appear at the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> by 8 a clock next morning; the <hi>Subpana</hi> imported a Cause depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and <hi>Thomas Whitebread,</hi> whom I do declare in the presence of God, I did not then know what or who he was, for tho all the Town at that time was full of no other discourse than of the <hi>Jesuites</hi> in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and other <hi>Popish</hi> Criminals; yet their Names I never troubled my self to enquire into, being then very melancholy under my long Adversity, and scarce daring to shew my head abroad. Now to shew the oddness of the circumstances that surprized me in this thing, I was found out at my Lodgings by the Paper Sir <hi>Thomas Lee</hi> had made me sign. Neither should they have done this, had I had the least suspicion that I should have been Subpoena'd in this cause; for when I appear'd before the Committee, their pretensions were wholly of using me in the Tryal of the Lords; which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Dissolution made me conclude was now over, and therefore not in the least imagining I should have been call'd upon in this Case at the <hi>Old-Baily, I</hi> had not provided me any other Lodgings, or sought any concealment or preventions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> accordingly in the morning <hi>I</hi> went, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the door, <hi>I</hi> spoke to an Officer, and show'd him my <hi>Subpana,</hi> not then knowing what <hi>I</hi> was summon'd thither for,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110302:11"/>
by reason I came home late the night before, and this was the first enquiry I made, for the Fellow that brought the <hi>Subpoena</hi> staying till 11 a clock at night for me at my Lodgings, and not finding me come in, left it with strict orders with my Landlord to deliver it me; and being asked what it concerned, he would give him no account of that, but in general terms told him it was business of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and so repeated his strict charge of not failing the Delivery of it, and sending me next morning accordingly; The Officer made me no other answer, than that I must go to the <hi>Fountain Tavern</hi> at <hi>Snow-hill;</hi> where coming, I found the two <hi>Oates's,</hi> Father and Son, (that being the first time that I had ever seen the Father) together with Councellour <hi>Smith,</hi> and many other persons, strangers to me. This likewise was the first time (as before-mentioned) that I had seen <hi>Oates</hi> from about <hi>Christmas</hi> before. After a Glass or two of VVine drank to me, and some other usual Civilities past, the two <hi>Oates</hi> and Councellor <hi>Smith</hi> retired, and in some minutes after sent a Messenger to tell me there was one would speak with me in another room; whereupon I went out, and found it was they: They had likewise a Bottle of VVine there, and after some further Civilities, Councellor <hi>Smith</hi> began to speak much to the purpose he had done at <hi>White-hall,</hi> which for brevity I pass by. But at length they came to insist upon my Testimony for <hi>Oates</hi> his being in Town in the month of <hi>May</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned, which I endeavouring to evade, they answered, I had confest it to the Committee, and subscribed my Hand to it, which they said they had ready to produce against me, if I retracted from it, and refused to do him Justice, and own the Truth (for Justice and Truth were then words of course with him) till, in fine, they plainly told me, This I must averr, or there was a Jayl ready hard by to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me; which truly would have been soon done, for the Court was then sitting, and undoubtedly that accursed and unlucky Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with the strength of <hi>Oates</hi> his credit and sway at that time of day, would have laid a bigger man than my self by the heels. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the impending Danger, and withal my own already too ruinous condition, I being then under that extreme poverty that I had long lain in a Lodging of but 13 <hi>d.</hi> a week, and was reduced to the most pressing want; and more than all this, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been lately informed of the dismal effects of <hi>Newgate,</hi> of those great numbers of <hi>Preists</hi> and other Prisoners on the Popish Account, that daily died through the unhealthiness of the place, occasioned by the infinite swarms there: My own Poverty, and the imminent Danger of my Life, not only this way, but also by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110302:12"/>
some of the old Stories formerly charg'd upon me at the House of Lords, which might still have been revived, with other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that the malice of <hi>Oates</hi> and his great Abettors, upon that refusal, through the prevailing VVickedness of those times might have raised against me. All this, I say, together with my own want of Money, Advice, or Friends at that time, and indeed not leisure enough throughly to consider the fatal consequences, the Tryal then hastning on, my own VVeakness at last forced me to comply, whilest my Apprehensions, Surprize, and Fears overpowred my vanquisht Reason, and husht all other sentiments.</p>
            <p>Thus was I unfortunately ensnared by a continual Chain of cross contingencies, together with an Humane Frailty which some time or other attends all mankind. Yet truly, that the VVorld may not lie in a mistaken Opinion, I profess before God, Men and Angels, that I neither had any malice against any of the persons then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peacht, whom till then I had never seen; nor did I comply through any prospect of Reward, or Mercenary end whatever, having never had so much as one farthing from that day to this, no not so much as one shilling at the delivery of the <hi>Subpoena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rest of the Summer I was very quiet, being very kindly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Oates</hi> whenever I came to visit him. And after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Dangerfield</hi> sets up his Plot; which when I heard of, in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity I went the next morning to <hi>Oates</hi> to hear his opinion of it; he was in his Chamber, and when I had stayed some small time with him, in came Sir <hi>Will. Waller,</hi> Coll. <hi>Mansell, Peter Gill,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chetwyn,</hi> and <hi>Tho. Merry,</hi> vvith some others. <hi>Waller</hi> had a very great bundle of Papers vvhich he pulled out from under his Coat, they having that night searched Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> House, and brought these from thence: <hi>Oates</hi> then ask'd Sir <hi>William</hi> hovv matters vvent, Sir <hi>William</hi> made a discourse of half an hour long; as much of which, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was to this purpose: VVe, says he, have searcht <hi>Celliers</hi> house from top to bottom, with all the care and diligence that men could use, and we thought vve might have found some Priests or Jesuites, or such ill persons, or else some Treasonable Papers, but vve found none, and so vve vvent out of the House; but when we vvere in the street, in Troth Doctor <hi>I</hi> had an impulse upon my Spirits to go back and search again; so vvere entred, and <hi>I</hi> remembring a Meal-Tub vvhich <hi>I</hi> had seen before there, but had not search'd; <hi>I</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd that, and under some Flovver at the bottom of it, <hi>I</hi> found all these Papers. Likevvise aftervvards <hi>I</hi> found some Papers, but of no great consequence behind a Pevvter Dish in the Kitchen: Says <hi>Oates</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:110302:12"/>
to this, VVhat are those Papers, vvhat is there in them? Quoth Sir <hi>William,</hi> the Papists have throvvn a Plot upon us; They have made the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> a General, and my Lord <hi>Macklesfield</hi> a Lieutenant General, and a great many other Officers (vvhich Sir <hi>William</hi> named, but <hi>I</hi> forgot) but Sir <hi>William</hi> proceeded, nay, they have done me the honour to make me a Collonel. From thence they vvent to the Council vvith the Papers, and only <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>I</hi> vvere left behind; and no sooner vvere their Backs turn'd, but says <hi>Oates; By the Lord they have put these Papers into the Meal-Tub themselves, and found them when they have done.</hi> And truly taking the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances all together, and Sir <hi>Williams</hi> True Protestant impulse for the safety of the Nation that made him return again into the House after so through a search before; <hi>Oates</hi>'s plain dealing in this matter, look'd vvith a shrevvd suspicious face of Truth and Reason.</p>
            <p>But having mention'd Sir <hi>William,</hi> I cannot omit another prank of his, vvhich vvas his producing of <hi>Pickerings</hi> Gun: He and his gang got a Gun of a confiding Brother, a Gunsmith in the <hi>Minories,</hi> vvhich cost them a considerable summ of Money. After this purchase, Sir <hi>William,</hi> vvith the aforenamed gang, pretended to make a search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Pickerings</hi> House in the <hi>Savoy;</hi> and in this sham search they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd the Gun into the House, and amongst a parcel of Feather-beds, vvhich vvith other goods lay in a confused heap, they opend the Seam in one of the Beds, and clapt in the Gun, and sovved up the Seam again; and next night making a nevv search, upon pretence of some second impulse of Sir <hi>Williams,</hi> that he had not search'd narrovvly enough before, they found the Gun vvhere they had left it; and tho this King killing Trophy vvas undiscover'd till this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond search, yet a more harmless and softer Metal in the same room, <hi>viz.</hi> 3 or 400 <hi>l.</hi> in old Gold and Silver, did not scape him at first search; vvith the fore-mention'd Trophy, thus heroically gain'd, these True Protestant Champions march'd in great Triumph to the King and Council, where Sir <hi>William</hi> upon his Knees made a present of it to his Majesty, vvho commending it for a very pretty Gun, made a present of it back again to Sir <hi>William.</hi> But that Sir <hi>William</hi> brought the Money to his Majesty as well as the <hi>Popish</hi> Gun, Historians make no question.</p>
            <p>I cannot pass by one more of Sir <hi>Williams</hi> Adventures; amongst the many Apparitions of Popery, visible only to True Protestant eyes, there happened an information of a Lady Abbess and a House of Nuns at <hi>Hammersmith;</hi> this vvas about <hi>March</hi> 1680. Sir <hi>William</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110302:13"/>
a VVarrant from the Council to search this <hi>Popish</hi> Seminary; vvhich vvas accordingly done, <hi>Oates</hi> himself going along vvith him; and to make the greater bustle in so doughty an undertaking, they put the whole Tovvn of <hi>Hammersmith</hi> into an uproar, and then most manfully broke open the doors, where they found an old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, with 3 or 4 little Girls which she taught Needlework; and to make out this formidable Discovery they found out a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which they had formerly taken amongst the spoils of some <hi>Popish</hi> Houses: and which <hi>Oates</hi> had a long time before carried in his pocket.

            <p>But to return to <hi>Titus</hi> again. His great and stupendious Fortune brought his Mother up to Town from <hi>Hastings</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> where she was a Midwife, to see her Son; which was a little before <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> in 79, who lay with her Husband at his Lodgings in <hi>York</hi> Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where one day I happen'd to dine with them. Some time after dinner the old man went out, and left only me and the old woman together; I staying indeed the longer for a Friend, whom I had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to call upon me there. The old woman, (much unlike her Husband and Son) was look'd upon by all that knew her to be a very Pious and Vertuous woman in her way, and at this time treated me very kindly; where discoursing with me, she said thus: <hi>Mr. Smith, you have known my Son</hi> Titus <hi>a great while, pray what do you think of him, and this business;</hi> (meaning the Plot) to which I answer'd, <hi>Very well;</hi> not thinking fit to tell her my real sentiments: The old woman shaking her head, replied, <hi>Indeed I do not like it well. Pray God bless him. You know, Mr.</hi> Smith, <hi>I have had a great many Children, and by my profession I have skill in Womens concerns. But I believe never woman went such a time with a Child as I did with him. I could seldom or never sleep when I went with him, and when I did sleep I always dreamt I was with Child of the Devil. But when I came to my Travail, I had such hard Labour that I believe no woman ever had; it was ten to one but it had kill'd me: I was never so of any of my other Children. Then when he grew up I thought he would have been a Natural; for his Nose always run, and he slabber'd at the mouth, and his Father could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure him; and when he came home at night the Boy would use to be in the Chimney corner, and my Husband would cry take away this snotty Fool, and jumble him about, which made me often weep, because you know he was my Child.</hi>

This is <hi>verbatim</hi> what his Mother said of him, for I took special Notice of her Words. He was Born at <hi>Oakam,</hi> in the County of <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> his Father being then Chaplain to Collonel <hi>Pride,</hi> where he was brought up in his Childhood. In the Year 1664. he was brought to <hi>Merchant-Taylors-School,</hi> as a <hi>Free-Schollar,</hi> by <hi>Nicholas Delves,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> now Living; he happening to be in Books that were Taught in my forms, I was sent for down to Receive him into the School, which I did in a very unlucky hour. And truly, the first Trick he served me, was, That he Cheated me of our Entrance-Money which his Father sent me, which the Doctor generously confest in his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and very Honestly paid me then. I wish he had been as just in all his other greater Matters; if so, the Kingdom had not been in such Tormoyls, nor so many Honest Men Destroyed and Undone.</p>
            <p>Coming one Evening to Visit him at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> I found <hi>Bedloe</hi> and <hi>Prance</hi> with him; amongst other Discourses, they Talkt of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey: Oats</hi> Laught at the business, and said, Here is <hi>Bedloe,</hi> that knew no more of the Murder than you or I did. But he got the Five Hundred Pound, and that did his work, and gave this Blockhead 30 <hi>l.</hi> of it. He pickt him up in the Lobby of the House of Lords, and took him for a Loggerhead fit for his purpose; at which <hi>Bedloe</hi> laught heartily, and <hi>Prance</hi> look'd a little dull, as displeased. At this Rate I have heard <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Bedloe</hi> Discourse very often, who used always themselves to make the business of <hi>Godfrey</hi> a Ridiculous Story, and Entertain'd themselves when Private with the Jest on't.</p>
            <p>At the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> Tryal, I got in for Curiosity amongst the Witnesses against him; and that Morning the Sentence was past, when the Question of <hi>Guilty or not Guilty</hi> passing among the Barons, we being so near them as to hear what past, when the Major Voices at first went <hi>Not Guilty, Dugdale</hi> walk'd about very Melancholy and Dejected, muttering to himself: I ask'd him, what was the matter? he Replyed, <hi>I believe he'l be Quitted, and I am undone; but let what will come on't, I am Ruin'd.</hi> I hapned the Winter after this to be in <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> Company, in the Kitchin at the <hi>Three-Tun Tavern</hi> at <hi>Charing-Cross</hi> one Night; where an Old Gentleman happening to come to the Bar to Inquire for some Person there, I observed <hi>Dugdale</hi> to startle and stare: I ask'd him, what was the matter? he made me no Reply, but in much disorder rose up, and went to the Woman at the Bar, (the Gentleman being then gone) and ask'd, who that Antient Gentlemen was? she told him, she knew him not. <hi>God bless me,</hi> said he, <hi>I believe 'tis my Lord</hi> Stafford! (as the Woman Inform'd me afterwards) and returning again to me, I ask'd him what he went out for? <hi>Lord!</hi> says he, <hi>Did you not see a Gentleman come to the Bar, and Speak to the Woman of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110302:14"/>
House? No,</hi> said I, <hi>My Back was towards the Bar, and I saw him not. I Protest,</hi> replyed he, <hi>I thought it had been my Lord</hi> Stafford; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued so terrified with the Apprehension, that he was very uneasie, and went away.</p>
            <p>This story coming to his Landladies Ear, who lived within a few Doors of the place, her Name Mrs. <hi>Beak,</hi> she and I discoursing this Matter, she told me also something of the like Nature of him, which was this: Having occasion to come into his Bed-Chamber for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, one Night, that she wanted from thence, when <hi>Dugdale</hi> was in bed, she went in softly with a candle in her hand, and a white Apron on, designing if asleep not to wake him; no sooner came she in, but <hi>Dugdale</hi> in a very great Fright and start, cryed out, <hi>Stafford! Stafford! Stafford!</hi> with many other expressions of a most Terrible Fear, till the Woman with much ado at last undeceived him.</p>
            <p>It will not be amiss, in this place, to add the Relation of <hi>Turbevils</hi> Death, the other great Witness against the Lord <hi>Stafford:</hi> Falling sick of the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> at his Landladies, Mrs. <hi>Holmes</hi> in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> near his Death he began to Rave extreamly of <hi>Stafford,</hi> crying, <hi>Take away</hi> Stafford! <hi>Take away</hi> Stafford! with several other continued crys upon the same subject; which several Persons, both the Landladies Relations and others will Testifie: and at the Minute of his Death, his Bed shook so extreamly, that his Landlady and several other People then present, thought it would have fal'n to pieces. Nay, and there came such a strong blast of Wind, that the People were afraid the House would have been blown down. And 'tis not unknown also, that a much greater Man than <hi>Turbevil,</hi> at his <hi>Exit</hi> demonstrated an extraordinary Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>Stafford.</hi>

In the Year 1681.

               <hi>ABout the time that Mr.</hi> Colledge <hi>was taken, I well remember one Mr.</hi> William Smith, <hi>a Fifth-Monarchy-man, askt me in</hi> Otes'<hi>s Chamber in</hi> Whitehall, <hi>in the presence of</hi> James Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, William Dalby, <hi>and</hi> William Powel, <hi>(the two first being</hi> Otes'<hi>s Menial Servants) where</hi> Smith <hi>the Priest,</hi> Macnamarra, <hi>and the other</hi> Irish <hi>Witnesses Lodged? I askt him why he enquired their Lodgings? he replyed, That himself and others would take them and carry them to</hi> Tyburn, <hi>and hang them on the Gallows, and pin papers on their Backs, to enform the World why they were Hanged. The said</hi> Smith <hi>likewise told me at</hi> Greys <hi>in</hi> Scotland-yard, <hi>That he and others would be about</hi> Henly, <hi>and meet</hi> Colledge, <hi>and Rescue him as easily as they formerly Rescued</hi> Mason. <hi>This was in the presence of the aforesaid</hi> Powel <hi>and</hi> Dalby; Smith <hi>then called</hi> Dalby <hi>into the next Room, and talked with him some time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>About</hi> Bartholomew-tide 1680, <hi>Alderman</hi> Wilcocks <hi>gave a Treat at the Crown Tavern without</hi> Temple-Barr <hi>to divers Gentlemen, of which (he being my very good Friend) I was one, the time appointed was one a Clock, about which time</hi> Otes, <hi>his Brother</hi> Sam, <hi>and Counsellor</hi> Smith <hi>came; and about half an hour after, up comes</hi> John Smith <hi>and</hi> Colledge; <hi>I not then well knowing</hi> Colledge, <hi>askt</hi> John Smith, <hi>who he was, which he told me, saying, It was Mr.</hi> Colledge <hi>the Protestant Joyner: One of the Company (I think it was</hi> Colledge) <hi>produced a Pamplet in Quarto of two sheets, about the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>which was Read: It was long before Dinner came up, which being ended, Mr.</hi> Otes, <hi>Mr.</hi> Savage, <hi>and Mr.</hi> John Smith, <hi>fell into a friendly dispute in Divinity; Mr.</hi> Colledge <hi>was so far from sleeping during their Discourse, that he was often interrupting them with his Quibbles and Rhime-doggrel, for which</hi> Otes <hi>rebuked him. I am very certain, neither</hi> Colledge, <hi>nor any body else, slept in the Room before Dinner or after: We parted, and I left</hi> Otes, Smith, Colledge, <hi>and others of the Company in an Alley by the</hi> Palsgraves head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The very day after (as I take it) that</hi> Colledge <hi>was Condemned, about Nine in the Morning, I was walking through St.</hi> Margarets
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110302:15"/>
               <hi>Church-yard, Westminster, and Mr.</hi> Hunt <hi>the Lawyer hum'd to me; I met him, he complained of</hi> Colledges <hi>ill usage in many bitter expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; among others, I very well remember, he said these words at our parting:</hi> By God, this pace will not carry it; we must take another course <hi>I askt him, what? he replayed,</hi> We must Dagger them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Dagger will do it. <hi>Dagger who, quoth I?</hi> These Rogues the Judges, <hi>says he;</hi> we must make a Tumult in the street, and Stab them like Villains in their Coaches, for an Example to others; for no good will be done, we shall have no Justice, till these Rogues be served so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Merry <hi>said to me in Mr.</hi> Ote's <hi>Chamber at</hi> Whitehall, <hi>when the Parliament was sitting at</hi> Oxford, 1680/1. That the King had a Design to seize upon all the Protestant honest Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and chop off their Heads; <hi>but, says he,</hi> They are well provided for Defence and Offence; yet the King will cut off all the honest Party, and bring in Popery at last by the help of the King of <hi>France;</hi> but if he Travels once more, neither he, nor any of the Race of him, will ever return.</p>
            <p>Rhoderick Mansel <hi>at</hi> Lambs <hi>Ordinary in</hi> March 1679. <hi>told Mr.</hi> Savage, <hi>Mr.</hi> Hughs, <hi>Mr.</hi> Button, <hi>and my self;</hi> That there were Commissions given out, that Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> had seized them, that he had seen them, that he knew of Twenty Horses in divers Stables ready, that he and Collonel <hi>Disney</hi> would Head the Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices; that he would Fight for the Cause in Blood up to the Knees, and that the King resolved to bring in <hi>Popery. This was before the business of Captain</hi> Tom.</p>
            <p>Nicholson, <hi>when he was fitting up</hi> Otes's <hi>Pistols, a little before the Parliament met at</hi> Oxford, <hi>said to me;</hi> Come, come, we shall have occasion for these before we come back again from <hi>Oxford;</hi> I shall be once again on Horseback: I would I were Twenty Years Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>He was a Trooper in</hi> Cromwells <hi>Army.</hi>

               <hi>The aforesaid</hi> Creswel <hi>is a most Audacious Villain; His many Horrid Expressions against the King, and the great Ministers of State, would fill many Sheets. His ordinary Execrations against the King, are,</hi> The Devil confound him, he is a <hi>Papist;</hi> the Devil run through him with a Scythe at's Back: The Devil Run through that <hi>Papist Whore,</hi> that <hi>Bitch,</hi> the Queen with a Scythe at's Back. <hi>The like Curses against the Chancellor, Mr.</hi> Seymore, <hi>Secretary</hi> Jenkins, <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have heard him express, (I do really think) above a hundred times.</hi>

               <hi>Doctor</hi> Oates <hi>hath in my hearing, I belive, a hundred times, affirmed very Peremptorily,</hi> That the Supream Power was in the People, That the King was but the Peoples Servant and Steward; That the People had Power to Depose him, and set up another when they pleased: That the King was as deep in the Plot, and was as Errant a Papist as his Brother: That, the King had Suborned VVitnesses to stifle the <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> and to throw it upon the <hi>Protestants; mentioning</hi> Dangerfield, Tongue, <hi>and</hi> Fitz-Harris.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One day; when</hi> Tongue <hi>was Examined before the Council.</hi> Otes <hi>told me,</hi> All the Subornation will come up to our Master at last; <hi>meaning the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Many times</hi> Otes <hi>has said to me,</hi> His Fingers Itches <hi>(meaning the King)</hi> to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> and the <hi>French Government;</hi> But it will not do; we are ready, we are Provided against him with Men and Arms, upon any occasion: He may remember what became of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Kings that abused <hi>Parliaments:</hi> Let him Remember his Father; He must expect the same Sauce if he goes on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Persons that most frequented</hi> Otes's <hi>Chamber, were, Councellor</hi> Smith, Starkey, Pascal, Charleton, Aaron Smith, VVilson, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, Nelthrop, VVest, Hunt, Snow, Halford, Blaney, Merry, Mansel, <hi>Sir</hi> Hugh Inglesby, <hi>Collonel</hi> Scot, Chetwin, Colledge, Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington, Harrington, <hi>Dr.</hi> Jones, <hi>Dr.</hi> Butler, <hi>Dr.</hi> Pole, <hi>Dr. a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary of</hi> Chichester, Cannon, Billing, Penn, <hi>and</hi> VVhitacre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Afternoon</hi> Oats <hi>Returned from</hi> Oxford <hi>after</hi> Colledges <hi>Tryal, he laid him down on the Chairs in his Chamber at</hi> Whitehall, <hi>and said,</hi> Oh! there is a great Man fallen this day in <hi>Israel!</hi> I wish I may lay down my Life in so just a Cause: He is his Countries <hi>Martyr.</hi> Well! well! we may now see how the Game is like to go; Our Master <hi>(meaning the King)</hi> is resolved to bring in <hi>Popery:</hi> No Man ever had such foul Play as this poor <hi>Colledge;</hi> all the <hi>True Protestants</hi> will be Murdered thus one after another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Major</hi> Wildman, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Charleton <hi>Furnished</hi> Oats <hi>at his going to</hi> Oxford <hi>to the Parliament with Forty Pound, his Collections are now ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by</hi> Elias Best <hi>the Hop-Merchant in</hi> Thames-street.</p>
            <p>William Powel <hi>said to me one day in</hi> Scotland-yard, Dam this Dog <hi>Warcup!</hi> By God, if I could light on him handsomely, I would Cut his Throat, he hath been the cause of all this mischief; <hi>meaning
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:110302:16"/>
the business of</hi> Colledge. <hi>This</hi> Powel <hi>will commonly say,</hi> Our Family lost a great Estate by <hi>Windsor</hi> at the Kings coming in, but if things go on we shall get it again I doubt not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have divers times in</hi> Oats's <hi>Chamber in</hi> Whitehall <hi>(particularly after the Dissolution of the Two last Parliaments, and during that at</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster) <hi>heard</hi> Henry Starkey, Aaron Smith, <hi>Mr.</hi> Hunt, <hi>Mr.</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Mr.</hi> Chetwin, <hi>Mr.</hi> Thomas Merry, <hi>Mr.</hi> Richard Halford, <hi>Mr.</hi> VVhitaker, <hi>Collonel</hi> Mansel, <hi>and Doctor</hi> Oates, <hi>Affirm and Discourse thus,</hi> VVe have 20000 Horse and Foot, ready Armed upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; we Value not the Kings Guards a Fart; and if the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> will but draw his Sword, he'l find Friends enough; and if the Parliament would but sit, their Friends could Protect them against the King, and all his Guards. <hi>The means how they can have 20000 Men so ready (as far as I could perceive) is this, The Gentlemen of the Three Great Clubs, and their Adherents of the better sort, and the meaner fort of the Trained-bands, are double Armed; I have heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them say,</hi> They would loose their Lives before they would part with their Arms, and if the King should come to demand them, they would Fire upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Remember, when the matter of presenting the Guards was on Foot, that Mr.</hi> Merry <hi>said to me,</hi> The Grand Inquest are Cowardly and Timerous Fellows, and dare not go through with the work, they are too much of the Court Party; <hi>but afterwards upon advice from my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>the business was laid aside: My Lord said,</hi> It was better to let the Guards alone, because they were of small moment to obstruct our Designs, and help'd to Impoverish the King; <hi>This Dr.</hi> Otes <hi>told me, and I once heard my Lord Speak to that purpose.</hi> Otes <hi>often visited my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>and was put upon Swearing against the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>by his Instigation; as</hi> Otes <hi>himself told me, and verily, I believe it was true. Dr.</hi> Otes, <hi>when I have ask'd him of my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>hath often told me, my Lord was Well, and would say,</hi> what are they all Starved yet at <hi>Whitehall?</hi> The King will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to buy a Shirt to his Back in a short time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I once heard my Lord say to</hi> Otes; I shall see thee Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> or <hi>Canterbury</hi> before I Dye: <hi>This was occasioned by</hi> Otes's <hi>threatning my Lord Chancellor, and saying,</hi> He was a Rogue, and he would stick as close to him as the Shirt on his back. <hi>This was in</hi> August, 1679.</p>

               <hi>Mr.</hi> VVilliam Dalby, Otes'<hi>s Clerk, hath often told me,</hi> That the King was a <hi>Papist,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Parsons</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> had many times seen him at <hi>Mass</hi> at <hi>Somerset-House:</hi> That the King was drunk when he Dissolved the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> so Drunk that he could not stand or Speak. <hi>I have often heard Mr.</hi> Dalby <hi>say,</hi> This <hi>Popish</hi> Race of the <hi>Stewarts</hi> must be Rooted out, there must be a Change. He <hi>was formerly Clerk to the Committee of the Rebels in</hi> Rutland.</p>

               <hi>Thus far Gentlemen, I have given you a small insight into this Grand Popular Cheat, this great Mystery of Iniquity, and as far as my little Walk amongst them has Empower'd me to do. And truly, if all Persons farther concern'd, would be as Candid as my Self, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the whole</hi> Imposture <hi>would be fully Detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the yet unsatisfied part of Mankind wholly undeceived.</hi>

            <p>SOme things being omitted in the preceding Discourse, it may not be thought impertinent to insert them in this <hi>Appendix;</hi> And first, I shall give an account (so far as fell under my knowledge,) of the wrong, Dr. <hi>Goade</hi> Mr. of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Taylors School</hi> sustaind in the late time of <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Injustice,</hi> hoping that Pious and Learned Person, will not take my honest and fair Intentions other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than I mean them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Factious Party</hi> of the Company had watch'd with malitious Eys to gain any advantage for several years against Him; But either not finding any plausible one, or esteeming him a Man so extraordinarily qualify'd, that a better could not be found in the Three Kingdoms, (and there I'm sure they were in the right,) They attempted not to Eject him, but lessen'd him in Priviledges belonging to his Place, some years (I think I may say) before <hi>Oates</hi>'s Plot appear'd above-ground. It so fell out, in the beginning of the year 1681, (as I take it,) that <hi>John Smith,</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd <hi>Narrative Smith,</hi> but his real name is <hi>David Barry,)</hi> happen'd to Dine with <hi>Elias Best</hi> the <hi>Hop-merchant</hi> in <hi>Thames-street;</hi> He having Sons at <hi>Merchant-Taylors-School,</hi> desir'd <hi>J. Smith</hi> to examine how they benefitted in Learning: These Boys producing their Books, drew out the Ch. of <hi>England's Catcehism</hi> with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it; in which Comment <hi>Smith</hi> positively avow'd there was plain <hi>Popery</hi> upon our B. Saviour's descent into Hell. This formidable <hi>Spectrum</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> thus opportunely conjur'd up by <hi>Smith</hi> the <hi>Renegado Priest;</hi> the <hi>True Prot. Elias</hi> manag'd so effectually, that <hi>Bushel, Mallery, Keys, Delves,</hi> and other Fanatical Members of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Taylors</hi> Company, caus'd Dr. <hi>Goad</hi> to be summon'd to the Hall to answer for his Comment; which he undertook, and unhappily did it under his Hand, which was the only thing they wanted. Next, they consulted their Oracles, <hi>Otes, Ferguson,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> the <hi>Independant;</hi> The first to <hi>Swear,</hi> and the latter to Evict the <hi>Popery</hi> of the Comment, and its Defence.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding during the time that this Affair was transacted, I was very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with <hi>Oates,</hi> yet he cautiously conceal'd it from me, knowing I would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prevent it, having so great a Veneration for Dr. <hi>Goad,</hi> He being the best Friend I ever found; However he had before often tamper'd with me to have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Dr. of being a <hi>Papist;</hi> which, neither knowing, or Believing him so, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to do, telling <hi>Oates,</hi> that it would be the greatest piece of Ingratitude imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in Him to attempt any such thing; To which he would always answer, I did not spare You who were my Mr. too, and therefore why should I spare Him? And for this aversion of mine, I was then wholly kept a stranger to their projects against him, till they had fully done their work.</p>
            <p>But to give you the full account of this Comment, and the Dr's. Ruine that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it; The matter of Fact is as follows. Upon a fit of Sickness that the Dr. lay under, the conduct of his School was wholly left to the Ushers, who driving (as is well known) a great Trade in Selling Books to the Schollars, did at that time, for their own private Lucre, Introduce this Comment upon the Church-<hi>Catechism</hi> into the School; which was so far from being <hi>Popish,</hi> that it was both Licens'd, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the then Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Now tho' the Dr. did very honestly in defending it, it was more than he was oblig'd to do, because it was brought into the School without his knowledge; The Fault (if any had been,) lying only at the Ushers dores, who, by the Custom of that School ought first to have consulted the Dr. (which they never did,) and to have had his approbation, this Book being for the lower Formes only; The <hi>Catechism</hi> used in the Fifth and Sixth Formes under the Dr's. more immediate Care, being only in <hi>Greek,</hi> without any Comment at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:110302:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now, though the Dr. did give his Enemies the above-nam'd advantage against him, by getting it under his Hand; and for That only reason, (this being the only quarrel against him,) they depriv'd him of his School, and utterly blasted his Name and Reputation to the world, as a down-right <hi>Papist,</hi> yet That whole Tenent on which they grounded their pretended <hi>Popery,</hi> was expresly a particular Doctrine of the Ch. of <hi>England,</hi> the descent of our Saviour into Hell being a special Article, even of our very Apostles <hi>Creed.</hi> But forsooth, because several Fanaticks dissent from Us in that Point of our Belief, those very persons were set up for Judges in the Cause, and even a Defence of our Ch. of <hi>England</hi> (the Dr's. Defence of the Comment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other,) Arraign'd, Convicted, and Condemn'd as <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Antichristian,</hi> by the Sentence and Decree of <hi>Oates, Ferguson, Owen,</hi> &amp;c. together with the Assent of <hi>Bushel, Mallary, Keys,</hi> and the rest of the Lay Brethren in <hi>Inquisition,</hi> assembled.</p>
            <p>Why the reforming Zeal of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> was so active in Dr. <hi>Goad</hi>'s Ruin, was, for the introduction of his Sisters Son Mr. <hi>Harcliff,</hi> into his place; a Person undoubtedly not unworthy of the Preferment, for having once Heroically attempted to Preach before His late Majesty, and not being able to utter one word of his Sermon, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the Pulpit as great an <hi>Orator</hi> as he went up, Treating His Majesty with no other Entertainment than a silent Meeting.</p>
            <p>But to give you the farther management of this Affair, passing by all the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice done to Dr. <hi>Goad,</hi> here was a violation of the Custom of the School in intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing this Mr. It being agreed <hi>ab Origine,</hi> between Famous Sir <hi>Thomas White, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Taylor,</hi> and Founder of St. <hi>Johns Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Company of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Taylors,</hi> that the Mr. of that School should always be a Member of that <hi>Colledge,</hi> which this man was not, being an <hi>Eaton</hi> Scholar, and consequently of <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now their reason for this illegal Election of a <hi>School-master,</hi> the Then over-ruling Factious Party of the <hi>Merchant-Taylors,</hi> (though offer'd an able Man by the <hi>Colledge)</hi> suspended this Custom, pretending That the <hi>Colledge</hi> of St. <hi>Johns</hi> would send none but Persons that would propagate <hi>Popery;</hi> so that here's the Gown men of a whole Colledge at one stroke branded with <hi>Popery</hi> by these Infallible <hi>Mechanick <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the time of this Business of Dr. <hi>Goads, Nat. Thompson</hi> had Publish'd in his <hi>News Book</hi> the Apprentices intent of burning the <hi>Rump,</hi> which being no sooner view'd with a pair of <hi>Whig-Spectacles,</hi> but it was turn'd to a <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> and to be manag'd by Sir <hi>W. Waller;</hi> In order to which, he attempted to get a Warrant from the Privy Councel for <hi>Thompson;</hi> But That Project failing, he decoy'd him in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persons Name without <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> and there by his own Warrant charg'd him with <hi>High Treason,</hi> and committing him to the <hi>Gate-house;</hi> The next day Sir <hi>Will.</hi> made it his whole business to boast what great Service he had done to the <hi>Cause</hi> in securing Him; further telling me, that <hi>Thompson</hi> had said, and done such things that did amount to <hi>Treason,</hi> and he did not doubt but to Hang him. But as Providence order'd it, in few days after Sir <hi>Will.</hi> was fairly dismist of his Justice-ship, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently made incapable of Plund'ring any more: Upon which he stept for <hi>Holland,</hi> and there turn'd his Plunder'd Relicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into Gold, to the value of 6 or 700 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Slander more they cast upon me, was, that I writ Seditious Pamphlets for <hi>Oates;</hi> Truly I will not wrong him, he never desir'd any such thing of me; Indeed he promis'd me 20 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and Dyet, to Translate certain Books in Latine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Institutions, Rules and Orders of the Jesuits; Some of which I put into <hi>English,</hi> and have part of them yet by me; all which if Printed, would no ways prejudice Jesuits, or other persons, but be useful to many curious men. Now for all my pains <hi>Oates</hi> never paid me one Peny, though he punctually satisfy'd <hi>John Philips</hi> for writing the many Lies and Villanies that even yet remain under his Name on every Fanatical Booksellers Stall. Many other wrongs I have long labour'd under, which I believe, if known, would draw compassion from my greatest Enemies; But those having no relation to the Publick, shall be now conceal'd.</p>
