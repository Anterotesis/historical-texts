         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10597:4"/>
with diuers zealous and godly men, who in mylde and louing speehes, made knowen vnto them, how iustly God repayeth the reprobate, howe fatherly againe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth the obedient, how he ouerthroweth the vngodlye in their owne deuises, and protecteth his chosen in all stormes and afflictions: in remembrance of all these, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke themselues of their wickednes passed, and to shew such harty and zealous repentaunce for the same, that all be it, they had so greeuously trespassed, yet in contrite and humble sorrowing they might be gratiously receiued into his heauenly fauour, whom they had mooued and styrred by their vnreuerent regarde, to smite and chasten with the rod of his fury. Among which godly perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Sherife himselfe, both learnedly and earnestly labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them, moouing al good occasions he might deuise, to chaunge the obstinacie be perceiued in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, into a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, like humility and repentaunce, but these good ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours tooke no wished effect, their owne euil disposition so blinded them, that there was no way for grace to enter.</p>
            <p>When they were come beyond S. Giles in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> féeld, there approched vnto the Hurdell, one of their owne secte, and a Priest, as himselfe hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, who in this maner spake vnto the prisoners.

U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing these and other trayterous speeches, holde was layde on him. When as M.

               <pb facs="tcp:10597:4"/>
Being come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of Execution, <hi>Thomas Forde,</hi> was first brought vp into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Carte, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he began in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Wheras I am come hither to die, for matters layd vnto my charge of treason, which shoulde be conspired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Quéene, within these two yeares or somewhat more. I giue you to vnderstande, that of any such matter I am innocent and free, for that I can prooue my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into England to be fiue yeerss since. Where vpon Maister Sherife spake vnto him and sayde, <hi>Forde,</hi> haue minde on God, aske him and her Maiestie hartily forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hast so highly offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, thou doost but delude the people, for it is manifestly known, how thou art guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of the matters layde to thy charge, here is thine owne aunswers to shew, affirmed vnder thine owne hand, and other witnesses to reprooue thee. Where vpon I my selfe was called foorth, who iustified the causes to his face, that at hys araignement was layd to his charge, and he eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and plainly found guiltye thereof. Then were his aunswers wherto he had subscribed read vnto him, which is in the booke lately sette foorth by authoritye, where vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he tooke occasion to tell a long sircumstaunce, of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine question mooued at Oxenforde, as concerning, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king armes against her Maiestie, which horrible treason he séemed to approoue thereby. Then Maister Sherife willed him to aske her Maiestie forgiuenes, offering him to stande his freende in attayning her graces mercy, yf he would chaunge his former traiterous minde to become a true and faithfull Subiect, acknowledging her to bee his lawful soueraigne Lady, notwithstanding any thing that any Pope could say or doo to the contrarye. Whereto be aunswered, I haue not offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded her Maiestie, but if I haue I aske her forgiuenes &amp; all the world, &amp; in no other treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue I offended then my religion, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholique faith, wherin I will liue and dye. And as for the Quéenes Maiestie, I doo acknowledge her supremacy in all thinges temporal, but as conserning Ecclesiastical causes I deny

her, that onely belongeth to the Uicar of Christ, the Pope. In bréefe, he graunted to nothing, but shewed himselfe an impious and obstinate Traytour, and so he remayned to the death, refusing to pray in the English tongue, mum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bling a fewe Latine prayers, desiring those that were <hi>Ex domo Dei,</hi> to pray with him, and so he ended his lyfe.</p>
            <p>In the meane time that he hanged, which was tyll hee was dead, so great is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercye of our gratious Princesse. <hi>Iohn Sherte</hi> was brought from off the Hurdell to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, wher séeing <hi>Forde</hi> hanging. He bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with holding vppe his handes, as the Papistes are wont to doo before theyr Images. O swéete Tom, O happy Tom, O blessed Tom. Then being stayed, <hi>Forde</hi> was cut downe, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the place where his body should be quartered. In which time <hi>Sherte</hi> was brought vp into the Carte, where looking toward the dead bodye of <hi>Forde,</hi> hee fell downe on his knées, and held vp his hands to it, (saying agayne.) O happy Tom, O blessed Tom, thy swéete soule pray for me. O déere Tom, thy blessed soule pray for me. For which woords béeing rebuked, the Executioner lifted him vp on feete, when as he prepared him to his confession, (saying) I am brought hither to this place, to dye a death, whych is both shamefull, and ignominious, for which I thanks thee my Lord God, who framing me to thine owne simy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude &amp; likenes, hath blessed me to thys good ende. There being stayed, because hee seemed to prolong the time to small purpose, the Sherife willed him to remember hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for what cause he was come thither: howe he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Quéenes Maiestie, and that he was nowe to aske her forgiuenes, Beside he might receiue her princely mercy: wherto with an Hipocriticall outward boldnesse, but an inward faynting feare, (as afterwarde euerye one playnly beheld,) he gaue thys aunswere.

Then Maister Sherife spake vnto him (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) by the way as we came, you swore an oath, for which you willed me to beare witnesse y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you were hartily sorie. Now I pray you let me be a witnesse, that you are as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telie sorie for offending the Quéenes Maiestie.

Alas, what can it eyther profite thée, or hinder thée? praye thou to God and he will helpe thee.

But then to manifest that his former boldnesse, was but méere dissembling, and hipocrisie: he lyfted vp his handes, and caught holde on the Halter, so that euerie one perceyued his fayre outwarde shewe, and his fowle inward disfigured nature, also howe

               <hi>Robert Iohnson,</hi> being broughte vp into the Carte, Maister Sherife according as he had before, both declared vnto hym, her Maiesties mercy if he would repent, and al so willed him to be sory for his offences against her, wher of he séemed to make small estemation, denying the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons according as the others had done, and appealinge likewise vpon his religion.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the VVednesday following, which</hi> was the thirtye daye of May, in the same maner as I haue before expressed. <hi>Luke Kirbie, William Filbie, Thomas Cottom,</hi> and <hi>Lauraunce Rychardson,</hi> were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Tower of London, to the place of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as the other were on the Mundaye before associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and accompanied with diuers learned and godlye Preachers, euen so were these, as to say, Maister <hi>Charke,</hi> Maister <hi>Herne,</hi> and diuers others, who all the waye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed such godly and Christian perswasions vnto them, (as had not the Child of perdition so meruailouslye blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them) were of force to haue wonne them into grace &amp; Mercye. The speeches they vsed to them by the way were néedelesse here to set downe, for that they did especiallye concerne causes to roote out that wicked opinion in them, and to establish a sound and perfect fayth in place thereof, but euen as it was in the other, so it did agree in them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Luke Kirbie</hi> séemed to chalenge me, as concerning I was able to approoue nothing against him, which he did because he supposed I was not there present: but what passed betwéene, him and me, you shall heare hereafter.</p>
            <p>They being come to the place of Execution, <hi>William Filbie,</hi> was brought vp into the Carte, where conforming himselfe vnto the death, his wicked treasons were moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto him, which obstinately and impudently he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. Then was he demaunded if hee would acknowledge the Quéenes Maiestie his soueraigne Princesse, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head vnder Christ of the Churche of Englande.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10597:7"/>
No (quoth he) I will acknowledge no other head of the Church, then the Pope onelie: Wher vyon his aunsweres were reade vnto him, and he not denying them in any point, euén as they were wicked and impious, euen so he remayned in them, still appealing that it was for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that he died, and not for any Treason. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie was prooued vnto his face, as well by sufficient proofes, as also by the Trayterous aunswers, whereto hée had subscribed with his owne hande. At last, as he was desired: he prayed for the Queenes Maiestie, that GOD might blesse her, and incline her harte to mercie towards the Catholiques, of which societie he was one. Then they opening his bosome, founde there two Crosses, which bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from him, were helde vp, and showen to all the people, beside, his Crowne was shauen. So after a fewe silent Latine prayers to himselfe, the Carte was drawne away.</p>
            <p>The next was <hi>Luke Kirbie,</hi> who being brought vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Carte, offered long circumstaunce of spéeche, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that he was come thither to dye, hoping to bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the blood of Christe: and much matter, which were néedelesse here to rehearse. Afterwarde, he beganne to saye, that there were none could approoue him to be a tray tour: neither had he at any time attempted any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to her Maiestie, and that his aduersaries, <hi>Sled,</hi> nor <hi>Munday,</hi> could not vpbraide him with any thinge. Whervpon Maister Sherife tolde him, that <hi>Munday</hi> was there, and asked him if he woulde haue him called to him. I sée him (quoth he) yonder, and let him say what he can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mee.</p>
            <p>Then was I commaunded to come some what neere him, when as he began in this manner to mée: O <hi>Munday</hi> consider with thy selfe, howe vntruly thou hast charged mee, with that which I neuer sayd nor thought. Besides, thou knowest that when thou camest to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tower to me, before Maister Liuetenaunt, and an other who was there
<pb facs="tcp:10597:7"/>
present then, thou wast demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded what thou thoughtest of mée, and what thou couldest say against mée? when as thou madest aunswer. Thou knewest no harme by mee, neither couldest thou at any tyme saye otherwise of mée then well: wherevpon thou wast asked, wherefore thou reportedst otherwise at my arraignement? Then the Sherife sayde vnto him, who can beare thée witnesse of this? (Quoth he againe) he spake it before Maister Lieuetenaunt, and an other was by then. Then was he demaunded what other he was that was present: which (after a long trifling) he sayde was a Keeper, and named him: whereto I made aunswere as followeth.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Kirbie,</hi> I wishe and desire you, in the feare of God, to remember your selfe, for this is not a place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port an vntrueth, neither to slaunder any man otherwise then you are able to prooue. When as I came vnto the Tower, and made knowen to Maister Lieuetenant, for what cause I was sent to speake with you, you were brought into a Chamber by your Keeper: and what I mooued vnto you, your selfe very well knoweth, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my allowaunce béeing the Popes Scholler: where, what aunswere you made, I haue truelie, and according as you aunswered already set downe in print. Maister Lieuetenant neither mooued any such woordes to mée, as héere you reported, and I call GOD to my witnesse, that not a motion of any such matter was once offered to mée by Maister Lieuetenant, or by your Kéeper. Your selfe then vttered that at sundrie times in the Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, there was diuerse leude woords spoken, which might better haue béene spared and denied that you were not in my Chamber, when as I lying sicke in my bed tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous spéech as were mooued by them, which were then present, whereof your selfe was one, with diuer so other matters which you spake vnto me, which Maister Lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant him selfe heard, and your Kéeper béeing present. But if this be true which you say, that it may be prooued
<pb facs="tcp:10597:8"/>
there was eyther such woordes mooued vnto mée, or any such aunswere made by mée, I offer to sustaine what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment the Lawe shall affoorde mée. Then falling to an other matter, for that this redounded to his owne confusion, (as Maister Lieuetenant can well witnesse:) he beganne to talke of my being at <hi>Roome,</hi> what fréend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe he had shewed vnto mée, and had done the lyke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a number of English men, whome he well knew, not to be of that Religion, bothe out of his owne purse, as also be fréending them to some of the Popes Chamber, he made conueyaunce for them the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Yea, I knewe well enough, when you departed thence, that your disposition was contrarie to ours, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it to my selfe.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Kirbie</hi> (quoth Maister Sherife) this is verie vnlyke, that you could affoord such fauour to any, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to that Religion that you professed no, no, if you knewe any such there, you would rather helpe to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them, then to pittie them, as it is the nature of you all.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Kirbie</hi> (quoth I) it is very vnlike that you had any such secrete knowledge of mée, eyther of my Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or howe I was secretlie bent, as you séeme heere to professe, for had I béene such a one as you woulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade these heere, you knewe mée to be, would you haue delyuered mee those silke Pictures halowed by the Pope which you did: and moreouer, make knowne to mée sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of your freends heere in England, to whome I should conuey them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O <hi>Munday</hi> (quoth he) I confesse I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to thée Pictures in déede, but thou knowest I gaue thée two <hi>Iulyes</hi> to goe huie them with, I dyd it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I knewe thée to be such a one, and therefore I dyd
<pb facs="tcp:10597:8"/>
misdoubt thee, for I woulde not credite thée with my hallowed Pictures. Maister <hi>Kirbie</hi> (quoth I) to deny your owne dooinges, is meruailous impudencie: dyd not you in your Chamber, delyuer to mée certaine silke Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which you tolde mée at Seukelyes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> béeing there, were hallowed by the Pope, &amp; what Indulgences were allowed them: one of them, which was a Crucifixe you gaue me, the other you willed me deliuer to your fréends at <hi>Rheimes,</hi> and in Englande: and because they were so fewe (as in deede I thinke they were no more but fiue) you gaue me two <hi>Iulyes,</hi> to goe into the Cittie to buie more, which I dyd: and hauing brought them to you, three or fowre of the fayrest you tooke from me, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to gette them hallowed at the next Benediction: the other in deede you gaue me, and I tooke them with me. Howe saye you nowe <hi>Kirbie</hi> (quoth Maister Sherife) would you haue credited him with such matters, had you not supposed him to be one of your owne secte. Maister Sherife (quoth he) what I haue sayde, I knewe verie well. And after he was gone from <hi>Roome,</hi> I sent fifteene shyllinges to <hi>Rheimes,</hi> to be delyuered to him, but he was departed thence towarde Englande, before it came.</p>
            <p>Then Maister Sherife sayde to him againe, you stand vpon these pointes verie much, which there is none that are héere, but will iudge to be vntrue. Thou hearest what he hath sayde vnto thee, and we haue heard that thou deniedst euerie thing.

<pb facs="tcp:10597:9"/>
At these woordes, the people among them selues, almoste generallie sayde: O excéeding mercie and fauour, what a gratious Princesse haue wée, who affoordeth such mercie to those that haue so yll deserued.</p>
            <p>Then Maister <hi>Feeld</hi> the Preacher, in the booke read his aunsweres to him, where he had subscribed with his owne hande. Whether the Pope might lawfullie depose her Maiestie, or had any aucthoritie to take the tytle of her Crowne and dignitie away from her, wherto <hi>Kirbie</hi> aunswered. This is a matter disputable in Schooles, and therefore I maye not iudge of it. I thinke this with my selfe, that if any Prince fal by infidelity, into Turscisme, Atheisme, Paganisme, or any such lyke, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Pope hath aucthoritie to depose such a Prince. And beeing asked, if her Maiesty were in any such: he sayd, he knew his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science. Another Preacher being by, said vnto him, that the Prince receiued his aucthority fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, &amp; that he was to be suppressed by none, but only by God Again that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> sayd: <hi>By me (meaning by God) Kinges raigne, and Princes decree Iustice. By me Princes rule, and the Nobles</hi>

               <hi>no power but of God, and the powers that be, are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God. Who soeuer therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinaunce of God, and they that resist, shall receyue to them selues iudgement. For Princes are not to be feared forgood works, but for euill: wilt thou then be without feare of the power, doo well, so shalt thou pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase praise of the same: For he is the minister of God for thy wealth: But if thou doo euill, feare, for he beareth not a swoord for naught, for he is the minister of God to take vengeaunce on him that dooth euill.</hi> If then the Pope be a Soule, hee is to be obedient to the higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. And béeing a subiect to God, as all other Princes be: hée must not take vpon him, what belongeth to God. As for the aucthoritie that her Maiestie hath, shee hath
<pb facs="tcp:10597:9"/>
receyued it from God, neither is the Pope, or any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Prince to depriue her therof, but onelie God. Againe, when Iesus was brought before <hi>Pilate, Pilate</hi> sayde to him. <hi>Knowest thou not that I haue power to crucifie thée, and haue power to loose thee?</hi> To the which Iesus <note place="margin">Iohn. 19. 10. 11.</note> aunswered: <hi>Thou couldest haue no power at all against mee, except it were giuen thee from aboue.</hi> Thus maye you see, that what Prince so euer ruleth vpon earth, hath his power and aucthority only from God: and not that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mortall man can vse the aucthoritie of a Prince at his pleasure. How say you to this? whereto he would make no aunswere: But séemed to demaunde of them, if they would deny, that if a Prince were in Paganisme, Atheis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, or gouerned by infidelitie: that such a Prince might not lawfullie be deposed. Which the learned Preachers aunswered in learned sort, approouing that as the power was of God, so Princes were not to be deposed by any, but onelie by God.</p>
            <p>No <hi>(quoth Kirbie</hi> againe) hath it not béene disputed in Schooles for these fiue hundred yéeres, and will you deny it? O Maister <hi>Crowley,</hi> Maister <hi>Crowley,</hi> and there paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as though that Maister <hi>Crowley</hi> had agréede with him in such a monstrous error. But Maister <hi>Crowley</hi> him selfe gaue me to vnderstand, that at such time as hee conferred with the sayde <hi>Kirbie</hi> in the Tower, about the same argument, that his aunswer was vnto him. If any Prince fell into any such kinde of error, that Prince were corrigible, but of whom? not of any earthly Prince, but of that heauenlie Prince, who gaue him his aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and seeing him abuse it any way, correcteth him in his Iustice. For by his attributing to the Pope, this auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he witnessed him to be Antichrist in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he wil depose Princes at his pleasure, &amp; exalt him self aboue all that is called God, and forgiue men their sinnes at his pleasure likewise. All this was not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to mollifie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> obstinate minde of <hi>Kirbie,</hi> but he would persist styl in this deuill<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:10597:10"/>
wauering, &amp; not able to yéeld any reason for his arrogant opinion, laboured as much as in them laye to chaunge it: and when all would not serue, they desired him in hartie and humble manner to pray to God, to ashe her Maiestie forgiuenesse, for the Treasons wherein he had offended her. Whereto he aunswered, that he had not offended in any Treason, to his knowledge: whervpon they shewed him his Treasons, which were adiudged by the people, woorthy of greater punishment, then he was at that time to suffer, yet would not he acknowledge them. But pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God for her Maiestie, that shée might lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g rule in her aucthoritie, to confound all her enimies: and that his hart was frée from any Treason to her Maiestie. Then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himself to his prayers, the Preachers desired him to pray in Englishe with them, and to say a prayer after them, wherin, if he could finde any fault, he should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued thereof. O (quoth he againe) you and I, were not one in faith, therefore I thinke, I should offend God, if I should praye with you: At which woordes, the people began to crie, away with him: so be saying his <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> in Latin, ended his life.</p>
            <p>Then was <hi>Laurence Richardson</hi> brought vp into the Carte, and to him <hi>Thomas Cottom,</hi> to be executed togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But <hi>Cottom</hi> seemed to vtter such words, as though there had béene hope he would haue forsaken his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so that the halter was vntyed, &amp; he brought downe out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Carte againe: In which time <hi>Laurence Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> prepared him to death, confessing him selfe a Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and that he would beléeue in all things, as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church of <hi>Roome</hi> did, vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope he allowed the onelie Supremacie.

<pb facs="tcp:10597:10"/>
would passe with as much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient spéede as might be. Then looking to the body of <hi>Laurence Richardson,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Executioner was vsing his office, he lysted vp his handes and sayde: O blessed <hi>Laurence,</hi> pray for mée, thy blessed soule <hi>Laurence,</hi> pray for mée: for which woordes, both the Preachers &amp; the people rebuked him telling him that he ought to pray to none, but to God onely, all helpe of man was but in vaine. Wherto he aunswered, he was assured that he could pray for him. In bréefe, his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons béeing mooued to him, he denied all, albeit his owne hand writing was there to affirme it. He prayed for her Maiestie, and sayde his <hi>Pater noster,</hi> and <hi>Aue Maria:</hi> and as the Carte was drawing away, he sayd: <hi>In manus tuas Domine commendo spiritum meum,</hi> and so he ended his lyfe. Thus in bréefe haue I set downe the Execution of these Traytors, desiring God, that the leude life of them and this lamentable spectacle wytnessed to our eyes, may be a warning to vs all, how by our disobedience we prouoke our Lord God to anger against vs, and by our slacknesse in duetie, to our gratious &amp; soueraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, next vnder God, our only supreame gouernesse, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force her mercifull hand to take vp the swoord of Iustice against vs. God long preserue her Maiestie, and her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Counsayle: confound Antichriste and his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, and giue all faithfull Subiectes, the grace to beare true and loyall mindes, to God, their Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>Let this suffise thée (gentle Reader) at this time: and if thou desirest to be more acquainted with their Romish and Sathanicall inglinges, reade my <hi>English Romaine lyfe,</hi> which so soone as it can be printed, shall be set foorth. And thus committing thée to the God of all trueth, who giue vs the grace to cleaue to the Trueth: I byd thée hartelie farewell.</p>
