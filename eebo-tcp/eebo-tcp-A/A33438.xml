            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>CHEYNEL</hi> is <hi>Bedlam</hi> seven stories high, or Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his gowty leg wire-drawn: His head is shot up, as if it would only converse with the Prince oth'aire, and what we mistake for the man ith'moon is but a peece of him. Hee's an <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> in the largest folio, or was intended for hoopes for the tun at <hi>Heidelberg</hi>; you may take him for the 119 <hi>Psalm,</hi> lasting the execution of a whol Universitie, or the Pinacle from which the Devill would break the neck of it. 'Tis a sufficient argument of <hi>Cromwells</hi> death to see this May-pole set up in Oxford. <hi>Dido,</hi> with his hide, might have had ground enough for her Carthage without slicing it into leashes. Hee's a monopoly of Steeples, and as often as he sounds, the bell goes out for some deceas't Scholar. Babels are erected for confusion.</p>
            <p>His red Nose is pearch't like a Beacon flaming on a mountain; Nature when she forged it, forgot to quench it: <hi>Web</hi> surrendred to it for a flag of defiance; <hi>Inkersell</hi> for a red Lattice, and only submitted to an Ale-house. The Scarlet-whore of Babylon spawn'd it with her menstruous profluviums. 'Twas painted with the blood of a witch when shee morgag'd her selfe. The single sight of it made <hi>Sedgewick</hi> dream of doomes-day and the second destruction of the world by fire. Such vessels are broach't when Villanes ratifie their Conspiracies in Sacraments of Blood. If there bee such an <hi>AEtna</hi> such a <hi>Purgatory</hi> aloofe, what's the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogorgon</hi>
the Hell ith' Center?</p>
            <p>The spirits which ascend from so hot a Limbeck have conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his braines to Sulphur, and made him nothing but an unruly Squib: Hee's as prodigiously furious, as if he had been bolted out oth' Monks pot when he invented gunpowder, or his mother limed by the Devill shot from a Canon. He was begot ith' Dog-dayes, or at Michaelmas when his Dam went to Rut. The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuba</hi>
when she conceiv'd this <hi>Paris</hi> dream't of wild-fire: His Nurse was a bleare ey'd Hound, <hi>Run-wood,</hi> and his native soyle th' <hi>Antipodes</hi> to <hi>Anticyra.</hi> His Syre engendred him in an Itch beyond the cure oth' brimstone which ruin'd Sodom. You may take him for a Spanish-Jennet, begot by a whirlewind or a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest raised by a Conjurer, or all <hi>AEolus</hi> bag'd up and sold by a Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42768:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for shipwracks; he ruminates on nothing but his <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
Chaines, and his breaking loose from 'em, and therefore 'tis his continuall businesse either to imprison or expell. Yet <hi>Mahomets</hi>
disease must be a divine rapture; in his paralytick fit, he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with his <hi>Gabriell.</hi> Shuffle him with the rest oth' visitors, and hee comes forth like mad <hi>Orestes</hi> switchd on by furies to kill his mother the <hi>Vniversity.</hi> Brutish <hi>Ajax</hi> because hee's a beast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe wallowes i'th gore of his fellow Greekes and thinkes 'em swine. The Caniball swears Mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mie's Bacon: he differs from an ordinary <hi>Tom</hi> of <hi>Bedlam,</hi> as a wild <hi>Wolfe</hi> from a tame one, or Rome on fire from <hi>Neroes</hi> Fiddle. Sure hee's don quicksotted, takes the Colledge for an inchanted Castle, the fellowes for Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, <hi>Web, Inkersell,</hi> and <hi>Lownds,</hi> for three distressed damsells. Hee sweepes the house cleane that his Fairy tennants may dance to him with mony, his phrensy flames higher because 'tis sprinkled with a little reason, as woemen paint themselves into wrincles and uglinesse. His blood rides the round post, or dances the Morrice through him, and so makes him giddy. His skull is a meer nest of hornets, which sting into him their own waspishnesse. This makes the mad bandog snap at all hee meets. This new Judge (without the Kings writ) is the prime Bencher at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation but usually removed at the execution, and kills with his weekely bill as secretly as the Plague: Still like a mad dog which (they say) never barkes. Hee wounds at farther distance than the starres influence can blesse: this long boared murdering peece will carry destruction point blank from <hi>Petworth</hi> to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. Cheynell</hi> in a University out rifles <hi>Cromwell</hi> in an Abby. The Divill is busiest ith' Church. Pickhatch nere was visited; Turne-Bull-Streete needs no reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cheynell</hi> among the visitors, is a mountebanke extraordinary with 4 zanyes, or blustring <hi>AEolus</hi> with his Cardinall winds. This purger is the only scammony; the rest somewhat milder simples, <hi>Rhubarbe</hi> and <hi>Sena,</hi> one indeed is all hony and manna dropt from heaven, but kept till 'tis mouldy and stinkes. This Sugar-Cane, this Posset, and Cawdle visitor; with his marmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade quagmire, his blather'd puffe-past, liquorish <hi>Kate Subs</hi> the second, are the Universities tooth drawers, and will leave no more Schollars then themselves have gummes. These Figs and Almonds rot the Universitie, while <hi>Cheynell</hi> like <hi>aqua fortis</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes it. And yet that Cormorant can bee dainty too: Doctors
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42768:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Seniors are too tough for continuall cramming, he must have Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers of art and Rabets, under-graduats and Chickens; master com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners and Phesants. <hi>Domitian</hi> gorg'd with men, wantons with flies afterwards. He runs himselfe off his legs the first daies journey, and like a Brewer tuns once a weeke. Though he rides post yet he must have his stages: the dismallest Tragedy is cantell'd into Acts, sure he hath got the mathematicall trick to make so many Turkes, and then by his hocus pocus Arithmetick, juggle them over board; yet the visitors like their harbinger the last new disease, murder the best. Among <hi>Moores</hi> blacks are the only beauties: <hi>Cheynell</hi> good Church-man (like Alters) protects the guilty only; hee thinkes others breath corrupted when 'tis but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected rancour of his own; like <hi>Senecaes</hi> wifes foole, struck with a sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine blindnesse, imputed it to the darkenesse of the roome: You would scarce believe he should have any Proselites but that some have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipt <hi>Cacodemons</hi>; and Asses yet kneele to <hi>Mahomet</hi>: Durt will submit to bee trampled on; good ingenious soules confesse themselves suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently vicious &amp; are thought worthy heaven because they boast no merit. But <hi>Cheynell</hi> admits them as Politicians do Jewes to use their villanies, or <hi>Romulus</hi> his Asylum Courtiers to Lord over them; else why should the Muscovite worship painted images and reject carv'd ones? why should my Lady expose her child and nurse her dog, bee divorc't from her Lord, and wanton with her Catamite Monkey? But alas a slip may breake a sober mans neck, while drunkards tumble and have no hurt. A privy-councellor is scarce secure in his dreame: My Lord of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke</hi>
and <hi>Archy</hi> can never speake Treason. Ugly cubs are most lick't, and the Changling's still the dilling: In Martyrdomes the best must to the stake; and who so fit to bee Pilgrims as the holy? if their bee any left in the hive it will be the drones; <hi>Cheynells</hi> thirst draines the liquour, the lees would choake him. Thus of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> characters, the vices only survive, the vertues are expelld the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cheynell</hi> and Doctor <hi>Baily</hi> differ as the Colledge good and bad <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>us, as a wisard and a prophet, or the dipt horse in Cornewall and a Christian. Hee succeeds the Doctor as <hi>Caligula's</hi> horse did the deceased Senatour, or as the Apocrypha doth the old Testament, and <hi>Tobie</hi> and his dog, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>; thus Innocents day pursues <hi>Christmas,</hi> a damnd massacre at the heeles of a blest nativity; nor can <hi>Herod</hi> perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute innocence without murthering St. <hi>Iohn's,</hi> every meale hee carves the President, at every course the Baptists head is dish't for him, and yet (unlesse the Merchant-taylors prove almoners) perhaps hee may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourd by his Colledgiate vermine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42768:4"/>Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> lookes like <hi>Scevaes</hi> sheild, so many expel'd peeces so many wounds 'tis reformd into it's primitive purity and turnd into the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists desart: The whole University resembles Greece over-run by Turkes, or Italy Goth'd and Vandald, it lookes like the world purged by a deluge, and destruction. <hi>Delos</hi> is turnd errant at <hi>Apolloes</hi> death, as it was at his birth. Colledges are converted into Hospitalls, lodges for diseases, scall'd heads and crutches, 'tis the only expulsive crime heere to bee wholesome.</p>
            <p>For how should <hi>Cheynell</hi> be a reformer, unlesse as an Atheist makes a Pope pious? as winter brings the Halcyon, or dead beere makes <hi>Aqua vitae</hi>: Hee is a strainer, retaines all the dreggs, and clarifies the University as milke and whites of eggs doth Ippocras; thus sinkes, and common shoares are the best scavengers, durt is somtimes a good fuller, and filthy Soap the only Lawndresse, miraculous <hi>Cheynell</hi>! Clay and Spittle shall bee a collyrium for the Kingdomes eye.</p>
            <p>Hee hath sullyed the University and will huckster in washing it; the mountebank gives out it is poysoned, that hee may quack in curing it. Thus <hi>Oxford,</hi> like the house of office at Westminster, is voted to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by those who fould it.</p>
            <p>But perhaps man must still forfeit paradise for too much knowledge; and Scholars perish (like the old Bishop) for discerning the visitors to be Truth's and the Law's Antipodes. Is the University <hi>Pim'd,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must change shifts, or are men turnd out (like the Israelites out of Egipt) for being scabby? Because <hi>Cheynell</hi> itches, must all smart? The Pope excommunicates the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> on one day, and restores him the next, <hi>Cheynell</hi> hath his Maundy Thursday, but the good-Friday's Popery. Extremes may concenter, <hi>Rolfe</hi> and a <hi>Iesuite</hi> are both <hi>Ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacks; Cheynell</hi> and Captaine <hi>Allen</hi> (his blasphemous adversaries second) can covenant in mischifes, as humiliations and thanks-givings conspire to ruine the Kingdome, or Naseby field and the Butchers dog to worry <hi>Skippon.</hi> But hee would have us mistake a hang-man for an Angell, and kisse his lightning, because it comes from Heaven. Indeede hee goes to Church but (like the Divill) 'tis to tempt: each prayer devours a widdowed Colledge, each bead pistolls a Schollar: hee never preaches but 'tis the Universities funerall Sermon, his doctrines and motives are meere proscriptions, and hee'l murder a whole Colledge with a use of consolation; his reformation hath got him more then the worke of 10 talents got <hi>Aristotle,</hi> this one word hath cost more then would have purchased the Sibills bookes and Prophet too. Beggers sell their ulcers at the rate of Diamonds; but though hee excommunicates, it must
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42768:4"/>
bee still the Pope and his holinesse: 'Tis his faith removes the University, as the publique faith the silver mountaines of Guild-hall, and <hi>Xerxes</hi> leveld <hi>Athos</hi> through the worlds credulitie. But this Kennell-raker, this Jaques-farmer is durty only on weeke-dayes. O the Sanctity of a sunday pudding! And yet perhaps the Sabaticall river is no better then prophane Isis. Turks have their Saboth, and not only a monthly fast, but a fast for a moneth. But <hi>Cheynell</hi> is a double Turke; Captaine <hi>Prestor Franck</hi> is both Muftie and Aga too.</p>
            <p>Thus is <hi>Oxford</hi> at last reform'd into an <hi>Algeers</hi> haunted by Pirates, where Janizaries are the only favorites: What to others is an inquisition, is to these a shrift. These are the only converts, because the only sinners: Some are expell'd for just oathes, others are dandled for lowd perjurie; like the Priest that lost his benefice for having a wife, and was retrived when shee was proved his whore. But <hi>Cheynell</hi> (like <hi>Romulus</hi>) is the sonne of heaven; when no man will own the brat, a God must father it. Hee's a libell and an ordinance; hath never a Sire, and yet perhaps a hundred: His mother sure hacknied herselfe to one of the guard, or the great porter on a maske night, and so conceiv'd this hipocrite: Had hee kept within his pulpit the lower part of the Minotaure might have skulkt undiscovered, but when hee would bee a bastard president too, a <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi> Doctor <hi>Baylie</hi> (like <hi>Alexander,</hi> ambitious to bee a God) hee proved himselfe a by-blow.</p>

               <hi>Cheynell,</hi> with his precious Triumvirats <hi>Web, Inkersell</hi> and <hi>Lownds,</hi> thinks himself the Emperor with his three spirituall Electors, or the Pope with his triple Crown; Hee lookes like wilde <hi>March</hi> borrowing three dayes of <hi>February.</hi> These are forsooth the 3 children (or <hi>Plutoes</hi> 3 furies) whom no flames can blister. All 3 are oth' progeny of <hi>Noah,</hi> drunke: Their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers longed for wort, they were borne in a brew-house, and christned in a Stand of Ale. They are only 3 Sponges possest, and submit to the upper and lower houses, as representatives of the Buttery and Seller. Certainly they are entertaind for Gospellers, because they have drunke away their Bibles. I might as well say <hi>Inkersell</hi> were a Nightingale, because hee hath lost his tongue. Moths and Wormes are acquainted with more Authors, and Parrots are better linguists. Latin's not the language of these Beasts, nor have they any thing of <hi>Greece,</hi> but drunkennesse and lying. Hebrew to them is Welch, they reele sufficiently of themselves, they need not study to go backward. Their Soules are blankes sufficient to write new mod'led Preachers in. <hi>Tiresias</hi> could not foresee any thing til he was blind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inkersell</hi> has one property of a Scholar, Poverty. You would take him for country-<hi>Tom</hi> broke loose from the Gallowes. If a man bee a Tree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed, hee's Beggars-bush. He was borne in Lent at a coursing, and sent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42768:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into the world with sippets. Hee's sunke below the wardrobe of dunghills, and the use of paper-mills. He must tick with <hi>Charon,</hi> and have his Epitaph writ in chalk. By his maggot-eaten face, you would swear he had been ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out on's grave with all his worms about him to bait Eele-hookes. You may compare <hi>Cheynell</hi> to the Chymists <hi>aqua Stygia,</hi> and him to their <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra damnata.</hi> Hee'l shortly be a Baptist without a voice, and wheases alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as if he fed on nothing but Locusts and Grashoppers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cheynell</hi> and <hi>Web</hi> looke like <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his Pigeon, or my Lord of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> and <hi>Michaell Oldsworth.</hi> Had every bird their feathers of him, he would be oth' same callow livery with <hi>Inkersell</hi>: hee hates all bookes because he is so much ith' mercers; and without a strong antidote will die of gall and Coperas: hee's as much in Ink as <hi>Inkersell</hi> in chalke, the one is all in mourning, the other is in his winding-sheete: his brother &amp; he drink duells, yet both, like their thirst, are still immortall; though the Sea they have drunke would have made stage enough for the battle of <hi>Lepanto</hi>: Yet his brother may bee dead drunke at last, hee lookes like <hi>Tiffany</hi> already; brimstone and hell will have him shortly, 'Tis fit the Souldier should conquer especially in bowsing combats: But our <hi>Mars</hi> must have his <hi>Venus,</hi> and his salt Nancy newly duck't lookes like the Sea-born goddesse. <hi>Cheynell</hi> cannot expell him farther then <hi>Bocardo,</hi> nor any Colledge so fit for him, as where <hi>Cheynell's</hi>
President, and who but those Goale-birds were ever bribed to christen him so? What basenesse would submit to the scorne of Prisoners? Who would be slave to a penny ballad?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lownds</hi> submitted to <hi>Cheynel's Sanguine promontory</hi> for feare of a bloody Nose; he may be steered with any rudder: You may hang in a single threed and use him instead of a bobin to weave Bone-lace: This rabbet sucker would submit to a ferret, and is scarce fit to bee a fellow of a Warren: hee would adore a reformer though hee were a Chimny-sweeper, and goe bare to <hi>Pidgeon</hi> as willingly as to <hi>Cheynell</hi>: A well grown spider might bee his President, <hi>Whittingtons</hi> Cat a Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> over him. Hee cannot go a high lone yet, but is carried on his fathers sleeve like a faulkoners Hawk; hee'll damme himselfe least hee should bee whipt, and bee perjurd because his father hath covenanted, like the fellow who would not bee a Christian because all his friends were gone to hell before him.</p>
            <p>O that Lice should bee humane off-springs as well as men! but the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest mothers may have abortions. The Kings Image is sometimes stampt on lead, and natures mint coynes monsters; as this Ostracisme proves the University a true Athens, so some Apastates makes her a Heaven.</p>
