         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O All ye people, Profeſſors and Prieſts of the world,
and to all others every where, who have an eye to
ſee, and an ear to hear, high and low, rich or poor,
of what ſort of profeſſion ſoever, whether Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,
Independents, Baptiſts, or by what other by-name
known or diſtinguiſhed, who are ſeeking the Kingdome of
heaven in outward obſervations, Loe here, and loe there, in
this duty, and this daies obſervation, or in the other perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
(as you call them:) Be it known unto you all, from
the Lord, that you are out of the way it is not to be found
there, for the Kingdome of God comes not with outward
obſervations, neither ſhall they ſay any longer, loe here, or
loe there, for the Kingdome of heaven is within; So ſaid
Chriſt Jeſus to the Phariſees who were ſeeking the Kingdom
without in outward obſervations, ſo ſay I to you, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by the ſpirit of the ſame Chriſt Jeſus, whom your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſlew and hung upon a tree; for your new Moons, and
Sabbaths, your calling of your Solemne, and your appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Faſts and Feaſts, my ſoul loaths, they are even an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
unto me ſaith the Lord, for your hands are full of
blood and cruelty, even the blood of the innocent cryeth in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114825:3"/>
mine ears, whom ye like your fathers have ſhamefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
and crucified, and hung upon a tree, and yet are
profeſſing his words, whom they ſlew, and their words, who
witneſſed him, and preach'd him, and your ſelves found in
the ſame practiſe with them who crucified the juſt one, and
requir'd to let looſe the murtherer, yet ready many of you
to ſay, as they of old did, if we had lived in thoſe daies, we
would not have done ſo wickedly: Oh what think ye will
be in the end hereof; when the juſt God ſhall come to call
you to an accompt for all this, do you think getting his
words, and their words, to profeſs and talk of, will ſave
you from the wrath to come, who are deſpiſers and haters
of their life, both in your ſelves and others, where he is made
manifeſt, and are ſcoffers and ſcorners at them who do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it, (calling them in deriſion) <hi>Quakers,</hi> and yet make
a profeſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, and <hi>Davids</hi> words, and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuks</hi>
Propheſie, and <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, who all witneſſed
Quaking; ye Hypocrites, ſearch the Scriptures and ſee,
whether ye are not in their ſteps, who deſpiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> Law,
and made Songs of <hi>David,</hi> and mock'd, and ſlew the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and perſecuted <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſton'd <hi>Stephen,</hi> which bare
witneſs to and for the Lord, and againſt your Idol Temples,
and yet make profeſſion of their words; to the light in all

fooliſh and ſlow of heart, to believe all that the Prophets

your Forefathers of old did, ſo do ye; ſearch the Scriptures

they that killeth you, ſhall think they do God ſervice; and
this will they do unto you for my name ſake becauſe they
have neither known me nor my father, ſee if ye be not they;
and if this be not ſo, O ye prieſts, profeſſors and people,
who deny the Revelation of Chriſt, and ſay all Revelation
is ceas'd and that none muſt expect Revelation now, are ye
not ſuch as the Scriptures (which in words ye profeſs, but in
life and power deny) witneſſeth againſt, to know neither
the Father, nor the Son? and no marvel ye are found in ſuch
practiſes, which he whom we have receiv'd, and do bear
witneſs of foretold, and in thoſe daies declar'd of; and ſo
the Scriptures are owned &amp; witneſſed unto by us, who are in
the life or them, and in the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of
him of whom they declare; as alſo do bear witneſſe againſt
you, who have the words declared, but are found enemies to

the life, and in the ſame practiſes with them, who had <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and the Prophets, which declar'd and propheſied of him
to come; but when he came, and was made manifeſt, would
not own him, nor receive him, but rejected him, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
him, who was the life of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets

Fathers, they would not have ſlain the Prophets that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied
of his coming; and ye now in theſe daies, be ye
witneſſes againſt your ſelves, even of the ſame generation,
who have not only their words who propheſied of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but ſay he is come, and have his words, and their words,
who wrought and witneſſed him come, to profeſs, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſay, had we been in their daies, we would not have
done ſo wickedly, nor cruelly; and yet ye your ſelves doing
the ſame thing, even perſecuting, and evilly entreating them,
who now witneſs him come, who is the end of the Law and
the Prophets, Chriſt Jeſus the righteous, whom ye crucifie;
and thinkeſt thou this, O man, who condemneſt another,
and doeſt the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgements of
God, or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his grace, long-ſuffering
and patience, not knowing that the goodneſs of God ſhould
lead thee to repentance: Oh what vvill ye do in the end
hereof, oh ye people, profeſſors and prieſts, who are groap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the dark even at noon day, vvhen repentance ſhall be
hid from your eyes, vvho vvill not ovvn him, nor receive
him, to lead you unto it, vvho is the light of the vvorld, and

prove you ever for your evil deeds, and that his ſpirit ſhall

will ye thus reject and contemn the Lord your Maker,
and ſtill go on to ſlander the footſteps of his Annointed, and
think to eſcape and proſper? notwithſtanding all this, are
ye not they who ſay in your hearts, We will none of this man

our own hearts, adding drunkenneſſe unto thirſt, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe

to obſerve a day to him, and come and pretend to bow and

on ſuch a people as this, who provoke me daily to my
face, notwithſtanding all my reproofs, but hate my reproofs,
and caſt my Laws behind their backs and ſay in their hearts,
We will not have this man to rule, even my Son, whom I
have ſent a light into the world, whom they (as their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
of old) crucifie and ſlay, and ſhed the innocent
blood in their land, even the ſtreets of their great City, which
ſpiritually is called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where our Lord is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
as well as at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to the light in all your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
I ſpeak, which will let you ſee, is it not ſo? deceive
not your ſelves; Can any do thus and be ſaved? Can any
kick and ſpurn againſt him and not be confounded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed?
Can any reject him, and he not grind them to

and thighs of braſs, legs of iron, feet part of iron, and part

and none ſhall be able to deliver it out of my hands, ſaith the
Lord; for <hi>Babylon</hi> the great is come up into remembrance

doctrines, ſaying, the Lord hath ſaid it, when of a truth I
never ſpake to them, nor never ſent them at all; therefore
have they not profited my people at all, but have taken of
my wooll, and of my flax, and of my wine and my oyl, and
of my kine, and of my ſheep, and have ſpent it on her luſts,
and her lovers; but now am I coming to require theſe things
at her hands, and I will ſtrip her naked and bare, even ſhe
who hath ſaid in her heart, <hi>I ſit as a Queen, and ſhall ſee no
ſorrow;</hi> ſorrow and miſery, Widdowhood and loſſe of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſhall come upon her in one day, and all her lovers with
whom ſhe hath played the harlot ſhall not ſave nor deliver
her out of my hands, ſaith the Lord, your righteous Judge,
who judgeth not for gifts nor rewards, but will plead the
cauſe of the innocent, and him that hath no helper in the
earth, and will recompence double into her boſome, even
for all the blood of the innocent that have been ſhed in the
midſt of her, even blood double, even till it come up to the
horſe bridles; and happy ſhall he be, that taketh <hi>Babilons</hi>
brats, and daſh out their brains againſt the ſtones, for ſhe
is come up into remembrance before me, ſaith the Lord, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſhe who hath made all the kindreds of the earth drunk
with the cup of her fornication, and all the Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Governours and Rulers of the earth, hath committed
inceſt and fornication with her, and the blood of my Saints
have been ſhed by them in the midſt of her; therefore ſhall
ſhe receive blood to drink, for ſhe is worthy, even the dregs
of the cup of my fury that will I wring out unto her, ſaith
the Lord, ſhall ſhe drink of, and ſhall ſpue, and fal, and never
riſe more; and they that have committed fornication with
her and her lovers, and her Merchants, and ſuch as have had
traffique with her by Sea, and all occupiers of ſhips behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſhall ſtand afar off, crying, Alas, alas, for that great
City, which was the glory of the whole earth, wherein was
ſo much traffique for gold and ſilver, and needle works, and
diamonds, and pearles, and precious ſtones, and ſilks, and
velvets, and ſcarlets, and fine linnen, and all manner of
broidered works, and whisks, and vails, and neck-laces, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114825:5"/>
powderings, and criſpings, and platings, for in one day is
her torment come upon her, and the ſmoak thereof ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
up for ever and ever: And do ye think the profeſſing
of theſe words will cover ye, O ye prieſts, profeſſors and
people; or that by your meanings, conceivings, or private
interpretations ye can put them off from you; or that ye are
not meant and concern'd in them, who are found in her pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes,
and doing her ſervice, and become as a pander unto
her, to uſher in her wickedneſſe, by denying the light which
lighteth every man that cometh into the world, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
the world of ſin, and ſheweth it plainly that theſe
things are not of God, but of the devil, envy, lying, and
ſwearing, and drunkenneſſe, and whoredome, and pride, and
vanity, and prodigality, by which the Merchants of the earth
are waxen rich and fat, and are become valiant and ſtrong,
to reproach the living God, and ſlander the footſteps of his
Annointed; and are ye not found in ſuch practiſes, O ye
prieſts, profeſſors, and people, let the light in all your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
anſwer? is it not ſo? What mean ye thus to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Lord? Will ye ſet bryars and thorns in battel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, ſaith the Lord, ſhall I not even paſſe thorough
them, and conſume ye together? or will ye Potſherds of the
earth ſtill ſtrive againſt your Maker? Shall I not daſh ye to
pieces like a potters veſſel, and rule ye with my iron rod? O
ye Kings and Rulers of the earth, who are joyned together
againſt the Lord, and againſt his Annointed, whom ye evilly
entreat, and deſpitefully uſe for my Name ſake, ſaith the
Lord, ſaying, <hi>Come let us joyn together to root out the name of
Iſrael from under heaven; let us break his bands aſunder, and
caſt his cords from us, for we will not have this man to rule over
us; come, let us ſell him into</hi> Egypt, <hi>let us make strong Lawes
and binding against him, ſo we may caſt him into priſon, and into
dungeons, &amp; drive him into dens and caves of the earth, even to root
out the name of</hi> Iſrael <hi>from under heaven, for</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall not go
free,</hi> ſaith proud <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Gods enemy; but he that ſitteth
in heaven laugheth your conſultations to ſcorn, and hath
you in deriſion: O ye Kings and Rulers of the earth, ſerve
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114825:6"/>
the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling; kiſſe the
Son, leſt he be angry, and ye periſh in the mid way, if his
wrath be kindled but a little; bleſſed are all they that put
their truſt in him, for this hath the Lord determined, even
to exalt and ſet his King upon his holy hill of Zion, who
ſhall rule the Nations in his anger with a rod of iron, and
ſhall daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel, for all thoſe
mine enemies, ſaith he, that will not that I ſhall rule over
them, ſhall be ſlain by the edge of the Sword, for the mouth
of the Lord hath ſpoken it, and it ſhall be accompliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your heads; for the Lord God is not a man that he ſhould
lie, or as the Son of man that he ſhould repent, but what he
hath decreed ſhall ſuddenly come to paſſe; and who is he
that ſhall dare to withſtand him, and ſay, why doſt thou ſo?
wherefore hear, O ye Kings, and be inſtructed, O ye Rulers
of the earth; break off your ſins betimes by repentance, and
your iniquities, by ſhewing compaſſion on the poor, leſt I
come upon you in my fury as an armed man, and cut you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder,
and ſweep you away with the beeſome of Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and there be none to deliver you out of my hands, ſaith
the Lord; for this will be the portion of their cup, vvho
vvill not be guided and counſelled by me in their life-time;
but running a-vvhoring from me after other gods, which
have eyes and ſee not, ears and hear not, neither have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
at all, they who make them are like unto them, and
ſo are all thoſe that put their truſt in them; therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what you are a doing, you who make unrighteous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
and eſtabliſh iniquity by a law to oppreſs the poor,
and the innocent, and to grind the face of the fatherleſſe,
even the fatherleſſe, the widdow, and the ſtranger, and him
that hath no helper in the earth; for I ſee you, ſaith the
Lord, and behold all your thoughts and purpoſes, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in ſecret, and I will declare them openly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them openly, and ye ſhall be aſhamed and conſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for all your wickedneſſe againſt me, ſaith the Lord, and
all your private determinations againſt my holy ones, my
holy ſeed, the lot of mine inheritance, ſaith the Lord, who
hath loved them, and given my ſelf for them, to redeem
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114825:6"/>
them unto my ſelf for ever, and none ſhall pluck them out
of my hand, nor out of my fathers hand, for my father is
ſtronger then all; I and my father am one, wherefore in the
dread and power of God I warn you, to take heed what ye
do, and what ye plot and contrive againſt the innocent, for
the Lord is their helper, leſt ye be found fighters againſt
God, but let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go free, that he may do ſervice, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Lord his God in the wilderneſs, for to that end hath
he cauſed me to write unto you, O ye Rulers of the earth,
leſt ye be made as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for the hardneſs of your hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my choſen, who is the meek of the earth, againſt
whom no weapon formed ſhall proſper, but ſhall return e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as a dart to pierce through the liver of him that formed
it, for <hi>Iſrael</hi> is my battel axe and weapon of war, with
which I'le daſh the mountains to pieces, and ſcatter them as
duſt before the whirl-wind of mine indignation, which ſhall
blow upon the wicked, till they be utterly conſumed from off
the face of the earth; thus ſhall it be done unto all that will
not that I ſhall raign, and that my Son ſhall rule, whom I
have ſent a light into the world, to lighten them that ſit in
darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, and to guide their
feet into the way of peace; wherefore prepare to meet thy
God, O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with faſting, and weeping, and mourning,
by putting away thine iniquities from before mine eyes, ſaith
the Lord, ceaſe from doing evil, learn to do well, come then,
and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, <hi>though thy ſins
were as crimſon, I would make them as white as wool, and though
they were as ſcarlet, yet would I make them as white as ſmow;</hi>
and if thou wouldſt return, my mercy would I not utterly
take away from thee, nor ſuffer my truth to fail; but if thou
wilt not return, thou muſt be deſtroyed, both thou and thy
King; wherefore conſider your wayes and doings, O ye
prieſts, profeſſors, and people, do ye think a profeſſion of his
words, who is the life, will ſave you from wrath to come,
who are enemies to his light and life, and will not have him
to rule and raign in you, and over you, who is the way to the
Father, and to his knowledge, whom to know is life eternal,
and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent? And do ye think ever
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114825:7"/>
to come to the knowledge of him, O ye prieſts, profeſſors,
and people, who are talking and profeſſing of ſerving God
in his own way, and that ſuch as will have Chriſt, muſt have
him in his own way, and on his own terms, and it will not
own him the way, even the way of his own appointment, the
light; Doth not the Scriptures, ye profeſſors, declare it?
or doth it ſay it ſelf is it? or is there another way then what
it declareth of, or another name given whereby the ſons of
men can be ſaved? what mean ye that ye thus oppoſe the
Lord and his way? are ye ſtronger then he? hath he not
ſaid he'l no longer be ſerved and worſhipped in Temples
made with mens hands, and will ye ſtill be ſerving him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his mind hands, and will, and yet profeſs to ſerve and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him in his own way? hath he not ſaid, that he dwelleth
not in temples made with hands, and will ye be ſtill ſeeking
of him there, notwithſtanding all this? Hath he not invited
and called upon all to come unto him, that they might have
life? and will ye be ſeekign life in the Scriptures for all this?
hath he not ſaid the Kingdome of heaven cometh not with
outward obſervances? and will ye remain ſtill ſeeking of it
in thoſe things; and yet be telling the people, and profeſſing
that God muſt be ſerved and worſhipped in his own way,
and yet ſeek to keep people in your own wayes? are ye not
deceitful, and deceivers of the people who do thus? ye are
obſerving daies and moneths, and times, and years: are ye
not ſtill carnal? ye eat and drink, but are ye not ſtill empty
and a thirſt? ye pray-and faſt, but receive not, for ye ask a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,
to ſpend it on your luſts; ye obſerve daies, and divers
watchings, and carnal Ordinances, but are the comers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
made perfect, as pertaining to the conſcience? ye cry
out, <hi>The Temples of the Lord, the Ordinances of the Lord, the
Church of Chriſt, the Ordinances of Chriſt;</hi> but which of you
is come to witneſſe your bodies to be the Temple of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt? or that you are made fit Temples for the Spirit of

the Church of the Firſt born, which is in God the Father of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Pillar and ground of truth; but
on the contrarie, ye profeſs, teach and ſay, none can, or

preſerve your bodies, temples for the devil, and not Chriſt,
(whileſt here) for Chriſts Temple is holie, and ye ſay, none

unholie, and their bodies Temples of ſin; this Doctrine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the devil well, and he loves you for it and will let you
profeſſe (to ſerve God in Gods way) and profeſs Chriſts
Church, ſay you are Chriſts Miniſters, ſo he may but keep
you to be his Temples, and Church, and Miniſters ſtill, and
thruſt Chriſt out of rule and dominion; <hi>for he that commits
ſin is of the devil,</hi> and his ſervants ye are, to whom ye yield
your members ſervants to obey, whether of ſin unto death,
or of obedience unto life; O fooliſh, and exceedinglie blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Scriptures, and where he is thus come and witneſſed, who
changeth Ordinances and Laws, and watchings, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of daies, and times, and moneths, and years, and

ſeriouſlie, is it not ſo with you as with them of the ſame
generation of old? to the light in all your conſciences I
ſpeak: Do ye think a profeſſion of theſe things, and a boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theſe things, will ſerve your turns any more then it
did your Forefathers of old, from whom God was departed
and removed, who became perſecutors of the life of his Son
in his Saints? are ye not found in the ſteps of thoſe evil huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen,
who ſay, behold the heir, let us kill him, and the
inheritance ſhall be ours? and are ye ſo blind and bewitched
by the god of this vvorld, to think, that ye ſhall eſcape their
puniſhment? will ye ſtill preach and profeſs their words,
vvho vvitneſſed Chriſt vvithin the end of the Lavv, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Ordinances, the obſervations, the Sabbaths and beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rudiments of the world, and cauſe the Croſs of Chriſt to

ceaſe, through your traditions? vvill ye ſtill be found thus
fighters againſt God in his Saints; vvho novv vvitneſs forth
the ſame, and cannot ſubmit unto thoſe things vvhich he
hath redeemed and purchaſed them out of, even vvith his
ovvn precious blood, and are made to vvitneſs againſt them,
and your idol Worſhipps, and crie, you have a Lavv; will
your Lavv think you excuſe you in his ſight, vvho ſeeth you,
your vvaies, and actions againſt him and his; nay, nay, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not your ſelves God will not be mocked, for ſuch as
you ſow, ſuch ſhall you reap; if ye ſow to the fleſh, think
ye, ſhall ye not of the fleſh reap corruption; but if ye ſow
to the ſpirit, of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting. Seriouſlie ſit
down, and weigh, and conſider, is pride, vanitie, luſt of the
fleſh, idleneſs fulneſs of bread, lying, ſwearing drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
covetouſneſs, deceipt, back-biting, emulation, ſtrife,
quarrelling, fighting, reviling, ſlandering, evil ſpeaking,
whiſpering, halling out of Synagogues, or Steeple-houſes,
mocking, ſtocking, impriſoning, cruel and evil entreating,
fruits of the Spirit? or did ever ſuch as witneſſed the Spirit
of God bring forth ſuch fruits? nay, nay, who witneſſed
the Spirit of Chriſt, never were found in ſuch practiſes;
ſearch and ſee in the Scriptures, in which ye think to find e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
life, where ever any of the Saints of Chriſt (who were
poſſeſſors, and not profeſſors) brought forth ſuch fruits;
and can ye think, or are ye ſo far blinded by the devil, to
believe ye ſhall be ſaved by profeſſing their words, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to their life, and led and guided by another ſpirit, then
that which they witneſſed to be guided and led by; or dare
ye ſay, that the Spirit of Chriſt is changed now from what it
was then, as ſome of ye do, if not all, that Revelation is
ceas'd now, and that none muſt expect Revelation now,
and ſo are deniers your ſelves of the Scriptures ye profeſs:
Nay, nay, it will not ſerve your turns, ye cannot deceive the
Lord, though ye have long deceived men; with the light
ye are ſeen and comprehended, and the Tree judged of by
his fruits: Is it the Spirit of the Lord that leads you into
thoſe things? what means your pride and vanitie in appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114825:8"/>
your exceſs in eating and drinking, &amp; rioting, and ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the day time, your chambering and wantonneſs, your
idle talk and fooliſh jeſting, and laughter, which is madneſs
and follie, your lying one to another, and deceipt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reaching
one another in your dealings and commerce,
and Merchandize one with another, and fighting, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling,
and going to Law, and ſwearing: O ye prieſts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
and people, are theſe the fruits of Chriſts Spirit? or
did ever any who were ſo guided, act thus; and except ye
come to be guided by his Spirit, O ye profeſſors of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
ye are none of his, profeſs what ye will; for whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his;
and know ye not that Chriſt Jeſus is in you, except ye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates;
and they that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh
with the affections and luſts: Are ye ſo ſottiſhlie blinded by
the God of this world, to believe and imagine that ye are
Chriſts, who are in the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes,
and the pride of life, faſhioning your ſelves according to the
vanities of your minds, after the converſation of this world,
after the deceiveable luſts, fulfilling the deſires of the wil &amp; of
the mind, being children of wrath, and yet imagine your
ſelves children of God: Did ever any of the Saints do thus,
or take the children of Gods words to profeſs and cover
over themſelves withal, whoſe adorning was not after the
faſhions of the world, in the outward adorning as of plait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and powdering the hair, of gold and ſilver, and coſtly
Array, but their adorning was in the hidden man of the
heart, even a meek and quiet ſpirit, which in the ſight of
God is of great price; and are you ſo blind to think theſe
words will cover you, who are found contrarie to their life?
or do you think that the holie womens of old, their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
decent attire mixt with gravitie, ſobrietie, and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and a quiet ſpirit, ſuch as accompanies holineſs of life

this according to holineſs of life and converſation; which the

I ſpeak, which will let you ſee, that many of you are
farther off from God, then you were many years ago, when
it may be ye made not ſo large a ſhow of profeſſion as now,
and are ye not then hypocrites, hypt above that which then
convinced you of the evil of it, and of them that walked in
ſuch things, and ſo become worſe, inſtead of witneſſing a
growth in grace, which the Saints of old did? and are not
theſe things to be found amongſt you, O ye prieſts, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,

manners; for if any come to you who are guided by the
good manners, Chriſts manners, which is without reſpect to
perſons, and ſpeak thee or thou, the Scripture language, to
any ſingle perſon whatſoever; are ye not ready to deride
them, or thruſt them out of doors, if not worſe, or ſay its
filthy language, and methinks ye may have better manners;
or if a man come to ſpeak to ſome of you with his hat on,
and not doff it, becauſe he dare not act contrarie to
Chriſts manners, nor follow the vain cuſtomes of the world?
are ye not ready to deride him, or ſtrike him, or caſt him
into priſon and ſay he may lie there till he learn better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;

and ſo ye manifeſt your ſelves to be enemies to Chriſt
and his manners, and teachings, and faith, which is without
reſpect to perſons, and account it too low and mean a breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and behaviour for your great worſhips, who are big
ſwoln with pride and envy, even ready to burſt again, and
in your faces plainlie ſhew whoſe image you bear, and whoſe

who are found in theſe or ſuch like practiſes, vain men and
women to be thus miſerably deceived and deluded by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
to ſay pride is not in the apparrel, or in outward things,
pride is in the heart; and ſo it's plainly ſeen, the day hath
declar'd it, even out of thy own mouth found a witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thy ſelf, for if it were not, then what means all this,
and much more vanity in thy life, which might be declar'd
and ſpoken of, enough almoſt to defile a chaft mind to write
it, and yet if any be ſent to declare the truth to you as it is
in Jeſus, againſt your exceſs and vanitie; are ye not ready
to cry out one to another, take heed of being bewitched, or
of being deceived; can any be greater deceived and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
by the devil, the old Serpent, then you are already
who are found in ſuch practiſes. And thus the devil would
fain keep you ſtill his ſubjects unto ſin, luſt, and vanities of
the world, by bidding of you take heed of being deceived
and deluded, leſt he ſhould loſe a member and ſubject of his
Kingdome, but your follie and his ſubtilty muſt be made
manifeſt, it can no longer be hid, for he is come and witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
who makes all things manifeſt, even your hidden works

O <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>AEgypt,</hi> where our Lord lies crucified, and

under a profeſſion of the Saints words; fair fig-leaves, but
underneath a Serpent; your coverings rent, it will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
hide you, the bed is too ſhort to ſtretch your ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Do ye think a profeſſion of their words will do it,

after this manner, by profeſſing my Saints and Servants
words, who went before them into the land of Reſt? Think

Prophet ſhall the Lord your God, raiſe up unto you, of your
Brethern like unto me, him ſhall ye hear, who though he
were dead, yet ſpeaketh? By whom think ye were the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks
told there was Corn in <hi>AEgypt</hi> (who had ſold <hi>Joſeph</hi>
thither) to preſerve them alive in Famine? Was it not by
him of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> declares? By whom did <hi>Joſeph</hi> make
mention of the Removing of his bones, when as he was yet in
<hi>AEgypt,</hi> long before their departure? By whom did <hi>Jacob</hi>
bleſs, both the ſons of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> leaning on the top of his ſtaff?
All theſe obtained a good report through Faith; having not
received the Promiſe; who being dead, yet ſpeaketh? Whom
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114825:11"/>
think ye that my ſervant <hi>Joſhua</hi> (called Jeſus) was ſav'd by,
was it by <hi>Moſes</hi> Writings? Or by Faith in him whom <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
declared ſhould come, by which he entred the good land?
What ſhould I ſpeak of <hi>Jeptha,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and
<hi>Gideon,</hi> and many others, who through Faith remov'd Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
ſtopt the mouths of Lions, quench'd the violence of
fire, fought many battels, over-come great Nations, ſlew
mighty Giants, <hi>Ogg</hi> King of Baſhan, and <hi>Doeg</hi> King of the
Amorites, and <hi>Tidal</hi> King of Nations, and <hi>Tartan, Pull,</hi> and
<hi>Lud,</hi> who bent the bow? By whom think ye was <hi>Abraham</hi>
ſtrengthned when he reſcued the ſpoils of the men of the
Eaſt out of the hands of their enemies, when <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi>
met him, who was without beginning of dayes, or end of life,
whoſe Father and Mother none knew, neither had they a
name in the earth, unto whom the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> gave
the Tenth of the ſpoyls that he had taken; who bleſſed him
who had the Promiſe, and without doubt the leſſer was bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of the greater, who was the figure of him who was to
come? And do ye think, O ye Prieſts, People, Profeſſors,
and Inhabitants of the World, that a making of Profeſſion
of theſe words will ſave you, who know not him who was to
come, nor will not believe in the light from whence the
words were declared forth, who was the Oath and Promiſe
unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> when as he was yet uncircumciſed, who is the
Father of all who believe in the Oath, who ſaid, Of the fruit
of thy Loyns ſhall he come, in whom all the Nations of the
Earth ſhall be bleſſed, even by turning away the Curſe for
ſin, and ſaving his People from their ſin, in whoſe Seed all
the Nations of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed, and again, in bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
I will bleſs thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thee,
and thou ſhalt be the Father of many Nations, and as the
ſtars of heaven, ſo ſhall thy Seed be; you who are profeſſing
theſe words, do ye know the Seed here ſpoken of, which ſhall
be as the ſtars of heaven for multitude, unto which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
is, not unto ſeeds as many, but unto thy ſeed, which is
Chriſt, in the Male, and in the Female, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> in the
Spirit teſtifieth? Or how can ye ever come to this knowledg
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114825:12"/>
vvho deny the light vvhich lighteth every man that cometh
into the World; and ſo the ſeed of God ye are ſtrangers
and enemies to, vvho deny the light to be ſufficient to lead
unto ſalvation, all vvho believe in it, and vvalk up to it,
and yet profeſſe their vvords vvho vvitneſſed ſalvation by it,
and take their ſayings; the holy men of Gods Words vvhich
they ſpake &amp; vvrote from the Word that dvvelt in them, and
vvas vvith them, and call them the Word of the Lord (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Hearken to the Word of the Lord</hi>) vvho never knevv his
Word, nor had ſeen his ſhape at any time, but are enemies
to his Word, and to thoſe vvho profeſſes his Word abiding
in them, and they in it; and ſo are ſuch found to be vvho
have not his Word abiding in you, who call that his Word
which were Writings from his Word, which they who knew
the Word, no where did: And ſo his Word you are ignorant
of, and his life haters of, and deſpiſers of, who have his words
to make a profeſſion of; I wonder how ye ſhould be ſtill thus
ignorantly blindfold as not to ſee this, when as his ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared of to you: Do ye not wilfully ſtop your ears and
blind your eies, O ye prieſts, profeſſors and people, that ye
will not ſee this? or do ye think or imagine to be ſaved by a
Profeſſion without the life and power? or are ye reſolv'd
on't that ye will not be ſaved, and ſay ſtill, He's not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent?
Will ye profeſſe to be lovers of God, and Chriſt, and
the ſpirit, and yet ſay, He's not ſufficient, and be haters of
them who are ſo, who are followers of that which is good,
and do witneſſe he's ſufficient? Is this to love God, and
Chriſt, and the Spirit, as ye profeſs who are haters of the
Brethren? Can ſuch a profeſſion ſave you? Doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
ye profeſs witneſs forth ſuch a ſalvation as this? Or
do ye think there's another ſalvation then what they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to, which is the light of the World, Chriſt Jeſus? And
can you think to be ſaved by him, who will not be led and
guided by him? Or doth he lead any into ſin? You who
profeſs him yet ſay, <hi>ye ſhall never be ſet free from ſin here:</hi> Are
ye guided by Chriſt? To the light in all your conſciences I
ſpeak, which will let you ſee who's your Leader and Guide
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114825:12"/>
into ſin and imperfection, even the man of ſin, and ſon of
perdition, whom Chriſt is come and made manifeſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy:
And do ye profeſs he's come, and it ſay ſin ſhall not
be deſtroyed, nor none can or ſhall be ſet free from it here?
What a profeſſion is this! and what a belief is this! it even
pitties me to ſee that men ſhould be thus miſerably deceived
by Chriſts Enemy, and the Enemy of your ſouls, to be thus
deluded; and yet if any one be moved of the Lord to declare
it unto you in love to your ſouls, cry out one to another,
<hi>Take heed of deluſion, it's a ſpirit of deluſion which is gone forth
into the world, which the Apoſtles ſaid ſhould come in the laſt days,
which privily ſhould bring in damnable errors, even denying the
Lord that bought them:</hi> Are ye not there who are led into
ſin, and ſay you ſhall not be free? And is it not the Devil
that tells you this, who is afraid his Kingdom ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
which is ſin in you? What think you? is it not ſo?
and are we not accounted your Enemies for thus telling you
the truth, O ye prieſts, profeſſors, and people, and O all ye
Inhabitants of the Earth? And do ye not now plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how he have been thus long deluded by the Devil and
his Inſtruments, to denie the light which lets you ſee this?
And will you ſtill love to have it ſo? Oh! What will ye do
in the end hereof? think ye to be ſaved in your ſin, ſeeing ye
will not come to him, nor own him, to be ſaved by him who
ſets free? Do ye not love your ſin better then him, and it
profeſs to love him, when in words ye denie him, and ſo are
unto everie good Work reprobate? for ſuch as are come to
the good Work, are come to him who was before the evil
Work was; but who are in the evil Work, are not, and ſo are
not in him who works the good Work, but in him who
works the evil, and yet think to be ſaved by profeſſing the
words of him who worketh all our Works in us, and for us;
for this is he of whom vve are Witneſſes, even the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of God, by which we are ſaved and ſet free from our
ſin; and this not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God, not of
Works, leſt any ſhould boaſt, for we are the Workmanſhip
of God, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, that we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114825:13"/>
ſhould grow and increaſe in them. And is this your Saviour
who profeſs and ſay ye ſhall never be ſet free from ſin here?
Or are ye not ſetting up a Saviour of your own making, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
your own hearts luſt, (which ye love and worſhip more
then Chriſt) which is not of Gods appointment, and it talk
and profeſs of worſhipping the Lord after his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whilſt ye are ſerving of him (by your own confeſſion)
who is not ſufficient to ſet free from ſin here? And ſo the
true Chriſt and God ye are ignorant on, who ſaves his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from ſin, whom we witneſs: And are ye not fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
your ſelves in words (almoſt blood to Knees) for your
God, (&amp; the manner of his Service and VVorſhip, and yet all
join'd together againſt the true Worſhippers) who hath not
ſav'd you from ſin, nor never will, and ſo not from Wrath to
come? Who would take part with ſuch a God, and fight for
ſuch a God, or ſerve ſuch a God, and Chriſt, and Goſpel, if
they were not ignorantlie zealous, and blind? And how
can ye be otherwiſe who denie the true light which lighteth
every one that cometh into the world, to be ſufficient? Is it
not juſt with God ye ſhould be blind ſtill who will not own
his light wherewith he hath enlightned you, but are Enemies
to it and haters of it, (calling it natural) and perſecutors,
and oppoſers of them that witneſs it, and believe in it, and
are guided by it, and account them not worthie to live in the
World; who are not of the World, but ſuch as he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
out of the World? And yet, will ye not yet ſee whoſe
ſteps ye are in? Search the Scriptures, and ſee, are they not
plain enough? (to the light in you I ſpeak) Or will ye ſtill
be hireing of a man to give you the meaning? Did they who
ſpake and writ that which ye profeſs, ſpeak one thing,
and mean another? Will ye be ſuch blaſphemers againſt the
Spirit of Truth, the Holie Ghoſt? Know ye not their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
ſearch the Scriptures, and ſee. Or will ye ſtill follow
their meanings rather then it, vvho are ſaying, The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
vvere ſpoken in other Tongues, and none can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them but ſuch as know and underſtand the Tongues,
<hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> vvhich the builders of <hi>Babel</hi> call
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114825:13"/>
the original? Are not ſuch blaſphemers vvho call Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Syllables the Original, and ſay none can underſtand
the Scripture but ſuch? Are they not ignorant of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
vvho ſay ſo? And vvill ye ſtill believe and follovv their
meanings and opinions vvho are out of the Original, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to the Original? Had not the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> their
Original? And vvere they not perſecutors and murtherers
of Chriſt Jeſus our Original? Search the Scriptures, and ſee.
And are there none ſuch to be found amongſt you, O ye
Prieſts, Profeſſors and People? to the Light in all your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
I ſpeak: If there be, Will ye ſtill be follovvers of
them? Is this to be follovvers of God as dear children, or
not follovvers of them that do evil, from vvhom the Apoſtle
bids turn avvay? And can ye be ſuch lovers of the Apoſtles
Words, (as ye profeſs) vvho vvill not take his advice (vvho
vvalked in the Grace of God vvhich he had received, and it
vvas ſufficient for him, as the other Saints did, and vvitneſſed
they needed not another Teacher to teach them, but as the
ſame Anointing vvhich vvas in them, taught them, vvhich
vvas truth, and in it vvas no lye?) Or are ye not rather hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
and haters of the Apoſtles, and their vvords too,
though in ſhevv ye profeſs them, calling them Bleſſed S. <hi>Paul;</hi>
and Holy St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Evangelical Prophet, and
the Holy and Bleſſed Evangeliſts and Bleſſed St.
<hi>Stephen</hi> that holy Martyr, vvhoſe vvords ye profeſs,
but can't abide his Doctrine, becauſe he vvitneſſed againſt
Temples made vvith hands, as by your vvorks ye plainly
ſhevv, for the Tree is to be knovvn and judged of by its
fruits, and that's according to vvhat ye profeſſe? Search and
ſee, is it not ſo? VVill their VVords, think ye, bear ye out
any longer to profeſs, vvho hate their VVorks, and ſcoff at
their VVorker, ſaying, <hi>Where was the Light, I pray, when</hi> Paul
<hi>perſecuted the Church of God?</hi> VVhy, even vvhere yours is,
hid under a Bed, or under a Buſhel, or under an ignorant
blind zeal, being brought up at the feet of ſome great <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel,</hi>
or Doctor, or Expounder (or Meaning, or Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-giver)
of the Scriptures, as <hi>Paul</hi> then vvas, vvho are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114825:14"/>
found in his ſteps, and yet querying; Where was the light? I
pray ye, blind Zealots, Think ye it's onely to be found or
had from <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge?</hi> and from St. <hi>Johns</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and not in St. <hi>John?</hi> Or was he learn'd it at any ſuch
place, and not by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt? ſearch the
Scriptures and ſee. And what was the end (I pray) of your
Miniſters being it ſent to your Univerſities, and the deſign
of their Parents in it? Was it the ſame that Chriſt taught
and inſtructed, and deſigned, and ſet apart this for? Or was
it not that they might get a livelyhood, and good mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and preferment (as you call it) in the World? Was
this Chriſt and his Miniſters end? And after they have been
trained up, or educated (as you call it) for ſome years at the
Craft, and become proficients in it, are they not from thence
ſent forth, having commenc't Mr. of the Science, and able to
handle their Weapons well in the defence of their Mother,
<hi>Myſtery Babylon;</hi> and afterwards being tryed by ſome able,
aged, and more experienced Arts-man, who had long worn
his Philactery (and found expert) is ordained, and ſent forth
to ſome certain place, or Pariſh, with an Order from man, to
enter and creep into a Stone-Houſe there to lead ſilly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
captive, laden with their ſins, and led about with divers
luſts, ever learning under them, but never able to come to
the knowledge of the truth; and how ſhould they, when
(with a ſtrong Law that none muſt come there to declare it
under penalty of a Houſe of Correction, or a Pariſon as a
diſturber) it's not their Teachers guide nor end, but two,
three, or four, or five hundred pounds a year, which was in
their eye? And was it ſo in the Miniſters of Chriſt? ſearch
the Scriptures, and ſee; Was it ſo? Or doth their Rule (as
they call it) teach them to ſprinkle Water on a childs face,
&amp; call it baptiſm, or an Ordinance of Chriſt; or to call Bread
&amp; Wine a Sacrament, do not ſuch make void the Ordinance of
Chriſt through their traditions? What pattern have they
from Chriſt, or any of his Miniſters, for theſe things, or for
their Pulpit, as 'tis called, their long Robes, their walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the dead, their words over the dead, their Knells, their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114825:14"/>
Bells, their money for Buryings and Chriſtenings; their ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Funeral Sermons; their Chancel-money, their Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money,
with many other knacks and toyes, and pedlary
Wares which they take money for, and call their dues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
ſweet-Meats and Wines for their Bellies; are theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of Chriſt too? No, <hi>But theſe are</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and uniformity:</hi> Did not your fore-fathers ſay ſo, who
ſought under thoſe Names to uſher in popery and idolatry?
And who gave ye orders for theſe and ſuch like practiſes?
Received ye them from Chriſt, or from your Rule? ſearch
and ſee: Or not from your fore-fathers the Biſhops, who
taught you to pray and preach by the hour, and to call upon
thoſe for money, who will buy none of your Merchandize?
Are not theſe covetous practiſes? And muſt you not have
your Clark, and Sexſtone, and Dog-Whipper too, to attend
for decencie and uniformitie? Who taught you it? VVere
there ever ſuch helpers in the Miniſtrie of the Goſpel? Yet
theſe muſt have their pay too, from ſuch as require none of
their labour, for uniformitie ſake: Doth your Rule you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, teach you ſuch practiſes; ſearch and ſee; or doth it
not rather condemn your burthenſomneſs: Do you think
calling your great Stone-houſes by the Saints Names, is any
honor to them; or that ye ſhall have their benediction for it,
who are Enemies to their Doctrine, practiſe, manner of life
and converſation, who were called and choſen to the VVork
of their Miniſtrie, not by the will of man, nor ſent forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the VVorld in mans will and time, but by the revelation
of Jeſus Chriſt, contrarie to mans VVill, whoſe revelation
ye denie, and cannot own nor receive, but ſay that's ceaſ'd,
and ſo are deniers of Scriptures, and yet would be accounted
Chriſts Miniſters, Goſpel-Miniſters, Goſpel-profeſſors;
VVhat Goſpel is't you Miniſter and profeſſe who denie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
and the Letter alſo which witneſſeth to it; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
that, and preach that which the Scriptures no where
ſpeaks, namely, That Revelation is ceaſ'd; Who revealed that
to you, you that denie Chriſts revelation; Muſt it not needs be
his enemie Antichriſt: &amp; vvhoſe Miniſters then are ye who ſay
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114825:15"/>
that none muſt expect or wait for revelation now, and that
ſuch who do, are a ſort of giddie-brain'd fellows and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
and ſuch as theſe upſtart <hi>Quakers,</hi> who profeſſe this
new-found light, who are contrarie to all mens opinions and
judgements of the Scriptures but their own; and was not
truth ever ſo, ye blind, leaders of the blind: Is truth to be
accounted of according to mens judgements or opinions of
it, or as it is in it ſelf infallible, which word I know you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
indure to hear, who are in that which is fallible; and ſo
meaſuring truth by a lie, and calling Jeſus <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and

will the words think ye cover you; nay, nay, the words are
the words of truth, and ſhall joine with the light, a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
againſt you, even to your eternal condemnation, who
are found in life, converſation, doctrine, and practiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to them, and this ſhall you witneſſe eternallie, who
diſowns the light, to be guided by it, which leads into the life
of the Scriptures from which they were ſpoken forth, which
was before the Scriptures were ſpoken, even before <hi>Babel</hi>
and her Builders, into the one Language and this according
to my meaſure am I a VVitneſſe of, as ever he was (who am
hated, perſecuted, and deſpitefullie uſed by your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
who came to fulfil the Scriptures, for he came not to
deſtroy them, but to fulfil them; and what do ye witneſſe of
them fulfilled in you, who profeſſe and ſay he is come, yet are
deniers of his light; which waie is he come unto you, ſeeing
you denie that he enlighteneth every one that cometh into
the VVorld; and he ſaith he doth enlighten every one, and
ye ſay he doth not; VVho taught ye to ſay ſo; doth he, or
the god of the World; and what is it lets you ſee this and
your other confuſion, who ſay ye are enlightned, but not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114825:15"/>
all; and that there's a common and a ſpecial light, a natural
and a ſpiritual light in man; diſtinguiſh them aſunder, that
we may know them one from another, ſeeing the Scriptures
ye profeſſe ſpeaks but of one true light, which lighteth every
one that cometh into the World, which is <hi>uncreated;</hi> if by
your natural light you mean the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
borrowed Lights, and <hi>created,</hi> we agree in that; but are
they in man; but if there be two Lights in man, ſeparate
them one from another, that we may know them, or elſe we
may freely conclude, (according to the Scripture) <hi>That the
light which is in you is darkneſs:</hi> and how great is that darkneſs
which hath overſpread the whole World ſince the Apoſtles
dayes, which is got ſo high; even into the Seat of God, exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelf above God, and boaſts himſelf as if he were
God, by making two Lights in man when God made but
one, and the Scriptures witneſſe to but one true light, and
yet he'le have two, but knows not how to ſeparate them one
from another; but he who dwells in the light doth, and
knows his to be darkneſſe, and to aſcend out of the pit of
darkneſſe and confuſion, unto which he muſt be ſent again,
even by him who is the Father of Light, even of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, God bleſſed for ever; the God of truth, in
whom there is no lye, but bears witneſſe againſt the Lye, and
the Frogs, and the Locuſts, and the Caterpillars, which are
aſcended out of the bottomleſſe pit, and have overſpread
the Nations of the whole earth, even all <hi>Egypt,</hi> but they
muſt be all whipt away with the Rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the pit out of which they aſcended, never to infect the
Nations any longer; for he is come, and coming, whoſe Fan
is in his hand, who will throughlie purge his Flour, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaff will he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
and burn up with fire unquenchable; for his fire is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the earth, which ſhall conſume, and none ſhall be able
to hinder it, till he hath conſumed the wicked from off the
face of the whole Earth; King and Peaſant, who will not
that he ſhould reign, Tophet is prepared for them of old,
and the glory of all earthly Diadems ſhall enter into it; for

thus hath the Lord decreed, and who ſhall be able to hinder

is ceaſt; What ſpirit is it (think ye) he preaches and
prays by, who knows not the Son, <hi>For none knows the Father
ſave the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him;</hi> Do ye think its
the ſpirit of my Father that prayes and preacheth in him
that knows not the Son nor the Father, but ſayes Revelation
is ceaſt; it's ceaſt to him indeed, becauſe he's a hater of the
light, and loves the darkneſſe rather then the light, becauſe
his deeds are evil: And do ye think his works are not in the
darkneſſe, whom it's even a torment to, to hear of the light,
and he had rather ſee, or ſpeak with the Devil, then to ſee,
or ſpeak with one who owns the light, and walks in the
light, and ſo hath fellowſhip with God; but whom think
ye his fellowſhip's with who loves not the light, but is a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the light; Muſt not his fellowſhip needs be with the
devil, who is the Prince and Ruler of the Darkneſſe of this
World, even the ſpiritual VVickedneſſe got into high places,
ſitting as God in the Temple of God, exalting himſelf even
above all that is called God, and would be worſhipped as
God; And think ye this ſpirit is no where to be found but at
<hi>Rome,</hi> O ye Prieſts, Profeſſors and People; Is it not to be
found amongſt your ſelves; To the Light in all your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
I ſpeak: VVhat means the Fines and cloſe impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ſuch who dare not ſwear, and ſo break my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
for conſcience ſake, and who dare not bow to, nor
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114825:17"/>
worſhip man for conſcience ſake? Are theſe things onely
to be found at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> who
are called Chriſtians as well as ye, (I, and boaſt in it too) and
not in <hi>England</hi> alſo, where liberty of conſcience is profeſt,
even amongſt you? O ye great and tall Profeſſors of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures!
Do you think the Scriptures will cover you any more
then they? or that your Faith, and Goſpel, and Chriſt is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then theirs, who are reſpecting one anothers perſons?
Will that Faith ſave ye any more then theirs? Search the
Scriptures, and ſee. Doth the change of the Air, or of the
Climate, or of the Names, or of the Languages, or of the
places, or of the profeſſion of God, and Chriſt, &amp; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
after another form or likeneſſe then theirs, (for they
have the Names, Chriſtian, and God, and Chriſt, and the
Scriptures, as well as ye, and a form of godlineſſe in ſome
things as near the Letter as ye) change the nature, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
a ſaving-faith which is that which purifies the heart,
and ſets free from ſin? Or are ye not in your ſin as well
as they, and ſay ye ſhall not be free here? Onely here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they out-ſtrip ye in profeſſion, for they profeſſe a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
after this life, through which they muſt paſſe, and be
cleanſed and purified; for they know that no unclean thing
muſt enter into Heaven, and ye think to enter in with your
ſins; for here ye ſay you ſhall never be ſet free, and ſo are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers
of the Scriptures in that particular, more then they;
for you will not come to me (ſaith Chriſt the light) that you
may have life: Do ye think that the profeſſion of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
will ſave you any more then them? Or is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
me? Were the Scriptures crucified at Jeruſalem, or
ſlain ſince the foundation of the VVorld? Or do ye think
that Letters and Syllables joined together in words, as God,
and Jeſus, will ſave from ſin? Or is that the blood which was
ſhed without the City, which only cleanſeth from ſin, and
purgeth from all unrighteouſneſſe? Or is that to be found
in things without? VVill the blood of Bulls, or Goats, or
the aſhes of a Heifer, think ye, cleanſe from ſin? If they
would, what needed he have come and been offered up, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114825:17"/>
ſhed his blood at Jeruſalem, who came to fulfil the Law, and
the Prophets, and the Paſſeover, and the Circumciſion, and
the divers waſhings, and carnal Ordinances, which could
not make the comers thereto perfect, as pertaining to the
conſcience? And do ye think that Bread, and VVine, and
VVater, which are carnal things, which you call <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
(who taught you that VVord? had you it by Revelation?
for the Scripture no where hath it) will do it now? why then
the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and they of <hi>Italy, Spain, and France,</hi> have
more of them then ye, yet they you ſay are Antichriſt, and
none of the Saints, and Church, and people of God, and we
ſay ſo too. Or is the manner or form of eating, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or dipping, or ſprinkling, that alters the nature, and
makes it more ſaving to one, then to another? for 'tis only
in that ye differ; for they have the ſame, and more then
ye, &amp; circumſtances by your own Doctrine, alters not, where
the ground and foundation is one; for circumſtances doth
not ſave according to your own Opinions, nor change the
ground; VVhy then do you exclude them from being a
Church of Chriſt more then your ſelves; who profeſſe
more of the carnal Ordinances then ye, and profeſſe the
ſame Scriptures, the ſame Faith, the ſame God, the ſame
Chriſt, and the ſame Sacraments? and where's the difference
but in the circumſtances? And it you ſay they are not a
Church of Chriſt, and profeſſe that you your ſelves are; and
it ſay circumſtances doth not ſave, if the ground and
foundation be one; VVhat confuſion is here! Are you not
all in <hi>Babylon?</hi> Are not Mother and Daughter both <hi>Harlots?</hi>
Is your Bread, and VVine, and VVine, and VVater, better,
and holier the theirs? Are they not all carnal? Or is yours
more pure and more ſaving? Yet neither of them make the
Comers thereunto perfect, by your own confeſſion; is not
their Saviour then as good as yours, and their Church as
yours, both imperfect? And is the Church of Chriſt ſo?
Search the Scriptures and ſee. Doth they ſay it is? Or doth
it not ſay that he waſheth and clenſeth it in his own blood,
and preſents it to God his Father without ſpot or wrinkle,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114825:18"/>
or anie ſuch thing; And do not the Apoſtles write to the
Church which is in God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;
and dare ye ſay that's imperfect, as by your own confeſſion
yours is, and it would be accounted a Church of Chriſt, and
your Teachers, Miniſters of Chriſt; Is Chriſt imperfect;
Are ye not miniſtring the carnal; Is Chriſt carnal; Are ye
not miniſtring the Letter: Is the Letter the Spirit; Are ye
not miniſtring the Bread and VVine; Is this Chriſt; But it
may be you'l ſay, You receive it by faith, but is it faith in
Chriſt; ſearch the Scriptures, and trie Hath this faith puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
your hearts; If not; it's not Chriſts. Hath it given you
victorie over the world; Hath it ſubdued and crucified the
world unto you, and you unto it; Hath it ſav'd &amp; clenſed you
from ſin, as by your own confeſſion it hath not, nor you ſay,
you believe never will here; and ſo is not the faith in Chriſt
which the Saints witneſſed; and if not in Chriſt, not true,
nor ſaving, nor wel-grounded faith, which you oft talk of,
but know it not; for the daie is come, and approaching, that
your Foundations ſhall be ſhaken; the Light comprehends
you, your Faith and Foundation, which is tottering and
ſandie. Therefore look about you, (ye that profeſſe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers)
and beware, for your image of Faith will not ſave ye
anie more then the Popes Images. VVhat's that ye worſhip
and pretend to ſerve; Do ye know; Is the Scriptures, or
mens meanings of them, He; Is Bread and VVine He; Is
the Ordinances He; 'Tis like you'l ſay, <hi>No, but they lead to
him:</hi> VVhich of you have they lead to him; Are ye found
out; Is your Ordinances Chriſt; Doth anie lead to God but
Chriſt; Knows anie the Father ſave the Son, and he to whom
the Son will reveal him; Are ye not making a Chriſt of your
Ordinance, and yet condemn the Pope and his Church to the
devil ſor believing the bread &amp; vvine is tranſubſtantiated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bodie &amp; Blood of Chriſt, &amp; that when they eat it, they
eat his fleſh, &amp; drink his blood: What difference betwixt their
eating their God, and yours leading to God, and yet ſaying
it's Bread and Wine ſtill, which is carnal; Doth that which
is carnal lead to God, whom to know and be led unto, is life
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114825:18"/>
eternal; And hath your dead Chriſt brought you thither,
yea or nay; The Light ſees your Chriſt, and in it are you
comprehended, and your Chriſt, and with it denied, and
your Faith, which doth not purifie; for whilſt I was under
the leading and conduct of it, I came not to the knowledge
of God by it, and ſo not to eternal life, which is witneſſed
through faith in him, and in his blood, which purifies my
heart, and gives me dominion over the world, and that Chriſt
I know, own and witneſſe which ſaves from ſin all that come
unto him; but your Chriſt is denied, which you ſay you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
will not ſet you free from ſin here, and ſo is not the
Chriſt of God; <hi>which is the true Light which lighteth every one
that cometh into the world, who is manifest to take away ſin, and
to deſtroy the works of the Devil, and in him is no ſin:</hi> And this
Chriſt I own, and bear witneſſe of, who is the true Light, the
Ordinance of the Father, whom ye hate and deſtroy, and
make void through your traditions; and denie your Mock-Chriſt,
which you ſay will not ſave you from ſin here, but
leaves you in the Devils work, which is ſin, (by your own
confeſſion) and ſo your Chriſt is but transform'd in you like
unto an Angel of Light, O ye Profeſſors and People, and
your Miniſters like unto Miniſters of Righteouſneſſe; and ſo
being not the ſame Chriſt, but like him, cannot ſave ye from
ſin, and ſo not from condemnation, but keepes you in it
whileſt ye are here, and perſwades you that ye cannot be ſet
free; and this Chriſt ye believe in: And heres the myſterie
of iniquitie hid, and diſcovered (even the ſpiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
got into high places) unto all who have an eye to ſee,
and an ear to hear, and an heart to underſtand, and will not
wilfullie blind themſelves by hating knowledge and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And this myſterie of iniquitie works not onelie at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but in <hi>England</hi> alſo, and in
every particular Member of that Church, which is not in
God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the pillar and
ground of Truth, whom to know is life eternal, which none
comes to know, but ſuch who comes down to know and own
the light within them, which is pure, of God, which convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114825:19"/>
of ſin and iniquitie, and ſhews evil deeds; that's the
Light which lets ye ſee when ye tell a lie, when ye ſwear, or
be drunk, or commit anie other ſin, that ye are ſerving the
devil, and not God; when ye are fulfilling the luſt of the
fleſh, the luſt of the eie, and the pride of life, that this is not
of the Father, but of the World; and the World paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie,
and the luſts thereof, but he that doth the Will of God,
the ſame abideth for ever; and this being obeyed, (which
convinceth) and ſin denied, it leads unto Chriſt from whence
the light comes, who leads to the Father of Light, with
whom there is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of changing,
who of his own good will hath he begotten us by the Word
of his Povver, unto a livelie hope by the reſurrection of Jeſus
Chriſt from the dead, that we ſhould be as the firſt fruits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, having ſlain the enmitie on the Croſs, and broken
down the Partition-wall, and hath brought in everlaſting
Righteouſneſs, even by waſhing and purging of us in his
own blood; and his fleſh we know, which is meat indeed; and
his blood, which is drink indeed; and his covering we know.
But the wo from him is unto all ſuch as are found covered,
and covering themſelves with a covering, and not of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord; for the Lord our God is come, and coming
in the Clouds of Heaven, with the voice of the Arch Angel,
and the ſhout of a great Trump, to call all vvho are in the
Graves to ariſe and ſtand up to judgement, they that have
done vvell to the reſurrection of life, but they that have
done evil, to the reſurrection of condemnation; and the daie

good ſhall go into life everlaſting; but he that hath done evil

vvhere ſhall be vveeping, and hovvling, and gnaſhing of
