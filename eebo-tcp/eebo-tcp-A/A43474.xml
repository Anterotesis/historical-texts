            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is my certain Knowledge of your being a Kinſman, and Chaplain to (and what's more, your being eſteemed by) the late Lord Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> (for I have it under his own Hand writing) which makes me give you not the Trouble, but Satisfaction of this long Letter; becauſe I believe you would be glad to hear how he was received by us in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and what kind of End he made; which there is none to capable of giving you an Account of, as my ſelf: For he was pleaſed, after he came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to converſe very freely with me before he fell Sick, and to make uſe of my Services and Aſſiſtances in the time of his Sickneſs.</p>
            <p>I will begin my little Narrative of this great Man, with his Landing in <hi>Ireland</hi> in the late King's Company, which was upon <hi>Tueſday, March</hi> 12. The <hi>Sunday</hi> following, being at <hi>Cork,</hi> he received the Bleſſed Sacrament at the Hands of the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Cork;</hi> came to <hi>Dublin</hi> with the King upon <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi> and on <hi>Eaſter</hi> Day, and the <hi>Octaves</hi> of <hi>Eaſter</hi> he again received the Holy Sacrament at <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> here from the Biſhop of <hi>Meath;</hi> to which Church his Lordſhip went daily to Prayers. 'Twas upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Week that I was firſt known to his Lordſhip, meeting him accidentally at a Perſon of Quality's Houſe at Dinner: From which time he was pleaſed to admit me into his Acquaintance, and to diſcourſe with me in his Lodgings ſeveral times very freely. That Day he complained a little of his being troubled with the <hi>Dyſentery,</hi> (which we here call the Country Diſeaſe) but uſed no means to cure it all that Week. And upon <hi>Tueſday, April</hi> 4. hearing that his Lordſhip was Ill, I went to viſit him, (as I did at leaſt once a Day after) and found him ſo much indiſpoſed, that he was hardly able to go with another Gentleman and my Self in a Coach to Dinner: But when he came to the Place he eat nothing but a little Bread and Cheeſe. After Dinner he grew worſe, we got him home with ſome trouble, and laid him down on his Bed ſo Ill, that he was ſcarce able to ſpeak to us. He was much averſe to meddle with Phyſicians, I therefore recommended to him an Able and Ingenious Apothecary of my Acquaintance, whom he accepted of; but finding no benefit by his ſervices, Dr. <hi>Willoughby</hi> was conſulted with, who being unable to viſit him, ſent directions what he would have him take: Which not ſucceeding, according to our Wiſhes, the next Day Dr. <hi>Aſpole</hi> was ſent for, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of what the other Phyſicians had preſcribed, and added further directions of his own. But all this doing no good, the Day following Dr. <hi>Sylvius,</hi> a Third Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, was made uſe of, who, upon his Firſt Viſit, told us he was a Dead Man; yet preſcribed ſuch things for him, as were proper in this Diſtemper, which he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly took, as he had done what the other Doctors ordered.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning his Lordſhip ſent for me, and while I was with him the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Pariſh, Dr. <hi>Foy,</hi> came to viſit him, when before us both (there being likewiſe a Jeſuite, one of the King's Chaplains, and ſeveral others preſent) he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily declared himſelf to be a Member of the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in which he had always lived, and wherein, by the Grace of God, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to die, whatever the World had ſaid, or might ſay of him to the contrary. He deſired then to have the Churches Prayers ſaid, which accordingly he had, and he joyned in them very Devoutly. That Afternoon he was viſited by the Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> who both Prayed with him, and was after left alone with him for ſome time. I went again late that Evening to viſit him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and offering my Service to ſtay with him that Night, becauſe I ſaw him very Weak: He accepted of it, and deſired me to adminiſter the Bleſſed Sacrament to him in the Morning, which I did, having before ſaid the Churches Office of Viſitation, received his Confeſſion, and given him at his deſire the Churches Abſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103960:2"/>During the performance of thoſe Offices, he demeaned himſelf with all the Signs of Zeal, Devotion and Preſence of Mind, as became one of his Character, and as could be expected, conſidering his mighty Indiſpoſition. His Lordſhip, deſired me twice that Morning to ſtay with him; but my attendance on my own Church calling me away, I ſent to Dr. <hi>Foy,</hi> who waited on him in my Abſence. I viſited him again about Noon; and in the Afternoon, while we were at Church, the Titular Biſhop of <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ghor</hi> and Dean of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> made his Lordſhip a Viſit, taking that time, I am apt to believe, in hopes to find him without Company, and Weak enough to be impoſed on by them.</p>
            <p>After the Firſt Civilities were paſt, one of them in Latin deſired him to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Eternity, and to prepare for Death. His Servant being preſent, anſwered them, That his Lordipſh had prepared himſelf already. They afterwards told him in Latin, There was but one God, one Faith, one Church: To which the Biſhop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>That he believed ſo, and that he hoped he had made his Peace with God.</hi> They again repeated, That there was but one God, one Church; ſo intending (as we may preſume) to enlarge upon that Subject: He Anſwered them ſomewhat ſhort, <hi>I know all this as well as you, but I am not able to Anſwer you for the failing of my Spirits; and therefore I deſire you to forbear talking with me any more about this, for I have done already what, I hope, is neceſſary for my Salvation.</hi> Hereupon they ſeeing they could not effect any thing with him, nor engage him in Diſcourſe, took their leaves, and they themſelves gave but, That the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> was dying, and that he would dye a Proteſtant. I waited on his Lordſhip again that Evening, and ſtaid with him till 'twas late; and being ſent for by him, about Four the next Morning, I went to him, and found him near Death; but he had the uſe both of his Reaſon, Senſes and Speech; for after I came to his Bed-ſide, he ſaid twice, — <hi>I ſhall dye.</hi> I Prayed with him then, and a little before Seven that Morning I commended his Soul to the Almighty.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was Dead, I ordered his Lordſhips Servant to acquaint the Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> and the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> with his Lordſhips Death, who, with the Earl of <hi>Longford,</hi> took care for his Funeral after this manner;</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>Tueſday, April</hi> 16, early, his Body was carried from the Houſe were he died, to the Biſhop of <hi>Meaths,</hi> which was near, where ſeveral Rooms were hung in Black; and that where the Body lay, was furniſhed with many Lights in Sconces, and Eight large Wax Tapers on Stands about the Body, which was covered with a fair Velvet Pall. In the Afternoon all the Nobility, Clergy, Judges and Gentry, of both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, that were in Town, amongſt whom were the Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> and the Lord Chancellor — came thither: And about Six in the Evening his Body was carried in a Velvet Herſe drawn with Six Horſes, Cloathed in Black, and attended by the King at Arms; the aforeſaid Company in near Thirty Coaches, and a multitude of Common People to <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> where the Subdean and Choir met the Body at the Church Door, and Sung it into the Choir, which was mightily crowded. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was Solemnly performed with ſeveral Anthems, and the Body afterwards Inter'd in the <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> end of the Choir, by the Lord Biſhop <hi>Meath</hi> in his Epiſcopal Habit.</p>
            <p>I have this further to add concerning his Lordſhip, that (as he himſelf told me) he read the Liturgy of our Church, in his Lodgings, at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> to ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as came thither to him; and while he was travelling in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when he had not the opportunity of going to the Publick, That except when he was at Court, his Converſation was chiefly amongſt Proteſtants, by whom he was frequently both viſited and treated. Two of his Phyſicians and his Apothecary were Proteſtants, and ſo was the Family where he Lodged, with which he had been heretofore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted in <hi>London.</hi> He was obſerved to be very ready to ſpeak to the late King (and was ſtill Succeſsful in his Addreſſes) in behalf of Diſtreſſed, or other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. And the <hi>Friday</hi> before the late King left <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Biſhop bought, at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Command, a Quarto Bible and Common Prayer Book, of the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Print, for him to carry with him to the <hi>North,</hi> for his Private Devotions.</p>
            <p>From all which (not to mention many other Circumſtances) we may without doubt conclude both that he was a firm Proteſtant, and that we of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom have received a great loſs in him. His deportment in his Sickneſs was becoming his Condition, and the Greatneſs of his Spirit; and conſidering, that for near Three Days before he died he was ſeverely Afflicted with a total ſtoppage of Urin, beyond the help of Goa Powders, <hi>Goddard</hi>'s Drops, and all that the Phyſicians could do to relieve him. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> He bore his Sickneſs very patiently. And therefore ſeeing he wanted nothing either for Soul or Body while he was with us, you, and the reſt of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Friends in <hi>England</hi> have leſs reaſon to be Afflicted at the Tidings of his Death than to bleſs God that he died amongſt us, and made ſo Honourable an End.</p>
