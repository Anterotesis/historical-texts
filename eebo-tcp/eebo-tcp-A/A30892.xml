            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>SUCH is the Malignity of man's Nature in his
fallen State, and so averse is he from walking
in the Straight and even Path of TRUTH,
that at every turn he is inclinable to lean either to the
Right Hand or the Left; yea, such as by the Work
of God's Grace in their Hearts, and powerful Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Spirit, have obtained an Entrance in
this Way, are daily molested, and set upon on all
hands, some striving to draw them the one way,
some the other; and if through the Power of God
they be kept faithful and stable, then are they calum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niated
on bothsides, each likening or comparing them
to the worst of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62828:3"/>
Those that are acquainted with the holy Scriptures
may observe this to have been the Lot of the Saints
in all Ages, but especially those whose place it hath,
been to Reform and Restore the Ruins of the House
of God, when decayed, or any considerable time
have been lyable to such Censures; hence those that
set about Repairing of the Walls of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were
necessitated to Work with the one hand, and Defend
with the other.</p>
            <p>Christ is accused of the <hi>Jews</hi> as a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and
by the <hi>Samaritans</hi> quarrelled for being a <hi>Jew.</hi> The
<hi>Apostle Paul</hi> is whipped &amp; imprisoned by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
and upbraided with being a <hi>Jew,</hi> and teaching their
Customs; the same <hi>Paul</hi> is haled and ready to be
killed by the <hi>Jews</hi> for breaking the Law, and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Temple with the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The like hath
also befaln these faithful Witnesses and Messengers,
whom God has raised up in this day to witness for
his Truth, which hath long been in a great Measure
hid, but now is again revealed, and many brought
to be Witnesses of it, who thereby are come to <hi>walk
in the Light of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This People, thus gathered, have not wanted
those Tryals that usually accompany the Church of
Christ, both on the right hand &amp; on the left, each cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterizing

would prove most to their Disadvantage; from
whence, as the Testimony of the false Witnesses
against their Lord, did not
agree, neither do these
against us; some will
have us to be <hi>foolish mad
Creatures</hi>; others, to be
<hi>deep subtil Polititions</hi>;<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>John Owen</hi> charges us with so much Ignorance, that though he writes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us in <hi>Latin,</hi> he fears we will not understand it: And <hi>Thomas Danson</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the sametime accuses us of being <hi>Jesuites,</hi> sent from abroad under this Vizard.</note>
some to be <hi>illiterate igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

<hi>learned cunning Jesuites</hi>
under a meer Vizard;
divers Professors will have us to be only <hi>Pensioners of
the Pope,</hi> undoubtedly <hi>Papists</hi>; but the <hi>Papists</hi> abhor
us as Hereticks: Sometimes we are a disorderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Rabble, leaving every one to do as they list,
against all Good Order and Government; at other
times, we are so much for Order, as we admit not
men to exercise the Liberty of their own Judgments.
Thus are our Reputations tossed by the Envy of our
Adversaries, which yet cannot but have this Effect
upon sober-minded people, as to see what Malice
works against us; and how these men, by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
Assertions concerning us, save us the Pains,
while they Refute one another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62828:4"/>
True it is, we have laboured to walk amidst these
Extremities, &amp; upon our appearing for the Truth we
have found things good in themselves, abused upon
both hands; for such hath alwayes been the Work
of an Apostacy, to keep up the Shadow of certain
Truths, that there-through they might shelter other
Evils. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> made use of the Law and
the Prophets to vindicate their Abuses, yea, and to
Crucifie Christ: And how much many <hi>Christians</hi>
abuse the Scriptures and the Traditions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
to uphold Things quite Contrary to it, will
in the general be readily acknowledged by most.</p>
            <p>But to descend more particularly, There be Two
Things especially, both of which in their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Use were appointed, and did very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
towards the Edification of the Church: The
one is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Power and Authority which the Apostles had given
them of Christ, for the Gathering, Building up and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
of his Church; by Vertue of which Power and
Authority they also wrote the holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other is, <hi>That Priviledge given to every </hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<hi>under the Gospel to be led and guided by the Spirit of
Christ, and to be taught thereof in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, both these in the primitive Church
wrought effectually towards the same End of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62828:4"/>
and did as in their Nature they may, and
in their Use they ought to do, in a good Harmony
very well consist together; but by the Workings of
Satan and Perversness of Men, they are made to
fight against and destroy one another: For on the one
hand, the Authority &amp; Power that resided in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
while it is annexed &amp; entailed to an Outward
Ordination and Succession of Teachers, is made use
of to cloak and cover all manner of Abuses, even
the height of Idolatry and Superstition; for by
Vertue of this Succession, these men claiming the
like Infallibility that was in the Apostles (though
they be Strangers to any inward Work or Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit in their Hearts) will needs obliege
all others to acquiesce and agree to their Conclusions,
however different from or contrary to the Truths
of the Gospel; and yet for any to call such Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in Question, or examine them, is no less then
a Hainous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heresie, deserving Death, &amp;c. Or while
the Revelation of God's Mind is wholely bound up
to these things already delivered in the Scriptures,
as if God had spoke his last words there to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note n="*" place="margin">So saith <hi>James Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> a noted Man among the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi> in his <hi>Exposition upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations.</hi>
               </note> we are put with our own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Understandings to Debate about
the Meanings of it, and forced to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
them not as they plainly speak,
but according to the Analogy of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62828:5"/>
Faith made by Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not so much
contrived to answer the Scriptures as
the Scriptures are strained to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
it, which to doubt of is also coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Heresie, deserving no less then E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
out of our native Country, and
to be robbed of the common Aid our Nativity enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
us to; and on this hand we may boldly say both
<hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> have greatly gone aside.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, some are so great Pretenders
to inward Motions and Revelations of the Spirit,
that there are no Extravagancies so wild which
they will not cloak with it, and so much are they for
every ones following their own Mind, as can admit
of no <hi>Christian-Fellowship</hi> and <hi>Community,</hi> nor of that
good Order and Discipline which the Church of
Christ never was nor can be without; this gives an
open Door to all <hi>Libertinism,</hi> and brings great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the <hi>Christian-Faith,</hi> and on this hand have
foully faln. The <hi>German Anabaptists,</hi> so call'd, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <hi>John of Leiden, Knipperdoling,</hi> &amp;c. in case these
monstrous things, committed by them, be such as
they are related, and some more moderate of that
kind have been found among the People in <hi>England,</hi>
called <hi>Ranters</hi>; as it is true the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>
hath bin branded with both of these extreams, it is as
true it hath been and is their Work to avoid them,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62828:5"/>
and to be found in that even and good Path of the
primitive Church, where all were no doubt led and
acted by the holy Spirit, and might all have prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
one by one, and yet there was a Subjection of
the Prophets to the Spirits of the Prophets. There
was an Authority some had in the Church, yet it
was for <hi>Edification, and not for Destruction</hi>; there
was an Obedience in the Lord to such as were set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and a being taught by such, and yet a knowing
of the Inward Anointing, by which each Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
was to be led into all Truth: The Work and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
the Lord hath given us is, to restore this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and to set both these in their right place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
causing them to destroy one another; to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
how this is accomplished and accomplishing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us is the Business of this Treatise, which I
hope will give some Satisfaction to men of sober
Judgments, and impartial and unprejudicate Spirits,
and may be made useful in the good Hand of the
Lord, to Confirm and Establish Friends against their
present Opposers, which is mainly intended and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
prayed for</p>

            <head type="sub">The Introduction and Method of this Treatise.</head>
            <p>AFter that the Lord God in his own appointed time had
seen meet, to put an End to the Dispensation of the
Law, which was delivered to the Children of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
by the Ministry of <hi>Moses,</hi> through and by whom he did
communicate unto them in the Wilderness from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
divers Commandments, Ordinances, Appointments and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
according as they are testified in the Writings of the
Law, it pleased him to send his own Son, <hi>the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi>
in the Fulness of Time, who having perfectly fulfilled the Law,
and the Rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>teousness thereof, gave witness to the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gospel; and having approved himself, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of his Doctrine by many Great and Wonderful
Signs and Miracles, he sealed it with his Blood, and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over Death (of which it was impossible for him to be held)
he cherished and encouraged his despised Witnesses, who had
believed in him, in that he appeared to them after he was raised
from the dead, comforting them with the Hope and Assurance
of the pouring forth of his Spirit, by which they were to be
led and ordered in all things, in and by which he was to be with
them to the End of the World, not suffering the Gates of Hell
to prevail against them, by which Spirit come upon them, they
being filled, were emboldned to preach the Gospel without
Fear; and in a short time Thousands were added to the Church,
and the Multitude of them that believed were of One Heart
and of One Soul, and great Love and Zeal prevailed, and there
was nothing lacking for a season.</p>
            <p>But all that was caught in the Net, did not prove Good and
Wholsom Fish; some were again to be cast in that Ocean from
whence they were drawn; of those many that were called, all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62828:7"/>
proved not chosen Vessels, fit for the Master's Use; and of all
that were brought into the great Supper and Marriage of the
King's Son, there were that were found without the Wedding
Garment; some made a Shew for a Season, and afterwards
fell away; there were that drew back; there were that made
Shipwrack of Faith, and of a Good Conscience; there were
not only such as did backslide themselves, but sought to draw
others into the same Perdition with themselves, seeking to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn
their Faith also; yea, there were that brought in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and
also of those Members that became not wholely corrupt (for
some were never again restored by repentance) there were that
were weak, and sickly, and young; some were to be fed with
Milk, and not with strong Meat; some were to be purged,
when the old Leaven received any place; and some to be cut
off for a season, to be shut out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it were, of the Camp for a
time, until their Leprosie were healed, and then to be received
in again.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as to Outwards, there was the Care of the Poor,
of the Widdow, of the Fatherless, of the Strangers, &amp;c. therefore
<hi>the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> who is the Head of the body, the Church
(for the Church is the Body of Christ, and the Saints are the
several Members of that Body) knowing in his infinite Wisdom
what was needful for the good ordering and disposing all things
in their proper Place, and for preserving and keeping all things
in their right Station, did in the Dispensation and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his holy Spirit minister unto every Member <hi>a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the same Spirit,</hi> yet diverse according to operation, for
the Edification of the Body, <hi>some Apostles, some Teachers, some
Pastors, some Elders</hi>; there are Old Men, there are Young
Men, there are Babes; for all are not Apostles, neither are all
Elders, neither are all Babes, yet are all Members, and as
such all have a Sense and Feeling of the Life of the Body, which
from the Head flows unto all the Body, <hi>is the Oyntment of</hi>
Aaron'<hi>s Beard unto the Skirts of his Garment</hi> and every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
has its place and Station in the Body, so long as it keeps
in the Life of the Body; and all have need one of another;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62828:7"/>
yet is no Member to assume another Place in the Body then
God has given it, nor yet to grudge or repine its Fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber's
Place, but to be content with its own; for the Uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Parts are no less needful then the Comely, and the less Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
then the more Honourable; which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
holds forth in <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 12. from Vers. 13 to 30.</p>
            <p>Now the Ground of all <hi>Schism, Divisions or Rents in the
Body,</hi> is, whenas any Member assumes another Place then is
allotted it, or being gone from the Life and Unity of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and loosing the Sense of it, lets in the Murmurer, the
Eye that watches for Evil, and not in holy Care over its Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-members;
and then, instead of coming down to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in it self, will stand up and judge its Fellow-members,
yea, the whole Body, or those whom God has set in a more
honourable and eminent Place in the Body then it self; such
suffer not the Word of Exhortation, and term the Reproofs
of Instruction (which is the Way of Life) Imposition and
Oppression, and are not aware how far they are in the things
they condemn others for, while they spare not to reprove and
revile all their Fellow-members, yet if they be but admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
themselves, they cry out as if their great Charter of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Liberty
were broken.</p>
            <p>Now, though such, and the Spirit by which they are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
be sufficiently seen and felt by Thousands, whose Hearts God
has so established as they are out of Danger of being intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in that Snare, and who have Power and Strength in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to judge that Spirit, even in its most subtil Appearances;
yet there are who cannot so well withstand the Subtilty and
seeming Sincerity, some such pretend to, though in measure
they have a sight of them; and others, that cannot so rightly
distinguish betwixt the Precious and the Vile; and some there
are, that through Weakness, and want of true Discerning, may
be deceived, and the Simplicity in them betrayed for a season,
as it is written, <hi>With Fair Speeches and Smooth Words they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Hearts of the Simple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore having, according to my measure, received an
Opening in my Understanding as to these things from the Light
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62828:8"/>
of the Lord, and having been for some time under the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Sense of them, I find at this instant a Freedom to commit
them to writing, for the more Universal Benefit and Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Now, for the more plain and clear opening and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of these things, it is fit to sum up this Treatise in these
following general Heads, to be considered of:</p>
            <p>First, <hi>From whence the Ground and Cause of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
is, the Rice and Root of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Whether there be now any Order and Government
in the Church of Christ</hi>?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>What is the Order and Government which we plead
for, in what Cases, and how far it may extend, in whom the
Power decisive is, and how it differeth; and is wholely another
then the Oppressing and Persecuting Principality of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and other Antichristian Assemblies.</hi>

CONTROVERSIE.</head>
            <p>VVHenas the Lord God by his mighty Power began
to visit the Nations with the Dawning of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Day (for thus I write unto those that have received and
believed the Truth) and that he sent forth his Instruments,
whom he had fitted and prepared for his Work, having fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
them, not according to the Wisdom and Will of Man,
but to his own heavenly Wisdom and Counsel; they went sorth
and preached the Gospel in the Evidence and Demonstration
of the Spirit, not in the Enticing Words of man's Wisdom,
but in Appearance, as Fools and mad to those that judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Man, but their Words and Testimony pierced through
into the Inner Man in the Heart, and reached to that of God in
the Conscience, whereby as many as were simple-hearted, and
waited for the Redemption of their Souls, received them as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62828:8"/>
the Messengers of the most high God, and their Words were
unto them, not as the Words of Men, but as the Words of
God; for in the receiving and imbracing the Testimony of
Truth through them, they felt their Souls eased, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Day began to dawn in and upon them. Now what
Evidence brought these Men to make their Testimony to be
received? did they entice? did they flatter? did they daub
up? did they preach Liberty to the Flesh, or Will of man?
Nay verily, they used no such Method, their Words were as
Thunder-Bolts, knocking down all that stood in their Way;
and pouring down the Judgement of God upon the Head of
the Transgressor every where: Did they spare the Zealous
Professor more then the open prophane? Nay verily, they
condemned equally, the Hypocrisie of the one, as well as the
Prophanity of the other, yet wanted they not regard to the
tender Seed, and Plant of God in either. Did they give way?
Did they yield to the Wisdom of man, to the Deceitfulness
of the Serpent, that would reason Truth from themselves,
saying, <hi>I must stay until I be convinced of this, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g to
be my Duty.</hi> How did they knock down this manner of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
by the Spirit of God which wrought mightily in them,
shewing and holding forth, that this is the Day of the Lord
that is dawned, that all are invited to come, that none ought
to tarry behind, that that which so pleadeth, is the same Spirit
which of old time said, in those that were invited, <hi>I cannot come
yet, I must first marry a Wife, I must go prove my Yoak of Oxen, I
must go visit my Possessions, let me first bury my dead Father</hi>? Did
not the Lord through them testifie and declare against these
things? and is there not a Cloud of Witnesses, who felt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
thus reasoning to keep us in the Forms, Fellowships, false
Worships and Foolish Fashions of this World, but we felt
as we were obedient, all these things to be for Condemnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that as we obeyed the pure manifestation of the Light of
Jesus in our Hearts, there was no Haesitation: We might and
should have parted with all those things at the first, and what
occasioned such Scruples, was but that which drew back,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62828:9"/>
through being unwilling to give pure Obedience to the Cross
of Christ; for as many as gave Obedience, and believed in
the Light, found no Occasion of stumbling; but such as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not, were condemned already, because they believed not
in him that appeared. Now the Boldness, and Courage, and

               </gap>,
Fear and Amazement in the Hearts of such as were
Ingenuous, that many began to be inwardly pricked, as in the
Days of old, and the Foundations of many began to be shaken,
and some that were asleep were awakened, and many that were
dead and buried in the Graves of Sin, and Formality, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
and Idolatry of all Sorts, were alarmed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were brought in from the Hedges and the High Ways, and
the Truth was received by Thousands with great Cheerfulness,
and a Readiness of Mind, and the Feet of those were beheld
to be beautiful upon the Mountains that brought the Glad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of these good things; &amp; great Lowliness and Simplicity of
Heart was upon such that were newly convi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ubjection to the Power,
both in themselves, and in those who were over them in the
Lord, and had gathered them into the Truth.</p>
            <p>But as it was in the Gatherings of old, so it also fell out in this
Day, all kept not their first Love, as among those Thousands
which <hi>Moses</hi> led out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and carried through the Red
Sea, who had sung praises to God upon the Banks of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
many Carcases fell in the Wilderness; some who murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and longed to return again to the Flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
some for opposing and contradicting the Servant, and Servants
of the Lord, whom the Lord had made Use of to lead them out
of Bondage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in saying, <hi>Ye take too much upon you, hath the
Lord indeed only spoken by</hi> Moses? <hi>hath he not spoken also by us</hi>?
And as among these Multitudes which were gathered by the
Apostles, there were many who continued not faithful to the
End; some returned back again with the Sow to the Puddle,
after they were washed; some embraced the present World;
some again separated themselves, being sensual and without
the Spirit, <hi>despising Dominion, and speaking Evil of Dignities,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62828:9"/>
their Mouths speaking great swelling Words, being puffed
up &amp; not abiding in these things which they were taught of the
Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So it is to be lamented, that among these many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
whom the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists,</hi> whom God raised
up in this Day, for the gathering of his Seed and People out
of spiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> into his pure Light and Life,
there are that have faln upon the right Hand and the left; some
are turned back again into <hi>Egypt,</hi> running into the same Excess
of Lust and Riot from whence they were once purified and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed;
some could not bear the Reproach of the Cross of
Christ, and were by and anon offended in him; some could
not bear the Tribulations, Sufferings and Persecutions which
came for the Truth's Sake, and the Seed in them was soon
scorched with the Heat of the Day; and some not abiding
in Subjection to the Truth in themselves, were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with that Place and Station in the Body, which God
had placed them in, but became vainly puft up in their Fleshly
Minds, intruding into those things which they have not seen,
and would needs be Innovators, given to change, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
new Doctrines and Practices, not only differing, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what was already delivered in the Beginning; making
Parties, causing Divisions and Rents, stumbling the weak, and
denying, despising and reviling the Apostles and Messengers of
Christ, the Elders of the Church, who loved not their Lives
unto Death, but through much Care, and Travail, and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and Whippings, and Bonds, and Beatings, in daily
Jeopardy gathered us by the mighty Power of God in the most
precious Truth. Yet in all this there hath nothing befaln us,
but what hath been the Ancient Lot of the Church of Christ in
the primitive times.</p>
            <p>Now he that was careful for his Church and People in old
times hath not been wanting to us in our Day, but as he has
again restored the Truth unto its primitive Integrity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
and as he has delivered our Understandings from
these false Doctrines &amp; Principles, which prevailed in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy;
So he hath not gathered us to be <hi>as Sheep scattered
without a Shepherd,</hi> that every one may run his own Way, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62828:10"/>
every one follow his own Will, and so to be as a confused
Mass or Chaos without any Order, but he, even the Lord hath
also gathered and is gathering us into the <hi>Good Order, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Government of his own Son the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi>
therefore he hath laid Care upon some beyond others, <hi>who
watch for the Souls of their Brethren, as they that must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi>

End gave Christ the Gifts mentioned <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12? And
how are the Saints perfected, and the Body of Christ edified of
those who come under the Cognizance, and as it were the Test
of this Order and Government? I may chiefly sum them up in
three sorts (though there be divers others little subdivided
Species of them.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, <hi>Those that turn openly back to the World again,</hi>
through finding the Way of Truth too narrow, these have
not been capable to do us any considerable Hurt; for being as
Salt that has lost its Savour, they mostly prove a Stink among
those to whom they go: And I never knew any of them that
proved any wayes steadable to those to whom they go. I find
other Professors make but small Boast of any Proselytes they
got out from among us: I hear little of their proving Cham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pions
for the Principles of others against us. And indeed, for
the most part they lose all Religion with the Truth; for I have
heard some of them say, <hi>That if ever they took on them to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
they would come back again to the</hi> Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Those who through Unwatchfulness, the secret
Corruption of their own Hearts, and the mysterious or hidden
Temptations of the Enemy, have fallen into his Snares; and
so have come under the Power of some Temptation or other,
either of Fleshly Lusts or of Spiritual Wickedness, who being
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62828:10"/>
seasonably warned by those that keep their Habitation, and
faithful Overseers in the Church, have been again restored by
unfeigned Repentance, not kicking against the Pricks, but
have rejoyced that others watched over them for their good,
and are become Monuments of God's Mercy unto this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such who being departed from their first Love,
Ancient Zeal for the Truth, become cold and lukewarm, &amp; yet
are ashamed to make open Apostacy, and to turn back again,
so as to deny all the Principles of Truth, they having had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
such Evidence of Clearness upon their Understanding,
yet not keeping low in their own Habitations, but being puffed
up, &amp; giving Way to the restless Imaginations of their exalted
and wandering Minds, fall out with their Brethren, cause Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
begin to find Fault with every thing and to look at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more than at themselves, with swelling Words to talk
of and preach up a higher Dispensation, while they are far
from living up to the Life and Perfection of this present, like
unto such who said, we will not have this Man to rule over us,
cry out of Formality and Apostacy, because they are not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in all Things, and if they be reproved for their Unruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
according to the good Order of the Church of Christ,
then they cry out, <hi>Breach of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iberty, Oppression, Persecution,</hi> we
will have none of your Order and Government, we were
taught to follow the Light in our Consciences, and not the
Orders of Men; well, of this hereafter, but this gave the
Rise of this Controversie, which leads me to that which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in the second place.</p>

            <p>IN Answer to this Proposition, I meddle not at this Time
with those that deny any such Thing <hi>as a Church of Christ,</hi>
I have reserved their Plea to another Place, neither need I to
be at much Pains to prove the Affirmative, to wit, <hi>That there
ought to be Government and Order in the Church of Christ,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Generallity of our Opposers, both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
who readily confess and acknowledge it, and have
heretofore blamed us for want of it, though now some of
them, and that of the highest Pretenders, are become so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
as to accuse us for the Use of it, improving it so
far as they can to our Disadvantage; for such is the Blindness
of partial Envy; that whereas the supposed Want of it was
once reckoned Heretical, now the present Performance of
it is counted Criminal.</p>
            <p>These then, to whom I come to prove this Thing are such,
who having cast off the Yoke of the Cross of Christ in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
refuse all Subjection or Government, denying that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such Thing ought to be, as disagreeing with the Testimony
of Truth; or those, who not being so wilful and obstinate in
their Minds, yet are fearful or scrupulous in the Matter, in
respect of the dangerous Consequences they may apprehend,
such a Thing may draw after it.</p>
            <p>For the clearing then, as well the Mistakes of the one, as
answering the Cavils of the other, I judge the Truth of these
following Assertions will sufficiently prove the Matter, which
I shall make no great Difficulty to evidence.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That Jesus Christ the King and Head of the Church,

did appoint and ordain that there should be Order, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Apostles and Primitive Christians,
when they were filled with the Holy Ghost, and immediately led
by the Spirit of God, did practise and commend it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the same Occasion and Necessity now occurring
which gave them Opportunity to exercise that Authority, the
Church of Christ hath the same Power now, as ever, and are
led by the same Spirit, into the same Practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the first, I know there are some, that the very Name
of a <hi>Church,</hi> and the very Words <hi>Order and Government,</hi> they
are affraid of. Now this I suppose hath proceeded because
of the great Hypocrisie, Deceit and Oppression that hath been
cloaked with the Pretence of these Things; but why should
the Truth be neglected because Hypocrites have pretended to
it? The right Institution of these Things, which have been
appointed and ordained by God, must not, nor ought not to
be despised, because corrupt Men have abused and perverted
them: I know not any thing that hath been more abused,
and pervented in the whole World, then the Name of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
shall we then renounce that Honourable Title, because
so many Thousands of wicked Men, yea, <hi>Antichrists</hi> have
falsly assumed it to themselves? The Man of Sin hath taken
upon him, <hi>to sit in the Temple of God, as God,</hi> yet we must
not therefore deny, <hi>that God is in his Temple,</hi> if the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of Satan</hi> hath assumed the Name of the Church of Christ,
and hath termed her Oppression and Violence, the Power and
Authority thereof, therefore must not the Church of Christ &amp; its
Authority be exercised, where it truly is according to his Mind?
This I prefix to warn all to beware of stumbling at things which
are innocent in themselves, and that we may labour to hold
the steady even Path of Truth, without running in either of the
extreams; for that Jesus Christ did appoint Order &amp; Government
to be in the Church is very clear from his plain Words,  <hi>Mat.</hi>
18. 15, 16, 17, 18. Ver. 15. <hi>Moreover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thy Brother shall tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
against thee, go tell him his Fault between thee and him alone,
of he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy Brother,</hi> Ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. <hi>But
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62828:12"/>
if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more,
that in the Mouth of two or three Witnesses, every Work may be
established,</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell
it unto the Church, but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him
be unto thee as an Heathen man, and a</hi> Publican, Ver. 18. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
I say unto you, whatsoever yee shall bind on Earth, shall
be bound in Heaven; and whatsoever yee shall loose on Earth,
shall be loosed in Heaven.</hi>     From which Scripture it doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
and evidently follow, <hi>First,</hi> that Jesus Christ intended
there should be a certain <hi>Order and Method in his Church,</hi> in
the Procedure towards such as transgress. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he
that refuseth to hear two is become more guilty (as hardned)
then in refusing to hear him that first reproved alone. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
That refusing to hear <hi>the Judgment of the Church,</hi> or whole
Assembly, he doth thereby exclude himself, and shut out
himself from being a Member, and is justly judged by his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
as a Heathen and a Publican.</p>
            <p>And lastly, That the Church, Gatherng, or Assembly of
God's People has Power to examin, and call to an Account
such as appearing to be among them, or owning the same Faith
with them, do transgress, and in Case of their refusing to hear,
or repent, to exclude them from their Fellowship, and that God
hath a special Regard to the Judgment and Sense of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
thus orderly proceeding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so as to hold such bound in
Heaven, whom they bind on Earth, and such loosed in Heaven,
whom they loose on Earth I am partly confident that no rational
Man will deny, but that these nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rally follow from the above
mentioned Scripture; and if there should be any found so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
as to deny it I could prove it by necessary and unevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Consequences, which at present, as taking it for granted, I
forbear to do. If it be reckoned so great a Crime to offend
one of the little ones, that it were better for him that so did,
that a Milstone were hanged about his Neck, and he were
drowned in the Depth of the Sea, without Question to offend
and gainsay the whole Flock, must be more criminal, and
must draw after it a far deeper Judgment.</p>
            <p>Now if there were <hi>no Order nor Government in the Church,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62828:12"/>
what should become of those that transgress? How should
they be again restored? would not this make all Reproving,
all Instructing, all Caring for, and Watching over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
void and null? Why should Christ have desired them
to proceed after this Method? Why doth he place so much
Weight upon the Judgment of the Church, as to make the
refusing of hearing it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to draw so deep a Censure after it, which
he will not have to follow the refusing to hear one or two apart,
though the Matter be one and the same, and so as to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
and Intrinsick Truth of the Thing, there lies the same
Obligation upon the Transgressor to hear that one, as
well as all; for that one adviseth him to that whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h is right and
good, as well as the whole, and they do but homologate or
confirm that which that one hath already asserted, yet Jesus
Christ who <hi>is the Author of Order, and not of Confusion</hi> will not
have a Brother cut off, or reputed a publican, for refusing to
hear one or two, but for refusing to hear the Chucrch. And if
it be objected, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and all other false
Churches makes use of this Scripture, and cover their Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titon,
and Cruelty, and Oppression by it, and thou sayes no
more then they say. I answer, I suppose no man will be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
as to affirm, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> abusing this
Scripture will make it false in it self, but how we differ in ours
Application of this Scripture shall be spoken of hereafter, I am
not now claiming Right to this Power, as due to us (that is
reserved for another Place) but this I say is that which I now
aver to be manifest from the Scripture Testimony, and to be
in it self an unquestionable Truth, <hi>That Jesus Christ intended
there should be Order and Government in his Church,</hi> which is
the Thing at present in hand to be proved, which if it be so
really true (as it cannot be denyed) then I hope it will also
necessarily follow, that such, who really and truely are the
Church of Christ, have Right to exercise this Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Apostles and primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
did practise Order and Government, we need but to
read the History of the Acts, of which I shall mention a few
pregnant and undeniable Testimonies, as we may observe in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62828:13"/>
the very first Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> from Verse 13 to the End,
where at the very first Meeting the Apostles and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ethren held
together after the Ascension of Christ, they began orderly to
appoint one to fulfil the Place of <hi>Judas,</hi> it may be thought
this was a needless Ceremony, yet we see how the Lord coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
it; hope none will say, that the Apostles appointing
of these two Men, or of him upon whom the Lot did not fall,
contradicted their inward Freedom, or imposed upon it, but
both agreed very well together, the one in the Will and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of God in appointing, and the other in the same in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to their Appointment.</p>
            <p>Moreover, after they had received the holy Ghost, you may
read <hi>Acts</hi> 6. so soon as there was an Opport unity, <hi>how they
wisely gave Order concerning the Distribution of the Poor,</hi> and
appointed some men for that Purpose. So here was <hi>Order and
Government</hi> according to the present Necessity of the Case,
<hi>and the Lord God was well pleased with it, and the Word of God
encreased, and the Number of the Disciples multiplied in</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>greatly.</hi>
 Might they not have said then, as some say now,
we will give our Charity to whom we see Cause, and we will
take no Notice of your Appointments and Orders? Whether,
would God have approved of such yea, or nay?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">W. M. in his Queries.</note>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When that the Business of Circumcision fell in
whether it was fit or not to circumcise the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> we see the
Apostles saw not meet <hi>to suffer every one to follow their own
Minds and Wills,</hi> They did not judge as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly
supposeth, <hi>that this Difference in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Exercise would commend the Vnity of the
true Faith,</hi> nay, they took another Method. It
is said expresly, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 6. <hi>And the Apostles and Elders
came together to consider of this Matter, and after there had been
much disputing about it</hi> (no doubt then, there was here Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of Opinions and Judgments) the Apostles and Elders
told their Judgments, and came also to a positive Conclusion;
sure some behoved to submit, else they should never have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed:
So those that were the Elders gave a positive Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and they were bold to say, <hi>That it pleased not only them,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62828:13"/>
but the Holy Ghost,</hi> by all which it doth undeniably appear that
the Apostles and primitive Saints practised a <hi>Holy Order and
Government</hi> among themselves, and I hope none will be so bold
as to say, they did these Things without the Leadings of the
Spirit of God, and his Power and Authority concurring, and
going along with them.</p>
            <p>And that these Things were not only singular Practices, but that
they held it doctrinally, that is to say, it was a Doctrine which
they preached, that there ought to be <hi>Order and Government
in the Church,</hi> is manifest from these following Testimonies,
<hi>1 Cor.</hi> 4. 15, 16, 17.  15 <hi>For though you have ten Thousand
Instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many Fathers; for in
Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel.</hi> 16. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I beseech you, be ye Followers of me.</hi> 17 <hi>For this Cause have
I sent unto you</hi> Timotheus, <hi>who is my beloved Son, and faithful
in the Lord, who shall bring you into Remembrance of my Wayes,
which be in Christ, as I teach every where, in every Church.</hi>  Here
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> is very absolute. <hi>First,</hi> In that he desires
them to be Followers of him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that he sends a
Teacher, yea, a Minister, and Eminent Bishop or Overseer
of the Church for to put them in mind of his Wayes, which
be in Christ, as he taught in every Church. No doubt there
were Apostates and Dissenting Spirits in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
that gave <hi>Paul</hi> Occasion thus to write, as he testifies in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Chapter, <hi>How he was judged by some of them</hi>;
he shews how they were grown high, ver. 8. <hi>Now ye are full,
now ye are rich, ye have reigned as Kings without us,</hi> &amp;c. Might
not these Dissenters of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> have reasoned
thus against <hi>Paul</hi>? Did not this <hi>Paul</hi> teach us at first to mind
the Measure of Grace in our selves, and follow that? (for no
doubt, that was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine) but now he begins to Lord
over us, and tells us, we must be Followers of him; might
not they have judged the Beloved <hi>Timothy</hi> to be far out of his
Place? might they not have said, it seems it is not God that
moved thee, and sent thee here by his Spirit, but Lordly <hi>Paul</hi>
that seeks Dominion over our Faith, it seems thou comes not
here to preach Christ, and with us to be Followers of him, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62828:14"/>
of his Grace in our Hearts, but to mind us to follow <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Wayes, and take Notice how he teaches in every Church, we
are not concerned with him, nor with his M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssenger, nor with
none of your Orders, and so sorth. Doth not this run very
plausible? I question not but there was such a Reasoning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Apostate <hi>Corinthians</hi>; let such as are of the same
kind among us examin seriously, and measure their Spirits tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hereby. Yea, he goes yet further in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ver. 3, 4.—3. <hi>As absent in Body, but present in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
have judged already, as though I were present concerning
him that hath so done this Deed.</hi> 4. <hi>In the Name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit with
the Power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. Would not one think
this to have been a very presumptuous Word, and yet who
dare offer to condemn it, from all which I shall shortly observe,
that it seems it was judged no Inconsistency, nor Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be Followers of the Grace in themselves, to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their own Hearts, and also to be Followers of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Paul,</hi> and of his Wayes, because his Wayes and Example
was no other, then the Spirit of God in themselves would have
led them to, if they had been obedient, therefore he found it
needful to charge them positively to follow him without d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this Reason: Next the great Argument the Apostle uses
to perswade them hereunto, upon which he mainly insists
because he had begotten them into the Truth, <hi>Ye have not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the
Gospel, wherefore I beseech you, be ye Followers of me.</hi> So he
makes that as the Cause, which the same Apostle also in his
Expostulation with the <hi>Galatians,</hi> putting them in mind how
he preached the Gospel to them at first, and Chap. 14. Ver. 15.
<hi>Where is then the Blessedness ye spoke of; for I bear you Record,
if possible you would have plucked out your own Eyes, and given
them unto me.</hi> We see then that the Lord hath, &amp; doth give such
whom he hath furnished, and sent forth to gather a People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himself, Care and Oversight over that People, yea, and a
certain Authority in the Power over them to bring them back
to their Duty, when they stray at any Time; and to appoint,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62828:14"/>
yea, and command such Things as are needful for Peace, and
Order, and Unity Sake, and that there lies an Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such as are so gathered, to reverence, honour, yea, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
such as are set over them in the Lord; for saith the same
Apostle, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>For to this End also did I write, that I
might know the Proof of you, whether you be obedient in all Things.</hi>
And Chap. 7. Ver. 13, 15.—<hi>Yea, and exceedingly the more
joyed we for the Joy of</hi> Titus, <hi>because his Spirit was refreshed by
you all.</hi> 15. <hi>And his inward Affection is more abundant toward
you, whilest he remembreth the Obedience of you all, how with
Fear and Trembling you received him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this will not at all infer, as if they had been implicitly
led of old, or that such as having the same Authority, exercise
it now, sought Dominion over their Brethrens Faith, or to
force them to do any Thing beyond, far less contrary to what
the Lord leads us to by his Spirit; but we know, as they did
of old, that the Enemy lies near to betray under such Pretences
and that seeing in case of Difference the Lord hath, and doth
and will reveal his Will to his People, and hath and doth
raise up Members of his Body, to whom he gives <hi>a Discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Power and Authority to instruct, reprove, yea, and
command in some Cases,</hi> and that those that are faithful, and
low in their Minds, keeping their own Places, and minding
the Lord, and the Interest and Good of his Truth in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
over all they shut out the Murmurer, and the Spirit of
God leads them to have Unity, and concur with their Brethren,
but such as are heady, and high-minded, are inwardly vexed
that any should lead or rule but themselves, and so it is the
high Thing in themselves that makes them quarrel others for
taking so much upon them, pretending a Liberty, not sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down in the Seed to be—willing to be of no Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for its Sake, such rather then give up their own Wills, will
study to make Rents and Divisions, not sparing the Flock,
but prostrating the Reputation and Honour of the Truth
even to the World, ministring to them an Occasion of Scorn,
and Laughter, to the harding them in their Wickedness and
Atheism.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62828:15"/>
Besides these Scriptures mentioned, I shall set down a few of
many more that might be instanced to the same Purpose.</p>

Fear of God.</hi>
            </p>

them which walk so, as ye have us for an Ensample.</hi>

            <p>I might at length enlarge, if needful, upon these Passages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any
of which is sufficient to prove the Matter in Hand, but that
what is said may satisfie, such as are not wilfully blind and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
for there can be nothing more plain from these Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
then that the Ancient Apostles, &amp; Primitive Christians practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Order and Government in the Church</hi>; that some did appoint,
and ordain certain Things, condemn and approve certain Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
as well as Doctrines by the Spirit of God; that there
lay an Obligation in Point of Duty upon others to obey and
submit; that this was no Encroachment nor-Imposition upon
their Christian-Liberty, nor any Wayes contradictory to their
being inwardly and immediately led by the Spirit of God in
their Hearts; and lastly, that such as are in the true Feeling
and Sense will find it their Places to obey, and be one with the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62828:16"/>
Church of Christ in such like Cases, and that it's such as have
lost their Sense and Feeling <hi>of the Life of the Body,</hi> that dissent
and are disobedient under the false Prentence of Liberty, so
that thus is sufficiently proven what I undertook in this Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> I judge there will need no great Arguments to prove
the People of God may &amp; do well to exercise the like Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the very like Occasion; for even Reason may teach
us, that what proved good &amp; wholsom Cures to the Distemper
of the Church in former Ages, will not now, the very like Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers
falling in, prove hurtful and poysonable, especially <hi>if
we have the Testimony of the same Spirit in our Hearts, not only
allowing us, but commanding us so to do.</hi> It is manifest (though
we are sorry for it) that the same Occasions now fall in, we
find that there are that have eaten and drunken with us at the
Table of the Lord, and have been Sharers of the same spiritual
Joy and Consolation that afterwards fall away, we find (to our
great Grief) that some walk disorderly, and some are puffed
up, and strive to sow Division, labouring to stumble the
weak, and to cause Offences in the Church of Christ: What
then is more suitable, and more christian, then to follow the
Foot-steps of the Flock, and to labour and travail for the good
of the Church, and for the removing all that is hurtful, even
as the holy Apostles, who walked with Jesus, did before us?
If there be such as walk disorderly now, must not they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished,
rebuked and withdrawn from, as well as of old?
or, is such to be the Condition of the Church in these latter
Times, that all Iniquity must go unreproved? Must it be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
or Oppression to watch over one another in Love, to take
Care for the Poor, to see that there be no corrupt, no defiled
Members of the Body, and carefully and christianly deal with
them, for restoring them, if possible, and for withdrawing
from them, if incureable? I am perswaded that there are none
that look upon the Commands of Christ and his Apostles, the
Practice and Experience of the primitive Church and Saints, as
a sufficient President to authorize a Practice now, that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Lawfulness or Usefulness hereof, but must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Necessity of it. But if it be objected, as some
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62828:16"/>
have done, Do not you deny that the Scripture is the adequate
Rule of Faith and Manners, and that the Commands or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of the Scripture, are not a sufficient Warrant for you now
to do any thing without you be again authorized, and led unto
it by the same Spirit, and upon that Score, do you not forbear
some things, both practised and commanded by the primitive
Church and Saints?</p>
            <p>Well, I hope I have not any thing weakned this Objection,
but presented it in its full Vigour and Strength, to which I
shall clearly and distinctly answer thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Seasons and Times do not alter the Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Things in themselves, though it may cause Things to
alter, as to the Usefulness, or not Usefulness of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Things commanded and practised at certain times
and seasons fall of themselves, whenas the Cause and Ground
for which they were commanded is removed, as there is no
need now for the Decision about Circumcision, seeing there
are none contend for it, neither as to the Orders concerning
Things offered to Idols, seeing there is now no such Occasion,
yet who will say, that the Command enjoyn'd in the same Place,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 20. <hi>To abstain from Fornication,</hi> is now made void,
seeing there is daily need for its standing in Force, because it
yet remains as a Temptation man is incident to? We confess
indeed we are against such, as from the bare Letter of the
Scripture (though if it were seasonable now to debate it, we
find but few to deal with, whose Practises are so exactly squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
seek to uphold <hi>Customs, Forms or Shaddows,</hi> when the Use
for which they were appointed, is removed, or the Substance it
self known and witnessed, as we have sufficiently elsewhere an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
our Opposers, in the Case <hi>of Water-Baptism, and
Bread and Wine,</hi> &amp;c. so that the Objection, as to that, doth
not hold, and the Difference is very wide, in respect of such
Things, the very Nature and Substance of which can never be
dispensed with by the People of God so long as they are in this
World, yea, without which they could not be his People; for
the Doctrines, and fundamental Principles of the Christian
Faith, we own and believe originally and principally, because
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62828:17"/>
they are the Truths of God, whereunto the Spirit of God in
our Hearts hath constrained our Understandings to obey and
submit. In the second Place we are greatly confirmed, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and comforted in the joint Testimony of our Brethren,
<hi>the Apostles and Disciples of Christ,</hi> who by the Revelation of
the same Spirit in the Dayes of old believed and have left upon
record the same Truths, <hi>so we having the same Spirit of Faith,
according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
we also believe, and therefore we speak</hi>; and we deny not
but some that from the Letter have had the Notion of these
Things, have thereby in the Mercy of God received Occasion
to have them revealed in the Life; for we freely acknowledge
(though often calumniated to the contrary) that <hi>whatsoever
Things were written aforetime, were written for our learning,
that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures may have
Hope.</hi> So then, I hope if the Spirit of God lead me now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that which is good, profitable, yea, and absolutely need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
in order to the keeping my Conscience clear and void of
Offence towards God and Man, none will be so unreasonable
as to say, I ought not to do it, <hi>because it is according to the
Scriptures,</hi> nor do I think it will savour ill among any serious
solid Christians, for me to be the more confirmed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that I am led to this Thing by the Spirit, that I find it in
it self good and useful; and that upon the like Occasions Christ
commanded it, the Apostles and Primitive Christians practised
and recommended it.</p>
            <p>Now seeing it is so that we can boldly say with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in the Sight of God, that the same Spirit which leads us
to believe the Doctrines and Principles of the Truth, and to
hold them and maintain them again after the Apostacy, in their
primitive and ancient Purity, as they were delivered by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
of Christ in the holy Scriptures, I say, that the same
Spirit doth now lead us into the like <hi>holy Order and Government</hi>
to be exercised among us as it was among them, being now
the like Occasion and Opportunity ministred to us therefore,
what can any Christianly or Rationally object against it; for that
there is a Real Cause for it, the thing it self speaketh, and that it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62828:17"/>
was the Practice of the Saints and Church of old is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
what kind of Ground then can any such Opposers have
(for to such, as scrupling at this, do notwithstanding acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our Principle) that this were done <hi>by Imposition or Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
more then the Belief of the Doctrines and Principles,
seeing as it is needful to use all Diligence to convince and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
People of the Truth, and bring them to the Belief of it
(which yet we cannot do, but as Truth moves and draws in
their Hearts) it is also no less needful, when a People is gathered,
to keep and preserve them in Unity and Love, <hi>as becomes the
Church of Christ,</hi> and to be careful, as saith the Apostle, <hi>That all
Things be done decently and in Order,</hi> and that all that is wrong
be removed according to the Method of the Gospel, and the
good cherished and encouraged, so that we conclude, and
that upon very good Grounds, <hi>that there ought now, as well
as heretofore to be Order &amp; Government in the Church of Christ,</hi>
that which now cometh to be examined in the third Place is,</p>
            <p>First, <hi>What is the Order and Government we plead for</hi>?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>In what Cases, and how far it may extend, and
in whom the Power decisive is</hi>?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>How it differeth, and is wholely an other then the
oppressive and persecuting Principallity of the Church of</hi> Rome,
<hi>and other Antichristian Assemblies</hi>?</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Order and Government which we
plead for.</head>
            <p>IT will be needful then before I proceed to describe <hi>the Order
&amp; Government of the Church,</hi> to consider what is or may be
properly understood by the <hi>Church,</hi> for some, as I touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62828:18"/>
seem to be offended, or at least afraid of the very Word,
because <hi>The Power of the Church, the Order of the Church, the
Judgment of the Church</hi> and such like Pretences, have been the
great Weapons wherewith <hi>Antichrist</hi> and the Apostate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
have been these many Generations persecuting the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and warring against the Man-child; and indeed great
Disputes have been among the Learned Rabbies in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
concerning <hi>this Church</hi> what it is, or what may be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted,
which I find not my Place at present to dive much in,
but shall only give the true Sense of it, according to Truth, and
the Scriptures plain Testimony.</p>
            <p>The Word <hi>Church</hi> in it self, and as used in the Scriptures, is
no other but <hi>a Gathering, Company, or Assembly of certain
People,</hi> called or gathered together; for so the <hi>Greek</hi> Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies, which is that the Translators render
<hi>Church,</hi> which Word is derived from the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i.
e. <hi>evoco,</hi> I call out of, from the Root <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>voco,</hi> I call.
Now though the English Word <hi>Church</hi> be only taken in such
a Sense, as People are gathered together upon a Religious
Account, yet the <hi>Greek</hi> Word that is so rendered, is taken in
general for every Gathering or Meeting together of People,
and therefore where it is said, <hi>The Town-Clark of the</hi> Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<hi>dismissed the Tumult</hi> that was gathered there together, the
same <hi>Greek</hi> Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is used, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 41. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
he dismissed the Assembly or the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Church</hi> then in the Scripture Phrase, is no other then a
Meeting or Gathering of certain People, which (if it be taken
in a religious Sense, as most commonly it is) are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the Belief of the same Principles, Doctrines and
Points of Faith, whereby as a Body they become distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from others, and have a certain Relation among themselves,
and a conjunct Interest to the maintaining and propagating
these Principles they judge to be right, and therefore have a
certain Care, and Oversight over on another, to prevent and
remove all Occasions that may tend to break this their conjunct
Interest, hinder the Propagation of it, or bring Infamy, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62828:18"/>
or Contumely upon it, or give such as on the other
Hand are or may be banded together to undo them, just Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
against them, to decry and defame them.</p>
            <p>Now the Way to distinguish that <hi>Church,</hi> Gathering,
or Assembly of People, whereof Christ truly is the Head, from
snch as falsly pretend thereto, is by considering the Principles, &amp;
Grounds upon which they are gathered together, the Nature of
that Hierarchy &amp; Order they have among themselves, the Way
and Method they take to uphold it, and the Bottom upon which
it standeth which will greatly contribute to clear all Mistakes.</p>
            <p>Forasmuch as <hi>Sanctification and Holiness</hi> is the great and
chief End among true Christians, which moves them to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together, therefore the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> defines the Church in
his Salutation to the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Vnto the Church
of God which is at</hi> Corinth, <hi>them that are sanctified in Christ
Jesus, called to be Saints,</hi> so the Church is such as are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in Christ Jesus called to be Saints.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Power and Authority, Order and Government</hi> we speak
of, is such as a Church, Meeting, Gathering, or Assembly
claims towards those that have or do declare themselves Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
who own, believe and profess the same Doctrines and
Principles of Faith with us, and go under the same Distinction
and Denomination, whose Escapes, Faults and Errors may by
our Adversaries justly be imputed to us, if not seasonably and
christianly, reproved, reclaimed, or condemned; for we are
not so foolish, as to concern our selves with those who are not
of us, far less, who stand in Opposition to us, so as to reprove,
instruct, or reclaim them, as Fellow Members, or Brethren,
yet with a Respect to remove the general Reproach from the
Christian Name, with a tender Regard to the good of their
immortal Souls, for the Zeal we owe to God's Glory, and for
the Exaltation and Propagation of his Everlasting Truth and
Gospel in the Earth, we have not been wanting with the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of our Lives to seek the scattered ones, holding forth the
Living and Sure Foundation, and inviting and perswading all to
<hi>obey the Gospel of Christ,</hi> and to take Notice of his Reproofs,
as he makes himself manifest in and by <hi>his Light</hi> in their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62828:19"/>
Hearts; so our Care and Travail is and hath been towards
those that are without, that we may bring them into the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of the Saints in Light; and towards those that are
brought in, that they may not be led out again, or drawn aside,
either to the left Hand or the right, by the Workings and
Temptations of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>These Things being thus cleared and opened, we do posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
affirm, that we being a People gathered together by the
Power of God (which most if not all of those that arising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our selves, do oppose us herein, have acknowledged)
into the Belief of certain Principles and Doctrines, and also
certain Practices &amp; Performances, by which we are come to be
separated and distinguished from others, so as to meet apart,
and also to suffer deeply for our Joint-Testimony, there are
and must of Necessity be, as in the gathering of us, so in the
preserving of us while gathered, Diversities of Gifts and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for the edifying of the whole Body. Hence saith the
Apostle, <hi>1 Tim.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
worthy of double Honour, especially they who labour in the
Word and Doctrine,</hi> &amp; this we suppose neither to be <hi>Popish</hi> nor
<hi>Antichristian,</hi> let our Opposers say it as oft as they can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reckoning the Apostles such.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Forasmuch as all are not called in the same Station,
some rich, some poor, some Servants, some Masters, some
married, some unmarried, some Widdows, and some Orphans,
and so forth, it is not only convenient, but absolutely needfull
that there be certain Meetings at certain Places and Times,
as may best sute the Conveniencies of such who may be most
particularly concerned in them, where both those that are to
take Care may assemble, and those who may need this Care
may come and make known their Necessities, and receive help,
whether by Counsel, or Supply, according to their respective
Needs. This doth not at all contradict the Principle of being
<hi>led inwardly and immediately by the Spirit,</hi> else how came the
Apostle in that Day of the Powerful pouring forth of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God to set apart Men for this Purpose? sure this was not
to lead them from their inward Guide, yea, of the contrary it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62828:19"/>
is expresly said, <hi>Look ye out among you Seven men of honest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
full of the Holy Ghost and Wisdom, whom we may appoint
over this Business.</hi> Sure they were not to undertake a Business
being full of the Holy Ghost, which might import a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to their being led by it: So we see it is both fit, and suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Apostles Doctrine to have <hi>Meetings about Business.</hi>
Now if any should be so whimsical or conceited, as to scruple
their being at set Places and Times, though these be nothing
relative to the Essential parts, but only Circumstances relating
to the Conveniency of our Persons, which we must have Regard
to so long as we are cloathed with Flesh and Blood; and such
Notionists as are against this Godly Care, work far more in
their vain Imaginations, than they reduce to Practice, being
like unto such of whom the Apostle <hi>James</hi> testified, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves with saying to <hi>the Naked, be clothed; and to
the hungry, be fed,</hi> while they offer not in the least to minister
to them those Things which are needful for clothing and Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of them, yet shall we not scruple to make it appear, that
it is not without very good Ground that we both appoint Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Times, and First, as to the Place, I say as before, it
is with our Bodies we must meet, as well as with our Spirits,
and so of Necessity we must convey our Bodies unto one Place,
that we may speak and act in those Things we meet for, and
that must be in some certain Place, where all must know where
to find it, having herein a regard to the Conveniencies and
Occasions of such as meet. Were it fit that those of the Church
of <hi>Corinth</hi> should go do their Business at <hi>Antioch,</hi> or the <hi>Church
of Jerusalem</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>? Nay surely, God hath not given us our
Reasons to no Purpose, but that we should make use for his
Glory, and the good of our Brethren, <hi>yet alwayes in Subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
to his Power and Spirit,</hi> and therefore we have respect to
these Things in the appointing of our Meetings, and do it not
without a Regard to the Lord, but in a Sense of his Fear. And
so the like as to Times, which is no contradicting of the inward
Leading of the Spirit, else how came the Apostle to appoint a
Time to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in their Contributions, desiring them
<hi>1 Cor.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>To lay by them in store upon the first Day of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62828:20"/>
Week, yea,</hi> saith he, <hi>not that he gave the same Order to the
Church of</hi> Galatia. I know not how any in Reason can quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
Set-Times for outward Business, it being done in a Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to God's Will, as all Things ought to be, or else, how
can such as so do but quarrel the Apostle for this Imposition
(at that Rate) upon the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia</hi>?
We appoint no set Times for the Performance of the Worship
of God, so as to appoint men to preach and pray at such and
such Set-times, though we appoint times to meet together <hi>in
the Name of the Lord,</hi> that we may feel his Presence, and he
may move in and through whom he pleaseth without Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which Practice of meeting together, we are greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to by the Promise of Christ, and our own blessed Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and also we are severely prohibited to lay it aside by
the holy Apostle, and also on the other Hand by the sad Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of such as by Negligence or Prejudice, forsake the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of God's People, upon many of which is already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
and upon others daily fulfilling the Judgments threatned
upon such Transgressors, read <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. from ver. 23. to the
End, where that Duty is so seriously exhorted to, and the
Contempt of it reckoned <hi>a wilfull Sin,</hi> almost, if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unpardonable, yea, a <hi>Treading under Foot the Son of God,
and a Doing Despite to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> which is fulfilled in
our Day, and proves the lamentable Fruits of such as have so
backsliden among us; and therefore having so much good and
real Ground for what we do herein, together with the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
and Encouragment of Christ and his Apostles, both by
Command and Practice, we can, as that which both the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi>
and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Foundation and Cap-stone, faithfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
in good Conscience, <hi>That God hath led us by his Spirit,
both to appoint Places and Times, where we may see the Faces
one of another,</hi> and to take Care one for another, provoking
one another to Love and good Works; and our Faith and
Cofidence herein cannot be staggered by a meer Denial in our
Opposers, which no man of Conscience and Reason will say it
ought, seeing the Thing it self hath such a solid and real Cause
and Foundation, so good and suitable a Patern and Example,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62828:20"/>
and that it is constantly confirmed to us, both by <hi>the Testimony
of God's Spirit in our Hearts,</hi> and by the good Fruits and Effects
which we daily reap thereby, as a Seal and Confirmation that
God is well pleased therewith, and approveth us in it.</p>
            <p>Having thus far proceeded to shew that there ought <hi>to be
Order and Government</hi> among the People of God, and that, that
which we plead for is, that there may be certain Meetings set
apart for that End, it is next to be considered in what Cases,
and how far it may extend.</p>

            <p>I shall begin with that which gave the first Rise for this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
among the Apostles, and I do verily believe might have
been among the first Occasions that gave the like among us,
and that is, <hi>The Care of the Poor, of Widdows and Orphans.</hi>
Love and Compassion are the great, yea, and the chiefest
Marks of Christianity. <hi>Hereby shall it be known,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>that
ye are my Disciples, if ye love one another.</hi> And <hi>James</hi> the Apostle
places Religion herein in the first place, <hi>Pure Religion</hi> (saith he)
<hi>and Vndefiled before God and the Father is, to visit the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and Widdows in their Afflictions, &amp;c.</hi> For this then, as
one main End do we meet together that Inquiry may be made,
if there be any poor of the Houshould of Faith, that need, that
they may be supplied, that the Widdows may be taken Care
of, that the Orphans and Fatherless may be bred up and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Who will be so unchristian, as to reprove this <hi>good Order
and Government,</hi> and to say, it is needless? but if any will thus
object, <hi>May not the Spirit lead every one of you to give to them
that need? What needs meeting about it, and such Formalities?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:62828:21"/>
I answer, The Spirit of God leads us so to do; what can they say
to the contrary? nor is this a Practice any ways inconsistent with
being inwardly and immediately led by the Spirit; for the Spirit
of God doth now as well as in the Dayes of old; lead his People
into those Things which are orderly, and of a good Report; <hi>for
he is the God of Order, and not of Confusion,</hi> &amp; therefore the Holy
Apostles judged it no Inconsistency with their being led by the
Spirit to appoint <hi>Men full of the Holy Ghost and of Wisdom over
the Business of the poor.</hi> Now if to be full of the Holy Ghost
be a Qualification needfull for this Imployment, surely the
Nature of their Imployment was not to render this so needful
a Qualification useless, and ineffectual, as if they were not to
be led by it</p>
            <p>Moreover, we see, though they were at that Time all filled
with the Spirit, yet there was something wanting before this
good Order was established. <hi>There was a Murmuring that
some Widdows were neglected in the daily Ministration,</hi> and we
must not suppose the Apostles went about to remedy this Evil
that was creeping into the Church without the Counsel of God
by his Spirit, or that this Remedy they were led to, was step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
into the Apostacy, neither can it be so said of us, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
upon the like Occasion.</p>
            <p>If then it be thus needful, and suitable to the Gospel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Necessities of the poor, that as there <hi>was no Begger
to be among</hi> Israel <hi>of old,</hi> so far less now, must there not be
Meetings to appoint Contribution in Order to the performing
these Things, which is no other but the giving of a general Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
what the needs are, that every one, as God moves
sheir Hearts, and hath prospered them, without Imposition,
Force or Limitation, may give towards these needful Uses, in
which Case these Murmurers at our good order in such matters
may well think strange at the Apostle. How pressingly? how
earnestly doth he reiterate his Desires and Provocations, so to
speak, in this Respect to the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2, and
the 8th and 9th Chapters of the 2d Epistle throughout!</p>
            <p>Now though he testifies to them elsewhere that <hi>they are the
Temples of the Holy Ghost, and that the Spirit of God dwells in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62828:21"/>
them,</hi> yet ceaseth he not to intreat and exhort, yea, and to
give them certain Orders in this Matter.</p>
            <p>Besides all these Reasons which are sufficient to convince any
unprejudicate man, the <hi>Secret Approbation of God's Spirit</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
us in this Thing, together with the Fruits and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it which hundreds can witness to, whose Needs have
been supplied, and themselves helped through divers Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and the Testimonies of some already, &amp; of many more
Orphans and Fatherless Children, who have found no want nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Father nor Mother, or other Relations through the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Love and Care of God's People in putting them in Trades
and Imployments and giving them all needfull Education which
will make it appear ere this Age pass away to those that have an
Eye to see, that these are not the meer Doings and Orders of
Men, <hi>but the Work of him who is appearing in ten Thousands of
his Saints to establish, not only Truth, but Mercy and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for that End therefore in the second Place this Order
reacheth the taking up and composing of Differences as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Things, which may fall out betwixt Friend and Friend;
for such Things may fall out through the Intricacies of diverse
Affairs, where neither hath any positive Intention to injure and
defraud his Neighbour, as in many Cases might be instanced;
or if through the Workings and Temptations of him; whose
Work is to beset the Faithful, and People of the Lord; and to
engender, so far as he can, Strise and Division among them,
any should step aside, as to offer to wrong, or prejudge his
Neighbour; we do boldly aver, as a People gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Lord unto the same Faith, and distinguished from
all others by our Joint Testimony and Sufferings, that we have
Power and Authority to decide and remove these things among
our selves, without going to others to seek Redress, and this
in it self hath so much Reason, that I cannot tell if any that are
not wholely prejudicate or obstinate can blame it; for if we be
of one Mind concerning Faith and Religion, and that it be our
Joint-Interest to bring all others unto the same Truth with us,
as supposing them to be wrong, what Confidence can we have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62828:22"/>
to think of reclaiming them, if the Truth we profess have not
Efficacy as to reconcile us among our selves in the Matters of
this World, if we be forced to go out to others for <hi>Equity and
Justice,</hi> because we cannot find it among our selves: how can we
expect to invite them to come among us, when such Virtues as
which still accompany the Truth, are necessarily supposed to
be wanting, should we affirm otherwise it were to destroy the
Truth and Faith we have been and are in the Lord's Hand
building up, and indeed the Spirit and Practice of such as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us herein, hath no less Tendency.</p>
            <p>Moreover, besides the Enforcing and Intrinsick Reason of
this Thing, we have the Concurrence, Approbation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the Apostles Testimony, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>Dare any of you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a matter against another go to Law before the Vnjust, and
not before the Saints?</hi> If it be objected, <hi>Do you reckon all Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
that are not of you? Think ye all other People void of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, Though the Apostle useth this Expression, I am
perswaded he did not reckon all others—Unjust that had
not received then the Christian Faith; there was no doubt
Morall and Just Men among the Heathen, and therefore the
same <hi>Paul</hi> commends the Nobility of <hi>Festus,</hi> he reckons them
there Unjust in Respect of the Saints, or comparatively with
them, as such as are not come to the just principle of God in
themselves to obey it and follow it, and therefore though he
accounts them who are least—esteemed in the Church ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to decide such Matters, yet he supposeth it safer to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to their Judgment in such Cases, though it were <hi>by taking
wrong, or suffering wrong,</hi> then to go before others to the
greater Reproach of the Truth. We hope though many Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of this kind have fallen in among us since we have been a
People, none have had just occasion to decline our Judgment,
and though some should suppose themselves to be wronged, yet
if they should go bring their matter before others, we might
say, as the Apostle saith in the forementioned Chapter, ver. 7.
<hi>This were thereby a Fault in them,</hi> and would evidence a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Care of some outward Concern, then of the Honour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62828:22"/>
of Truth, and therefore such as have a tender Regard
that Way, would rather suffer what to their Apprehensions
may seem wrong; for in matters wherein two Parties are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
in the Case of <hi>Meum and Tuum,</hi> it is somewhat hard to
please both, except where the Power of Truth, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judgment thereof reaching to that of God in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
hath brought to a true Acknowledgment, him that hath
been mistaken, or in the wrong, which hath frequently fallen out
among us, to the often refreshing and confirming our Souls in
the certain Belief, that Christ was fulfilling his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Promises among
us, <hi>In restoring Judges, as at the first, and Counsellors, as in the
Beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now suppose any should be so pettish or humorous, as not
to agree in such Matters to the Judgment of his Brethren, and to
go before the Unbelievers (for though I reckon them not such
Unbelievers as the Heathen of old, because they profess a Faith
in God and Christ, yet I may safely say, they are Unbelievers,
as to these Principles and Doctrines which we know are the
Truth of God, and in that Sense must be Unbelievers as to him
that so appealeth to them from his Brethren) I say, such as so
do, first commit a certain Hurt and Evil in staining the Honour
and Reputation of the Truth they profess, which ought to be
dearer to us then our Lives, and even in that outward Matter,
for which they thus do, they run a Hazard, not knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things shall carry as they expect; if they loose, they have
a double prejudice, if they gain it is a too dear Rate, even with
the Hurt of Truth's Reputation, which their outward Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
cannot make up. If then it be unlawfull to do evil, that
good may come of it, even a Spiritual Good, far less is it
lawful to do a positive Evil of so deep a Dye, as to bring an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Report upon the good Land; and give the Uncircumcised an
Occasion to rejoyce, out of the Uncertain Hope of an outward
Gain, it is far better to suffer Loss, as the Apostle very well
argues in the Place above mentioned.</p>
            <p>Indeed if there be any such, have been, or appear to be of us,
as suppose <hi>there is not a wise Man among us all, nor an honest
Man that is able to judge betwixt his Brethren.</hi> We shall not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62828:23"/>
covet to meddle in their Matter, being perswaded that either
they or their Cause is naught (thought Praises to Go)d among all,
those that have gone from us, either upon one Account or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I never heard that any were so minded towards us, but
the most part of them having let in the Offence of somethings
or persons, have had this Unanimous Testimony concerning
us, that <hi>generally we are an honest and upright-hearted People,</hi>
but whatever Sense our Enemies or Apostates have of us, who
look asquaint on the Face of Truth, and can see nothing aright in
those they love not, or are prejudicate against. This we can
say in the last Place, besides the Reasons and Scripture above
declared, that the good Fruits and Effects which daily abound
to the Houshold of Faith, in this as well as the other Parts of
the Government the Lord is establishing among us, doth more
&amp; more commend it unto us, and confirmeth our Hearts in the
certain Belief of that which we can confidently testifie in good
Conscience, <hi>that God hath led us hereunto by his Spirit,</hi> and we
see the Hand of the Lord herein, which in due Time will yet
more appear, that as through our faithful Testimony in the
Hand of the Lord that Antichristian and Apostatized Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>the National Ministry</hi> hath received a deadly Blow by
our discovering and witnessing against their Forced Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and Tythes, against which we have testified by many
cruel Sufferings of all kinds (as our Chronicles shall make
known to Generations to come) so that their Kingdom in the
Hearts of Thousands begins to totter and loose its Strength, and
shall assuredly fall to the Ground, through Truth's prevailing
in the Earth, so on the other Hand, do we by coming to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and Innocency, weaken the Strength of their Kingdom
who judge for Rewards (as well as such as preach for Hire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
and by not ministring Occasion to those, who have heaped up
Riches, and lived in Excess, Lust and Riot, by feeding and
preying upon the Iniquities and Contentions of the People;
for as Truth and Righteousness prevails in the Earth, by our
faithful witnessing and keeping to it, the Nations shall come to
be eased and disburdned of that deceitful Tribe of <hi>Lawyers,</hi> as
well as <hi>Priests,</hi> who by their many Tricks, and Endless Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62828:23"/>
have rendered Justice in their Method burdensom to
honest Men, and seek not so much to put an End, as to foment
Controversies and Contentions, that they themselves may be
still fed and upheld, and their Trade kept up. Whereas by
Truth's Propagation, as many of these Controversies will dye
by Mens coming to be less contentious, so when any Difference
ariseth, the Saints giving Judgment <hi>without Gift or Reward,</hi> or
running into the Tricks and endless <hi>Labyrinths of the Lawyers,</hi>
will soon compose them, and this is that we are perswaded the
Lord is bringing about in our Day, though many do not, and
many will not see it, because it is indeed in a Way different
and contrary to Man's Wisdom, who are now despising Christ
in his inward Appearance, because of the Meanness of it, as the
<hi>Jews</hi> of old did him in his outward, yet notwithstanding there
were some then that did witness and could not be silent, but
must testifie that he was come; even so now are there Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
that can set to their Seal, that he hath now again the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time appeared, and is appearing <hi>in Ten Thousands of his
Saints,</hi> in and among whom (as a first Fruits of many more
that shall be gathered) he is restoring the Golden Age, and
bringing them <hi>into the Holy Order and Government of his own
Son,</hi> who is ruling, and to rule in the midst of them, setting
forth the Counsellors as at the Beginning, and Judges as at
first, and establishing Truth, Mercy, Righteousness and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
again in the Earth, <hi>Amen, Halelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> these Meetings take Care in the Case of <hi>Marriages,</hi>
that all things be clear, and that there may nothing be done in
that Procedure, which afterwards may prove to the Prejudice
of Truth or of the Parties concerned, which being an outward
Thing that is acknowledged in it self to be lawful, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Importance a Man or a Woman can perform in this World,
and from the suddain, unwary or disorderly Procedure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
very great Snares and Reproaches may be cast both upon
the Parties and the Profession owned by them, therefore it doth
very fitly among other things when it occurs come to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
of by the People of God, when met to take Care to
preserve all things right and savoury in the Houshould of Faith:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62828:24"/>
We do believe our Adversaries that watch for Evil—against
us, would be glad how promiscuously or disorderly we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in this weighty Matter, that so they might the more
boldly accuse us, as Overturners of all <hi>Humane and Christian
Order,</hi> but God hath not left us without his Counsel and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in this Thing, nor will he that any should receive Just Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
against—us his People, and therefore in this weighty
Concern, we, who can do nothing against the Truth, but all
for and with a Regard to the Truth, have divers Testimonies
for the Lord, and,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That we cannot marry with those that walk not in,
and obey not the Truth, as being of another Judgment, or Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
or pretending to it, walk not suitably and answerably
thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor can we go to the Hireling-Priests to uphold
their false and usurped Authority, who take upon them to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
People without any Command or President for it from the
Law of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Nor can we suffer any such Kind of Marriages to
pass among us, which either, as to the Degrees of Consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or otherwise in it self is unlawfull, or from which there
may be any just Reflection cast upon our Way. As to the first
two, they being Matter of Principles received and believed, it
is not my Work here to debate them, only since they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and owned as such for which we can and have given out
sufficient Reasons else-where as for our other Principles, we
ought to care how any by walking otherwise bring Reproach
upon us. Yet not to pass them wholely by, as to the <hi>First,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Testimony of the Spirit of God in our Hearts which is
the Original Ground of our Faith in all Things, we have the
Testimony of the Apostle <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Be ye not unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
yoked together, &amp;c.</hi> Now if any should think it were much
from this Scripture to plead it absolutely unlawful, in any Case
to joyn in Marriage with any (however otherwise Sober) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their not being one with us in all Things, I shall speak
my Judgment. To me it appears so, and to many more who
have obtained Mercy, <hi>and we think we have the Spirit of God,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:62828:24"/>
but whether it be lawful or not, I can say positively, it is not
expedient, neither doth it edifie, and as that which is of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Consequence, doth give justly Offence to the <hi>Church of
Christ,</hi> and therefore no true tender Heart will prefer his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Love to the Good and Interest of the whole Body. As for
the <hi>Second,</hi> In that we deny the Priests their <hi>assumed Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Power</hi> to marry, it is that which is no wise we can resile
from, nor can we own any in the doing of it, it being a part of
our Testimony against the Usurpations of that Generation, who
never yet that I ever heard of, could produce any Scripture-proof
or Example for it, and seeing none can pretend Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the Matter (for they themselves confess, that it is no
part of the Essence of Marriage) if any pretending to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us should through Fear, Interest, or Prejudice to the
Truth come under and bow to that Image, have we not Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to deny such Slavish and Ignoble Spirits, as mind not Truth
and its Testimony?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Seeing if any walking with us, or going under the
same Name, should hastily or disorderly go together, either
being within the Degrees of Consanguinity, which the Law of
God forbids, or that either Party should have been formerly
under any Tye or Obligation to others, or any other vast Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
which might bring a just Reflection upon us from
our Opposers; Can any blame us for taking Care to prevent
these Evils, by appointing that such as so design, make known
their Intentions to these Churches or Assemblies where they
are most known, that if any know just Cause of Hinderance, it
may be mentioned, and a timous Let put to the Hurt, either
by stopping it, if they can be brought to condescend, or by
refusing to be Witnesses and Concurrers with them in it, if
they will not? for we take not upon us to hinder any to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
otherwise then by Advice, or disconcerning our selves; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we judge that such as do marry contrary to our Mind,
that therefore their Marriage is null and void in it self, or may
be dissolved afterwards, nay, all our meddling is in a holy
Care for the Truth, for if the Thing be right, all that we do is
to be Witnesses, and if otherwise, that we may say for our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62828:25"/>
Vindication to such as may upbraid us therewith, that we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
otherwise, and did no wayes concur in the Matter, that so
they may bear their own Burden, and the Truth and People
of God be cleared.</p>
            <p>Now I am confident that our Way Herein is so answerable to
Reason and Christianity, that none will blame us therefore,
except, either such whose Irregular and Impatient Lusts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
suffer a Serious and Christian Examination, and an advised
and moderate Procedure, or such who watching for evil against
us, are sorry we should proceed so orderly, and would rather
we should suffer all manner of Irregularities and Abominations,
that they might have the more to say against us; but the Solid
and Real Reasons we have for our Way herein, will sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
plead for us in the Hearts of all Sober Men; and moreover,
the Testimony of God's Spirit in our Hearts doth abundantly
confirm us, both against the Folly of the one, and the Envy of
the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There being nothing more needful then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Men and Women in Righteousness after they are brought
into it, and also nothing more certain, then that the great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
of Man's Soul seeks daily how he may draw back again,
and catch those who have in some measure escaped his Snares,
and known Deliverance from them, therefore do we also meet
together, that we may receive an opportunity to understand if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have fallen under his Temptations that we may restore them
again if possible, or otherwise separate them from us: Surely
if we did not so we might be justly blamed, as such, among
whom it were lawful to commit any Evil unreproved, indeed
this were to be guilty of that <hi>Libertinism,</hi> which some have
falsly accused us of, and which hath been our Care all along,
as become the People of God to avoid, therefore have we
sought always to keep the House clean, by faithfully reproving
and removing according to the Nature of the Offence, and the
Scandal following thereupon; private things privately, &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
things publickly: We desire not to propagate Hurt, and
defile Peoples Minds with telling them such things as tend not
to edifie, yet do we not so cover over or smooth over any
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62828:25"/>
Wickedness, as not to deal roundly with the Persons guilty, and
causing them to take away the Scandal in their acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before all to whose Knowledge it hath come, yet judge
we not our selves obliged to <hi>tell that in</hi> Gath, <hi>or publish that in
the Streets of</hi> Askelon, <hi>which makes the Daughters of the Vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
rejoyce,</hi> or strengthen <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Ranters</hi> in their
Obduredness, who feed more upon the Failings of the Saints,
then to imitate their true Repentance, and therefore where we
find an Unfeigned Returning to the Lord, we desire not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that which the Lord hath forgotten, nor yet to throw
Offences in the Way of the weak, that they may stumble upon
them.</p>
            <p>And therefore I conclude, that our Care as to these Things
also, is most needful, and a Part of that <hi>Order and Government</hi>
which the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> never was nor can be without, as
doth abundantly appear by divers Scriptures heretofore menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>

            <head>SECTION Sixth.</head>
            <head type="sub">How far this Government doth extend in Matters
Spiritual, and purely conscientious.</head>
            <p>THUS far I have considered the <hi>Order and Government
of the Church,</hi> as it respects outward things, and its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in condemning or removing such things which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are Evil, as being those which none will readily justifie,

            <p>Now I come to consider things of another kind, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
verily are, or are supposed to be <hi>Matters of Conscience,</hi>
or at least wherein People may lay claim to Conscience in the
acting or forbearing of them, in which the great Question is,
<hi>How far in such Cases the Church may give positive Orders, or

Rules? How far her Authority reacheth, or may be supposed to

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Wherein consisteth the Freedom and Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which may be exercised by the Members of the true
Church diversly without judging one another.</hi>

            <p>And Lastly, <hi>In whom the Power decisive is in Case of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
or Contention in such Matters,</hi> which will also lead us to

in this particular.</p>
            <p>As to the First, <hi>Whether the Church of Christ have Power in any
Cases that are Matters of Conscience, to give a positive Sentence
and Decision, which may be obligattry upon Believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I answer</hi> affirmatively, she hath, and shall prove it from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Instances, both from Scripture and Reason; for first, all
Principles and Articles of Faith, which are held doctrinally, are
in Respect to these that believe them matters of <hi>Conscience</hi>:
We know the <hi>Papists</hi> do out of Conscience, such as are zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
among them, adore, worship and pray to Angels, Saints
and Images, yea, and to the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as judging it to be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> &amp; so do others place Conscience in things that
are absolutely wrong: Now I say, we being gathered together
into the Belief of certain Principles and Doctrines without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

if any one or more so engaged
with us should arise to teach
any other Doctrine or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
contrary to these which
were the Ground of our being
One, who can deny but the
Body hath Power in such a
Case to declare, this is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Truth we profess,
and therefore we pronounce
such and such Doctrines to be wrong, with which we cannot
have Unity, nor yet any more Spiritual Fellowship with those
as hold them, and so such cut themselves off from being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
by dissolving the very Bond by which they were linked
to the Body: Now this cannot be accounted <hi>Tyranny and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi>
no more then in a Civil Society if one of the <hi>Society</hi>
shall contradict one or more of the fundamental Articles upon
which the Society was contracted, it can be reckon'd a breach or
iniquity in the whole <hi>Society,</hi> to declare that such Contradictors
have done wrong and forfeited their Right in that Society; in
case by the original constitution the Nature of the Contradiction
implys such a Forfeiture as usually it is, and will no doubt hold
in Religious Matters; as, if a Body be gathered into one Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
by the Belief of certain Principles, he that comes to
believe otherwayes naturally scattereth himself, for that the
Cause that gathered him is taken away: and so those that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
constant, in declaring the thing to be so as it is, and in
looking upon him and witnessing of him to others (if need be)
to be such as he has made himself, do him no Injury: I shall
make the Supposition in the general, and let every People make
the Application to themselves, abstracting from us, and then
let Conscience and Reason in every impartial Reader declare,
whether or not it doth not hold: Suppose a People really ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
unto the Belief of the true and certain Principles of the
Gospel, if any of these people shall arise and contradict any
of those <hi>fnndamental Truths,</hi> whether has not such as stand good
right to cast such a one out from among them, &amp; to pronounce
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62828:27"/>
positively, <hi>this is contrary to the Truth we profess and own, and
therefore ought to be rejected, and not received, nor yet he that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
it, as one of us</hi>: And is not this obligatory upon all the
Members, seeing all are concerned in the like Care, as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to hold the right, and shut out the wrong? I cannot tell
if any man of Reason can well deny this, however I shall prove
it next from the Testimony of the Scripture, Gal. 1. 8. <hi>But
though we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Gospel
unto you, then that which we have preached unto you, let him be
accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, If any man
preach any other Gospel unto you, then that ye have received, let
him be accursed.</hi>

               <hi>Of whom is</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Alexander, <hi>whom I have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 John 10. <hi>If there come any unto you, and bring not this Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrine,
receive him not into your House, neither bid him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce</hi>;
for so the <hi>Greek</hi> hath it.</p>
            <p>These Scriptures are so plain and clear in themselves, as to
this Purpose, that they need no great Exposition to the Unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed
and Unprejudicate Reader, fore-seeing it is so that in
the true <hi>Church</hi> there may men arise, and speak perverse things,
contrary to the Doctrine and Gospel already received, what
is to be the place of those that hold the pure and ancient Truth?
Must they look upon these perverse men still as their Brethren?
Must they cherish them as Fellow-Members, or must they
judge, condemn and deny them? We must not think the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
wanted Charity, who will have them <hi>Accursed,</hi> and
that gave <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> over to Satan after that
they had departed from the true Faith, that they might learn
not to Blaspheme. In short, If we must (as our Opposers herein
acknowledge) preserve and keep those that are come to own
the Truth by the same means they were gathered and brought
into it, we must not cease to be plain with them, and tell
them when they are wrong, and by sound Doctrine both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62828:27"/>
and convince Gainsayers: If the Apostles of Christ of
old, and the Preachers of the Everlasting Gospel in this day,
had told all people, however wrong they found them in their
Faith and Principles, our Charity and Love is such, <hi>We dare not
judg you, nor separate from you, but let us all live in Love together,
&amp; every one injoy his own Opinion, &amp; all will be well,</hi> how should
the Nations have been, or what way now can they be brought
to Truth and Righteousness? Would not the Devil love this
Doctrine well, by which Darkness and Ignorance, Error and
Confusion might still continue in the Earth unreproved and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned?
If it was needful then for the Apostles of Christ,
in the dayes of old, to reprove, without sparing to tell the
High Priests and great Professors among the <hi>Jews, That they
were stubborn and stiff-necked, and alwayes resisted the Holy
Ghost,</hi> without being guilty of Imposition and Oppression, or
want of true Love and Charity: And also, for those Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
the Lord raised up in this day to reprove and cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Hireling Priests, and to tell the World openly both
Professors and Prophane, that they were in Darkness and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
out of the Truth, Strangers and Aliens from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth of <hi>Israel</hi>; if God has gathered a People by this
means into the Belief of one and the same Truth, must not
they that turn and depart from it be admonished, reproved
and condemned? yea, rather then those that are not yet come to
the Truth, because they crucifie afresh unto themselves the
Lord of Glory, and put him to open Shame: It seems the
Apostle judged it very needful they should be so dealt with,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 10. when he sayes, <hi>There are many unruly and vain
Talkers and Deceivers, especially they of the Circumcision,</hi>
WHOSE MOUTHS MUST BE STOPPED, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Were
such a Principle to be received or believed, That in the <hi>Church
of Christ</hi> no man should be separated from, no man condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or excluded the Fellowship and Communion of the Body,
for his Judgment or Opinion in Matter of Faith, then what
<hi>Blasphemies so horried,</hi> what <hi>Heresies so damnable,</hi> what <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Devils,</hi> but might harbour it self in the <hi>Church
of Christ?</hi> What need then of sound Doctrine, if no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62828:28"/>
make unsound, what need of convincing and Exhorting
Gainsayers? If to Gainsay be no Crime, where should the
<hi>Vnity of the Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h be?</hi> Were not this an Inlet to all manner of
Abominations, and make void the whole tendency of Christ
and his Apostles Doctrine, and render the Gospel of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and give a Liberty to the unconstant and giddy Will of
Man, to innovate, alter and overturn it at his Pleasure. So
that from all that is above-mentioned, we do safely conclude,
that where a People are gathered together into the Belief of
the Principles and Doctrines of the Gospel of Christ, if any
of that People shall go from their Principles, and assert things
false and contrary to what they have already received, such
as stand and abide firm in the Faith have Power by the Spirit of
God, after they have used <hi>Christian</hi> Endeavours to convince
and reclaim them, upon their obstinacy to separate from such,
and to exclude them from their spiritual Fellowship and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
for otherwayes, if this be denyed, farewel to all
<hi>Christianity,</hi> or to the maintaining of any sound Doctrine in the
<hi>Church of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>secondly,</hi> Taking it for granted, that the <hi>Church of Christ</hi>
or Assembly of Believers, may in some Cases that are Matter
of Conscience, pronounce a positive Sentence and Judgment
without hazard of Imposition upon the Members, it comes to
be inquired; <hi>In what Cases and how far this Power reached?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, <hi>First,</hi> As that which is most clear and undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the fundamental Principles and Doctrines of Faith in
Case any should offer to teach otherwayes, as is above decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and proved; but some may perhaps acknowledge that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if any should contradict the known and owned Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Truth, and teach otherwayes, it were fit to cast out
and exclude such. But what judgest thou as to lesser matters,
as in Principles of less Consequence, or in outward Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
or Gestures, whether it be fit to press <hi>Vniformity</hi> in these
things? For Answer to this, it is fit to consider,</p>
            <p>First, <hi>The Nature of things themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Spirit and Ground they proceed from.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Thirdly, <hi>The Consequence and Tendency of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62828:28"/>
But before I proceed upon these, I affirm, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Truth, That as the Church and Assembly of God's
People, may and hath Power to decide <hi>by the Spirit of God</hi> in
Matters fundamental and weighty (without which no Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor Decree in whatever Matters is available) so the same
Church and Assembly also in other Matters of less Moment,
as to themselves, yet being needful and expedient with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Circumstance of Time, Place and other things
that may fall in, may and hath Power, <hi>by the same Spirit, and
no otherwayes,</hi> being acted, moved and assisted, and led by
it thereto, to pronounce a positive Judgment, which no doubt
will be found obligatory upon all such who have a Sense and
Feeling of the Mind of the Spirit, though rejected by such as
are not watchful, and so are out of the Feeling and Unity of
the Life; and this is that which none that own immediate
Revelation, or a being inwardly led by the Spirit, to be now a
thing expected or dispensed to the Saints, can without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
their own Principle deny, far less such with whom I
have to do in this Matter, who claiming this Priviledge to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
saying, <hi>That they being moved to do such and such
things, though contrary to the Mind and Sense of their Brethren,
are not to be judged for it</hi>; adding, <hi>Why may it not be so, that
God hath moved them to it.</hi> Now, if this be a sufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for them to suppose as to one or two,—I may without ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
suppose it as well to the whole Body; and therefore
as to the first, to wit, <hi>The Nature of the things themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be such a thing, the doing or not doing whereof, that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any Act or the Forbearance of any may bring a real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
or Ground of Accusation against the Truth professed
and owned, and in &amp; through which there may a visible <hi>Schism</hi>
and Dissension arise in the <hi>Church,</hi> by which Truth's Enemies
may be gratified, and it self brought into disesteem, then it is
fit for such whose Care is to keep all right, to take Inspection
in the Matter, to meet together in the Fear of God, to wait
for his Counsel, and to speak forth his Mind according as he
shall manifest himself in and among them; and this was the
Practice of the primitive Church, in the Matter of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62828:29"/>
for here lay the Debate, some thought it not needful
to circumcise the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> others thought it a thing not to be
dispensed with, and no doubt of these (for we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
they were not the Rebellious <hi>Jews,</hi> but such as had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
believed in CHRIST) there were that did it out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as judging Circumcision to be still obligatory; for
they said thus, <hi>Except ye be Circumcised after the manner of</hi>
Moses, <hi>ye cannot be saved</hi>: Now what Course took the Church
of <hi>Antioch</hi> in these Cases? <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 2.—<hi>They determined that</hi>
Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>and certain other of them, should go unto</hi>
Jerusalem, <hi>unto the Apostles and Elders about this Question.</hi>
We must not suppose they wanted the Spirit of God at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
to have decided the Matter, neither that these Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
neglected or went from their inward Guide in underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this Journey; yet we see they judged it meet in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to have the Advice and Concurrence of the Apostles and
Elders that were at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that they might be all of one
mind in the matter; for there is no greater Property of the
Church of Christ then pure Unity in the Spirit that is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
and oneness in Judgment and Practices in Matters of
Faith and Worship (which yet admits of different Measures,
Growths and Motions, but never contrary and contradictory
Ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in these Diversities of Operations, yet still by the
same Spirit, the true Liberty is exercised, as shall be declared
hereafter) Therefore prayeth Christ, <hi>That they all may be one
as he and the Father is one</hi>; to which Purpose also let these
following Scriptures be examined:</p>
            <p>Rom. 12. 16. <hi>Be of the same Mind one towards another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Cor. 1. 10. <hi>Now I beseech you, Brethren, by the Name of
our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that
there be no Divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joyned
together in the same Mind, and in the same Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 5. 21. <hi>Submitting your selves one to another in the
Fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Phil. 2. 2. <hi>Fulfil ye my Joy, that ye be like-minded, having
the same Love, being of one accord of one Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet more remarkable is that of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62828:29"/>
the Philippians, Chap. 3. Vers. 15. <hi>Let us therefore, as many
as be perfect, be thus minded; and if in any thing ye be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk
by the same Rule, let us mind the same thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren, be Followers together of me, and mark them which
walk so, as ye have us for an Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So here, though the Apostle grants Forbearance in things
wherein they have not yet attained, yet he concludes they
must walk so, as they have him for an Example, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
not contrary or otherwayes, and therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that whereas any in the Church of God pretending
Conscience or Revelation, shall arise to teach and practise,
however insignificant or small, in themselves, whether Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
or Practices, yet if they be contrary to such as are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
received as true, and confirmed by God's Spirit in the
Hearts of the Saints, and that the introducing of these things
tend to bring Reproach upon the Truth, as such as are not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
in themselves, and so stumble the Weak; those who
have a true and right Discerning, <hi>may in and by the Power of
God authorizing them</hi> (<hi>and no otherwayes</hi>) condemn and judge
such things, and they so doing it, it will be obligatory upon
all the Members that have a true Sense, because they will feel
it to be so, and therefore submit to it.</p>
            <p>And thus far as to the Nature of the things themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to <hi>the Spirit and Ground they proceed from.</hi>
Whatsoever Innovation, Difference or diverse Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
whether in Doctrine or Practice, proceedeth not
from the pure Moving of the Spirit of God, or is not done
out pure Tenderness of Conscience, but either from
that which being puft up affecteth singularity, and there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
through would be observed, commended and exalted, or
from that which is the Malignity of some Humours and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Tempers, which will be contradicting without Cause,
and secretly begetting of Divisions, Animosities and Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by which the Unity and unfeigned Love of the Brethren
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62828:30"/>
is lessened or rent; I say, all things proceeding from this Root
and Spirit, however little they may be supposed to be of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
are to be guarded against, withstood and denyed, as
hurtful to the true Church's Peace, and a Hindrance to the
Prosperity of Truth.</p>
            <p>If it be said, <hi>How know ye that these things proceed from that
Ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Answer, I make not here any Application as to particular
Persons or Things; but if it be granted (as it cannot be denied)
that there may arise Persons in the true Church, that may do
such Things from such a Spirit, though pretending Conscience
and Tenderness, then it must also be acknowledged, that such
to whom God hath given a true Discerning by his Spirit, may
and ought to judge such Practices, and the Spirit they come
from, and have no Unity with them, which if it be owned in
the General proves the Case, to wit, that some pretending
Conscience in Things seeming indifferent, but yet it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in them from <hi>a Spirit of Singularity, Emulation or Strife,</hi>
those that have received a Discerning thereof from the Lord,
may and ought to judge the Transgressors, without being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Imposers, Oppressors of Conscience, or Inforcers of
Uniformity contrary to the Mind of Christ, against which the
Apostle also guardeth the Churches of old.</p>
            <p>Phil. 2. 3, 4. <hi>Let nothing be done through Strife or Vain-Glory,
but in Lowliness of Mind let each esteem other BETTER
THEN THEMSELVES.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Look not every Man on his own Things, but every Man also
on the Things of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if it be an Evil to do any Thing out of Strife, thus such
Things that are seen so to be done, are they not to be avoided &amp;
forsaken. So that we are confident our Judgment herein cannot
be denied, or reputed Erroneous, except it be said that none will
or can arise in the Church of Christ, pretending such things from
such a Spirit, which I know not any that will, it being contrary
to the express Prophecies of the Scripture, &amp; the Experience of
the Church in all Ages, as may appear from, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. <hi>Acts</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62828:30"/>
15. 24. <hi>1 Tim.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>2 Tim.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 21, 22, <hi>2 Pet.</hi>
2. 19. Or on the other Hand, that those that abide faithful,
and have a Discerning of those Evils ought to be silent, and
never ought to reprove and gainst and them, nor yet warn and
guard others against them, and that it is a part of the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Unity of the Church of Christ, to suffer all such Things
without taking Notice of them. I know none will say so, but
if there be any so foolish, as to affirm it, let them consider these
Scriptures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>1 Tim.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>2 Tim.</hi> 2. 24, 25. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.
9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Now if none of these hold true, but on the contrary such E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
have been and may be found to creep in among the People
of God, and that such as see them may and ought to reprove
them, then necessarily the doing so is neither Imposition Force
nor Oppression.</p>
            <p>As to the third, concerning the Consequence and Tendency
of them, it is mostly included in the two former, for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
tendeth not to Edification, but on the contrary to Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and to beget Discord among Brethren, is to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
according to that of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>Now I
beseech you Brethren, mark them which cause Divisions and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since there is no greater Mark of the People of God
then to be at Peace among themselves, whatsoever tendeth to
break that Bond of Love and Peace, must be testified against;
let it be observed I peak always of the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> indeed,
and deal with such as are of another Mind, not as reckoning on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false Churches not to have this Power, but denying it even
to the true Church of Christ, as judging it not fit for her so to
act, as in relation to her Members; for though Christ be the
prince of Peace, and doth most of all commend Love and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to his Disciples, yet I also know he came not to send Peace,
but a Sword, that is, in dividing Man from the Lusts and Sins
he hath been united to; and also it is the Work of his Disciples
and Messengers to break the Bonds and Unity of the Wicked,
wherein they are banded against God &amp; his Truth, &amp; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62828:31"/>
of such as stand in Unrighteousness, by inviting and
bringing as many as will obey, unto Righteousness, whereby
they become disunited and separated from their Companions,
with whom they were centered &amp; at Peace in the contrary and
cursed Nature; and indeed blessed are they that are sent forth
of the Lord to scatter here, that they may gather into the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Life; and they are blessed that in this Respect, even
for Righteousness Sake are scattered and separated from their
Brethren, that they may come to know the Brotherhood and
Fellowship which is in the Light, from which none ought to
scatter nor to be scattered, but be more and more gathered
thereunto, &amp; this leads me to what I proposed in the third Place
under this Head of the true Church's Power in Matters Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
or purely Conscientious, which may be thus objected.</p>
            <p>If thou plead so much for an Oneness in the smallest Matters,
wherein consisteth the Freedom and Liberty of the Conscience
which may be exercised by the Members of the true Church
diversly without judging one another?</p>
            <p>In answer to this Proposition, I affirm, first in general,
That whatsoever Things may be supposed to proceed from the
same Spirit, though divers in its Appearance, tending to the
same End of Edification, and which in the Tendency of it, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not a real Ground for Division or Dissension of Spirit, Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Members ought not only to bear one another, but strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
one another in them.</p>
            <p>Now the Respects wherein this may be, I can describe no
better then the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth principally in two Places,
which therefore will be fit to consider—at length for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of this Matter, this being one of the weightiest Points
pertaining to this Subject, because as on the one Hand due For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
ought to be exercised in its right Place, so on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the many Devices and false Pretences of the Enemy
creeping in here ought to be guarded against.</p>
            <p>The first is, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 12. from 4. to 31. thus:</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Now there are Diversities of Gifts, but the same Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 <hi>And there are Difference of Administrations, but the same
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:62828:31"/>
6 <hi>And there are Diversities of Operations, but it is the same
God which worketh all in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 <hi>But the Manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
profit withall</hi>;</p>
            <p>8 <hi>For to one is given by the Spirit the Word of Wisdom, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
the Word of Knowledge by the same Spirit,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9 <hi>To another Faith by the same Spirit, to another the Gifts
of Healing by the same Spirit,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10 <hi>To another the Working of Miracles, to another Prophecy,
to another D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>scerning of Spirits, to another divers kinds of
Tongues, to another the Interpretation of Tongues</hi>;</p>
            <p>11 <hi>But all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
to every Man severally as he will</hi>;</p>
            <p>12 <hi>For at the Body is one, and hath many Members, and all
the Members of that one Body being many are one Body, so also
is Christ</hi>;</p>
            <p>13 <hi>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one Body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we be</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Gentiles, <hi>whether we be bond or free, and
have been all made to drink into one Spirit</hi>;</p>
            <p>14 <hi>For the Body is not one Member, but many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15 <hi>If the Foot shall say, because I am not the Hand, I am not
of the Body; is it therefore not of the Body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16 <hi>And if the Ear shall say, because I am not the Eye, I am
not of the Body, is it not therefore of the Body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17 <hi>If the whole Body were an Eye, where were the Hearing?
If the whole were Hearing, where were the Smelling?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18 <hi>But now hath God set the Members every one of them in the
Body as it hath pleased him,</hi>

            <p>Which I would not have set down at large, but that there
be some of careless (especially in Matters they like not) that
they will scarce be at the pains seriously to read over a Citation
only named; and that also this being presented before the
Reader in the Current of the Discourse, will fix the Nature of
my Application the more in his Understanding; for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
shews here the Variety of the Operations of the divers
Members of the Body of Christ, working to one and the same
End, as the divers Members of a Man's Body towards the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and upholding of the whole.</p>
            <p>Now these are not placed in contrary Workings; for so
they would destroy one another, and so the Apostle in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of them in three several kinds proves this. First, <hi>Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of Gifts.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Differences of Administrations.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Diversities of Operations,</hi> and that which is the Bond that
keeps the Oneness, here he also mentions, to wit, <hi>The same
Spirit, the sam Lord, the same God</hi>; the Apostle names no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Contrariety or Opposition; but lest any should be
so critical, as to bring in here the School. Distinction of <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium
oppositum, and contradictorium,</hi> I shall not deny but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62828:32"/>
or Opposition in the Sense it is sometimes taken, may
be found in the Body without Schism, as the comely Parts
may be said to be opposite, or contrary to the uncomely, or
the left Hand contrary to the right, or the Foot opposite to the
Head, as the uppermost Part to the undermost, or the Doing
a Thing is contrary to the Forbearing of it; but as for that
which is acknowledged to be <hi>Propositiones, or Termini contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorij,</hi>
that is, contradictory Propositions, which are in
themselves irreconciliable, whereof one must be still wrong,
and that still destroy one another, and work contrary Effects,
they are not at all admitted, nor supposed to be in the Body of
Christ, as I shall give in one Instance, ver. 8. <hi>To one is given
by the Spirit, the Word of Wisdom, to another the Word of
Knowledge by the same Spirit, First,</hi> here are two different
Gifts but not contrary. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There may something like
Contrariety in the Sense afore-mentioned, be here supposed, as,
some may want this Gift of Wisdom and Knowledge, and so
to have is contrary to want (though as to these two, none may
be absolutely said to want them, yet all have them not in the
same Degree, as a special Gift, though as to some Gifts there
may be an absolute want, as that of Miracles, and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Tongues) but should I suppose such a Cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>y,
or more properly a Contradiction, as to <hi>Wisdom</hi> to oppose
<hi>Folly,</hi> and to <hi>Knowledge Vtter Ignorance</hi>; this were an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
not to be admitted of in the Body, because it were
false to suppose that to proceed from the same Spirit, and such
Contrarieties or Diversities, as cannot justly be supposed to
proceed from the same Spirit of God, which is the Bond that
links together cannot be mutually entertained in the Body.
So the Differences and Diversities which the Apostle admits of
while he speaks largely in this Matter, is that none ought to be
offended at his Brother, that he hath not the same Work and
Office in the Body that he hath but that every one keep in
his own Place, as God hath appointed them, that neither them
that are set in a higher Place despise them that are set in a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
nor them that are set in a lower grudge and repine at such
as are set higher, but all work in their proper Place towards
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62828:33"/>
the Edification of the whole, and that the Apostle intends this,
is manifest where he draws to a Conclusion, ver. 27. <hi>Now
ye are the Body of Christ and Members in particular, and God
hath set some in the Church, first, Apostles, secondarily, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
&amp;c. and then he subsumes, <hi>Are all Apostles?</hi> &amp;c. which
the same <hi>Paul</hi> again confirms, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 8, 11. to the 17th. which
was the second Place I intended, and shall only mention for
Brevity sake, leaving the Reader to consider of it at his Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
This is also held forth by the Beloved Disciple <hi>John</hi> in
his Threefold Distinction, <hi>1 John</hi> 2. 12, 13. <hi>Of Fathers, Young
Men, and little Children,</hi> and by <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 5. in that
<hi>of Elders and Younger.</hi> The true Liberty then in the Church of
Christ is exercised, whenas one judgeth not another in these
different Places, but live in Love together, all minding the Unity
and general good of the Body, and to work their own Work
in their own Place; also the Forbearance of the Saints is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
whenas they judge not one another for being found in the
different appearance, either of Doing or Forbearing, which
may be peculiar to their several Places and Stations in the
Body; for that there is &amp; may be Diversities of Works, there is
excellently well expressed by the Apostle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>For I say through the Grace given unto me, to
every man that is among you, not to think of himself more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then he ought to think, but to think soberly, accord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng as God
hath dealt to every man the Measure of Faith</hi>;</p>
            <p>4 <hi>For as we have many Members in one Body, and all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
have not the same Office</hi>:</p>
            <p>5 <hi>So we being many are one Body in Christ, and every one
Members one of another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 <hi>Having then Gifts differing, according to the Grace that is
given to us, whether Prophecy, let us prophesie according to the
Proportion of Faith,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 <hi>Or Ministry, let us wait on our Ministring, or he that
teacheth on Teaching</hi>;</p>
            <p>8 <hi>Or he that exhorteth on Exhortation: He that giveth, let
him do it with Simplicity, he that ruleth, with Diligence, he
that sheweth Mercy, with Cheerfulness.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62828:33"/>
If any then should quarrel his Brother for exercising that
which belongeth to the Office of the Body, Christ hath called
him to, and would force him to exercise the same Office he
doth, though he be not called to it, here is a Breach of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Liberty,</hi> and an Imposing upon it. Now all Schisms and
Jars fall out in this twofold Respect, either when any Person or
Persons assume another or an higher Place in the Body then
God will them to be in, and so exercise an Office, or go about
to perform that which they ought not to do; or whenas any
truly exercising in their Place, which God hath given them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
rise up and judge them and would draw them from it,
both of which Cases have been, and may be supposed to fall out
in the Church of Christ, as <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4. where some judged
<hi>Paul</hi> wrongously. <hi>3 John</hi> 9. where one exalting himself above
his Place, judged whom he ought not. We see then what
Diversities be most usually in the Church of God, consisting in
the Difference of the Gift proceeding from the same Spirit,
and in the divers Places that the several Members have in the
same Body for the Edification of it, and every one being here
in his own Station, in standing therein is his Strength &amp; Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and to be in another, though higher and more eminent,
would but weaken and hurt him; and so in this there ought to
be a mutual Forbearance, that there may neither be a coveting
nor aspiring on the one hand, nor yet a despising or condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the other. But besides the Forbearance of this Nature
which is most ordinary &amp; universal, and for the Exercise where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there is and will still be a need so long as there is any Gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
or Church of Christ upon the Earth, there is a certain
Liberty and Forbearance also that is more particular, and has
a Relation to the Circumstance of Times and Places, which
will not hold universally, whereof we have the Example of
the primitive Church, testified by the Scriptures in two or three
Particulars; the first was, <hi>in suffering Circumcision to the</hi> Jews
<hi>for a time,</hi> and not only so, but also divers others of the legal
and ceremonial Purifications and Customs, as may appear
<hi>Acts</hi> 21. v. 21, 22, 23, 24, &amp;c. The second was, <hi>in the Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62828:34"/>
of certain Dayes,</hi> Rom. 14. 5. And the third, <hi>in the Abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Meats,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. throughout; here the Apostle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
to and recommends a Forbearance because of the <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of some</hi>; for he sayes not any where, nor can it be found
in all the Scriptures of the Gospel, that these things, such
weak ones were exercised in, were things indispensibly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or that it had been better for them they had not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such Scruples, providing it had been from a Principle of
true Clearness, and so of Faith.</p>
            <p>Next again, These Acts of Forbearance were done in a
Condescension to the Weakness of such upon whom the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
(and truly deserved in its season) Veneration of the Law
had such a deep impression, that they could not yet dispense
with all its Ceremonies and Customs; and to such the Apostle
holds forth a two-fold Forbearance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> A certain Compliance by such Believers as were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
out from the <hi>Jews,</hi> though they saw over these things,
yet it was fit they should condescend somewhat to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men
and Brethren, who were <hi>weak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> The like Forbearance in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not to judge
them in these things; but we see that it was not allowed for
such weak ones to propagate these Scruples, or draw others
into them; and that whenas any of the <hi>Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
who wanted this Occasion, would have been exercising
this Liberty, or pleading for it, the Apostle doth down-right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemn it, as I shall make appear in all the three Instances
above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In that of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> Gal. 5. 2, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold, I</hi> Paul <hi>say unto you, that if ye be Circumcised Christ
shall profit you nothing, Christ is become of none effect unto you:
Whosoever of you are justified by the Law, ye are fallen from
Grace</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can there be any thing more positive? Might not some here
have pretended <hi>Tenderness of Conscience,</hi> and have said,
<hi>Though the Decree of the Apostles do dispense with Circumcision
in me, yet if I find a Scruple in my self, and a Desire to it out
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62828:34"/>
of Tenderness, why should it be an Evil in me to do it, more then
in the</hi> Jews <hi>that believe?</hi> We see there is no room left here for
such Reasoning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to <hi>Observations,</hi> Gal. 4. 9, 10, 11. Might not
they have answered, <hi>What if we Regard a Day to the Lord,
must we not then? is not this thy own words?</hi> We see that did
not hold here, because in them it was a <hi>returning to the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
Elements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to <hi>Meats,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 3. Here we see that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<hi>a Doctrine of Devils,</hi> which in another respect was
<hi>Christian-Forbearance,</hi> and therefore now, and that in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
respect, he gives this Reason, Vers. 4. <hi>For every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God is good, and nothing to be refused if it be received
with Thanksgiving of them that believe and know the Truth.</hi> So
we see that in these particular things there is great need of Wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> for that sometimes Forbearance
under a Pretence of Liberty may be more hurtful then down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
judging. I suppose if any now should arise, and pretend
Conscience, and claim a Liberty for <hi>Circumcision and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications
of the Law,</hi> whether all <hi>Christians</hi> would not with
one Voice condemn it; and so as to <hi>Dayes</hi> and <hi>Meats,</hi> how
do the Generality of <hi>Protestants</hi> judge it, though I deny not
but there may and ought to be a mutual Forbearance in the
<hi>Church of Christ</hi> in certain such Cases, which may fall in, and
a Liberty there is in the Lord which breaks not the Peace of
the true Church, but in such Matters (as I observed at
large before) both the Nature of the things, the Spirit they
come from, and the Occasion from whence, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
and Tendency is to be carefully observed.</p>

            <p>SEeing then it may fall out in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> that both
some may assume <hi>another place</hi> in the <hi>Body</hi> then they ought,
and others may lay claim to a <hi>Liberty,</hi> and pretend <hi>Conscience</hi>
in things they ought not, and that without Question the wrong
is not to be tolerated, but to be testified against, however spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
its Appearance may be, and that it must and ought to be
judged: The Question will arise, <hi>who is the proper Judge or
Judges in whom resideth the Power of deciding this Controversie</hi>?
and this is that which I undertook in the next Place to treat of,
as being the Specifick Difference, and Distinguishing Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> from all other Antichristian-Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
and Churches of man's building and framing. To give a
short, and yet clear and plain Answer to this Proposition, <hi>The
only proper Judge of Controversies in the Church, is the Spirit of
God, and the Power of deciding solely lies in it, as having the only
Vnerring, Infallible and Certain Judgment belonging to it,
which Infallibility is not necessarily annexed to any Persons,
Person, or Places whatsoever, by Virtue of any Office, Place or
Station any one may have, or have had in the Body of Christ,</hi> that
is to say, that any have Ground to reason thus, because I am
or have been such an Eminent Member, therefore my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is infallible, or because we are the greatest Number, or
that we live in such a Noted or Famous Place or the like,
though some of these Reasons may and ought to have their true
Weight in Case of Contradictory Assertions, as shall hereafter
be observed, yet not so, as upon which either mainly or only
the <hi>Infallible Judgment is</hi> to be placed, <hi>but upon the Spirit,</hi> as
that which is the firm and unmoveable Foundation. And now
if I should go on no further, I have said enough to vindicate us
from Imposition, and from the Tyranny, whether of <hi>Propery,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62828:35"/>
Prelacy or Presbytery,</hi> or any such like, we have or may be
branded with, as shall after appear.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, herein lies the Difference betwixt the
Dispensation <hi>of the Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospel or New Covenant,</hi> for
that of old all Answers were to be received from the Priests in
the Tabernacle; for he that appeared betwixt the <hi>Cherubims</hi>
there spoke forth his Mind to the People; and there was also
Families of the Prophets to whom they resorted for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of the Lord (though sometimes as a Signification of the
further Glory that was to be revealed, it pleased God to reveal
his Mind to some even to them who were neither Prophets nor
Prophets Sons) but under the Gospel we are all <hi>to be taught
of God,</hi> that is, none are excluded from this Priviledge, by
not being of the Tribe <hi>of Levi,</hi> or of the Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
though this Priviledge is as truly exercised in some by
assenting and obeying to what God commands and reveals
through others, <hi>they feeling Vnity with it in the Life,</hi> as by such
who by the Revelation and Command of God's Spirit, hold
forth his Will to his People in certain Particulars, which the
<hi>same Spirit leads and commands them to obey</hi>: So that we say, and
that with very good Ground, that it is no ways inconsistant with
this Sound, and Unerring Principle, to affirm that the Judgment
of a certain Person or persons in certain Cases<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is infallible, or
for a certain Person or Persons to give a positive Judgment, and
pronounce it as obligatory upon others, because the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Ground thereof, is not because they are infallible, but
because in these Things &amp; at that Time <hi>they were led by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Spirit,</hi> &amp; therefore it will not shelter any in this Respect,
to pretend I am not bound to obey the Dictates of Fallible
Man, is not this Popery, I not being perswaded in my self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not disobedient to them, but to the Judgment of
Truth through them at such a Time, and one or more their not
being perswaded, may as probably proceed from their being
hardned, and being out of their Place, and in an Incapacity to
hear the Requirings, as that the Thing is not required of them
which none can deny but it may as well be supposed, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
but for the further clearing of this Matter before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62828:36"/>
I shall not doubt both to affirm and prove these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Propositions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That there never will nor can be wanting in Case of
Controversie, <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> to give Judgment through some
or other in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> so long as any assembly can
properly, or in any tolerable supposition, be so termed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That God hath ordinarily, in the communicating
of his Will under his Gospel, imployed such whom he had
made Use of in gathering of his Church, and in feeding and
watching over them, though <hi>not excluding others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That their <hi>de Facto,</hi> or effectually meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and giving a positive Judgment in such Cases will not
import <hi>Tyranny and Vsurpation,</hi> or an Inconsistency with the
Universal Priviledge that all Christians have, to be led by the
Spirit, neither will the Pretences of any contradicting them,
or refusing to submit upon the account they see it not, or so
excuse them from being really guilty of disobeying God. For
the <hi>First,</hi> to those that believe the Scripture there will need no
other Probation then that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28, 20. <hi>And lo I am with
you alway, even unto the End of the World.</hi> And ver. 18. <hi>And the
Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> were so destitute of the Spirit of
God, that in Case of Difference there were not any found that
by the Infallible Spirit could give a certain Judgment, would
not then the Gates of Hell prevail against it? for where is
Strife and Division, and no effectual Way to put an End to it,
there not only the Gates, but the Courts and Inner Chambers
of Darkness prevail; for <hi>where Envying and Strife is, there is
Confusion, and every Evil Work</hi>; but that there may be here
no Ground of mistake, or supposition that we were annexing
Infallibility to certain Persons, or limiting the Church to such, I
understand not by the <hi>Church,</hi> every particular Gathering or
Assembly circumscribed to any particular Country or City;
for I will not refuse, but divers of them, both apart and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if not established in God's Power, may err, nor yet do I
lay the absolute Stress upon the <hi>a General Assembly</hi> of Persons,
as such, picked and chosen out of every one of these particular
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62828:36"/>
Churches, as if what the Generallity or Plurallity of those
conclude upon, were necessarily to be supposed to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Judgment of Truth, though to such an Assembly of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
truly stated as they ought in God's Power, he hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
revealed his Will in such Cases, and yet may, as the
most probable Way (which shall be spoken of hereafter) yet
such, as <hi>a meer Assembly,</hi> is not conclusive, nor yet do I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by the Church, every Gathering or Assembly of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who may hold Sound and True Principles, or have a
Form of Truth; for some may lose the Life and Power of
Godliness, who notwithstanding may retain the Form or
Notion of Things, but yet are to be turned away from, because
in so far (as I observed before) as Sanctification, to wit, those
that <hi>are sanctified in Christ Jesus</hi> make the <hi>Church,</hi> and give the
right Definition to it, where that is wholely wanting the
<hi>Church of Christ ceaseth to be,</hi> and there remains nothing but a
Shadow without Substance; such Assemblies then are like the
dead Body when the Soul is departed, which is no more fit to
be conversed with, because it corrupts and proves noisom to
the living; but by the Church of Christ I understand all those
that truly and really have received and hold the Truth as it is
in Jesus, and are in measure sanctified, or sanctifying in and by
the Power and Virtue thereof, working in their inward Parts,
and this may be made up of divers distinct Gatherings or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in several Countries or Nations; I say, so long as these or
any of them do retain that which justly entitles them <hi>the
Church or Churches of Christ</hi> (which they may be truly called)
though there may fall out some Differences, Divisions or
Schisms among them, as we may see there was no small Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sension
in the <hi>Church of</hi> Antioch, and yet it ceased not to be a
Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 15 2. and <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my Brethren, that
there are Contentions among you,</hi> and yet ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

So long I say, as they truly retain this Title of the <hi>Church of
Christ,</hi> as being really such there will never be wanting the
certain <hi>Judgment of Truth,</hi> for which, besides the positive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62828:37"/>
of Christ before-mentioned, which is not, without Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
to be called in question or doubted of. I shall add these
Reasons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That seeing the Church of Christ is his Body, of which
he is the Head, it were to make Christ negligent of his Body,
who stiles himself the good Shepherd, and hath said, <hi>He will
never leave nor forsake his own,</hi> or else which is worse, it would
infer a possibility of Error, or Mistake in Christ, in whom, as
the Head, is the Eyes of the Body, by which it is to be ruled
in all things. Next we never find in all the Scripture since the
Gospel, that ever this was wanting, but that God still gave
infallible Judgment by his Spirit in some of the Respects above
mentioned, if the Transactions and Controversies of the after
Centuries be alledged, I will boldly affirm and prove, that
there was never a true Judgment wanting so long as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Essence of the true Church was retained, if any will
needs affirm otherwise, let them shew me where and I shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it, though I deny not (that after the Mystery of Iniquity
did begin to work, or had so wrought, first by intermixing, and
afterward by altogether forsaking the Nature of Truth, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only the bare Name of the Church) but that there might be
some scattered ones here and there one in a Nation, and now
and then one in an Age, who by the Power and Virtue of the
Spirit of Life working in them might be truly sanctified, yet
these were but as <hi>Witnesses in Sack cloth,</hi> no wayes sufficient to
give these Assemblies in which they were engrossed, the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Church of Christ, coming no more under Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by the Generallity, nor having as to them any more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
then some Tittle or scarcely discernable Sparks of
Fire in many great Heaps and Mountains of Ashes, and thus
much to prove that where there is any Gathering or Assembly,
which truly and properly may be called the Church of Christ,
the infallible Judgment will never be wanting in Matters of
Controversie. Secondly, <hi>That ordinarily God hath in the
communicating of his Will under his Gospel, imployed such whom
he had made use of in gathering of his Church, and in feeding and
watching over them though not excluding others</hi>; for as in a
natural Body to which the Church of Christ is compared, the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62828:37"/>
more substantial and powerful Members do work most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and their Help is most necessary to supply any Defect or
Trouble in the Body, so also if there be Diversities of Gifts in
the Church, as is above proved, and some have a greater
Measure and some a lesser, these that have the greater are more
capable to do good and to help the Body in its need, then others
that are weaker and less powerful, since there are strong and
weak, Babes and Young Men, <hi>who have overcome the Evil One,
and in whom the Word of God abideth,</hi> such are more able when
the Enemy besets to resist having already overcome, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who are but yet wrestling and not Conquerers. Now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Controversie and Dissension in the Church comes from the
Besetments of the Enemy, yet if any of these Strong or Young
Men, or Powerful Members go from their Station, it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
but that they are as Weak as any, and it is presupposing
their Faithfulness in their Place, that I thus affirm, <hi>and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,</hi>
nor yet do limit the Lord to this Method; <hi>for in him are
all the Treasures both of our Wisdom and Strength,</hi> and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
in his Hand are as strong as the strongest, who may now,
as well as heretofore kill a <hi>Goliah</hi> by the Hand of <hi>little Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
yet we see the Lord doth ordinarily make use of the strong
to support the weak, and indeed when such as may be termed
weak are so made use of, it alters the Nature of their Place, and
constitutes them in a higher, and more eminent Degree; for
though it was <hi>little David,</hi> it was also he that was to be King
of <hi>Israel,</hi> though the Apostles were mean Men among the <hi>Jews</hi>
yet they were such as were to be the Apostles of the Lord of
Glory, Instruments to gather the lost Sheep <hi>of the House of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
and to proclaim the acceptable Day of the Lord; and
though <hi>Paul</hi> was once accounted the <hi>Least of all the Saints, a
Child born out of due Time,</hi> yet was he him who was to be the
greatest Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Now then let us consider,
whom the Lord makes use of in the Affairs of the primitive
Church, and through whom he gave forth his infallible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
did he not begin first by <hi>Peter</hi>? he was the first that spoke
in the first Meeting they had, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. and who first stood
up after the pouring forth of the Spirit, and who first appeared
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62828:38"/>
before the Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and spoke in behalf of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Christ, though I am far from calling him as some do the
Prince of the Apostles, yet I may safely say, he was one
of the most ancient and eminent, and to whom Christ in a
Manner somewhat more then ordinary had recommended the
Feeding of his Flock; we see also he was first made use of in
preaching to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and what Weight his and <hi>James's</hi>
Words had in the Contest about Circumcision towards the
bringing the Matter to a Conclusion, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. yet that we may
see Infallibility was not inseparably annexed to him, he was
found blameable in a certain Matter, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11. notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his Sentence was positively received in many particulars:
So also the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> argues from his gathering of the
Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> that they ought to be Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of him, and positively concludes in divers Things, and
upon this Supposition exhort the Churches both he and <hi>Peter</hi>
in many Passages heretofore mentioned (which I will not (to
avoid Repetition) again rehearse, <hi>To obey the Elders that
watch for them, to hold such in Reputation, and to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to them that have addicted themselves to the Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>istry of
the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 15, 16. Also we see how the Lord
makes use of <hi>John</hi> his beloved Disciple to inform and reprove
the seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> and no doubt, <hi>John</hi> (the rest by
the usual Computation being at that Time all removed) was
then the most noted and famous Elder alive, and indeed I
mind not where under the Gospel Christ hath used any other
Method, but that he alwayes in revealing his Will, hath made
use of such as he himself had before appointed Elders and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
in his Church, though it be far from us to limit the Lord
so as to exclude any from this Priviledge, nor yet on the other
Hand will the Possibility hereof be a sufficient Warrant to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
every obscure Member to stand up, and offer to rule judge
and condemn the whole Body, nor yet is it without Cause
that such an one's Message is jealoused and called in Question,
unless it have <hi>very great Evidence, and be bottomed upon some
very weighty and solid Cause and Foundation.</hi> And God doth so
furnish those whom he raises up in a singular Manner of which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62828:38"/>
as I said, I mind no Instance in the New Testament, and in the old
we see though it was strange that little <hi>David</hi> should oppose
himself to the great <hi>Goliah,</hi> yet he had before that killed
both the Lyon and the Bear which was no less improbable, and
which of all is most observable, was before that Time by the
Appointment of God and the Hand of the Prophet anointed
King of <hi>Israel,</hi> compare the 16th and 17th chap. of the 1st of
<hi>Samuel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to the Third, <hi>That any particular Persons</hi> de Facto,
<hi>or effectually giving out a positive Judgment, is no Incroaching
nor Imposing upon their Brethren's Conscience,</hi> is necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in what is said before, upon which for further Probation
there will only need this short Reflection, that for any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or Members in Obedience to the Lord to give forth a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Judgment <hi>in the Church of Christ</hi> is their proper Place
and Office, they being called to it, and so for them to exercise
that Place in the Body which the Head moves them to, is not
to usurp Authority over their Fellow Members, as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hand to submit and obey, it being the Place of some so
to do, is not a renouncing a being led by the Spirit, seeing the
Spirit leads them so to do, and not to obey, in Case the
Judgment be according to Truth, and the Spirit lead to it, is
no doubt both offensive and sinful; and that all this may be
supposed in the Church of Christ without Absurdity, and so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
the above mentioned Propositions will appear by a
short review of the former Passages.</p>
            <p>If that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James</hi> their giving a positive Judgment in
the Case of Difference in divers particul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs, did not infer them
to be <hi>Imposers,</hi> so neither will any so doing now being led to
it by the same Authority, every one may easily make the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
and on the contrary, if for any to have stood up and
resisted their Judgment pretending an unclearness, or so, and
thereby held up the Difference after their Sentence, breaking
the Peace and Unity of the Church, Things being concluded
with an <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us,</hi> I say, if such
would have given just Cause of Offence, and have been cut off
as Despisers of Dignities of old, will not the like Case now
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62828:39"/>
occurring, the same Conclusion holds. Now whether those
Propositions do not hold upon the Principles before laid down
and proved, I leave to every Judicious and Impartiall Reader
to judge.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we see how positive the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> is in many
particulars throughout all his Epistles, insomuch as he saith,
<hi>2 Thes.</hi> ult. 14.—<hi>If any Man obey not our Word by this Epistle,
note that Man, and have no Company with him, that he may be
ashamed.</hi> And in many more Places before mentioned, where
he commands them both to obey him and several others who
were appointed (no doubt by the Spirit of God) to be Rulers
among them, and yet who will say, that either the Apostle did
more then he ought in commanding, or they less then they
were obliged to, in submitting, and yet neither were to do any
thing contrary or more then the Spirit of God in themselves led
them to or allowed them in; and if the Church of God bear
any Parity or Proportion now in these Dayes with what it did
of old, as I know no Reason why it should not, the same things
may now be supposed to take Effect that did then, and also be
lawfully done upon the like Occasion proceeding from the
same Spirit, and established upon the same Basis and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and thus much as to that Part to shew <hi>in whom the Power of
Decision is,</hi> which being seriously and impartialy considered
is sufficient to clear us from the Tyranny either of <hi>Popery,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other of that Nature, with those that are not either wilfully
blind, or very ignorant of <hi>Popish</hi> Principles, may observe; but
seeing to manifest that Difference was one of those things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be considered of, I shall now come to say something
of it in its proper Place.</p>

petty <hi>Schismaticks</hi>; I say whatever Way we take them, all
those that do profess themselves Members of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi>
and are so far such, as to understand their own Principles, do
unquestionably acknowledge,</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> That no General Council can be lawfully called, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That what is concluded on by Plurallity of Votes
and agreed to by the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Legates, must necessarily be
supposed to be the Judgment of the Infallible Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That all the Members of the Church are bound im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
to receive and believe it, because it proceeds from a
Council to be accounted lawful in the Respects above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
without Regard to the Intrinsick or Real Truths of the
Things prescribed, or bringing them in any Respect to the Test
or Examination of <hi>the Spirit of God in themselves,</hi> or the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Testimony,</hi> or their Agreement or Disagreement with
Truths formerly believed and receiv'd, for so much as to prove
or try them by Way of Doubt they reckon a Breach of
the first Command, as on the other Hand a matter of Merit
implicitly to receive and believe them, however inconsistent
with the Testimony of the Spirit in ones own Heart, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Truth and Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That no Man as a member of the Church of
Christ in that simple Capacity, unless a Clergy-man, or the
Embassadour of some King, &amp;c. can be admitted to sit, vote
or give his Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> that it is in no Respect to be supposed that any
Members, especially Laicks, whether in a particular City,
Country or Nation, may meet concerning any Things relating
to the Faith and Worship of the Church, and give <hi>by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God</hi> any Judgment, but that all such Meetings are to be
accounted Schismatical and Unlawful. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly.</hi> That the Promise of Infallibility, and the Gates of
Hell not prevailing, is necessarily annexed to the <hi>Pope</hi> and
Council called and authorized in the Manner above expressed.</p>
            <p>Now if to deny every one of these Propositions, wherein all
Understanding Men know the errors &amp; abuses of the <hi>Romish
Church</hi> consist, be to be <hi>Popish,</hi> then indeed may we be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62828:40"/>
to be one with the <hi>Papists</hi> in this Matter, but no otherwise; so
that the very mentioning of these things is sufficient to shew
the Difference betwixt us and them, but if any will needs
plead our Agreement with them thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Papists <hi>affirm an Infallibility of Judgment in the Church
of Christ, and so do you; therefore you are one with</hi> Papists.</p>
            <p>I answer, That proves no more our Oneness in this Matter,
then if it should be said, the <hi>Papists</hi> plead that God ought to
be worshipped, and so do you; therefore ye agree, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the vast Differences, as to that which is known
not only betwixt us and them, but betwixt them and all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
who agree more with them in the matter of Worship,
then we do.</p>
            <p>Next again, Infallibility in the Church, according as we
hold it, &amp; I have above defined it, no man upon our Supposition
or <hi>Hypothesis</hi> can deny it; for since we first assert, as a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that no Gathering, no Church nor Assembly of People,
however true their Principles be, or however exact their
Form, are to be accounted the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> except the
infallible Spirit lead and guide, what can be the Hazard to say,
that in such a Church there is still an infallible Judgment; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this is so far from <hi>Popery,</hi> that it resolves in a Proposition
quite contradictory to them: The <hi>Romanists</hi> say, <hi>That the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Spirit alwayes accompanies the Outward Visible Professors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and is annexed to the external Suceession of Bishops and Pastors,
though ever so vitious, as to their Lives,</hi> yea, though perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> in their private Judgments<note n="*" place="margin">For some <hi>Popes</hi> have been known to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny, or at least to doubt the Truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as to the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ, &amp; to call in question the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity of the Soul, and the Resurrection.</note> yet if out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
professing the Catholick Faith
and Subjection to the Church, we say
on the quite contrary that where there
is either Vitiousness of Persons, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundness
of Judgment in the particular
Members, these cannot by Virtue of
any outward Call or Succession they
have, or any Profession they make, or
Authority they may pretend to so much
or claim an Interest in any part of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62828:41"/>
Church of Christ: So then, if we admit none to be Members
of the Church, but such as are led and guided by the Spirit, it
will be no <hi>Popery</hi> in the Second Place to affirm, that where
there is a Company of People so gathered (who are not any
longer to retain justly the Name of the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> then
they are led and guided by his Spirit) or a Church so qualified
and designed, there is still an infallible Judgment; so that this
Infallibility is not annexed to the Persons, to the Succession, to
the bare visible Profession, though true (which the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> is denied to be) or to any Society, because of its Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but singly and alone to the true real and effectual Work <hi>of
Sanctification and Regeneration,</hi> the New Creature brought
forth in the Heart, and this is the <hi>Spiritual-Man</hi> which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
faith, <hi>judgeth all Things, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 15. To affirm there
is an Infallibility here cannot well be condemned by any, or
whoso doth must needs say, the Spirit of God is fallible; for
we place the Infallibility <hi>in the Spirit and in the Power,</hi> not in
the Persons, and so these are the Degrees we ascend by,
<hi>because such and such Men are led by the Spirit of God, and are
obedient to the Grace in their Hearts, therefore are they Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Officers in the Church of Christ, and because they are
Members of the Church of Christ in the Respect before declared,
therefore there is an Infallible Judgment among them</hi>: We do
not say, because such men profess the Christian Faith,
and have received an outward Ordination, and so are by a
lawful Succession, formally established Officers in the Church,
when they meet together according to certain Rules above
declared, there is an Infallibility annexed to their Conclusions,
and they cannot but decide what is right, or rather, what they
decide must needs be supposed to be right; who seeth not here
a vast Disproportion?</p>
            <p>Now we differ herein fundamentally, that is, as to the very
Basis and Foundation upon which we build, and that not only
from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but also from the Generallity of
<hi>Protestants</hi> in this matter. All <hi>Protestants</hi> do acknowledge a
General Council to be useful, yea, necessary in the Case of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62828:41"/>
Division or Debate, let us consider the Basis upon which they
proceed, and the Stress they lay upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> All jointly, both the <hi>Prelatical</hi> and <hi>Presbyterial</hi> will
have this Synod or Council to consist of a Convocation of the
Clergy, chosen and sent from the particular Congregations,
with some few laick Elders called together by the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
in case he be one in Judgment with them.</p>
            <p>They decide by Plurallity of votes, and though they assume
not an absolute Infallibility in that they reckon it possible for
them to err, yet do they reckon their Decisions obligatory
upon their supposed Consonancy to the Scripture, and howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
do affirm that the Civil Magistrate hath Power to constrain
all to submit and obey, or else to punish them either by Death,
Banishment, Imprisonment, Confiscation of Goods, or some
other Corporal Pain, even though such be perswaded and offer
to make appear, that the Decisions they refuse are contrary to
the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Lastly,</hi> As among the <hi>Papists,</hi> none, though otherwise
confessed to be a Member of the Church, both knowing and
sober, except commissionate in some of the Respects above
declared, can be admitted to sit, vote and give his Judgment.
Any that will be at the Pains to apply this to the Foundation I
before laid of the Infallibility of Judgment, in that we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
only to be truly called <hi>the Church of Christ,</hi> will easily see
the great Difference betwixt us, which I shall sum up in these
particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Do we exclude any Member of the Church of Christ,
that may be truly accounted so, to tell his Judgment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Do we say, man ought to be persecuted in his Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for his disassent in Spirituals?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Do we plead that decision is to pass conclusive
because of the plurality of Votes? And much more which
the Reader may observe from what is already mentioned, which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62828:42"/>
that it may be all more obvious at one view, will appear some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
clearly by this following Figure, which will give the
Reader an Opportunity to recollect what lay heretofore more
scattered.</p>

the Promise of Christ, <hi>That

Strength and Vigour; so that
there lies an Obligation upon
the whole Body of the Church

as do not, are not only certainly
damned for their disobedience,

so called, whether Married, or a Tradesman, or a

any Difference, there will be an infallible Judgment
from the Spirit of God, which may be in a General
Assembly, yet not limited to it as excluding others,

not to be decided thereby, as if the Infallibility were

Limitation to be of Persons particularly chosen, but
that all that in a true Sense may be reckoned of the
Church, as being sober and weighty, may be present,
and give their Judgment; and that the Infallible
Judgment of Truth, which cannot be wanting in
such a Church, whether it be given through one or
more, ought to be submitted to, not because such
Persons give it, but because the Spirit leads so to do,
which every one coming to in themselves will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and naturally assent to; and if any through
Disobedience or Unclearness do not all that the
Church ought to do, is to deny them her spiritual
Fellowship, in case the nature of their Disobedience

            <p>Who will be at the Pains to compare these Three seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
together, I am hopeful will need no further Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prove the Difference. But if any will further object,
<hi>What if it fall out de facto, that the Teachers, Elders or Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
do decide, and from thence will say, this is like the</hi> Church
of Rome, <hi>and other false Churches, it will be hard to prove that
to be an infallible Mark of a Wrong Judgment, as we have not
said it is of a Right.</hi> And indeed, to conclude it were so,
would necessarily condemn the Church in the Apostles dayes,
where we see the Teachers and Elders, and so far as we can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
the greater number did agree to the Decision, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 15.
for if the thing be right, and according to Truth, it is so much the
better that the Elders and greater Number do agree to it; and if
wrong, their affirming of it will not make it right: And truly, a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62828:43"/>
Gathering, where the Elders and greater Number are always or
most frequently wrong, and the younger and lesser Number
right, is such as we cannot suppose the <hi>true Church of Christ</hi>
to be; and if any will plead, that there is now no infallible
Judgment to be expected from the Spirit of God in the Church,
it no doubt will leave the Dissenters as much in the Mist, and
at as great a loss as those they dissent from, both being no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then blind men, hitting at random, which will turn <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
into <hi>Sceptism</hi>; and though we may acknowledge, that
this Uncertainty prevails in the generality of those called
<hi>Churches,</hi> yet we do firmly believe, (for the Reasons above
declared, and that for many more that might be given) That the
true Church of Christ has a more solid stable Foundation, and
being never separated from Christ, her Head, walks in a more
Certaiu, steady and Unerring Path.</p>

            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:62828:44"/>
            <head>THE
CONCLUSION</head>
            <p>THE Substance then of what is asserted and
proved in this Treatise resolves in these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That in the Church of Christ, when it
consists of a visible People (for I speak not here of
the Church in the dark Night of Apostacy, that
consisted not of any Society, visibly united) gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the Belief of certain Principles, and united
in the joint Performance of the Worship of God,
as meeting together, praying, preaching, &amp;c. there
is and still must be a certain Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Government, as to the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Form of it, consists of certain Meetings, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
principally for that End, yet not so as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Acts of Worship, if the Spirit move there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Object of this Government is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
Outwards and Inwards; the <hi>Outwards</hi> relate
mainly to the Care of the Poor, of Widows and
Fatherless, where may be also included Marriages,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62828:44"/>
and the removing of all Scandals in things undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
wrong; the <hi>Inwards</hi> respects an Apostacy, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Principles or Practices, that have a Pretence
of Conscience, and that either in denying some
Truths already received and believed, or asserting
new Doctrines that ought not to be received; which
again to subdivide, may either be in things funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
and of great moment, or in things of less
weight in themselves, yet proceeding <hi>from a wrong
spirit,</hi> and which in the natural and certain Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of them tend to make Schisms, Divisions,
Animosities, and in sum, to break that Bond of Love
and Unity that is so needful to be upheld and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the Church of Christ, and here comes also
under this Consideration all Emulations, Strifes,
Backbitings, Whisperings and Evil-surmisings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That in the true Church of Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Definition above given of it, there
will in such Cases of Differences and Controversies
still be an Infallible Judgment <hi>from the Spirit of God,</hi>
either in one or other, few or more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That this Infallible Judgment is only and
unalterably annexed and seated <hi>in the Spirit and Power
of God</hi>; not to any particular Person or Persons, Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Assembly, by vertue of any setled Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Office, Place or Station, that such may have,
or have had in the Church; no Man, Men nor Meeting
standing or being invested in any Authority in the
Church of Christ, upon other terms then so long as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62828:45"/>
he or they abide in the living Sense and Unity of the
Life in their own particulars, which whosoever one
or more inwardly departs from, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> loses all
Authority, Office or certain Discerning he or they
formerly have had, though retaining the true Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and sound Form, and may be not faln into any
gross Practices as may declare them generally to be
thus withered and decayed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That Jesus Christ under the Gospel hath
ordinarily revealed his Will in such Cases, through
the Elders and Ministers of the Church, or a general
Meeting, whose Testimony is neither to be despised
or rejected without good Cause; neither is their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon them really to decide any just Ground to
charge them with Imposition, or to quarrel their
Judgment, unless it can be proved that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed,
and have lost their Discerning, as above.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That to submit and obey in such Cases
is no detracting from the common Priviledge of
<hi>Christians</hi> to be inwardly led by the Spirit, seeing the
Spirit has led some heretofore so to do, and yet may;
and that every Pretence of Unclearness is not a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Excuse for Disobedience, seeing that may
proceed from Obstinacy, or a Mind prepossessed with
Prejudice; yet say I not, any ought to do it before
they be clear; and who are, every Right will not
want Clearness in what they ought to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:62828:45"/>
And <hi>Lastly,</hi> That these Principles are no wayes
tainted with Imposition, or contrary to true Liberty
of Conscience, and that they fundamentally differ
from the usurpations both of <hi>Popery, Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
or any other of that Nature.</p>
