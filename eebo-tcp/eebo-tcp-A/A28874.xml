         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LIFE

St. IGNATI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S. The Firſt BOOK.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE providence of God never
appear'd more viſibly in the
preſervation of his Church,
then in the laſt Century; ſo
fatal to <hi>Germany,</hi> to <hi>England,</hi>
and to <hi>France;</hi> by the Apoſtacy
of <hi>Luther,</hi> by the Schiſm of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and by the pretended Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Calvin:</hi> As the manners of Men generally
grow corrupt, by the ſame degrees that they looſe
their Faith; ſo were theſe new Hereſies followed by
a general licentiouſneſs. The People, after they
had revolted from the common Paſtor of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Rebelled alſo againſt their Lawful Princes; and
having ſhaken off the Yoke of Eccleſiaſtical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and of Allegiance to their Soveraigns, they
abandoned themſelves to all thoſe diſorders, which
Men are capable of, when they are govern'd by the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65023:6"/>
Spirit of Lying. Thus did Impiety ravage the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Jeſus Chriſt, and in thoſe places, where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
had been moſt flouriſhing, Altars were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan'd,
the uſe of Sacraments aboliſh'd, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Councils contemn'd, and all Laws, both Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
and Divine, trampl'd under foot.</p>
               <p>Then it was, that Heaven rais'd up <hi>Ignatius</hi> of
<hi>Loyola,</hi> to ſerve, and relieve the preſſing neceſſities of
the Chriſtian World; and it looks, as if the Divine
wiſdom had intended ſpecially to declare that very
purpoſe, by a concourſe of Accidents then happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which could not be the product of meer chance:
For in the ſame year, that <hi>Luther</hi> publickly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
his Apoſtacy in the Dyet of <hi>Worms,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
himſelf into his ſolitude of <hi>Alſtat,</hi> wrote a
Book againſt Monaſtical Vows, which made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
of Apoſtates, Did <hi>Ignatius</hi> conſecrate himſelf
to God, in the Church of <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> and in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of <hi>Manreze,</hi> write his ſpiritual Exerciſes, which
ſerv'd to form, and model his own, and to re-people
all other Religious Orders.</p>
               <p>At the very time that <hi>Calvin</hi> began to Dogmatize,
and gather Diſciples in <hi>Paris; Ignatius,</hi> who was
come thither to Study, did in like manner aſſemble
his company, to declare War againſt the Enemies of
the Catholick Faith. And Laſtly, When <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth firſt aſſum'd the Title of Head of the
Church, and Commanded all his Subjects under pain
of Death, to raze out the Name of the Pope from all
their Papers and Books: Did our new Patriark
(whoſe life I now write) lay the Foundation of a
Society, devoted to the ſervice of the Holy See.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> was born in the year 1491. in the Reign
of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Birth and his Natural parts.</note> and in that part of the
Spaniſh <hi>Biſcay,</hi> which reacheth towards the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans,</hi>
and is at this day called <hi>Guipuſcoa;</hi> Don <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65023:6"/>
his Father, Lord of <hi>Ognez,</hi> and <hi>Loyola,</hi> was
of the Ancient Nobility in that Country, and Head
of a Family, which had always enjoy'd the firſt
charges, and had produc'd many eminent Perſons.
His Mother <hi>Marina Saez de Balde,</hi> was of no leſs
Illuſtrious an Extraction. He was the laſt born of
three Daughters, and Eight Sons; well ſhap'd, of a
temper inclining to choller, his Aire and his Genius
lofty, and above all he had an ardent paſſion for Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Tho he ſeemed outwardly ſomething violent,
and haughty, he was nevertheleſs in his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
affable, and obliging. He was naturally Wiſe;
and in his firſt years a certain diſcretion was obſerv'd
in him, which had nothing of Childiſhneſs.</p>
               <p>His Father,<note place="margin">His Life in the World.</note> who judged him proper for the Court,
ſent him thither betimes, and made him Page to
the Catholick King. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> took pleaſure to
ſee a Child ſo lively and rational, and upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
gave him Marks of his good liking. But young
<hi>Ignatius</hi> was not of a humor to lead ſo unactive a
life; the Love of Glory, and the Example of his
Brothers, who had ſignaliz'd themſelves in the Army
of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſoon gave him a diſguſt of the Court,
and put thoughts of War in his head, at an Age,
in which others only mind the plays of Children.
He declar'd his intentions to the Duke of <hi>Naiare,</hi>
Don <hi>Antonio Manrique,</hi> Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and a particular friend to his Family; The
Duke, who had a Martial Soul, and was eſteem'd
one of the moſt accompliſh'd Gentlemen of his time,
did not oppoſe the deſign of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> He took
care to have him well taught his Exerciſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
himſelf in forming and inſtructing him in
them. <hi>Ignatius</hi> under ſo good a Maſter, became
in a ſhort time capable of ſerving his Prince; He
paſ'd through all the degrees of Soldiery; In all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65023:7"/>
occaſions he ſhew'd great Bravery, and was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intent, and ſedulous in the Service, whether he
Obey'd or Commanded.</p>
               <p>He was not ſo exact in the Duties of Chriſtianity,
as in the Diſcipline of War; thoſe ill habits he had
contracted at Court, were increas'd in him by the
Licentiouſneſs of the Camp; nor did the toils of
War leſſen in him his propenſion to Love and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
Perhaps there never was a Cavalier more
hardned to Labour, and at the ſame time ſo polite,
and addicted to Gallantry; and yet as Worldly as
<hi>Ignatius</hi> then was, he had in him thoſe principles of
Morality and Religion, which made him keep a
kind of decency even in his Irregularities. He was
never heard to utter any thing, that was impious
or immodeſt; he had a Reverence for Holy Places,
and Sacred Perſons. Although he were very nice
in the point of Honour, and his Natural promptneſs
incited him to revenge the leaſt Injury, yet he eaſily
Pardon'd, and was perfectly reconcil'd, upon the
leaſt ſubmiſſion, and acknowledgement. He had
a particular Talent to accommodate, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
quarrels amongſt Soldiers, and alſo to appeaſe
popular commotions; in ſo much, that he has been
ſeen more then once, with a word only to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
Parties lay down their Arms, when they
were upon the point of falling on.</p>
               <p>How generous and diſintereſs'd he was, appear'd
at the taking of <hi>Naiare,</hi> a Town ſituated upon the
Frontiers of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> which being left to the pillage
of the Soldiers, <hi>Ignatius</hi> (who had the greateſt part
in the Victory, and therefore ought to have no little
ſhare in the booty) was content to have for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
only the glory of the Action: For he judg'd,
that a Man of Honour ought not to Enrich himſelf
with the ſpoils of miſerable people. He wanted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65023:7"/>
not dexterity in the management of Affairs; and as
young as he then was, he very well underſtood, how
to humor both Men, and Occaſions; He hated
Gaming, but lov'd Poetry, and tho he had no tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Learning, he made very good Verſes in
Spaniſh, and ſometimes upon pious Subjects, among
which, one Poem is particularly mentioned, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by him in the praiſe of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This notwithſtanding, his conduct was never the
more Chriſtian, or regular, his fancy was wholly
fill'd with Gallantry and Vanity, and in all his
Actions he only follow'd the falſe maxims of the
World. In this ſort he liv'd to the Age of Nine and
twenty, at which time God was pleas'd to open his
Eyes, in the way and manner, I am now to relate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who ſucceeded <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and
was newly elected Emperor, being gone into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
to take poſſeſſion of the Imperial Crown, the
people of <hi>Spain,</hi> irritated by the exactions of the
Lord <hi>des Cheures,</hi> made an Inſurrection in <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
and the greateſt part of the <hi>Caſtilean</hi> Lords, jealous
of the Authority of the <hi>Flemings,</hi> who Govern'd
all in <hi>Spain,</hi> put themſelves at the head of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Frederick Henriques,</hi> Viceroy and Admiral
of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> being faithful to his Prince, made
it his buſineſs to ſecure and fortifie the ſtrong Holds,
and to that end, drew out of <hi>Navarre</hi> into <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
both Troops and Ammunition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt of <hi>France,</hi> who having been a
pretender to the Empire, was now become an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the Emperor, underſtanding that <hi>Navarre</hi>
was unprovided, reſolv'd to make uſe of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to recover that Kingdom, of which <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
had lately Diſpoſſeſs'd <hi>John d'Albert,</hi> and which
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth ſtill held, contrary to the treaty
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65023:8"/>
of <hi>Noyon,</hi> which oblig'd him to reſtore it in Six
Months. <hi>Francis</hi> therefore ſent a great Army thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the year 1521, under the Conduct of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
de Foix,</hi> Lord of <hi>Eſparre,</hi> and Brother to the
Famous <hi>Lautrec.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the noiſe of this March, <hi>Don Manrique,</hi> Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> went in perſon to demand ſuccours
from <hi>Don Frederick,</hi> who had newly routed the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Rebels; but in this while, the <hi>French</hi> Army
paſſed the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> and were entred into <hi>Navarre,</hi>
through the Province of <hi>Guypuſcoa,</hi> and having
taken ſeveral places of leſs Importance, laid Seige
to <hi>Pampelona,</hi> the Capital of that Kingdom. The
Viceroy had left behind <hi>Don Ignatius</hi> of <hi>Loyola,</hi> not
to Command, but to Encourage the Gariſon, and
keep the people in their Duty, under the Authority
of an old Officer.</p>
               <p>The Soldiers and Inhabitants, affrighted at the
ſight of the Enemy, were reſolv'd to open their
Gates, notwithſtanding all the Remonſtrances of
<hi>Ignatius.</hi> He promis'd them Relief, he threatned
them with the Indignation of the Viceroy, and of
the Emperor. He reproch'd them for their Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
and perfidiouſneſs; but he gain'd nothing
upon a ſort of people, poſſeſs'd with a Panick fright,
and who gave themſelves for loſt. To revenge
himſelf of them, and to ſave his own Honour, he
left them to their fears, and retir'd into the <hi>Cittadel,</hi>
with one only Soldier, who had the heart to follow
him.</p>
               <p>The Governour of the <hi>Cittadel</hi> himſelf, was in
no very good aſſurance, being ill provided with
Victuals, and Men; his Spirit began to fail him,
when he ſaw the <hi>French,</hi> Maſters of the Town. But
he was ſomewhat recover'd, when they offer'd him
an Interview to <hi>Capitulate.</hi> The Ancient Officers
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65023:8"/>
were of opinion, that they ſhould accept the offer,
made by the Enemy: <hi>Ignatius</hi> oppos'd it, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſucceſs: Not being able therefore to hinder this
Interview, he would at leaſt be of it, ſo to hinder
(if poſſible) the ſhameful conſequence it might have.
The Beſiegers confident of their Forces, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
propos'd very hard conditions to the Beſieged.
<hi>Ignatius</hi> with diſdain rejected them; and finding
that his companions were upon the point of making
a diſhonourable compoſition, on ſet purpoſe he fell
into ſharp, and provoking Language with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
whereupon the conference broke off. And
then raiſing the Courage of the Officers, who were
come forth to <hi>Capitulate,</hi> he ſhut himſelf up with
them, reſolv'd to defend the place to the laſt drop
of his Blood, at leaſt to die like a Man of Honor.
The <hi>French</hi> incenſed at the tranſport, and fierceneſs
of the young <hi>Spaniard,</hi> Attack'd the Caſtle with
great Fury. They planted all their Artillery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, and where the breach was wideſt, they
made their Approches, and in concluſion their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.
<hi>Ignatius</hi> appear'd upon the breach, at the head
of the braveſt, and receiv'd the Enemy with his
Sword in his hand. On both ſides it was obſtinately
Fought, and in a little time a great Slaughter was
made. In the heat of the Combat <hi>Ignatius</hi> was
wounded with a Splinter in his left Leg, and almoſt
in the ſame inſtant,<note place="margin">He is wounded at the Siege of <hi>Pampelona.</hi>
                  </note> his right was broken with a
Cannon bullet. The Soldiers, who had been ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by his Courage, loſt Heart when they ſaw
him thus diſabled, and rendred upon diſcretion.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>French</hi> uſed their Victory with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they carried off <hi>Ignatius</hi> to the Generals quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
treated him very civilly, and had all the care
of him that was due to his Valour and Quality. When
his Leg was ſet, and the condition of his wound
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65023:9"/>
would permit his removal, they caus'd him to be
carried in a Litter to the Caſtle of <hi>Loyola,</hi> which is
not far diſtant from <hi>Pampelona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where he was ſcarce arriv'd, but he felt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
pain. The Chirurgeons were of opinion,
that ſome of the Bones were out of their places, either
through the ignorance of him, who firſt ſet them,
or by reaſon of the moving, and jogging too ſoon
after the ſetting: And that to replace the Bones in
their Natural ſcituation, they muſt break the Leg
again. <hi>Ignatius</hi> readily believ'd them, and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their hand, he ſuffered the painful operation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt concern. But in theſe occaſions Courage
cannot always ſupport Nature, and he was forc'd
to yield to a violent Fever, which ſeiſing him
with dangerous ſymptoms, caſt him down into a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
weakneſs. The Phyſitians declar'd to him
his danger, and that he had not many days to live.
He receiv'd the Sacraments upon the Eve of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and then grew ſo much
weaker and weaker, that it was not believ'd he
would paſs that night.</p>
               <p>But God, who had his deſigns upon him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
him, contrary to all humane appearance;
and ſo order'd it, that he ſhould be cur'd by the
means, and interceſſion of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> either becauſe
<hi>Ignatius</hi> had from his youth a ſpecial veneration for
the Prince of the Apoſtles, or in regard that St. <hi>Peter</hi>
had an Intereſt in the cure of a Man deſtin'd by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to maintain againſt Hereticks the Authority of
the Holy See. However it were, the ſick Man ſaw in
his dream the Bleſſed Apoſtle, who toucht him, and
cur'd him, and the event did ſhew, that this dream
was no illuſion; for <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as ſoon as he awaked,
found himſelf out of danger; his pains left him, and
his ſtrength ſuddenly return'd. Tho he recover'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65023:9"/>
Miraculouſly his health, he did not loſe the ſpirit
of the World; his Leg, which had been ill ſet at
firſt, was not ſo well re-ſet the ſecond time but that
there remain'd a viſible deformity, caus'd by the
ſtanding out of a Bone under the Knee, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the Cavalier from wearing a Boot with a good
Grace; He paſſionately affecting to appear every
way compleat, without the leaſt blemiſh, reſolv'd
to have this Bone cut off. The Chirurgions told
him, the operation would be extreamly dolorous:
He reckon'd pain for nothing, and would neither be
bound nor held; The Bone was cut off, and <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
whilſt it was doing, hardly chang'd his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>This was not the only torment, which he endur'd,
that he might have nothing of deformity in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
one of his Thighs being ſhrunk, by reaſon of
his wound, he was in mighty apprehenſion, leaſt
any lameneſs ſhould appear in his Gate, which to
prevent, he put himſelf for many days together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a kind of Rack, and with an Engine of Iron he
violently ſtretch't, and drew out his Leg: But with
all his pains and endeavours, he could never extend
it, but that ever after his right Leg remain'd ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then his left.</p>
               <p>The Poſture <hi>Ignatius</hi> was now in, did not very
well agree with his Active and Ardent nature; he
was reſtrain'd from Walking, and confin'd to his
Bed. Having nothing to do, it appear'd the more
irkſom to him, in regard he found himſelf perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in health, bating only the cure of his Knee, which
requir'd time; He therefore to divert himſelf, call'd
for a Romance; <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> and ſuch Books
of Knight Errantry, were at that time in great
vogue with all Perſons of Quality; and he above the
reſt, was moſt particularly affected with the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65023:10"/>
and feats of Arms, in ſuch Books related.
Altho the Caſtle of <hi>Loyola</hi> did not uſe to be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
of ſuch Fabulous Hiſtories, yet, at that time,
they could not light upon any; ſo that inſtead of
a Romance, they brought him the Life of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and of the Saints.</p>
               <p>Theſe Books he read with no other deſign,<note place="margin">His Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> but
to wear away the time, and at firſt, without any
guſt, or pleaſure; But after a while, he began in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
to reliſh them, and by degrees took ſuch
delight in them, that he paſt whole days in reading.
The firſt effect which this produc'd in him, was to
admire in the Saints their love for Solitude, and
for the Croſs. He conſidered with Aſtoniſhment,
among the <hi>Anchorets</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> Men
that had been of quality, and condition in the World,
cover'd with Hair-ſhirts, macerated with Faſtings,
and buried alive in Caves and Dens: He thereupon
ſaid within himſelf, <hi>Theſe Men, ſo much at enmity
with their own fleſh, and ſo dead to the vanities of
the Earth, were of the ſame nature that I am of: Why
therefore ſhould not I do, what they have done?</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he took a reſolution to imitate them, and
thought nothing too great for his courage, nor too
hard for his undertaking. He propos'd to himſelf,
to viſit the Holy Sepulchre, and to ſhut himſelf up
in an Hermitage: But theſe good motions laſted
but for a while, and he quickly relaps'd into his
former weakneſs. Beſides his innate paſſion for
Glory, he had a ſecret inclination for a certain Lady
of great Quality in the Court of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and now
inſtead of thinking upon his Retreat, his head was
full of I know not what, Military exploits, to make
himſelf worthy of the Ladies favour, as he himſelf
has afterwards confeſt to Father <hi>Lewis Gonzales,</hi>
giving him an accompt of his Converſion. He
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65023:10"/>
was poſſeſt to that degree with theſe fond Ideas, that
it would not enter into him, how any Man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
could be happy without a ſtrong paſſion for
Glory, and the ſofter entertainments of Love. When
his thoughts were tired with thus tumbling about,
for his diverſion he ſet himſelf again to read; and
falling into freſh admiration of the vertues he
found in the Saints, there did appear to him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more wonderful in their Actions, then in all
the exploits of thoſe Romantick Heroes, which had
formerly fill'd his imagination. And by reading
on, and reflecting upon what he read, he came at
length to underſtand, that nothing was more frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
then that Worldly Glory, which had ſo poſſeſt
his fancy; that God only was capable to content the
Soul of Man, and that he ought to renounce all
things, to make his Salvation ſure.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations did by degrees re-kindle in
him the deſire of ſolitude, and that, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear'd impoſſible to him, conſulting his nature
and inclinations, now ſeem'd feaſible and eaſie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the example of the Saints before his Eyes.
But ſtill when he was juſt upon the point of taking
a good Reſolution, the World with all its Charms
ſo powerfully aſſaulted him, that he fell back, and
ſoon became the old Man again.</p>
               <p>Many days he ſpent in this fluctuation of mind,
unreſolv'd which way to determine himſelf; ſtill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by God, and ſtill held faſt by the World.
But theſe his various thoughts, as they were very
Heterogenious in their origine, ſo were they no
leſs different in their effects. Thoſe, which came
from God, fill'd him with conſolation, and caus'd
within him a profound peace and tranquility of
mind; But the others, though at firſt they brought
with them a more ſenſible delight, yet after ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65023:11"/>
he found, they left behind them a certain
bitterneſs, and heavineſs at Heart. He reflected
upon it, and (as Carnal and Worldly as he then was)
he began to reaſon and diſcourſe with himſelf upon
the nature of ſpiritual things; for God Almighty,
who had reſolv'd to ſettle in him a great fund of
Sanctity, and to ſhew in his perſon, how far Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Wiſdom can advance, when accompani'd with
great Natural parts, would not have his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
too eaſily, or ſuddenly made.</p>
               <p>He obſerv'd that there were two kinds of Spirits,
diametrically oppoſite, the one of God, the other of
the World; He took notice by what he found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
himſelf, that a ſolid joy which penetrates the
Soul, does infinitely ſurpaſs that light and flaſhy
pleaſure, which only gratifies the ſenſes: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it was eaſie for him to conclude, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the things of Heaven have over thoſe of the
Earth, in order to the contenting and ſatiating the
Heart of Man. Theſe firſt Rudiments, which
<hi>Ignatius</hi> had of interior motions, were the Ground
and Foundation of thoſe Rules, which he gives us
in the Book of his Exerciſes, for the diſcernment of
thoſe Spirits, which are in us the principles of Good
and Evil.</p>
               <p>Theſe great Truths having taken full poſſeſſion
of his Soul, and being fortified with Divine Grace
againſt all the ſuggeſtion of Hell; He made now
a final Reſolution to change his Life, and quite to
break off with the World. His firſt purpoſe was,
to uſe his Body with all the rigor it was able to bear;
and this he did, either through a lively apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the torments of Hell, with intent to appeaſe
the Divine juſtice, or elſe, as being yet but of ſmall
experience in a Spiritual life, he imagin'd that all
Chriſtian perfection conſiſted in the maceration of
the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65023:11"/>
He reſolv'd therefore to go bare-foot to the Holy
Land, to cloth himſelf with Sackcloth, to faſt with
Bread and Water, not to ſleep but on the bare
Ground, and to chooſe a wild Deſert for his aboad;
But whereas his Leg was not yet perfectly cur'd, he
could not immediately execute what his love of
Pennance inſpir'd him to do.</p>
               <p>So that for the preſent, to ſatisfie in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
his fervour, he conſtantly roſe up at midnight,
and being throughly toucht with a Remorſe of his
ſins, he ſpent that time, which was free from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
of company, in weeping for them. One
night among the reſt, being up according to his
cuſtom, and proſtrating himſelf before an Image of
the Bleſſed Virgin, with extraordinary ſentiments of
Piety, he offered up himſelf to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by her
means, and interceſſion, and Conſecrated himſelf
to the Service of the Son and the Mother, vowing
to them both an inviolable fidelity. When he had
ended his Prayer, he heard a mighty noiſe, the Houſe
trembled, all the windows of his Chamber were
broken, and there was made a great rent in the
Wall, which remains at this day to be ſeen. It is
probable, that God did thereby make it appear, that
the Sacrifice of his new Servant was agreeable to
him; for Heaven ſometimes declares it ſelf by ſuch
ſurprizing ſigns in favour of the Saints; witneſs,
what we read in the Acts of the Apoſtles, of the
place where the Faithful were Congregated to
make their Prayers; and of the Priſon where St. <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Silas</hi> ſung Hymns together. It may alſo be,
that this Earthquake was caus'd by the Devils, who
inrag'd to ſee their prey raviſh'd from them, and
foreſeeing, what <hi>Ignatius</hi> would one day become,
did their endeavour, by the fall of the Caſtle of
<hi>Loyola,</hi> to put a Period to his life, and to his future
progreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65023:12"/>
Thus, whilſt his Leg was ſtill in cure, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
reading the lives of our Saviour and the Saints;
not as formerly, for amuzement ſake, and to paſs
away the time, but to the end of forming his own
life according to thoſe great Models, and of corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating
his Holy Reſolutions. Nor did he only
read them, but he made them the ſubject of his
Meditation, and wrote down what he found moſt
ſenſibly to affect him.</p>
               <p>It is farther ſaid of him, that having Learn'd
in his Youth to deſign, he took delight with
Crayons of ſeveral Colours to draw the moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Actions of the Saints, and to write down their
remarkable ſayings; to the intent of Printing
them deeper in his memory.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was thus imploy'd, the great Truths
of Chriſtianity took ſuch deep root in him, that he
himſelf was aſtoniſh'd at his own transformation into
another Man, ſo that the converſion of <hi>Ignatius</hi>
was finiſhed, and brought to perfection, by the
ſame means, which firſt gave the riſe, and entrance
to it. And the reading of good Books work'd that
in him, which neither a mortal Diſeaſe, nor the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of Death, nor an apparition from Heaven,
with a miraculous cure could effect: So much it
imports Worldly perſons, and even the moſt obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſinners, ſome times to read Books of Piety.</p>
               <p>The Favours he receiv'd from Heaven, did not
a little ſerve him to forget the Vanities of the
World: The bleſſed Virgin all inviron'd with
light appear'd to him one Night, holding little
<hi>Jeſus</hi> in her Arms. At this Viſion <hi>Ignatius</hi> felt his
Soul repleniſh'd with ſuch a ſpiritual Unction, as
ever after rendred all pleaſures of the Senſes inſipid
to him. During this Apparition, which laſted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
time, it ſeem'd to him that his Heart was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65023:12"/>
purifi'd within him, and that all images of ſenſual
Delights were quite raz'd out of his Mind. Theſe
happy effects did not end with the Apparition; for
from that time forward he was never ſubject to the
rebellion of carnal concupiſcence, nor even to thoſe
thoughts with which ſometimes the moſt chaſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
uſe to be tormented. But the diſappearing of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
and <hi>Mary</hi> left him in great trouble: Wherefore
to comfort himſelf, he often with flaming Aſpirations
look'd up to Heaven; and when he did ſo, all that
was charming and tempting in the World, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
with horror. His Leg being throughly cur'd,
he prepar'd himſelf in good earneſt to follow the
Voice of Heaven, but did it with all poſſible ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;
being even then perſwaded, that the Affairs of
God are to be carry'd on without noiſe; and that
no oſtentation ſhould be us'd in leaving the World.
And yet, to ſee him ſo different from himſelf, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in profound Meditations, ſpeaking little, and
ſpeaking only of the vanity of worldly things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Reading, and Writing; it was eaſie to imagine,
that he was diſguſted with the World, and that he
projected ſomething very extraordinary. <hi>Don
Martino Garſias,</hi> his eldeſt Brother, who ſince the
death of <hi>Don Bertram</hi> was become Lord of the
Caſtle of <hi>Loyola,</hi> one who did not live over-much
according to the Maxims of the Goſpel, did all that
he could to diſcover and break his Deſign. Taking
him one Day aſide, he began to praiſe the good
Qualities that Nature had beſtow'd upon him, and
above all, his Warlike Genius, which from his
Childhood had made him embrace the Profeſſion of
Arms; and the maturity of his Judgment, which
appear'd ſo early in his Conduct: After this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
him not to give way to his Melancholly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
nor raſhly to run upon any extravagant
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65023:13"/>
Courſes. He ſaid to him, <hi>You have gain'd no little Glory
at the Siege of</hi> Pampelona, <hi>and you are now reckon'd
among the moſt illuſtrious Warriors of</hi> Spain, <hi>do not
deſtroy your own Reputation, nor diſhonor your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
by a Folly unworthy of your Name; at leaſt
hide not from me thoſe Thoughts, with which of late
you are ſo fill'd, and alter'd; and put confidence in a
Brother, who tenderly loves you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When God ſpeaks efficaciouſly to the Heart, the
words of Men, be they never ſo flattering, make
little impreſſion. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who thought nothing
ſo truly Great, as the contempt of worldly Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and apprehending the danger which a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with his Brother might expoſe him to, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
him in two words; <hi>That he was very far
from doing any fooliſh thing, and that he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
always to live like a Man of Honor.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſo ſhort and general an Anſwer did not
content <hi>Don Garſias,</hi> however it made him hope,
that <hi>Ignatius</hi> would make ſober Reflections upon
what he had ſaid, and ſo in time would come again
to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Soon after this,<note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Montſerrat.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who had taken his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
for his departure from <hi>Loyola,</hi> got on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
without any other deſign in appearance, then
to viſit the Duke of <hi>Naiare,</hi> who liv'd at <hi>Navarret,</hi>
a ſmall neighbouring Town, and who during his
Sickneſs had often ſent to ſee him. From this Place
he took ſome occaſion to ſend home his two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
which attended him; and having ended his
Viſit, he went without any Company onwards in
the way to <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> a Monaſtery of St. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s
Order, diſtant a days Journey from <hi>Barcelona.</hi> This
Place is famous for the Devotion of Pilgrims, who
come thither from all parts of the World, to implore
the ſuccour, and to honor a miraculous Image of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65023:13"/>
the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> At his coming out of <hi>Navarret,</hi>
he made a Vow of perpetual Chaſtity; and this he
did, not only to render himſelf more agreable to
the high pattern of Purity, the Holy Virgin, before
whom he was ſhortly to preſent himſelf, but alſo, as
it were, to put a Seal (never to be broken) upon
the grace and gift of Chaſtity, which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in the Apparition we formerly mention'd.
For altho he found himſelf free from all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
of concupiſcence, yet he thought he could
never be too ſevere, and therefore reſolv'd always
to be upon his guard, leſt thoſe extinguiſh'd flames
ſhould kindle again.</p>
               <p>The Zeal which he then conceiv'd for the honor
of the Mother of God, had almoſt tranſported him
too far, for want of light and experience in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
matters, in which he was yet but a Novice.
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who had conquer'd the <hi>Moors,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to root them out of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo to aboliſh
<hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> of which they made profeſſion, could
not ſo wholly purge them out of his Kingdom, but
that many remain'd after the Conqueſt of <hi>Granada:</hi>
That Prince being deceas'd, ſome Reliques of thoſe
Infidels were ſcatter'd even in the Kingdoms of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia</hi>
and <hi>Arragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of theſe <hi>Mahometan Moors</hi> happen'd to
joyn <hi>Ignatius</hi> on the Road, and as Travellers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ask Queſtions of the Places from whence,
and whither they come, and go; <hi>Montſerrat</hi> being
nam'd, they fell into Argument about the immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Purity of the Bleſſed Virgin. The <hi>Moor</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree'd,
that till the Birth of <hi>Chriſt, Mary</hi> preſerv'd
her Virginity; but he maintain'd, that when ſhe
became a Mother, ſhe ceas'd to be a Virgin. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
could not hear this Blaſphemy without horror;
he took great pains to diſabuſe the <hi>Moor,</hi> and his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65023:14"/>
Devotion inſtructed him with Reaſons far ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the capacity of a Soldier; but his Arguments
were loſt upon the Infidel, whoſe Underſtanding
was poiſon'd, and prepoſſeſs'd againſt Chriſtian
Truth. The <hi>Moor</hi> ſlighted his Reaſons, and fell to
railly his Religion; but perceiving that his Raile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
began to ſtir the choller of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by his Phyſiognomy that he would take his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
not in words only, the Infidel very wiſely
ſet Spurs to his Horſe, and made his way with all
the ſpeed he could. <hi>Ignatius</hi> tranſported both with
anger and zeal, was in doubt with himſelf, whether
his Faith did not oblige him to revenge the Honor
of the Bleſſed Virgin, by the death of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan:</hi>
Nor are we much to wonder, that ſuch
a Doubt ſhould come into the Head of a Man
brought up in Arms, accuſtom'd to Combats, and
but little inſtructed in the Rules of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Not being able to reſolve his Doubt, and fearing
on the other ſide to be wanting in his Duty, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
at leaſt to follow the <hi>Moor,</hi> and then to do
what God ſhould inſpire him. Thus riding on, he
came where the Road parted, one Way leading to
<hi>Montſerrat,</hi> and the other to a Village, whither the
<hi>Moor</hi> was gone; he ſtopt ſhort with his Horſe, and
reſolv'd on the ſudden to leave himſelf to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of his Beaſt, which of the Ways to take, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
to kill the <hi>Moor,</hi> if Providence directed his
Horſe that Way which leads to the Village; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
he ſlacken'd his Reins, and altho the Road
to the Village was very plain and wide, the Horſe
of his own accord took the other leading to <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerrat,</hi>
which was both narrow and rugged; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Ignatius</hi> concluded, that God did not require
at his hands, that he ſhould revenge the Blaſphemies
of the <hi>Moor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:65023:14"/>
Being come to the Village, lying at the foot of a
Mountain, on which ſtands the Monaſtery of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerrat,</hi>
he bought for his Voyage of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a long
Coat of courſe Cloth, a Girdle, a pair of Sandals,
with a Pilgrims Staff, and a Wallet: This Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
of a Pilgrim he took along with him up to the
Monaſtery, where his firſt thoughts were, to begin
the Reformation of his Life, by a general Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of all his Sins, tho at that time ſuch Confeſſions
were not much in uſe. For the well performing
ſo important an Action, he made it his buſineſs to
find out ſome very able ſpiritual Director, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
him in the Duties of a Penitent, and to ſet him
right in the way of ſaving his Soul.</p>
               <p>There was in the Monaſtery a Religious Man of
eminent Sanctity, call'd <hi>Don John Chanones,</hi> of the
<hi>French</hi> Nation, a Man of great Sence, and who
before his retreat had ſometime been Grand Vicar of
<hi>Mirapoix. Ignatius</hi> had the good fortune to light
into the hands of this good Religious Man, who was
chief Confeſſor of the Pilgrims. He wrote down his
Sins with all poſſible exactneſs: but he confeſs'd
them with ſo lively a Sorrow, and ſuch abundance
of Tears, that he was forc'd ſeveral times to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
his Confeſſion; ſo that it laſted three days. He
diſcover'd to his Confeſſor all his Intentions, and
chiefly that Form of an auſtere Life which he was
reſolv'd to lead. The good Father, who was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a very mortifi'd Perſon, confirm'd <hi>Ignatius</hi> in
his Deſign; and withal gave him Rules for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
diſcovering to him thoſe ſnares which the evil
Spirit might poſſibly lay for him in his firſt Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
               <p>The Sentiments of Pennance which <hi>Ignatius</hi> then
had, went farther then bare Sighs and Tears. In the
Evening he went forth to find out a poor Man, to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65023:15"/>
whom, ſtripping himſelf to his Shirt, he privately
gave all his Clothes; then putting on his long
Weed, and girt with a Cord, which he had bought
by the way, he return'd back to the Church of the
Monaſtery: Entring in, there came into his thoughts
what he had formerly read in <hi>Amadis,</hi> and ſuch
other Books of Chivalry, that thoſe Knights, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were receiv'd into the Order, did watch
a whole Night in their Arms. He to convert into
a holy uſage this profane Ceremony, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
made his Vigil before the Altar of our Lady,
ſometimes ſtanding, ſometimes kneeling, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
praying and devoting himſelf to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and
<hi>Mary,</hi> in quality of their Knight, according to
thoſe Warlike <hi>Idea's</hi> which were ſtill in him,
and by which he repreſented to himſelf the things
of God.</p>
               <p>He hung up his Sword upon a Pillar near the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
in teſtimony of his renouncing ſecular Warfare.
Very early in the Morning he Receiv'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and then departed from <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leſt he ſhould be diſcover'd by ſome of thoſe
perſons who came from <hi>Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Navarr:</hi> For
that Day happen'd to be the Feaſt of the <hi>Annunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
which is Celebrated in that holy Place with
much Solemnity, and great concourſe of Pilgrims
from all <hi>Spain.</hi> He left his Horſe to the Monaſtery,
and carry'd away nothing with him but ſome peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
Inſtruments, which (at his requeſt) were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
upon him by his Ghoſtly Father.</p>
               <p>He march'd with his Staff in his Hand,<note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Manreze.</hi>
                  </note> his Scrip
by his Side, bare-headed, one Foot bare, for the
other, which had ſtill a weakneſs ſince his hurt, and
ſwell'd every Night, he thought neceſſary to be
ſhod; but he march'd with ſuch vigor and ſpeed,
as well ſhew'd what Spirit mov'd him; mightily
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65023:15"/>
comforted, in having caſt off the Liveries of the
World, and put on thoſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was ſcarce advanc'd a League, when he heard
the noiſe of a Horſeman riding with full ſpeed after
him: He was an Officer of the Juſtice, belonging
to <hi>Montſerrat. Is it true</hi> (ſays he being come up to
him) <hi>that you have beſtow'd rich Clothes upon a
Beggar? Notwithſtanding the poor Man's proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the contrary, he is not believ'd; he is ſuſpected
of theft, and clapt in Priſon.</hi> At theſe words <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
was ſenſibly griev'd, and could not refrain
tears. To deliver the innocent he confeſs'd the
truth; but would not declare (tho preſs'd to it)
neither his Quality, nor his Name. He purſu'd his
Journey with ſome trouble of mind, for the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the poor Man, which he reckon'd his own,
in that he could not aſſiſt his Neighbour, without
bringing him into trouble. With theſe thoughts he
went on towards <hi>Manreze,</hi> where he reſolv'd to
conceal himſelf, and to wait till the Plague did ceaſe
at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and till the Port was open, that he
might proceed in his Journey to the Holy Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manreze</hi> is a little Town, three Leagues diſtant
from <hi>Montſerrat;</hi> a Place famous at this day, for
the exemplary Pennance of the Saint, whoſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
I write, and for Devotion of the People, who
reſort thither in Pilgrimage from all Parts; but at
that time hardly taken notice of, having nothing in
it conſiderable, but a Monaſtery of <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and
an Hoſpital for Pilgrims, and ſick Perſons. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
went ſtraight to the Hoſpital, which ſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Walls of the Town, and was call'd the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of St. <hi>Lucius.</hi> He took great content, to ſee
himſelf in the number of the Poor, and in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of doing Pennance witout being known.</p>
               <p>Which he began by Faſting the whole Week
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65023:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with Bread and Water,<note place="margin">His peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Life.</note> excepting the <hi>Sunday,</hi> when
he eat a few boil'd Herbs, but ſprinkled over with
Aſhes; he girded his Reins with an iron Chain;
under his courſe Habit he wore a Hair Shirt; thrice
a day he Diſciplin'd himſelf, ſlept little, and lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ground.</p>
               <p>In this ill treatment of himſelf, he had at firſt no
other aim, but to imitate thoſe holy Penitents, whoſe
Lives he had read, and to expiate the Diſorders of
his Life paſt. Afterwards he conceiv'd an ardent
deſire of purſuing the Glory of God in all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and this deſire render'd the Motive of his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
more pure and noble. The truth is, he had
always his ſins before his eyes, and always he had a
horror of them: But after ſome time his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
did not touch him, and in thoſe rigours which he
us'd upon his Perſon, inſtead of minding to ſatisfie
for the pains which his ſins deſerv'd, he only
thought of revenging the injury, and repairing the
Honor of the Divine Majeſty.</p>
               <p>He was every day preſent at the whole Service of
the Church, and ſpent ſeven hours in Prayer upon
his Knees; and tho he had not as yet the Rules of
Mental Prayer, yet he was ſo recollected, that he
many times continued ſeveral hours together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any motion. He often viſited the Church of
our Lady at <hi>Villa Dordis,</hi> which is but half a League
from <hi>Manreze,</hi> and when he perform'd theſe little
Pilgrimages, he commonly added to his Hair Shirt
and his Chain, a Girdle of certain Herbs, full of
little Thorns and Prickles.</p>
               <p>Reflecting upon his own conduct, he rightly
judg'd, that the macerations of the Fleſh would little
advance him in the ways of Heaven, if he did not
make it his buſineſs to ſtifle in himſelf all motions of
pride and ſelf-love. To this end he begg'd his Bread
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65023:16"/>
from Door to Door, endeavouring to appear a real
Beggar; and leſt any ſhould gueſs at his Quality, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his Countenance or by his Behaviour, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
clowniſhneſs in his Carriage, ſo to liken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the meaneſt ſort of People. And the better to
diſguiſe himſelf, he entirely neglected his Perſon, and
ſtudied how to deform himſelf; he, who formerly
made it his chief happineſs to appear graceful and
comely in the eyes of the World. His Face all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Dirt, his Hair clodded and uncomb'd,
his Beard and his Nails grown out to a fearful
length, made ſuch a Figure of him, as ſeem'd at once
both frightful and ridiculous; ſo that whenever he
appear'd in the Town of <hi>Manreze,</hi> the Children
pointed at him, threw Stones at him, and follow'd
him in the Streets with ſhouts and outcries. Moſt
part of the People of whom he ask'd Alms, inſtead
of giving him any thing, laught at him; and one
there was more brutal then the reſt, who not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to abuſe him only when he met him in the Street,
would often go on purpoſe to the Hoſpital to revile
him, and to inſult over him. <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſuffer'd all
theſe outrages and ſcorns without ſaying a word, as
if he had been a ſtupid Ideot, but rejoyc'd in his
heart that he had his ſhare in the reproches of the
Croſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Devil could not endure theſe Chriſtian Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
in a Man naturally haughty, and who was
but a beginner in the Service of God; therefore he
took his time to tempt him with ſuch thoughts as
theſe;</hi> What do you do in an Hoſpital? Heaven,
who has beſtow'd upon you a noble Extraction, and
generous Inclinations, would have you to be a holy
Cavalier, not a counterfeit Beggar. Were you at
Court, or in the Army, your Example alone would
reform all the Couriers and the Soldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65023:17"/>
At the ſame time the naſtineſs of the Hoſpital
grew ſtrangely noiſom and diſguſtful to him; and
he felt an inward ſhame to ſee himſelf in the
company of Beggars. But he ſoon diſcover'd
the ſuggeſtion of the malignant Spirit, who under
the pretence of a ſpecious and plauſible Good, would
have drawn him out of that way in which God had
plac'd him. To vanquiſh the Enemy, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
himſelf, he now us'd more familiarity then
before with his poor Companions, and apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the tending of thoſe ſick Perſons whoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
were moſt loathſom.</p>
               <p>In the mean time a report was ſpread in <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reze,</hi>
That the poor Beggar, whom no body knew
what he was, or whence he came, and who was
mock'd and ſcorn'd by every body, was a Man of
Quality, diſguis'd upon the ſcore of Pennance.
The above-mention'd Adventure of the Beggar of
<hi>Montſerrat</hi> was the ground of this ſuſpicion: It
had made a noiſe in the Country, and by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the Face, and the marks of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
they judg'd that this unknown Pilgrim might
well be the ſame Cavalier who ſtript himſelf to his
Shirt. The Modeſty, the Patience, and the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> made this conjecture very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
ſo that the Inhabitants of <hi>Manreze</hi> began to
look upon him with other eyes; and by how much
they were conſcious of their Indignities againſt him,
by ſo much more they now did reverence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
him. He perceiv'd it, and to avoid this new
ſnare, which he imagin'd the Devil had laid for him,
he ſought out a Retreat, where he might be more
conceal'd then in the Hoſpital.</p>
               <p>At the foot of a Hill,<note place="margin">He retires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cave.</note> about half a mile from the
Town, he found a Place fit for his purpoſe; it was
a dark and deep Cave, in the hollow of a Rock,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65023:17"/>
which open'd into a ſolitary Valley, commonly
call'd, <hi>The Vale of Paradice.</hi> This Cave was known
to few, and it appear'd ſo hideous, that none
would ever venture into it. <hi>Ignatius</hi> made his way
through the over-grown Buſhes and Brambles,
which ſtopt up the paſſage and entrance into it. And
in this gloomy Cavern, which had no light but
what came in by a ſmall cleft in the Rock, he fix'd
his abode.</p>
               <p>The horror of the Place inſpir'd him with a new
ſpirit of Pennance, and the liberty he had in ſo great
ſolitude, gave ſcope to his fervour, to proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
without reſtraint. He chaſtis'd his Body four or
five times a day with an iron Chain; three or four
Days together he remain'd without taking any Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment;
and when he could hold out no longer,
he reliev'd himſelf with a few Roots which he found
in the Valley, and ſome Bread which he brought
from the Hoſpital. The ſeven hours of Prayer,
which was his former ſtint, did not now ſatisfie him;
he did nothing but Pray, or rather he employ'd both
Night and Day to lament the Tranſgreſſions of his
Youth, and to praiſe the Mercies of our Lord.
Sometimes he went out of his Cave, and whatever
his Eyes beheld, ſerv'd to entertain his penitential
Sentiments. When he beheld a rapid Torrent run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the foot of a Hill, he conſider'd with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that all the things of this World paſs and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
and are unworthy the care and eſteem of an
immortal Soul.</p>
               <p>Tho <hi>Ignatius</hi> were of a very ſtrong Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet theſe Exceſſes had mightily ruin'd his
Health; he had great pains in his Stomach, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with continual faintings; and ſome who
had made ſearch after him, and had diſcover'd the
Place of his Retreat, found him one Day in a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65023:18"/>
Swoon at the entrance of the Cave; When he was
brought to himſelf, and had recover'd a little
ſtrength by the Nouriſhment which his Friends
made him take, he would have retir'd again to his
dark Cell; but they would not ſuffer it, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
him againſt his will to the Hoſpital of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reze.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The malignant Spirit took hold of this occaſion
to aſſault</hi> Ignatius <hi>with a temptation of Deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is tempted, and reſiſts the temptation.</note>
How will you be able to endure ſo auſtere a
Life for fifty years together, which you are yet to
live? <hi>ſaid the Tempter to him.</hi> Ignatius, <hi>who well
underſtood whence this ſuggeſtion came, anſwer'd
within his ſoul,</hi> You that talk at this rate, can you
inſure me only one day of life? Is not God the Maſter
of our days? And were I yet to live fifty years, what
are ſo many years to Eternity?</p>
               <p>But in the mean time <hi>Ignatius</hi> was ſeis'd with a
violent Feaver; which finding a Body ſo waſted
and broken, ſoon got the upper hand of Nature;
ſo that his life was deſpaired of. Lying in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
he heard another inward voice often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
to him, That he need not be troubled to
die, becauſe he dy'd a Saint; and that, being arriv'd
to ſo high a degree of perfection in ſo ſhort a time,
he had no reaſon to fear either the temptation of
the Devil, or the Judgment of God. After this, there
appear'd (as it were) plac'd before his Eyes, his
Sackcloth, his Chains of iron, his Hair-Shirt, and
all the Inſtruments of his Pennance. There alſo
was repreſented to him, on one ſide his Cave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew'd
with his tears, and ſprinkl'd with his blood;
on the other, Heaven open, where the Angels with
Palms and Crowns in their Hands, invited him to
come in. Tho theſe imaginations caus'd horror in
him (as well knowing whence they came) yet ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65023:18"/>
ſtrongly were they impreſs'd in his Fancy, that he
had great difficulty to put them by: For a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative
againſt them, he call'd into his memory
the moſt ſhameful and enormous ſins of his life; he
made to himſelf a lively repreſentation of the
pains of Hell, which he had ſo often merited, and
then ask'd himſelf this Queſtion, <hi>Whether there
were any proportion between one Month of Pennance,
and an Eternity of Torments?</hi> Theſe Conſiderations
humbl'd him in the ſight of God, and made him
clearly to underſtand that he ought to fear, and not
to preſume. In concluſion, he vanquiſh'd the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation;
but he remain'd ſo terrifi'd with it, that
when he came to be a little recover'd, he deſir'd
ſome devout Perſons who tended him in his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
often to tell him in his Ear, <hi>Remember your
ſins, and think not that Heaven was made for ſuch
Sinners as you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this was not the rudeſt aſſault which <hi>Ignatius</hi>
ſuſtain'd in his Retreat of <hi>Manreze;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is afflicted with interior pains, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, with Scruples.</note> Since he firſt
gave himſelf up to God, he for a while enjoy'd a
perfect tranquillity, he often taſted that healing joy
which the Holy Ghoſt doth uſually pour into the
Souls of newly converted Sinners, ſo to give them a
diſguſt of the Pleaſures of the World, and to ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to them the labour of Pennance. This interior
calm, and theſe ſpiritual joys were now taken from
him, inſomuch that in the times of his Prayer, and
in his Mortifications, he found nothing but anxiety
and dryneſs; ſometimes ('tis true) ſerenity of mind
all on the ſudden would return, and with ſuch a
flood of conſolations, that he was even overwhelm'd
and tranſported out of himſelf. But theſe delicious
moments had no continuance; and he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
often, as it were, precipitated from an illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſtate, into deſolation and darkneſs. Having not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65023:19"/>
had any experience of theſe different ſtates, and not
knowing that Souls at their entrance into a Chriſtian
Life are often treated after that manner, leſt they
ſhould attribute the fervour they feel, to their own
forces, and ſhould more adhere to the Favours of
God, then to God himſelf. In theſe ſudden changes
he us'd to cry out, <hi>What new war is this? Into
what unknown Liſts do we enter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God Almighty alſo put him upon other trials;
Tho <hi>Ignatius</hi> had made a very exact Confeſſion,
and was none of thoſe weak Heads that are troubled
with vain appearances, yet was he now cruelly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
with the torment of Scruples. Sometimes he
doubted whether he had duly explicated all the
Circumſtances of ſuch and ſuch Sins; ſometimes he
was afraid that ſome he had conceal'd, or at leaſt had
not clearly expreſt them, to cover his ſhame. To
clear himſelf of theſe doubts, and to diſſipate his
fears, he had recourſe to Prayer; but the more he
pray'd, the more his doubts and fears grew upon
him. Every ſtep he made he thought he ſtumbled
and offended God, imagining there to be ſin where
there was not the leaſt ſhadow of it, and always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
with himſelf about the ſtate of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
not being able to decide what was ſin, and
what was not. In theſe continual conflicts and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Mind, ſometimes he broke out into ſighs,
into outcries, and threw himſelf upon the Ground,
like a Man tormented with pain; but for the moſt
part he kept a mournful ſilence, as if the ſadneſs
which oppreſs'd him, had made him inſenſible and
ſtupid.</p>
               <p>Amidſt all theſe ſpiritual convulſions, he had no
relief but from the Holy Sacrament of the Altar,
which he receiv'd every <hi>Sunday:</hi> It happen'd alſo
to him more then once, that being ready to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65023:19"/>
his troubles of Mind ſo redoubled upon
him, that fearing to commit a Sacriledge, he retir'd
from the Holy Table full of confuſion and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
After a great many unprofitable debates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
himſelf, in which his Underſtanding was loſt, and
could ſee no day, it entred into his thoughts, that
Obedience only could cure him, and that his pains
would ceaſe, if his Confeſſor did command him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to forget what was paſt. But he had a difficulty
to propoſe to his Confeſſor an Expedient of his own
finding out. True it is, he had been forbid to heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to Scruples; but he had no certain Rule whereby
to know what was a Scruple, and what not; And
to decide this matter, was to him a new ſubject of
diſquiet.</p>
               <p>He did not fail to continue his practices of Piety
and Pennance, judging that the more he was in
trouble, the more exact and ſedulous he ought to be.
But finding no relief, neither from Earth nor from
Heaven, he believ'd that God had forſaken him,
and that his damnation was certain. No body can
tell the torment which he then ſuffer'd; and none
but thoſe Perſons who are afflicted with this ſort of
Croſſes, are able to conceive how heavy they are.</p>
               <p>The Religious of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> in the Monaſtery
of <hi>Manreze,</hi> who govern'd his Conſcience, had pity
of him, and out of charity took him into their Houſe.
Inſtead of having there any comfort, he was more
tormented then at the Hoſpital. He fell into a dark
Melancholly, and being one day in his Cell, he had
the thought of throwing himſelf out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
to end his miſery: But he was withheld from
yielding to this motion of Deſpair, by the ſame
Hand which ſtruck him. Tho Heaven ſeem'd wholly
ſhut upon him, he notwithſtanding with an ardent
Faith rais'd up his Eyes thither, and with a flood of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65023:20"/>
tears, cry'd out, <hi>Succour me, O Lord, my ſupport
and my ſtrength, ſuccour me; 'Tis in you only that
I hope, nor do I ſeek comfort but in you. Hide not
your face from me; and ſince you are my God, ſhew
me the way by which you will have me come to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after he remembred to have read, that an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Hermit not being able to obtain a favour from
God which he had long pray'd for, ſet himſelf to
Faſting, and reſolv'd to eat nothing till God had
heard him. By this Example of the Hermit, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to take no Nouriſhment till he had recover'd
the peace of his Soul; He purpos'd (I ſay) to Faſt in
this manner, as far as he could go without danger
of death. Accordingly he Faſted ſeven whole days
without eating or drinking, but not without conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
his accuſtom'd Exerciſe of Devotion. But
his trouble of Mind ſtill continuing; and whereas
by a kind of miracle his ſtrength was not much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd,
he would have ſtill held on his Faſt, if his
Confeſſor had not abſolutely commanded him to
break it. Heaven did accept both of the fervour
which made him undertake ſo extraordinary a thing,
and of the obedience which made him lay it down
again; for his former tranquility was reſtor'd to
him, and his interior croſſes were chang'd into ſuch
ſpiritual delights, as hitherto he had not taſted. But
a new tempeſt was rais'd in his Heart three days
after: His Scruples, his Dejections, his Deſpairings
took him again with ſo much violence, that he would
certainly have ſunk under them, if he had not been
in his hands whoſe Trials are Favours: And it was
not without great meaning, that he was try'd in ſo
many different manners: For being deſign'd by
the Providence of God for the direction of Souls, it
was neceſſary that his own experience ſhould teach
him the ſeveral ways by which God doth lead them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65023:20"/>
Here ended all his troubles of this kind;<note place="margin">He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned from above.</note> and <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
was not only deliver'd from all his ſcruples,
but had the gift beſtowed upon him of curing ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Conſciences. And as God doth uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
comforts on pious Souls, in proportion to their
ſufferings, and fidelity, ſo now, having freed his
Servant out of his deſolate ſtate, he rewarded him
with many ſingular graces.</p>
               <p>One day, as he was ſaying the Office of our Lady
upon the Stairs of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> Church, he was
elevated in Spirit, and in a moſt lively manner there
was repreſented to him the Myſtery of the Holy
Trinity. This viſion ſo ſenſibly affected him, and
fill'd him with ſuch inward conſolation, that going
afterwards in a ſolemn Proceſſion, he could not hold
back his Tears before all the company. All his
thoughts were fix'd upon that Myſtery, he could not
ſpeak but of the Trinity; but he ſpoke with ſo much
unction, and light, and in ſuch proper, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
expreſſions, that the moſt Learned admir'd him,
and the moſt ignorant were inſtructed by him. He
wrote down the conceptions he had of that Adorable
Myſtery, and his writing (which ſince) by, I know
not by what misfortune has been loſt, contain'd no
leſs, then fourſcore Leaves; if notwithſtanding we
may call that his writing, which had ſomething in
it of the Language of the Prophets, and wherein
the Spirit of God had a greater ſhare, then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Man. For <hi>Ignatius</hi> could only Read, and
Write; and an ignorant Cavalier, without being
inſpir'd, could not poſſibly treat of ſo high a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
From hence he conceiv'd a moſt tender devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Trinity, and had a cuſtom many times
in the day, to make his Prayers to the Three Divine
Perſons, ſometimes to them altogether, ſometimes
to each in particular, according to the different diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
he felt within himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65023:21"/>
A little after this, by another illumination was
repreſented to him the order, which God held in
the Creation of the World, and the motives which
induced the Divine wiſdom to that outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of himſelf. Once, in time of Maſs at the
Elevation he had an intuitive knowledge, that the
Body and Blood of the Son of God were truly under
the Elements; and in what manner they were there.
One day, as he went to viſit the Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
lying a quarter of a Mile out of the Town,
ſetting himſelf down on the banks of the <hi>Cardenero,</hi>
which runs along the plain of <hi>Manreze,</hi> he had a
profound knowledge of all the Myſteries together;
and at another time, when he pray'd before a Croſs,
upon the way to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> all that he had formerly
learn'd, was ſet before his Eyes, in ſo full a light,
that the verities of Faith ſeem'd to him to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
obſcure in them: And he remain'd ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
and ſo convinc'd of them, that he has
been heard to ſay, that had they never been Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Scriptures, he ſhould ſtill have maintain'd
them to the laſt drop of his Blood; and that, had
the Scriptures been loſt, no part of his Faith had
been diminiſh'd.</p>
               <p>But of all the favours, he at that time receiv'd,
the moſt remarkable was an Extaſie, which laſted
Eight days; A thing hardly to be believed, if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Perſons of credit, had not been witneſſes of it.
This began upon a <hi>Saturday</hi> about the Evening, in
the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Lucy,</hi> where <hi>Ignatius</hi> had again
taken up his Lodging, and it ended upon the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi>
following, juſt at the ſame hour: He had no
uſe of his ſenſes all that time; they thought him
dead, and would have bury'd him, if thoſe who
came to viſit his Body, had not perceiv'd ſomething
of motion about his Heart. He came to himſelf,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65023:21"/>
as out of a ſweet ſleep, and opening his Eyes, he
ſaid with a tender and devout voice, <hi>Ah Jeſus!</hi>
No body ever knew the ſecrets, which were reveal'd
to him in this long Rapture, for he would never
diſcover them to any body. And all that they could
draw out of him was, that the graces with which
God Almighty favour'd him, could not be expreſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe divine illuſtrations did not hinder him from
conſulting the Religious of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He truſts not his own light.</note> and of
St. <hi>Benet,</hi> about the ſtate of his Soul, nor from punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
following their directions. Many times he went
to his Confeſſor of <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> to render him an
accompt of his interior, and to ask advice for his
Spiritual advancement. Altho this holy old Man
did the office of an inſtructor to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> yet he
look'd upon his Diſciple with great veneration, and
ſaid to the Religious of his Monaſtery, That this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
of <hi>Manreza</hi> would one day be the Support,
and Ornament of the Church; that he ſhould be a
Reformer of the Chriſtian World, a ſucceſſor of
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> an Apoſtle, who ſhould tranſmit the light
of Faith into Idolatrous Nations.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ignatius</hi> open'd himſelf only to his Directors,
and no farther to them then was neceſſary for his
conduct; otherwiſe he kept a profound ſilence, and
ſhut up all his ſecret favours from Heaven within
himſelf. Yet notwithſtanding his care to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
from the Eyes of Men, he miſs'd of his aime,
either becauſe God would recompence the humility
of his Servant, or in regard, that vertue has marks,
which diſcover her againſt her will. His Auſterities,
and his Extacies grew famous round the Country;
And that, which added Luſter to them, was, that
no body doubted of his being a Perſon of Quality,
who had diſguis'd himſelf upon the account of doing
Pennance. A certain Religious Woman, eſteemed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65023:22"/>
a Saint in thoſe parts, ſpoke of him with great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and pronounced him a Saint; This is the
ſame perſon, who at that time was Celebrated all
over <hi>Spain,</hi> and who was often conſulted by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
King in matters of Conſcience, and was call'd
the <hi>Beata</hi> of <hi>Manreza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had in fine ſo great an opinion of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
that falling ſick again, and being remov'd to the
Houſe of a rich Burgeſs, who was a good Man, and
would not ſuffer the Servant of God to continue in
the Hoſpital, the people hereupon commonly call'd
this Burgeſs by the Name of <hi>Symon,</hi> and his Wife
by the Name of <hi>Martha,</hi> as if, in receiving <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
within their walls, they had received <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His reputation drew every body to him, ſome
only to behold him, others to hear him; And when
he went to Pray before the Croſſes, which are ſet
up about <hi>Manreza,</hi> or when he went in Pilgrimage
to our Lady at <hi>Villa-Dordis,</hi> and to other places of
Devotion, the people uſually crowded after him.</p>
               <p>Hitherto in all his practices of Piety,<note place="margin">He is call'd by God to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Neighbour.</note> he only
propos'd to himſelf his own perfection. But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
which deſign'd him for the Evangelical
Miniſtery, and had already prepar'd him for it,
without his knowledge, by contempt of the World,
by retirement, and mortification, gave him now other
lights, and meaſures. He began to conſider, that
Souls having coſt our Saviour ſo dear, nothing could
be done more acceptable to him, then to hinder
their loſs; He comprehended that the glory of Gods
Majeſty did moſt ſhine in the Salvation of Souls,
purchas'd with the Blood of his Son. Theſe were
the notions which kindled in him his Zeal for Souls.
<hi>It is not enough</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I ſerve our Lord; all
Hearts muſt love him, and all Tongues muſt praiſe
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65023:22"/>
As ſoon as he had turn'd his thoughts towards his
Neighbour, how dear ſoever ſolitude was to him,
he gave it over, and leaſt he ſhould fright thoſe
from him, whom he deſign'd to bring to God, he
chang'd his auſtere penitential Dreſs, into a more
decent Attire. Moreover, knowing that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
to which he was call'd, requir'd health and
vigour, he moderated his Auſterites, and put on a
Garment of courſe Cloth, becauſe the Winter was
very ſharp, and the pains of his Stomack ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
               <p>He ſpoke in publick of the things of Heaven;
and to be better heard by the people, which came
about him, he got up upon a Stone (which is at
this day expos'd to view) before the Antient Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital
of St. <hi>Lucy.</hi> His mortified Countenance, his
modeſt Aire, his words animated with the Spirit of
Truth, inſpired into his Auditors the love of
Vertue, and a horror of Vice. But his private en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
produc'd wonderful effects: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the moſt obſtinate ſinners, by laying before
them the Maxims and Duties of Chriſtianity, and by
cauſing them to meditate upon them in retirement.
Some were ſo toucht, that they renounced the World,
and changed at the ſame time both manners and
ſtate.</p>
               <p>The many reflections, which <hi>Ignatius</hi> made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the force and power of theſe Evangelical Maxims,
and the many tryals of their Operation both in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and others, mov'd him to write a Book of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Exerciſes, for the good of their Souls that
live in the World. This Book has ſo great a part in
the life, which I now write, and is ſo little known
in the World, that it will not be unprofitable in this
place to give an accompt of it.</p>
               <p>

The Spiritual Exerciſes of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then a bare collection of Meditations
and of Chriſtian conſiderations; if they were that,
and no more, there would be nothing in them parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and new.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> is not the firſt,<note place="margin">He writes the Book of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Exerciſes.</note> who has taught us the
way of raiſing our minds to God, and of looking
down into our own infirmities, by the means of
mental Prayer. Before him, were known the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
heads of Meditation; concerning the end for
which we were Created, the Enormity of Sin, the
Pains of Hell, the Life and Death of our Saviour;
but this we may ſay, that, before him, there was
not a certain, and prefix'd method for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of manners. To him we owe this method;
and he it was, who enlightned by God, after a
manner, altogether new, in a methodical way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
(as it were) into a holy Art, the converſion
of a ſinner. Knowing of one ſide the perverſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of the Heart of Man, and on the other,
the power and vertue which ſuch particular truths
of Chriſtianity duly appli'd, have to rectifie them,
he has ſet down a way, by which Man, with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
of grace, may recover out of his ſin, and climb
to the higheſt degree of perfection. In effect, if
we look near into the matter, there is as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the common Meditations, and theſe
Exerciſes, as between the knowledge only of ſimples,
and the entire Art of Phyſick; which has its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and aphoriſms for the cure of Diſeaſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the conſtitution of Bodies, the nature
of the Diſtempers, and the quality of the Remedies.
But to the end, the reality of what I ſay, may appear,
I will here ſet down the whole Order and Scheme of
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> his <hi>Spiritual Exerciſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65023:23"/>
They begin by a very important Meditation,<note place="margin">The Scheme and Order of the Exerciſes.</note>
which is the ground work, on which the whole
Frame is built, and therefore is called the Beginning
or Foundation of the Exerciſes. The ſcope of
this Fundamental Meditation, is to weigh and duly
conſider, the end for which we are born and plac'd
here upon Earth; Whether it be, to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of our Senſes, to grow Rich, to acquire Glory,
learn unprofitable Sciences; or whether it be, to
Serve and Obey our Lord and God, whoſe Creatures
we are: And when our underſtanding is fully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
of this Truth, that our Eternal Salvation wholly
and ſolely depends upon loving and ſerving him, we
muſt then draw this conſequence, That the things
of this World, are no otherwiſe to be ſought or
enjoy'd, then as they conduce to the honoring and
ſerving God.</p>
               <p>Moreover, whereas ſuch things, as are only
means to ſome end, are to be conſidered and valued,
not by their own intrinſick worth, but for their fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and tendency to ſuch End: It neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that we ought to judge of Riches and Poverty,
of a High and a Low Condition, of Health and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
not according to the Good or Evil, which
they bring us in this preſent Life, but according to
the Advantages, or Hindrances we receive from
them, in order to Eternity.</p>
               <p>Hence again it will follow, That we ought to be
perfectly indifferent, in reference to theſe things;
ſo that we are not to deſire Health more then Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to prefer Riches above Poverty, Honour above
Contempt, nor a long Life above a ſhort one.</p>
               <p>And in the Laſt place, we are to conclude, That
if we muſt determine our Choice, on the one ſide
more then on the other, we muſt chooſe that, which
moſt directly leads to our End.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:65023:24"/>
It is hardly credible, how much this grand veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
well weigh'd, and comprehended, doth enlighten
and ſtir up the Soul of a ſinner, be he never ſo blind
and obſtinate: For, provided he be a little remov'd
out of the noiſe and hurry of company and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
it makes him look upon the World with other
Eyes then he did, and ſhews him the fatal miſtake of
Worldlings, who place their happineſs in Creatures;
and thereby throughly awakes him out of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Lethargy.</p>
               <p>Being poſſeſt and convinc'd, of this Eſſential
Principle, we are next to conſider, what it is, that
puts us out of the way to our End: In order to
this, St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> propoſeth to us Meditations upon
ſin; And firſt, of the fall of the Angels, who were
caſt down from Heaven, into the bottom of Hell,
for one ſin of Pride; next, of the Tranſgreſſion of
the firſt Man, who was baniſh'd out of Paradice,
He and his Poſterity condemn'd to ſo many Evils,
for his Diſobedience; and Laſtly, of ſo many
Millions, that are Eternally loſt, and doom'd to
the Torments of Hell, for ſins, leſs Enormous then
our own.</p>
               <p>But in regard, our main buſineſs is to remedy
our own diſorders, it is neceſſary for us, to have
a ſufficient knowledge of them; Wherefore the
Saint leads us, from the general conſideration of
ſin, to a particular Diſcuſſion and Examination of
our own Conſcience; To the End, that looking
throughly into the ſtate of our whole Life, we may
find out all our enormities and deviations, which
have ſet us at diſtance and at enmity with God; but
further, becauſe the knowledge of our Trangreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
would have no great effect upon us, if we did
not rightly apprehend, how ſhameful and criminal
they are; St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> directs, that in the Second
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65023:24"/>
Meditation of Sins, we ſhould conſider how ugly
and infamous in their own Nature they are, and
would be, altho they were not forbid: And to the
end, this conſideration may have its full force, to
ſhew us, how infinitly Heinous they are; He bids
us ſet before our Eyes the Immenſe diſtance between
the Greatneſs and Glory of God, and our Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
and Lowneſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe paſt Conſiderations (tho Powerful and
Weighty) are not yet ſufficient to inſpire into a
worldly Soul, all the Compunction that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
There muſt be ſomthing us'd, more Corroſive
and Penetrating: And becauſe her adhering to the
World was that, which made her leave and forget
God, ſhe muſt be made ſenſible how Vain and
Tranſitory, are all thoſe objects of her Paſſions;
and alſo of the certain and ſpeedy end, of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
Riches and Greatneſs of this preſent Life;
She muſt alſo have before her Eyes the ſevere Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
which will be one day taken of the bad uſe
of the Creatures; and what thoſe pains are, which
are reſerv'd for Impenitent ſinners: Hence follow
in order thoſe Meditations, which expoſe the fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Images of Death, Judgment, and Hell. The
contemplation of Hell, which is very uſeful to
make us comprehend the deplorable effects of ſin,
is beſt made by an application of our interior ſenſes,
to draw lively Images of the Torments of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
Howlings, Blaſphemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Firſt Exerciſes tend (as may be ſeen) to
purge the Heart of thoſe corrupt Paſſions, which
make it incapable of conceiving an efficatious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of Salvation, but in regard that theſe vicious
affections are ordinarily very deeply rooted; and
are of no leſs difficulty to be removed, then the bad
humours, which have been long ſettled and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65023:25"/>
in the Body, we muſt therefore more then
once uſe the ſame Medicine, by repeating the ſame
Meditation. In the repetition of them are added
ſome fervent Prayers, which the Saint calls Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies,
and are addreſt to the Eternal Father, to
our Saviour, and to the Bleſſed Virgin: Theſe
Prayers which cloſe the Repeated Meditations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double
their virtue and efficacy. Thus ends the
Firſt week; for St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> divides the whole Body
of his Exerciſes into Four weeks, or rather Parts,
which he calls weeks, and which are not ſo well
diſtinguiſh'd by the number of the days, as by the
diverſity of the Matters.</p>
               <p>The Soul when ſhe is thus purg'd, and her Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Paſſions carry'd off, will now be in a temper
and diſpoſition to receive and follow the motions of
Grace, which lead her into the ways of Heaven;
And for this reaſon, the Second week begins with
the Contemplation of the Kingdom of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
This contemplation repreſents to us our Saviour, as
a King moſt Perfect and Amiable, who invites his
Subjects to accompany him in a Military Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in which he deſigns to make himſelf Maſter
of the whole Earth, and who invites them upon
theſe moſt advantagious Conditions; that they ſhall
be every way Treated like himſelf; That in his
Service they ſhall do and ſuffer nothing, but what
he in perſon ſhall Firſt give them an Example of;
And in concluſion, that they ſhall have a ſhare in
the Booty and Glory of his Conqueſt, in proportion
to the Fatigues they endure in the War.</p>
               <p>So ingaging an invitation makes her take the
Reſolution of marching after <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the
obſervation of the Divine Law, and in the Exerciſe
of Evangelical Vertues. But in regard, that it doth
not ſuffice to form in general the deſign of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65023:25"/>
Life, but that we muſt come to particulars;
the following Meditations, which are of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
the Nativity, the Circumciſion, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
in the Temple, the Flight into <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
the conceal'd Life of the Son of God, repreſent
him to us in theſe ſeveral States and Conditions, as
a Pattern and Model of Humility, of Poverty, of
Mortification, of Piety, of Retirement, according
to which we are to regulate our conduct.</p>
               <p>It is not enough to be the Diſciples and followers
of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> unleſs we make a publick profeſſion
of it, which may Edifie our Neighbour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to Imitate us, according to the word of
St. <hi>Paul, Be you Imitators of me, as I am of Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi> And this is the Aym and Deſign of the
Meditation of the two Standards, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> according to his Military Ideas,
but very congruous to the expreſſions of the Holy
Ghoſt, who calls our <hi>life a warfare,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
makes all Chriſtians to be Soldiers.</p>
               <p>Here is repreſented the Son of God, coming
forth from his retreat and concealment, to Preach
his Doctrine to the World; but he is Repreſented
with the Devil ſtanding in front before him, and
both under the ſemblance of Generals, who raiſe
Troops, ſpread their Enſigns, take the Feild, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
their Men to follow them.</p>
               <p>At the ſight of ſo many Generous Souls, who in
all Ages have rang'd themſelves under the Standard
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> a penitent ſinner declares himſelf
for Vertue, and far from being aſham'd of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
He makes it his Glory, to Combat the Maxims
and the Practices of the World.</p>
               <p>Being once ingag'd on the right ſide, he is not
content with a bare deſire of Chriſtian Perfection,
he ſeeks, and embraces all the means which are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65023:26"/>
to bring him to it, and renounces all things that
may hinder him from it, and deſires nothing, but
what may contribute to his perfection. From this
diſpoſition he goes on to another, and ſo wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
himſelf to the Orders of God, that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loſe all the Goods of the World, then delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
commit, I will not ſay a Sin that wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
him of Divine Grace, but the leaſt fault, that
ſhould make him leſs acceptable in the Eyes of God.</p>
               <p>His ſubmiſſion goes farther yet; and not only
content to avoid the lighteſt ſins, he will alſo in a
manner expreſs in himſelf a perfect Image of our
Saviour, ſo that in caſe it were equal to the Intereſt
of Gods Glory, whether he be placed in a ſtate of
Honor, or of Contempt, of Riches or of Poverty, he
would prefer Contempt before Honor, Poverty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Riches, without any other motive, but of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the Son of God. Theſe generous Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are to be learnt in two Meditations, of which
one is Entituled <hi>Of the Three Claſſes, or Three ſorts
of Perſons;</hi> and the other, <hi>Of the Three Degrees of
Humility.</hi> And for the well Rooting and Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe Sentiments, are the Meditations upon the
Baptiſm, the Tempting in the Deſert, and upon the
other Myſteries of our Saviours Life to his Paſſion.</p>
               <p>All theſe Premiſes are neceſſary Preparatives for
the laſt Meditation of the Second week, which is
that of the choice of a State and Form of Life. This
being a matter equally important and difficult, on
which our Salvation doth much depend, and in
which we may be eaſily deceiv'd. St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>
therefore uſeth all the precautions Imaginable, ſo to
direct us in it, that we may never repent of the
choice we make.</p>
               <p>Firſt he conſider the Matter, next the Time,
and laſtly the manner of this Election. As to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65023:26"/>
Matter of our Choice, it is certain, that it muſt be
good, or at leaſt there muſt be nothing ill or ſinful
in it. Moreover it is evident, that of thoſe things
to be choſen, ſome are fix'd and immutable, as
Prieſthood and Marriage, others may be changed,
as Offices and Imployments Eccleſiaſtical or Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
If we be already ingaged in the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Life, there is no more room for delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and choice, altho our firſt Ingagement were
made upon Humane and Worldly Motives; What
we have then to do, is to uſe our endeavour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
all that Perfection, which ſuch a ſtate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:
Nor are we to relinquiſh the ſecond, when
we are once ingaged in ſuch ſtate; I ſay we are not
to relinquiſh it, unleſs it contains in its ſelf, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
us to, any thing againſt the duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;
or unleſs we leave it to put our ſelves in
a more perfect ſtate.</p>
               <p>As to the Times and Seaſons, that are proper for
the making ſuch Election, the moſt appoſite are
theſe; Firſt, When God touches the Heart in ſuch
a manner, that there is no poſſibility of a doubt,
that the Call comes not from Heaven; as in the
caſe of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome others.
Secondly, When the Impreſſion of Grace is at leaſt
ſo ſtrong in us, as to give us a kind of aſſurance
that our Vocation comes from the Holy Ghoſt;
And Thirdly, when the Soul Illuminated by Faith
and undiſtracted by outward objects, which may
miſlead her into falſe judgements, is in a fit diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to elect, what is moſt conducible to her Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>As for the Manner of the Choice, thus it ought
to proceed. Firſt, the Condition, the Office, the
Imployment, the form of life, whatever it be, is
laid before us. Secondly we are to recall into our
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65023:27"/>
Conſideration the End, for which we were Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and according to the Rules of the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Meditation, we muſt Endeavour to put our
ſelves into an abſolute Indifferency towards all the
things of the World, and to make no reckoning of
them any otherwiſe, then as they Serve to our End.
Thirdly we are humbly to beg of God, that he
will enlighten our underſtanding, and not ſuffer
us to deviate from that way, by which he would
conduct us. After this, we are to find out all the
Reaſons, for, or againſt ſuch a Courſe, and to
weigh them, one againſt the other, and thoſe
muſt preponderate, which in our Aym to Eternity,
and our laſt End ſeem to tend moſt directly thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
When it appears evidently to us, upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
ſo made, that one calling has the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
over the other, there we muſt fix, and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolve to embrace it with out delay. If after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
we ſhould find any wavering and irreſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in our ſelves, and ſhould deſire to be confirm'd
and ſettled in our choice, we are then to uſe the
ſame Reaſons to our ſelves, as we ſhould do to our
beſt Friend, upon the like occaſion. Moreover, we
ought to do that, which we ſhall wiſh were done
at the hour of <hi>Death,</hi> and at the day of <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
when we are to render an Account of all
our Actions. Laſtly, we ought to chooſe that way,
which ſhall ſeem beſt to us, according to theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide,
and evident Principles. This in ſhort is the
whole Oeconomy of this matter of Choice; and the
Concluſion of this Important affair makes an End
of the Second week.</p>
               <p>It will be hard for a Soul to tread all thoſe ſteps,
we have now markt out, without much labour and
pain; and it is natural, that a new ſtate, and form
of life ſhould find great contradictions, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65023:27"/>
the world doth uſually riſe in oppoſition
againſt thoſe, who embrace a true Chriſtian life;
or for that God doth commonly try the fidelity of
his new Servants. The Soul therefore hath great
need of ſtrength and of Love to be ſupported;
and where can ſhe find more powerful Succour,
then in the wounds of Jeſus Chriſt Crucify'd, who
has Conſummated by his ſufferings the work of our
Redemption, and ſo lov'd us, as to dye for us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Croſs? 'Tis in the Contemplating the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and Death of our Saviour, that the Soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd
with his Love, takes Reſolution to Suffer
all things to pleaſe him, and conſtantly to perſiſt
in the Practice of Chriſtian vertues, in defyance of
the world and the Devil.</p>
               <p>The Soul being now in ſuch a Scituation, what
ſhe has more to do, is to elevate her Thoughts and
her deſires towards Heaven; And this ſhe doth in
the Fourth week, which repreſents to her, the
Glorious Myſteries of the Reſurrection, of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions,
and of the Aſcention of the Son of God, as
being moſt proper to enliven her Faith, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
her Hope, and to purify her Love. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
the contemplation of Spiritual Love, or
of the Benefits and perfections of the God, conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
the whole work, by cloſely uniting her to
God, and making her taſte the ſweetneſs of Divine
Union. Thus ends our Saint his ſpiritual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
with a Prayer full of Unction and fervour,
in which after having intirely given himſelf up to
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he asks nothing of him, but his
Grace and his Love, proteſting that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the world beſides, that he deſires; and
that he is rich enough, if he can but Love, and
be Loved.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to perceive the Connection of the four
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65023:28"/>
parts, and how all the Meditations have ſuch a
dependance one on the other, that the Firſt is ſtill
the foundation of the Second, the former ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
and giving ſtrength to the latter, and all
of them together work the intended effect, which
is, to raiſe a Soul into a State of perfect charity, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having diſingaged her from the Love of the
world.</p>
               <p>Here you have the Character and the Spirit of
the Exerciſes which <hi>Ignatius</hi> compos'd at <hi>Manreza,</hi>
and which in proceſs of time he digeſted into that
order and form in which now we ſee them, then
adding to them divers Rules concerning <hi>Catholick</hi>
Faith, Prayer, Alms deeds, Temperance, Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and Diſcernment of ſpirits; Beſides thoſe,
which he ſets down under the Title of <hi>Annotations</hi>
and <hi>Additions,</hi> to make the exerciſes, both eaſily
and profitably; and which are ſo Eſſential, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Judgement</hi> of one of the moſt Eminent
Sons of our <hi>Saint</hi> that we can expect no fruit from
our Retirement, if we neglect them.</p>
               <p>For, amongſt other things, they Import, that
he, who deſires profitably to make the Exerciſes,
muſt enter into them with great Courage, and with
a Reſolution, to give himſelf up wholly to the
Dictates and Conduct of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and be
ready to go what way ſoever the voice of <hi>Heaven</hi>
ſhall call him; That being ſo diſpos'd at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into them, he muſt not only forget for a
time, all the affairs of the World, but alſo muſt
apply himſelf ſingly and Solely to the Meditation
of each Preſent day; not permitting his thoughts
to make any excurſion into the Meditations, that
are to follow; That it is not Sufficient to read <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Good Books,</hi> but the matter of them muſt be
agreeable to the Subject of his Meditations, leaſt the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65023:28"/>
underſtanding being diſſipated and ſcatter'd upon
divers Objects, ſhould have leſs force to Penetrate
thoſe Truths, of which it is to be convinc'd; That
the way of Living, the Solitude, the Silence, the
Auſterities, ought to be apply'd and directed to the
matter and Subject of the Meditations of each week,
as much as prudence may require; That if he feels
<hi>Devotion</hi> upon any <hi>Article,</hi> he ſhould not paſs on
to another, till ſuch time, as that Pious affection
be fully ſatisfyed; That if he falls into a dryneſs
and Irkſomneſs, far from ſhortning the time prefixt
for his Prayer, he ſhould ſomewhat lengthen it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the uſual bounds: So to maſter his Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and to overcome himſelf, waiting with ſilence
and <hi>Humility</hi> the comfortable viſit of the <hi>Holy
Spirit.</hi> That if on the contrary, he be fill'd with
Spiritual Guſts and conſolations, at that moment
he ſhould not engage himſelf in any vow, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if the vow be Perpetual, and ſuch as obligeth
to a change of State of life: That in concluſion,
he ſhould open himſelf to his director in theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
and give him an exact Account of all that
paſſes in his Interior, to the end, that ſuch Director
may treat the Penitent conformably to his diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and neceſſity; and that he may not inſtil
too much fear into a puſillanimous ſoul nor too
much Confidence into a Soul inclining to preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and leaſt he ſhould miſtake, and aim to bring
a Sinner to the height of perfection, before he is
Purg'd of his vicious habits.</p>
               <p>It follows from all, that I have now ſet down,
that the Spiritual Exerciſes of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> exactly
perform, what they promiſe in the beginning of
the Book; which is to conduct a Soul in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that ſhe may overcome her ſelf, and chooſe a
ſtate of Life, tending beſt to her Salvation; after
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65023:29"/>
ſhe has cleans'd her ſelf from thoſe deprav'd incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
which may corrupt her <hi>Judgement</hi> in
making her Choice.</p>
               <p>In this Book, which I now ſpeak of, St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>
has alſo inſerted the particular Examen of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
not to ſay any thing of the General Examen
with the five points ſo common at preſent, and ſo
little us'd before him; This particular Examen,
which he has invented, and which he reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the ſureſt means, to reform a worldly Soul,
conſiſts in taming that Vice, which moſt raigns in
us, and in ſetting upon it ſingly by its ſelf, and in
continual fighting againſt it by a Conſtant watch
upon our ſelves, that we may at no time yeild to it;
by a contrite returning to God, as often as we fall
by it; By an exact computation of our Falls, even
to the ſetting them down, by making little Marks
upon ſo many Lines, which are drawn to Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond
with every day in the week (as may be ſeen
in the Book it ſelf) to the end, that comparing day
to day, and week to week, we may eaſily ſee the

Vice in the ſame way.</p>
               <p>I will not ſtop here, to confute the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a certain unknown <hi>Writer,</hi> who fancying that
the Founder of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had taken his Exerciſes,
out of a Book of <hi>Don Garcias de Ciſneros,</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of St. <hi>Benets</hi> Order, and <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Montſerrat,</hi>
has Printed on the Subject a <hi>Libel,</hi> under the Name
of <hi>Don Conſtantine Cayetan, Abbot</hi> of <hi>Mont Caſſin.</hi>
For beſides that the <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Mont Caſſin</hi>
has diſavow'd the <hi>Author</hi> and the <hi>writing,</hi> in a
General <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Order, held at <hi>Ravenna</hi> in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65023:29"/>
the Year 1644, and that the ſame was done, in the
Year following by the Benedictines of <hi>Portugal;</hi>
the two Books themſelves are every where to be ſeen,
and they will beſt decide the Point, that Bating
the <hi>Titles,</hi> there is no reſemblance at all of one
with the other.</p>
               <p>But to return to our <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
his Apoſtolical Diſcourſes, and of his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Exerciſes, were ſo great in <hi>Manreza</hi> that
they more and more drew upon him the praiſes
and admiration of the People. He could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
that they ſhould ſo eſteem him in a place,
whither he had retir'd only to avoid the eſteem
of men; Wherefore he reſolv'd to Leave <hi>Manre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi>
after more then a ten months continuance
there: Beſides, the Plague being now abated at
<hi>Barcelona</hi> and the Commerce of the <hi>Sea</hi> beginning
to be open, he had an extreme Impatience to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
towards the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> At the beginning
of his Converſion, he only intended by this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
to honor thoſe places, conſecrated by the
Preſence, and Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> But now he
undertook it with an ardent deſire, to procure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his ability, the converſion of the
<hi>Sciſmaticks</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He did not leave <hi>Manreza</hi> with ſo much Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,<note place="margin">He Leaves <hi>Manreza</hi> to go to the <hi>Holy Land</hi>
                  </note>
as he did <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> he declar'd his journey
to his Friends, but did not tell them what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to do in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> It cannot be Imagin'd,
how much this news did trouble them: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
him with tears in their Eyes, not to abandon
them; They repreſented to him the <hi>Fatigue</hi> and
the danger of ſo long a journey: But neither their
Intreaties, nor their reaſons could ſtop him a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

him their <hi>Purſe;</hi> He would take neither Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,

nor money; that he might have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
but from God, and no dependance but on
Providence: And he ſaid to thoſe, who were
inſtant with him to make ſome Proviſion of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for his Journey, that a perfect relyance upon
Heaven was all things; that we are not Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

Hope; which vertue could not be perfectly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd

found in the Haven a
Brigantine, and a great Ship,
both which prepared for their
Voyage into <hi>Italy.</hi> He was
upon the point of Imbarquing
in the Brigantine, becauſe that
Veſſel was likely to part ſooneſt: but God, who had
a care of his Servant, chang'd his Deſign; which
happen'd in this manner.</p>
               <p>A very vertuous Lady, call'd <hi>Iſabella Roſella,</hi>
hearing one day a Sermon, chanc'd to caſt her eyes
upon <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who was placed at the foot of the
Altar amongſt the Children; ſhe thought ſhe ſaw
his Countenance inviron'd with light, and heard a
Voice, which cry'd; <hi>Call him, call him.</hi> However
ſhe contain'd her ſelf at that time from ſaying any
thing, fearing it might be an Illuſion. But when
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65023:31"/>
ſhe came home, ſhe ſpake to her Husband of it: both
of them were of opinion to examine what it might
be; wherefore they immediately ſent to find out the
Pilgrim, who was ſtill in the Church. In deſign of
honoring our Saviour in the perſon of a poor Man,
they oblig'd him to eat with them at their Table;
and to ſound him, they put him upon a Diſcourſe of
Piety. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who was ignorant of their Deſign,
ſpoke of the things of Heaven ſo feelingly, and ſo
ſublimely, that they were convinc'd he was a Man
of God. Fain they would have had him make his
abode with them; but he declar'd, that he was call'd
by Heaven to another Place, and that he only
waited the departure of the Veſſels, to leave <hi>Spain.</hi>
The Lady, who underſtood by him, that he had
taken a Place in the Brigantine, conjur'd him not to
go in that Veſſel, and told him more then once, by
ſome ſecret inſtinct, that his life would be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
if he went in the Brigantine. The ſame Spirit
that mov'd her ſo to ſpeak, mov'd him to believe
her.</p>
               <p>He would not engage in the Ship, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that the Maſter would give him free Paſſage
for Charity ſake. In the interim the Brigantine put
forth to Sea, and ſhe was hardly out of the Haven,
but there roſe a furious Tempeſt, in which ſhe was
caſt away, and all the Paſſengers and Mariners
drown'd.</p>
               <p>The Maſter of the Ship gave <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
free, but withal oblig'd him to make his own
Proviſion for the Voyage. This Condition appear'd
very hard to him; for having thrown himſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon Providence, he thought it would be a kind
of retracting, and diffiding, to provide for himſelf;
and whereas he ſhould only want a little Bread,
which he might beg in the Ship, he was afraid he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65023:31"/>
ſhould deviate from Evangelical Poverty, in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing along with him. To eaſe himſelf of
this ſcruple, he had recourſe to his Confeſſor, and
being order'd by him to accept of the Condition as
it was propos'd by the Maſter, he boldly did that out
of Obedience, which he durſt not do of himſelf: He
would not accept of any thing from the Lady, that
by her counſel had ſav'd his life, who offer'd him
all Neceſſaries for his Journey; but he would beg
from Door to Door for what might ſuffice him;
whereupon an Adventure befell him very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>There was in the Town a Woman of Quality,
call'd <hi>Zepiglia,</hi> who had a Son extravagantly lewd,
and a Libertine, that lately had thrown himſelf into
a Troop of wandring Beggars, with whom he ran
up and down the World. <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaw this Woman
coming out of her Houſe, and pray'd her for God's
ſake to give him a piece of Bread. Looking upon
him, ſhe preſently thought of her Son; and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by his Carriage, and the Ayre of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that he who asked the Alms was a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,
and not truly poor, ſhe began to rate him, and
treat him as an idle Vagabond, threatning withal to
have him puniſh'd. <hi>Ignatius</hi> very peaceably heard
all ſhe ſaid, and at laſt told her, That indeed he was
a great deal worſe then ſhe had made him, and ſo
went away. She remain'd ſurpris'd at his Patience
and his Anſwer: But underſtanding afterwards, that
the Pilgrim ſhe had ſo ill treated, was a holy Man,
ſhe was extreamly confounded at what ſhe had
done: ſhe employ'd ſome perſons to ask his pardon,
and upon the Day of his departure ſent him a good
proviſion of Bread. He would not carry with him
the Money which ſome devout people had forc'd
him to take againſt his will, nor would he give it to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65023:32"/>
the Seamen, who would have uſed him the better for
it in his Voyage; and being to enter the Ship, not
finding any Poor to beſtow it upon, he laid it down
upon the Shore, for the firſt Comer to take.</p>
               <p>The Voyage was dangerous, but ſhort; a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
wind carried the Ship in Five days to <hi>Gayeta</hi>
in the year 1523. <hi>Ignatius</hi> being Landed, took
up his Lodging at night in the Stable of an Inn,
when he began to ſleep, he heard a great cry, as
it were of a perſon who call'd for help, in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.
He preſently ran towards the place from
whence the noiſe came; and finding a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the hands of Soldiers, who would have
forc'd her, he ſpoke to them with ſo much Courage
and Reſolution, that they left her; For upon this
occaſion his Zeal ſtir'd in him his Natural fierceneſs,
and made him ſpeak in that Imperious tone, which
Officers of War commonly uſe to ſtop the Inſolence
of the Soldiers; He took his way towards <hi>Rome,</hi>
alone, and a Foot, Faſting the whole Day, and
Begging according to his Cuſtom. He arrived there
on <hi>Palm Sunday,</hi> and Eight days after <hi>Eaſter,</hi>
he parted for <hi>Venice,</hi> having firſt received the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction
of the Pope (who was <hi>Adrian</hi> the Sixth)
and obtain'd leave of his Holineſs to make the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Some <hi>Spaniards</hi> gave him
Seven or Eight Crowns, and told him, it would be
madneſs to go without Money, or Language, into
a Country, which was infected with the Plague.
But afterwards he had a trouble upon his Conſcience,
for having taken this Money, and he accus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of it to God in his Prayer; And often ſaid to
himſelf, that it was better to paſs for a Fool in the
judgment of Men, then in the leaſt to diſtruſt the
Care and Providence of God.</p>
               <p>To make amends for his fault, he gave to the firſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65023:32"/>
poor that he met, all the Money he had. By this
means he was brought to extream neceſſity, not
finding almoſt any thing to live upon in the Villages,
and not being able to enter into the Towns; For by
reaſon of the Plague then raging, and of his pale
and extenuated Countenance, the Guards at the
Gates deny'd him entrance: So that he was often ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to lie whole Nights abroad in the open Air.
But theſe great hardſhips, which his Body endur'd,
were abundantly recompenced by Divine Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in his Soul. Being one Day quite ſpent, and
not able to keep company with thoſe, that Travelled
with him, he was left alone, in an open Deſert. The
ſolitude invited him to Pray, in which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
appeared to him, gave him inward ſtrength, and
promiſed him, that he ſhould have entrance into
<hi>Padua,</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The event confirm'd the Apparition. His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
that had left him, and were gone before,
could not with their Tickets of health gain admiſſion
into the Town; but he coming after, went quietly
in without the leaſt queſtioning of the Guards. It
was late when he came to <hi>Venice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and not knowing
where to lodge, he laid himſelf under a porch in the
great ſquare of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> to take a little reſt: But
God would not have his Servant paſs the Night in
that place.</p>
               <p>There was amongſt the Senators of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
a Man of extraordinary Merit, called <hi>Marc
Antonio Treviſani.</hi> Of that wiſe Senate, he was one
of the beſt heads, and moreover a perfect Chriſtian,
diſingaged from the World, in the midſt of the
World, and ſuch an enemy to Luxury, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
wore a Hair ſhurt. His tenderneſs for the
poor had in a manner chang'd his Houſe into an
Hoſpital; and indeed he himſelf would have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65023:33"/>
been a poor Man, if the Marcelli his Nephews had
not oblig'd him to regulate his Charities. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
himſelf in his Imployments after ſuch a
Chriſtian manner, that they call'd him the <hi>Saint of
Cyprus,</hi> where he had Exercis'd the charge of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor.
His Vertue afterwards rais'd him to the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Doge,</hi> which he would abſolutely have refus'd,
and renounc'd, if <hi>Lorenzo Maſſa,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donne,</hi>
both Secretaries of the Republick, had not
diverted him from it, for reaſons which he could not
oppoſe. Having liv'd to a great Age, one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſent at the Divine Myſteries, with a lively
and ardent Faith, which even ſhin'd in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
he fell into a ſound, and expir'd at the foot
of the Altar.</p>
               <p>This Senator, who lived in the Square of St. <hi>Mark,</hi>
whither <hi>Ignatius</hi> was retir'd, heard in his ſleep a
voice, which ſeem'd to ſay, that whilſt he ſlept at eaſe
in his Bed, the Servant of God lay upon the Stones in
the Porch: He waked, and immediately went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to find out the perſon ſignifi'd by the Voice.
He ſound him, and with great humanity brought
him into his Houſe, and there paid him all the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
reſpects, due to a Pilgrim ſent by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who thought himſelf very unworthy
to be ſo treated, left the Palace of the Senator, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pretence of Lodging with a <hi>Biſcay</hi> Merchant of
his Acquaintance. Both the Senator, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
offered him all manner of ſupplies for his
Voyage of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> But the only Courteſie
he asked of them, was, to be introduc'd by their
means to the <hi>Doge Andrea Griſti,</hi> one of the Sageſt
Politicians, and greateſt Men of his time.
The Ship being gone ſome days before, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Pilgrims, <hi>Ignatius</hi> had no means
left of proceeding in his Journey, but by getting a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65023:33"/>
Paſſage in the Admiral, which was ready to ſet Sail
for the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> whither the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
was ſending a new Governor. This was his
buſineſs with the <hi>Doge</hi> which he effected at the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
procur'd him.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all the Inſtances of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Merchant, he would not be brought to ſee the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth. He had renounced
all Intereſts in the Courts of Princes, and his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and Deſires were now Converted to Holy
<hi>Places.</hi> It made no Impreſſion upon him when they
told him, that ſince the taking of <hi>Rhodes</hi> (of which
<hi>Solyman</hi> made himſelf Maſter the year before)
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Rovers infeſted the Coaſts of <hi>Syria,</hi> and
that the danger of being made Salves had oblig'd
the greateſt part of the Pilgrims to return back to
<hi>Venice.</hi> All this did not Diſcourage him, and the
reliance which he had on God, made him tell thoſe,
who endeavour'd to fright him from the Journey,
that if he could not get a Ship, he would paſs the
Sea upon a Plank, with the ſuccour of Heaven. He
had a burning Feaver a little before his departure,
and tho he had been purg'd that very day, when
they put to Sea, he would not be hindred from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
againſt the advice of his Phyſicians who thought
it would coſt his Life, if he then went: But far
from dying by doing ſo, he found himſelf very
much amended, and the Sea-ſickneſs perfectly cur'd
him.</p>
               <p>There was on board the Veſſel, a profligate crew,
which almoſt in open view, committed the
moſt enormous Sins: There was nothing of Prayer,
nothing of Religion among the Mariners, But all,
that came from them, was Impious, or Obſcene.
Theſe Diſorders highly afflicted, and irritated <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius:</hi>
He indeavoured to remedy them by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65023:34"/>
inſtructions, and Charitable advertiſments;
But finding that the ways of Mildneſs were unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
he fell to ſevere reprehenſions, and menac'd
the guilty with the vengeance of Divine Juſtice:
This liberty of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pilgrim did not pleaſe the
<hi>Italians.</hi> To be rid of ſo incommodious a Reprover,
they Conſpir'd together to touch upon a Deſert
Iſland, and there to leave him: The notice, which
was given him of it by a Paſſenger, who had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more of humanity then the reſt, did not at all
abate his Zeal. But the deſign of the <hi>Italians</hi> took
no effect: For coming near the Coaſt, where they
meant to Land him, a ſudden guſt of Wind came
from the Land, with ſo much violence that it carri'd
them off in ſpite of their teeth, and brought them
in a few hours to the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They found in the Port, the Ship, which carri'd
the Pilgrims, quite ready to hoiſt Sail, as if they had
only ſtaid for <hi>Ignatius.</hi> He immediately went on
Board, and after Forty days Sail ſince his departure
from <hi>Venice,</hi> he arriv'd at the Port of <hi>Jaffa,</hi> on the
laſt day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the year 1523. He took
the way of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by Land, and came thither
the Fourth of <hi>September,</hi> with the reſt of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims.</p>
               <p>Seeing the Town at a diſtance,<note place="margin">The ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he had in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land.</hi>
                  </note> he wept for Joy,
and was ſeiz'd with a certain Religious horror, which
has nothing in it, but ſweet and comfortable. He vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
the Holy places ſeveral times, and always with
a profound Reverence, and moſt ſenſible Piety;
for he did lively repreſent to himſelf, what had paſt
in each place for the Redemption of Man; even to
the imagining, that he ſaw <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Born in
the <hi>Grotte</hi> of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> Teaching in the Temple
of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Praying in the Garden of <hi>Olives,</hi>
and dying upon Mount <hi>Calvary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:65023:34"/>
Upon this Mountain it was, that his Heart was
toucht with the moſt tender Devotion; He kiſs'd
ten thouſand times over the Earth which had been
dy'd with the Blood of our Crucify'd Saviour, and
bath'd it with his tears; making moſt fervent Acts
of Love. The Sentiments he then had, we receive
from his own Relation, and he ſet them down in
a ſhort Memoire, which he writ concerning the
Particulars of his Journey.</p>
               <p>But in regard, that according to the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of meditating upon the Myſteries of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
we ſhould frame a lively Image of the place,
where the Myſtery was perform'd, by ſo apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Interior ſenſes, as if we heard and ſaw
what was ſaid, and done; He therefore fill'd his
Imagination as much as he could, with the Scheme,
and Scituation of thoſe Holy Places.</p>
               <p>He came with a deſign into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> to labour
in the Converſion of thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People, and
it ſeem'd to him, that God almighty had call'd
him to it. In truth, it was made known to him
in his Contemplations of <hi>Manreza,</hi> that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
had Ordain'd him for the ſervice of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and there was ſhew'd to him a rough draught
of his Inſtitute, in the Meditation of the two Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards;
But he did not preciſely know, in what
Countrey, or in what manner, that was to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
ſo that, being guided by the light of his
natural Reaſon, where that of the Holy Ghoſt did
not evidently appear, he imagin'd, that his Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did lead to <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> becauſe upon his firſt
Converſion he had an inward motion, which prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
him to the voyage of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which motion
always continu'd in him.</p>
               <p>To proceed orderly,<note place="margin">He is oblig'd to leave <hi>Paleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
                  </note> he went to the Guardian
of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> who reſide in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65023:35"/>
look to the Holy <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> having delivered to
him his Letters of Recommendation, which he
brought out of <hi>Italy,</hi> he declar'd to him his thoughts
of remaining in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> but he did not open
himself to him concerning his intended Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there; He only ſaid, that he did not intend
to put them to any Charge, and that all the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
he asked of them, was to direct his Conſcience.
The Guardian treated him Civilly, but for his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
he remitted him to the Father Provincial,
who was then at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and dayly look'd for.</p>
               <p>The Provincial being come, he Councel'd <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
to return into <hi>Europe,</hi> not only becauſe Alms
were very ſcarce in thoſe parts, for they themſelves
had much adoe to Subſiſt; but alſo, becauſe there
was no ſecurity for <hi>Pilgrims</hi> in a Country, where
the Grand Signior was Maſter; And that, not
long ſince, ſome had been made Slaves and ſome
kill'd that were found walking in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of the Town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who as yet thought of nothing, but
of Converting the Barbarous people, did not reliſh
this Councel; He anſwered, that he neither fear'd
Slavery nor Death; and that nothing, but the fear
of diſpleaſing God, ſhould make him leave the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Land.</hi> Why then ſays the Provincial, with an
Ayre and tone of Authority, <hi>you ſhall be gone to
Morrow; for you cannot reſiſt me without offending
God: I have Power from the Holy See, to ſend
back what Pilgrims I pleaſe, and moreover to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
thoſe, who will not Obey.</hi> As St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi>
inſiſted upon his Staying, for fear of going
againſt his Conſcience, ſo he no ſooner heard the
power of the Holy See injoyning his Return, but he
inſtantly ſubmitted; taking the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinical,
as of an Oracle from Heaven, without ſo
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65023:35"/>
much as ſtaying to ſee the <hi>Popes</hi> Bull, which the
Religious man offer'd to ſhew him.</p>
               <p>At the ſame moment an extream deſire took
him, once more to ſee the Print of our Saviours
feet, which he left upon the ſtone, when he Aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Heaven. To this end he Privately ſlipt
out, and went alone to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and for
want of Money, giving his Pen knife to the <hi>Turk,</hi>
that kept the Mosque, where the Footſteps are to be
ſeen, he entred in, and fully ſatisfy'd his Devotion.
When he was come back as far as <hi>Betfage,</hi> it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his mind, that he had not obſerv'd, to what
quarter of the Heaven the impreſſion of thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Feet was directed, he therefore comes back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
(ſo much Curioſity there is ſometimes in Piety
it ſelf!) and to procure his Entrance the ſecond
time, he preſented the keeper with a little pair of
Sizzers, and having made his Obſervations and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
his Devotions, he return'd.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the good Religious of the
<hi>Franciſcan</hi> Convent, underſtanding that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Pilgrim was gone towards Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and
fearing leaſt he ſhould be ill treated by the <hi>Turks,</hi>
ſent after him a Servant of the Convent, an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian,</hi>
who was known to the Guards. The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi>
met <hi>Ignatius</hi> coming down the Hill, and
with great Choler held up his ſtick at him, and
taking him by the Arm drew him along with him
to the Monaſtery. But <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not feel, nor
ſcarce know, what he did to him. He was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rapt with an interior joy, caus'd in him by the
Preſence of our Saviour, who appear'd to him in
the Air, ſhining with Glory, and marching, as a
Guide before him.</p>
               <p>He parted the day following from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
and embark'd in a ſhip, which carryed him to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65023:36"/>
the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> Coming there, he found three
Veſſels in the Port ready to ſet Sail for <hi>Italy,</hi> one
was a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallion, the other a great ſhip of
<hi>Venice,</hi> and the third a little Bark very weak, and
ill Equipp'd. They who came with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
the <hi>Venetian</hi> Captain to receive him on board
upon the Score of Charity, telling him, that he was
a Saint. The Captain who being very Covetous,
but not very Religious, did not care for the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of a poor Saint, anſwer'd in raillery, that if
the Pilgrim were ſo great a Saint, as they ſaid, he
had no need of a Ship, he might go into the Sea, and
the waves would carry him whither he pleas'd. The
Maſter of the little Bark was more Civil and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
he receiv'd him <hi>Gratis.</hi> The three Veſſels
made Sail together, and had at firſt a favourable
wind; but the weather changing all on a ſudden,
there roſe a furious Tempeſt: The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sunk with all her company; the <hi>Venetian</hi> ſhip
endeavouring to get to land, and to recover the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
was daſh'd in pieces upon the Rocks: The
little Bark, which carry'd <hi>Ignatius,</hi> was very ill
treated, but all in diſorder as ſhe was, ſhe ſav'd
her ſelf by the favour of a good wind, which
ſeem'd to riſe on purpoſe, to bring her on the
Coaſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> where having
gain'd a Port, ſhe refitted: And thence ſhe put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to ſea, and happily arriv'd at <hi>Venice,</hi> about
the end of <hi>January</hi> in the year 1524, after a voyage
of more then two months. Whence may be ſeen,
that Saints are under the Protection of Heaven, and
that Providence doth Conduct them, even when to
outward appearance it ſeems to abandon them.</p>
               <p>During this Voyage, <hi>Ignatius</hi> had leaſure to
make a great many refflections. He conſider'd,
that to work Profitably in the Converſion of Souls,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65023:36"/>
ſome parts were requir'd, which were wanting in
him, and that without the foundation of humane
Learning, nothing could be ſolidly perform'd. He
was every day more and more convinc'd of this
Truth; which made him reſolve to return to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona,</hi>
where he had acquaintance with the Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the School, and where he hop'd to find where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
to ſubſiſt during his Studies. So that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making any ſtay at <hi>Venice</hi> he began his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in the deep of Winter, and very ill clad for
the ſeaſon. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Merchant, who knew
him, would have cloath'd him; but he could not
make him accept of any more, then a little Piece
of Courſe cloth to cover his ſtomack, which the
Air of the Sea had extreamly weakened: The
Merchant alſo forc'd him to take fifteen or ſixteen
<hi>Reales,</hi> but he took them only to part with them
again; of doing which, he ſoon had the opportunity.</p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> he went to pray in the
great Church. A poor man immediately came to
him, and held out his hand; He gave him a <hi>Real;</hi>
another came after, and he gave him as much:
Theſe Liberalities drew all the Beggers to him,
and he refus'd none of them, as long as his money
laſted. When he had done his Prayers, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him out of the Church, and ſeeing him beg
there himſelf, they all cry'd out <hi>a Saint a Saint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He needed no more, to make him leave the
place, he continued his Journey through <hi>Lombardy,</hi>
and took the way of <hi>Genova.</hi> There being War
at that time between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
and the two Armies ſpreading all over the Countrey,
made the ways exceeding dangerous: Every body
adviz'd him not to venture forwards: But being
under the Protection of God, he conceiv'd, he
ought not to fear any thing: He moreover believ'd,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65023:37"/>
that if he did not go the ſtrait Road, he ſhould
go out of the way in which Providence deſign'd
to Conduct him. He took up his Lodging every
night in ſome Cottage, where he could hardly lye
dry, in a ſeaſon of Rain, and Snow. He travel'd all
the day in the bad weather, both through the <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armies; coming near a Village, where
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were entrench'd, ſome of the out
Guards took him: His Habit and Figure made them
believe, he was a Spie. They examin'd him, but not
being able to draw a word out of him, they ſtript
him, and carryed him in his ſhirt to their Captain.</p>
               <p>The Remembrance of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> expos'd
naked to the Eyes of the <hi>Jews,</hi> fortify'd <hi>Ignatius</hi>
in an exigence of ſo great Humilitation: But the
fear of being tortur'd did a little terrifie him. He
began to think that if he did make himſelf known,
he could get clearly off; at leaſt, that by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fairly and rationally to the officers, they might
hear reaſon, and not treat him as a Spie. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Reflection, Judging theſe thoughts to be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
of a bad Spirit, and Illuſions of ſelf Love,
he affected and immitated more then before, the
Stupidity of an Ideot. He remain'd without motion
in preſence of the Captain, caſting down his Eyes,
and anſwering nothing to the Queſtions, which the
Officiers put to him: He never ſpoke, but when
they ask'd him, if he were a Spie; then he readily
anſwer'd, No, the Officer taking him to be a
ſilly Poor Wretch, was angry with the Soldiers,
that they could not diſtinguiſh a Spie from a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Fool; and Commanded them to give him his
Cloaths again. So that the ſemblance of an Ideot,
which out of the Love of Suffering and humilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he took upon him, was that which ſav'd him,
and brought him off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:65023:37"/>
But the Souldiers, before they parted with him,
us'd him very roughly both in words and blows,
being enrag'd for having had a Reprimand from
the Captain, upon his account. The joy which
<hi>Ignatius</hi> had, in being us'd in the Camp of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> much after the ſame rate of <hi>Jeſus
Christ his</hi> uſage, in the Court of <hi>Herod,</hi> hindred
him almoſt from feeling the rude treatment of
the Souldiers. Yet among them, there was one
leſs Barbarous then the reſt, who out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
lodg'd him that night, and gave him meat.</p>
               <p>Following on his way, he fell into the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the French; the officer, to whom he was
brought was a <hi>Baſque,</hi> a neighbour to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Gypuſcoa,</hi> and a very Gallant Man: He
judg'd favourably of the <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> by his Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy:
And having learnt his Country, he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him very Civilly. This diverſity of entertainment
confirm'd <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his relyance upon the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, and in his reſolution, to receive
from the hands of God, with the ſame Equality,
comforts, and Croſſes.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Genova</hi> he met <hi>Roderigues Portundo,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galleys, who knew him. They
had ſeen one another at the Court of the <hi>Catholick
King,</hi> and were both of the ſame Country: That
which pleas'd <hi>Ignatius</hi> moſt, was to meet a Ship
ready to go for <hi>Spain,</hi> in which he eaſily procur'd
his paſſage, by the Favour of <hi>Portundo.</hi> The Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
which haunt the Coaſts of <hi>Genova,</hi> gave
chaſe to the Veſſel; and the Galleys of <hi>Andrea
Doria,</hi> who had embrac'd the French Intereſt, did
alſo purſue her; but ſhe ſcap'd both the one, and
the other, and happily gain'd the Port of <hi>Barcelona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> went immediately to ſee <hi>Jeronimo
Ardebale,</hi> who taught in the Grammar School,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65023:38"/>
and he Communicated to him his new deſign: He
imparted it alſo to <hi>Isabella Roſella,</hi> who was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
glad to ſee him again, and promis'd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
him with all neceſſaries. He was then thirty
years old, and had no natural propenſion for ſtudy;
for he had been train'd to Military Exerciſes from
his Childhood, as we have already ſeen; and the love
of Arms, which before his Converſion had wholly
poſſeſt him, gave him a diſguſt to <hi>Latine,</hi> in an
Age, when People of quality took Pride in their
Ignorance. There was little appearance of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
in beginning to Learn at that time of day a
Language, which is only well learnt in the years
of Childhood. On the other ſide, a man wholly
apply'd to the Practice of an interior life, muſt
find a great deal of difficulty to interrupt it, with
beating his brains about the Rules of Grammar.
However, <hi>Ignatius</hi> fell to ſtudy the firſt Rudiments
of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, and went every day to
School with the little Children. The deſire he
had of making himſelf uſeful to his Neighbour,
and the aim he took of Gods greater glory, which
he now Propos'd to himſelf for his only Rule,
made eaſie to him that Crabbed Task, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
in him all his diſguſts and repugnances. But
the enemy of the ſalvation of Mankind, who
foreſaw where the Science of <hi>Ignatius</hi> would one
day end, us'd his Artifice to defeat the Pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p>That Spirit of darkneſs, which is ſometimes
transform'd into an Angel of Light, continually
inſtigated our new Schollar to Practices of Piety,
fill'd him with Conſolations, raiſed in him ſuch
tender ſentiments for God, that all the time of his
ſtudy was ſpent in devout Aſpirations: Inſtead of
conjugating the Verb <hi>Amo</hi> he made Acts of Love,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65023:38"/>
I <hi>Love</hi> thee my God (ſaid he), <hi>you Love me; to
Love, to be Lov'd,</hi> and nothing more. When he
was in the School his thoughts flew up to Heaven,
and while his Maſter explicated the Rules of
Grammar, he was attentive to another Maſter
within him, who open'd to him the difficulties of
Scripture, and the Myſteries of Faith.</p>
               <p>So that he learnt nothing; or the little which
he did learn, was ſoon rub'd out of his Memory
by other more lively and ſtrong Idea's, which
he could not be rid of; Had he ſtopt at appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
or follow'd the motions of ſelf love, he
would have believ'd, that God had only call'd him
to the repoſe of a contemplative life, and that ſtudy
had been an Obſtacle to perfection. But conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Matter according to that light, which he
had for the diſcernment of Spirits, and regulating
all things by the greater glory of God, he had no
difficulty to comprehend, that the Malignant Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
deceiv'd him.</p>
               <p>He diſcover'd the temptation to <hi>Ardebale,</hi> and
carrying him one day along with him to the
Church of St <hi>Mary of the Sea,</hi> he fell down upon
his knees, ask'd him Pardon for his negligence,
and made a vow at the foot of the Altar, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his ſtudies with greater application. He alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
his Maſter to uſe him with ſeverity, when
he did not perform his Task, and to ſpare him no
more, then the leaſt of his Schollars. Tis very
marvilous, that after <hi>Ignatius</hi> had in this manner
combated the illuſions of Hell, they ſo abſolutely
vaniſh'd, that they never return'd more.</p>
               <p>Some Learned men counſel'd him to read the
books of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> (Famous at that time over all
<hi>Europe</hi>) and amongſt the reſt the <hi>Chriſtian Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
as moſt proper for Piety, and for the Purity
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65023:39"/>
of the Latine tongue. He read him, and alſo
markt the Phraſes, and beſt ways of expreſſion:
but he perceiv'd, that the Reading this Author
diminiſh'd in him his Devotion, and that the more
he read, the leſs fervour he had in his Exerciſes of
Piety. By often experience finding this to be ſo,
he threw away the Book, and conceiv'd ſo much
horror of it, that he would never read it more;
and when he came to be General of the Society,
he ordered, that they ſhould not read the Books
of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> or at leaſt, not without great precaution.
To keep alive his firſt fervour, he often read the
<hi>Imitation of Chriſt,</hi> Looking upon it to be a book,
next to the Goſpel, moſt full of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>But if ſometimes divine Conſolations, with
which God often favour'd him, were leſſen'd
in him, he comforted himſelf with the fruit
which he expected from his ſtudies; and well
diſtinguiſhing between Drineſs, and Tepidity, he
was wont to ſay, that the loſs of ſpiritual guſts,
caus'd by ſtudy, purely follow'd for the Glory of
God, was better worth, then all the delights of
ſenſible Devotion; provided the heart be repleniſht
with the Love of God. In this manner, it twas his
Principle care, to maintain the interior Spirit,
which grows ſlack, and is diſſipated by ſtudy,
when it is not eſtabliſht upon ſolid vertue.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon, his health being now mended,
ſince his return from the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> he renew'd
his Auſterities, which the weakneſs of his ſtomack,
and the hardſhips of the Journey had caus'd him to
intermit. But he did nothing without the advice
of his Confeſſor; and far from permitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be tranſported by his Devotion, he retrencht
part of his ſeven hours of prayer, to have more
leaſure for his ſtudy; Following the light, which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65023:39"/>
he then had, that we may, and ought in ſome
occaſions leave God for God.</p>
               <p>Whereas he had now form'd a Model of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Converſation, conformable to that of <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> not to ſcare or eſtrange the People from
him, nor to diſtinguiſh himſelf by any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Habit, he would not take to his Sackcloth
again, nor to his Iron chain, but was contented to
wear a hair ſhirt, under a very poor Caſſock; of the
Alms, which <hi>Iſabella Roſella,</hi> and other devout
perſons beſtow'd upon him, he reſerv'd to himſelf
no more, then was preciſely neceſſary to live, and
parted the reſt among the poor, to whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
gave the beſt of every thing: Inſomuch,
that <hi>Agnes Paſcal</hi> a devout woman, with whom
he lodg'd, and where probably he was placed by
<hi>Iſabella Roſella,</hi> aſtoniſht at the little Care, which
<hi>Ignatius</hi> took of himſelf, reprehended him one day
for keeping ſtill the worſt for his own uſe. <hi>And
what would you do</hi> (Reply'd <hi>Ignatius) If Jeſus
Chriſt ſhould ask of you an Alms? Could you find in
your heart to give him the worſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Son of <hi>Agnes,</hi> call'd <hi>John Paſcal,</hi> a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and devout Youth, would riſe ſometimes in
the night to obſerve what <hi>Ignatius</hi> did in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and ſometimes he ſaw him upon his knees,
ſometimes proſtrate upon the ground, his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
always inflam'd, and often in tears; He
thought once, that he ſaw him elevated from the
ground, and ſurrounded with Light. He often
heard him deeply to ſigh, and in the heat of his
Prayer, theſe words uſually came from him, <hi>O
God, my Love, and the delight of my Soul, if men
did know thee, they would never offend thee! my
God, how good art thou, to bear with ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as I am!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65023:40"/>
This is that <hi>Paſcal,</hi> who being afterwards Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd,
told his Children, that if they knew what he
had ſeen of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> they would never leave kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Floor and the Walls of the Chamber
where the Servant of God did Lodge. And in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, Tears would come from his Eyes; he
would knock his Breaſt, and accuſe himſelf for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo little profited by the Company of ſo holy
a Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> while he endeavour'd his own perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
did not neglect that of his Neighbour. At
thoſe hours which were not employ'd in Study, he
made it his Buſineſs to withdraw Souls from Vice,
by Examples, or by edifying Diſcourſes: This his
Zeal did very much appear upon an important Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
There was out of the Town, between
the new Gate, and the Gate of St. <hi>Daniel,</hi> a famous
Monaſtery of Nuns, call'd <hi>The Monaſtery of the
Angels;</hi> this Name did not very well agree with
thoſe Religious: They liv'd in a great libertinage,
and abating their Habit, were perfect Curtiſans.
<hi>Ignatius</hi> could not without horror ſee ſuch abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in a holy Place; notwithſtanding he judg'd,
that how violent ſoever the Diſeaſe was, violent
Remedies would have no good effect; and that
whereas Religious Perſons who have forſaken God,
are more difficult to be Converted then thoſe of the
World, they are to be manag'd with greater caution
and tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>In order hereunto he frequented the Church of
the Monaſtery of the Angels, making it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Place of his Devotions, where he every day
made his four or five hours of Prayer upon his
Knees, and receiv'd the Sacrament of the Prieſt
who Serv'd that Church, call'd <hi>Puygalte,</hi> who was
a Man of good life, and to whom he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65023:40"/>
his Deſign. The regular and conſtant Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> with his great modeſty and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
rais'd a curioſity in the Nuns to know who
he was: Wherefore they deſir'd to ſpeak with him;
and after many idle Queſtions concerning his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
his Condition, and the like, which <hi>Ignatius</hi>
endeavour'd to elude by general Anſwers, as well as
he could. He at laſt turn'd his Diſcourſe upon the
Excellency and the Duties of a Religious ſtate of
Life. He much inſiſted upon the Purity which
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> requires in his Spouſes, and repreſented
to them the diſhonor done him by their Infidelity.
But he ſpoke to them with ſuch energy and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
together, and gain'd upon them ſo much in this
firſt Conference, that they deſir'd to hear him again.
He came to them many days together, and finding
them diſpos'd to follow his Advice, he engag'd
them by degrees to meditate upon the firſt Verities
of his ſpiritual Exerciſes. In proceſs of time they
were ſo touch'd with Compunction, that changing
their Conduct, they ſhut up their Doors, and quite
broke off the ſcandalous Commerce which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had with the Men of the Town.</p>
               <p>This change enrag'd ſome of the Youngſters who
moſt us'd to haunt the Monaſtery, and they reſolv'd
to revenge themſelves on him whom they found
out to be the Author of it. One day, when <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
return'd from the Monaſtery with the Prieſt
<hi>Puygalte,</hi> two <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Slaves ſet upon them near
the Gate of St. <hi>Daniel,</hi> and Baſtinado'd them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to death. In effect, <hi>Puygalte</hi> dy'd few days
after, and <hi>Ignatius</hi> was left in a manner dead upon
the place: But coming a little to himſelf, after
the Aſſaſſins were gone, and not being able to ſtand
upon his Legs, he was reliev'd by a charitable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
who ſet him upon his Horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:65023:41"/>
His Bruiſes and Pains had ſo weaken'd him, that
his Friends deſpair'd of his life. Many Perſons of
Quality, who honor'd him as the Apoſtle of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona</hi>
(according to the Teſtimony of <hi>John Paſcal</hi>)
came to ſee him as ſoon as they heard of his Diſaſter,
and among the reſt a Daughter of the <hi>Conde de
Palamos,</hi> who was Wife to <hi>Don John de Riqueſens.</hi>
This Lady, no leſs illuſtrious for her Piety then for
her Birth, who had a particular affection for the
Servant of God, was afflicted in the higheſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to ſee him in that condition; at all times, and
in all places ſhe wept for him. But <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who
eſteem'd himſelf happy in ſuffering upon ſuch an
account, blam'd her Tears, telling her, that ſhe
ought to rejoyce, and not to grieve for him.</p>
               <p>He had his Hair-Shirt upon him when he was
aſſaulted by the Slaves, and he could not be induc'd
to leave it off in the height of his Pains, but by the
Command of his Confeſſor, <hi>Diego d' Alcantara,</hi> of
the Order of St. <hi>Francis. John Paſcal</hi> lock'd up
the Hair-Shirt, and would not let him have it any
more; he charily kept it all his life, and left it to
his Children as a precious Legacy, with a Writing
under his Hand to atteſt the truth of it: But in the
Year 1606, the Duke of <hi>Mont-Leon,</hi> Vice-Roy of
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> with great entreaty got it of the Family,
who had kept it as a Relique.</p>
               <p>God in the mean time, who had deſtin'd <hi>Ignatius</hi>
to greater Enterpriſes then this, which coſt him ſo
dear, reſtor'd his Health after Three and fifty days
of Sickneſs and Pain. As ſoon as he was able to
walk, he viſited the Monaſtery of the Angels, to
finiſh the Work he had begun; and when they
told him, that he ſhould take heed of a ſecond Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination,
he anſwer'd, <hi>How glad ſhould I be to
die for ſo good a Cauſe?</hi> But his Enemies, far from
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65023:41"/>
enterpriſing any thing more upon his Perſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of their Crime, and the moſt furious amongſt
them, call'd <hi>Ribera,</hi> came and threw himſelf at
<hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Feet, begging his pardon.</p>
               <p>Two Brothers,<note place="margin">He raiſes a dead Man to life.</note> call'd <hi>Liſani,</hi> had a Law-Suit one
with the other for a Matter of concern, and there
was a mortal hatred between them, as commonly it
happens, when neareſt Relations go to Law. One
of theſe being overthrown, was in ſuch affliction
and rage, that he hang'd himſelf upon one of the
Beams of his Houſe. All the Neighborhood came
in at the outcries of the Family, upon finding their
Maſter hang'd. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who was coming back from
the Monaſtery of the Angels, went into the Houſe
with the reſt, and made them cut the Rope: they
found the unfortunate Man without motion or
Pulſe, and notwithſtanding all they could do to
him, he ſhew'd no ſigns of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> concern'd at the deplorable ſtate of the
poor Man, fell upon his Knees cloſe to the Body, and
by a ſtrong inſpiration begg'd of God with a loud
and diſtinct voice, ſo much life for this miſerable
wretch, as might ſerve him to make his Confeſſion.
He is heard, and in preſence of all the Company,
who aſtoniſh'd at his Prayer, waited with impatience
the ſucceſs, <hi>Liſano</hi> immediately came to life. In
this manner it is, that the three Auditors of the <hi>Rota</hi>
ſpeak of this matter;<note place="margin">Cunctis ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, &amp; rei exitum expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantibus, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanus ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam rediit.</note> and to the end it may not be
doubted, that Heaven did reſtore life to the dead
Man at the Prayer of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the reſuſcitated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
immediately dy'd, after he had Confeſs'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> had now continu'd almoſt two years at
<hi>Barcelona,</hi> in which time he had ſo well profited in
the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, that his Maſter judg'd him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to proceed to the higher Sciences. Though
he did not believe that <hi>Ardebale</hi> would flatter him,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65023:42"/>
yet for greater ſecurity, he would be Examin'd by
a Perſon who was a Doctor of Divinity, and had
little acquaintance with him. The Doctor was of
the ſame opinion with <hi>Ardebale,</hi> and counſell'd
him to Study his Courſe of Philoſophy in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of <hi>Alcala,</hi> which had been newly Founded
by the Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> and was at that time very
flouriſhing.</p>
               <p>Many young Men,<note place="margin">He go's to <hi>Alcala,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies there.</note> whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> had brought
into the way of Vertue, deſir'd to accompany him;
but he would take with him only three, of which
one was call'd <hi>Caliſte,</hi> another <hi>Artiaga,</hi> and the
third <hi>Cazieres.</hi> He alſo choſe a fourth Diſciple in
the Hoſpital of <hi>Alcala;</hi> where <hi>Ignatius</hi> took up his
Quarter at his arrival in that Town. This fourth
Diſciple was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> Page to <hi>Don Martin de
Cordova,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Navarr.</hi> The young <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
who had been wounded in a Quarrel, as his
Maſter paſs'd through <hi>Alcala,</hi> was carry'd to the
Hoſpital to be cur'd of his Wounds. While the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons
had care of his Body, <hi>Ignatius</hi> undertook the
Cure of his Soul; and he labour'd ſo ſucceſsfully in
it, that the Page reſolv'd to reform his Life, left the
Service of the Vice-Roy, and his Hopes in the
World. They were all five Habited alike, wearing a
long Garment of gray Cloth, with a Hat of the ſame
colour; and they liv'd only upon Aims, but they
did not reſide together in one Houſe: <hi>Ferdinando
de Para,</hi> and <hi>Andrea d' Arze,</hi> each of them Lodg'd
two out of Charity. As for <hi>Ignatius,</hi> he had his
Lodging in the Hoſpital of <hi>Dantezana,</hi> where he
had no difficulty to get a Chamber, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great multitude of Poor there; for that
which they let him have, had been a long while
empty, and no body durſt lie in it, having the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of being haunted with Spirits; and perhaps
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65023:42"/>
not without reaſon: for the firſt Night that <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
lay there, he heard a terrible noiſe, and even
ſaw ſome hideous Spectres, which, as bold as he was,
did a little frighten him; but having recourſe to
Prayer, he never ſaw nor heard more of them.</p>
               <p>The impatience which he had to give himſelf
entirely to the Converſion of Souls, made him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Study with extream earneſtneſs; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that he ſhould make a quick diſpatch, by
applying himſelf to ſeveral Sciences at once, he had
ſcarce learn'd his Terms of Logick, but he fell upon
Natural Philoſophy, and alſo undertook Scholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Divinity. They read in the Schools of that
Univerſity, the Logick of <hi>Soto,</hi> the Phyſick of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus
Magnus,</hi> and the Theology of the Maſter of
the <hi>Sentences.</hi> He took all theſe three Leſſons one
after another, and Study'd Night and Day without
intermiſſion. But ſo many different Notions ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
his Underſtanding, that all his labour ended
in learning nothing; as it always happens when
one Study's without Method, and would graſp all at
once. Thus it was, that Providence, deſigning <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
to teach <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Univerſity of
<hi>Alcala,</hi> inſtead of learning <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
gave him not any light to ſee the diſorder in his
way of Studying, nor even permitted that his own
natural Reaſon ſhould ſerve to redreſs it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore being diſheartned with the little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
which he had made in the Sciences,<note place="margin">He doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good works.</note> he, with
his four Diſciples, apply'd himſelf wholly to good
Works. All the time which he did not ſpend in
Prayer, he employ'd in Catechiſing Children, in
ſerving the Sick of the Hoſpital, and in procuring
Relief for poor People aſham'd to beg. But moſt
particularly he apply'd himſelf to reform the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of diſſolute Schollars, for which he had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Talent from Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:65023:43"/>
This zeal for the reformation of Youth, made
him undertake the Converſion of a Man much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to liberty, who held one of the firſt Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the Church of <hi>Spain,</hi> and who by his ill
Example, by his Liberalities, and by his Careſſes,
corrupted almoſt all the young Men in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of <hi>Alcala.</hi> After having begg'd of God the
Light and Forces which he ſhould have need of
in ſo hard an Enterprize, he go's to the Lodging of
the Prelate; and to obtain Audience, he ſends up
word, that an unknown Perſon had things of great
importance to tell him. When he was brought up
to him, he ſaid, <hi>It is the greateſt Concern you have
in the World which obliges me to wait upon you,
for it is the Concern of your eternal Salvation. And
what?</hi> (he added in a Tone of Aſſurance, and yet of
Reſpect) <hi>d'ye think that God has plac'd you in this
World to live as if there were neither Heaven nor
Hell? Is a happy Eternity of ſo little value, that it
doth not deſerve your care? If at this moment that I
ſpeak to you Death ſhould ſurprize you, where would
you be? What Account could you give, I do not ſay
of ſo much Riches ſo ſinfully employ'd, but of ſo many
Souls which you have deſtroy'd, and do every day
deſtroy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> would have ſtill continu'd in the ſame
Tone, but the Prelate took him ſhort, call'd him an
inſolent Fool, and a Mad-man, and in a great
rage threatned to have him thrown out of the
Window, if he did not preſently depart; and in
order thereunto, call'd up his Servants. For all this
<hi>Ignatius</hi> did not ceaſe to follow on his Point with
the ſame liberty as before; and God gave ſuch
a Bleſſing upon his Words, that the incenſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
grew ſuddenly calm, and ſo much an alter'd
Man, that with great Civility he invited <hi>Ignatius</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:65023:43"/>
to Sup with him. <hi>Ignatius</hi> would not balk ſo fair
an occaſion of going on with his Work; but made
ſuch good uſe of his time, that before he left him,
what with his modeſt Comportment, and with the
force of his Reaſons, he gain'd him to that degree,
that he wholly chang'd the looſe courſe of his life.</p>
               <p>This Converſion made a great noiſe in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and had a very good effect upon the young
Students of the Univerſity, in order to the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Manners: The Prelate himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
zealous to reclaim thoſe by his good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whom his bad had corrupted. But that which
moſt ſerv'd to reform the Youth of <hi>Alcala,</hi> was the
Aſſemblies of Devotion which <hi>Ignatius</hi> held in the
Hoſpital, whither great Crowds of Schollars came
to him, and ſeldom went away, but with a horror
and deteſtation of Vice.</p>
               <p>The common People were ſtruck with theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Changes,<note place="margin">He is ſuſpected of Sorcery and Hereſie.</note> and following their natural
malignity, they entertain'd ſtrange Fancies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Ignatius.</hi> Some ſaid he was a Conjurer,
and that without Art-Magick he could not do what
he had done: Others, that he was an Heretick, and
that under pretence of bringing the young Fry to
Piety he inſtill'd falſe Doctrine into them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Rumors quickly came to the Ears of the
Inquiſitors at <hi>Toledo.</hi> They had lately condemn'd
in <hi>Spain</hi> certain Viſionaries, who were call'd the
<hi>Illuminated,</hi> or Men of new Lights. The Hereſie of
<hi>Luther</hi> began to deſolate <hi>Germany,</hi> and there was
reaſon to fear that it would ſpread it ſelf abroad
like the Plague, which ſeldom doth rage in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
without infecting the Neighbouring Parts.
Wherefore the Inquiſitors being very zealous and
watchful, were induced to believe, that poſſibly
the Perſon ſo much talk'd of, might either be an
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65023:44"/>
                  <hi>Illuminato</hi> or a <hi>Lutheran;</hi> and to be throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of the matter, they came themſelves to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala,</hi>
to take Examinations upon the Place.</p>
               <p>After an exact Enquiry into the Manners and
Doctrine of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is declared innocent.</note> not finding any thing that
might render him ſuſpected, and not judging it
expedient to make him appear before them, they
were contented to refer the Matter to <hi>John Roderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
Figueroa,</hi> Grand Vicar of <hi>Alcala,</hi> and to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate
to him all their Authority, in caſe any new
Matter ſhould happen. As ſoon as the Inquiſitors
were gone, the Grand Vicar call'd <hi>Ignatius</hi> before
him, and declar'd to him, that the Juridical Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
which had been made, was much in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and that he might continue his Functions for
the ſervice of his Neighbour. He only admoniſh'd
him, that it was not approv'd of, that he and his
Companions, not being Religious, ſhould go in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
alike. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to take away all ground of
Complaint, Cloth'd himſelf and <hi>Artiaga</hi> in Black,
left his gray Habit to the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and made
<hi>Caliſte</hi> and <hi>Cazeres</hi> go into a Ruſſet Colour. But
in regard the Grand Vicar had forbidden him to go
bare-foot, he put on Shoes, and ever after wore
them.</p>
               <p>The Teſtimony of the Inquiſition juſtifi'd <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
and gave him a great deal of Credit among the
People. He was no more now an <hi>Illuminato</hi> or a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran,</hi>
but a Man fill'd with the Spirit of God, and
a Succeſſor of the Apoſtles; and <hi>Alphonſo Sanchez,</hi>
Canon of St. <hi>Juſte,</hi> commonly call'd him <hi>The holy
Man.</hi> This is the Canon who before he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the true Piety which was in <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and in his
Diſciples, did one day publickly refuſe them the
Communion, upon ſuppoſition that they were Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
if not worſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:65023:44"/>
                  <hi>Martin Saez,</hi> a rich and principal Man of the
Town of <hi>Aſpetia,</hi> which lies near to the Caſtle of
<hi>Loyola,</hi> being come to <hi>Alcala</hi> for ſome Buſineſs of
Conſequence, heard them ſpeak much of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
which made him deſire his Acquaintance. Being
ſhew'd to him one day in the Street, he follow'd
him to a little Houſe whither he us'd to go every
Morning upon a Charitable account: Having
ſeen him go in, and come out of the Houſe, he
went in himſelf, and there found a poor ſick Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whom he ask'd who that Perſon was that laſt
went from her; She anſwer'd, that ſhe did not know
the Man, but that he brought her every day ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to live upon, and that without his aſſiſtance
ſhe muſt have ſtarv'd. <hi>Tell him</hi> (ſays the Man of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petia)
that you know a Perſon that will furniſh him
with Money for all the Charities which he will do.</hi>
The ſick Woman fail'd not to advertiſe <hi>Ignatius</hi> of
it, and to tell him the Lodging, the Name, and the
Country of this Man, according to the Order ſhe
had receiv'd from him. The very Name of <hi>Aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
did much affright <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who fear'd nothing
more then the meeting of any Perſons of his own
Country: On the other ſide he was mortifi'd to be
ſo diſcover'd; ſo that without ſaying any thing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the poor Woman, he only told her, <hi>Siſter, I
have ſuccour'd you hitherto, according to my ability;
hereafter Providence will aſſiſt you by ſome other
means.</hi> After which he departed, and came no more.</p>
               <p>In this while the Grand Vicar caus'd new Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
to be taken of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Diſciples;
either incited thereunto by ill-minded People, or
elſe imagining with himſelf, that Men of ſmall
Learning might be apt to teach falſe Doctrine in
their Catechiſms; and that being young, how ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
now ſoever they appear'd, they might eaſily
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65023:45"/>
fall into the frailties of Youth. Upon this freſh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
he ſtill found their Doctrine ſound, and their
Manners irreprehenſible. But there fell out an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
which gave him ill impreſſions of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and even did exaſperate him againſt them.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Perſons that follow'd <hi>Ignatius,</hi> there
were two Women of Quality, the Mother and the
Daughter, and both Widows: The Mother was
call'd <hi>Maria de Vado,</hi> and the Daughter <hi>Loviſa
Velaſquez,</hi> They had both been great Worldlings,
eſpecially the Daughter, whoſe Beauty and Youth
had drawn more Courtſhip. From the beginning
of their Converſion they reſolv'd to undertake
ſomething extraordinary for the love of God. As
Women commonly run to Extreams, and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
having more fire then the reſt, they imagin'd
that nothing could be finer, nor more edifying,
then to Clothe themſelves like Beggars, and to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
about begging their Bread, viſiting Hoſpitals,
and ſerving the Sick. However, they would not
ſet forth till they had conſulted <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whom they
took for their ſpiritual Director. He told them the
folly of their Deſign, and that without an evident
Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, they muſt not take
ſuch extraordinary Courſes to advance in Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
That Sanctity did not conſiſt in running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
That Women, who were not too ſecure even
within their own Walls, had a great deal to fear in
a wandring Life; That in <hi>Alcàla</hi> there were Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals
where they might exerciſe their Charity;
That being rich, they ſhould employ themſelves in
helping the Neceſſitous, and not counterfeit them
by an affected Beggery; In concluſion, That they
ſhould either renounce the World for good-and-all,
or elſe live in it like reaſonable Perſons, regulating
their Vertue according to their Condition, and not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65023:45"/>
attempting to be Saints in any other way then God
would have them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Devotes, by Profeſſion, do not always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Counſel, nor have deference to the Judgment
of their Directors, unleſs it jump with their own
ſenſe. Theſe its true did lay down the thoughts of
rambling every where about, but they could not
be hinder'd from making a Pilgrimage in their own
faſhion, to our Ladies of <hi>Guadeloupe,</hi> and to the
Holy <hi>Syndon</hi> of <hi>Jaen.</hi> Theſe are two Celebrated
Devotions in <hi>Spain,</hi> the one in new <hi>Caſtille,</hi> the
other in <hi>Andalouſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſet forwards with great Secreſie,<note place="margin">He is again accus'd and put in Priſon.</note> without
ſaying any thing to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Habited like pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Pilgrims, and went all the way on Foot beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Alms. As ſoon as the thing was known, all
the World fell foul upon <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and among others,
Doctor <hi>Cirol,</hi> who was a particular friend of theſe
Ladies. He complained againſt the ſuffering an
illiterate Lay-man to tamper in the Direction of
Conſciences; He ſaid openly, that a Director, who
advis'd mad things, ought himſelf to be ſhut up.
Whereas this Doctor was in great Credit with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Ximenes,</hi> who had beſtow'd on him the firſt
Chair of Divinity in the new Univerſity of <hi>Alcala,</hi>
he had no great difficulty to make the Grand Vicar
enter into his ſentiments. <hi>Ignatius</hi> is Arreſted, and
publickly carried to Priſon.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Franciſco de Borgia,</hi> Son to the Duke of
<hi>Gandia,</hi> who at that time was but Seventeen years
old, happen'd then to paſs in the Street with a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Train. The Modeſty and Mildneſs of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
in the midſt of the ſhouts and clamor of the
People, mightily ſtruck the young Lord, and made
thoſe impreſſions in him, of which he did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the meaning, till afterwards. It is probable,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65023:46"/>
that Heaven, deſigning <hi>Borgia</hi> to be one day a
Son of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> purpoſely expos'd him to his view
in this ſuffering condition; and that this ſight of him
was the firſt ſeed of his Vocation.</p>
               <p>The news of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Impriſonment was no
ſooner ſpread about the Town, but people of all
ſorts flock'd to him: According to his Cuſtom, he
ſpoke to them of Heaven, and the things of God;
and he ſpoke with greater liberty then ever. <hi>George
Naver,</hi> who was the firſt Profeſſor of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the Vniverſity of <hi>Alcala,</hi> and who paſs'd for
a Man of great Senſe, was one day ſo charm'd with
the Diſcourſe of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that he forgot the hour of
his Leſſon. Going afterwards to the School, and
meeting his Scholars, who had waited for him; I <hi>have
ſeen St.</hi> Paul <hi>in Priſon</hi> (ſaid he) quite tranſported.</p>
               <p>Some Ladies of Quality, who knew the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of the Priſoner, ſent to him, to offer their
Mediation for getting him out of Priſon. The
moſt conſiderable were <hi>Thereſa Henriquez,</hi> Mother
of the Duke of <hi>Maqueda,</hi> and <hi>Elinor Maſcaregnas,</hi>
at that time Lady of Honor to the Empreſs, and
afterwards Governant to the Prince of <hi>Spain,
Philip</hi> the Second. Both the one, and the other, were
of that ſort of Vertuous Women, whom the World
doth not corrupt, and who have the ſecret to be
Saints at Court. They had never convers'd with
<hi>Ignatius</hi> but once, and that only Conference had
given them a great opinion of his Sanctity.</p>
               <p>He did not accept of their offers, and would not
ſo much as retain an Advocate; whether it were,
that he confided in the goodneſs of his Cauſe, or
that he believ'd, he ought to leave himſelf to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
not to loſe, through his own fault, ſo
fair an occaſion of partaking in the Ignominies of
the Croſs. And beſides, he deſir'd nothing more
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65023:46"/>
then to be ſet right by Ecceleſiaſtical Superiors, in,
caſe he had err'd in any thing; and declar'd, that
he was diſpos'd and reſolv'd blindly to obey them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> had been ſeventeen days in Priſon, when
the Grand Vicar came thither to examine him. The
ſtreſs of the Examination was concerning the two
Pilgrim Ladies. He confeſt that he knew them,
but at the ſame time declar'd, that far from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling
them to ſo unbecoming an expedition, he
had endeavor'd, what in him lay, to ſuppreſs in
them ſuch rambling thoughts. <hi>And yet for that only
matter are you put into Priſon,</hi> ſaid the Grand Vicar.</p>
               <p>While ſtrict enquiries were made upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as alſo upon the Life and Converſation of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
the wandring Ladies came back, after a
two and forty days ramble; who being Juridically
interrogated, confirm'd what <hi>Ignatius</hi> had ſaid,
and their Teſtimony was believ'd, in this matter,
where they accus'd themſelves; ſo that he was fully
acquitted on that ſide; and nothing more being
found to charge him withall, he was abſolutely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd,
and enlarg'd by a publick Sentence, the
firſt day of <hi>June</hi> in the year 1527.</p>
               <p>This Sentence had two Clauſes in it not very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable,
That he, and his Companions ſhould wear
the ordinary Habit of Scholars; That not being
Divines, they ſhould abſtain from explicating to the
People the Myſteries of Religion, till ſuch time, as
they had ſtudied Four years in Divinity: Moreover
the Grand Vicar forbad them all manner of teaching
or inſtructing in Religious matters, under pain of
Excommunication and Baniſhment.</p>
               <p>For what regarded their Clothing, <hi>Ignatius</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
it was not in their power to obey, unleſs they
had the means of doing it; upon the other point of
inſtructing the People, he did not declare himſelf,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65023:47"/>
becauſe he doubted, whether it were a lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
The ground of his doubt was, that
their work in Catechizing did not require a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
knowledge of the Myſteries; and that in not
doing it, they ſhould be wanting to their Call
and Vocation. To clear this Scruple, and above
all to take certain meaſures in the doing it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to apply himſelf to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi>
who was at <hi>Vallidolid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Grand Vicar made him, and his Diſciples
be cloth'd after the manner of the Scholars; he
moreover told him a little harſhly, that they would
not have brought ſo much trouble upon themſelves
if their Diſcourſes had leſs of Novelty in them. <hi>I did
not think, Ignatius</hi> repli'd with a grave and modeſt
Aire, <hi>that it had been a novelty amongſt Chriſtians,
to ſpeak of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some few days before his Departure, paſſing
through a Street, where the People were aſſembl'd
to ſee ſome play at long <hi>Tennis,</hi> before the Houſe of
<hi>Lopez Mendoze,</hi> he ask'd an Alms from ſome of
the People there. <hi>Lopez</hi> had no ſooner caſt his Eyes
upon him, but pointing at him with his finger, he
cry'd out, <hi>I will be burnt, if that Man does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be ſo.</hi> The ſame day the news was brought
of the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Spain, Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
and at night Bonefires were made over all
the Town. <hi>Lopez</hi> being on the top of his
Houſe, to cauſe ſome little pieces of Cannon to be
diſcharg'd, it chanc'd, that a ſpark fell upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of Powder, which taking Fire, inclos'd him,
and burnt him alive: As if God, to declare the
innocence, and to repair the honor of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> had
deſign'd to take <hi>Lopez</hi> at his word, in puniſhing him,
according to his own Imprecation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> was very well receiv'd by Don <hi>Alphonſo
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65023:47"/>
de Fonſeca,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Toledo.</hi> This Prelate,
having heard his reaſons, and knowing how much
thoſe of <hi>Alcala</hi> were prepoſſeſt againſt him, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel'd
him to go and Study at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and very
much exhorted him to continue his functions of piety
towards his Neighbour. He promis'd him all the
protection that he and his Companions ſhould want,
and gave them wherewithal to make their journey.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding <hi>Ignatius</hi> his earneſtneſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
his Studies,<note place="margin">What he doth and what he ſuffers at <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca.</hi>
                  </note> when he ſhould be at quiet, yet
when he came to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> he made it his firſt
buſineſs to Labour in the gaining of Souls; and he
did it with the greater Fervour and Liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
now his Miſſion ſeem'd to be Authoriz'd by
the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Toledo.</hi> The fruits of his Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Labour firſt appear'd in the Converſion of
many among the ordinary People; and in a little
time his Reputation ſo ſpread it ſelf, that the moſt
conſiderable of the Town deſir'd to learn of him the
Maxims of Salvation.</p>
               <p>And yet there were ſome good People, who did
not well reliſh all that <hi>Ignatius</hi> did, either out of a
ſecret Jealouſie, that ſo many good works ſhould be
done by him, in which they had no part, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perſwaded, that in a time in which Hereſie did
very much ſpring up, every new thing ought to be
ſuſpected. They ſaid, it was a thing unheard of,
that a ſimple Lay-man ſhould inſtruct the People,
and in a manner execute the Office of a Paſtor, in
directing Conſciences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Religious of St.</hi> Dominick <hi>in the Monaſtery
of St.</hi> Stephen <hi>were of this opinion, and took upon
them to Examine the Matter to the Bottom; altho
they had no Juriſdiction, nor Order given them,
for their ſo doing.</hi> Ignatius <hi>had his Confeſſor in
this Monaſtery, who one day invited him to Dinner
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65023:48"/>
by order of the Sub-Prior, who at that time, in the
abſence of the Prior, govern'd the Houſe: This
Religious Man had a great Curioſity to know what
kind of Man this new Apoſtle was, of whom the
World ſo much talk'd. After dinner the Sub-Prior,
accompani'd with the Confeſſor, and another Father,
carri'd</hi> Ignatius <hi>and his Diſciple</hi> Caliſto <hi>into a private
Chappel; where putting on an open free Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
he thus ſpoke to him,</hi> I am very glad, that
according to the Example of the Apoſtles, you go
about every where Teaching the People the things of
Heaven, and I can aſſure you, that all of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
are no leſs ſatisfi'd with it. But I would fain
know (<hi>he added</hi>) what ability of Learning you have,
and to what Sciences you are moſt appli'd. We are
not Learned Men, nor do we pretend to be ſo (<hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd</hi>
Ignatius) nor have we Studied much. How
then comes it to paſs, that you take upon you the
Miniſtery of Preaching? (<hi>repli'd the Sub-Prior.</hi>) We
neither undertake the Office of Preaching, nor do
we Preach (<hi>ſaid</hi> Ignatius) We only Catechize, and
make familiar Diſcourſes. But what do you ſpeak of
(<hi>reply'd the Sub-Prior</hi>) in thoſe familiar Diſcourſes?
We ſpeak of Vertue, and Vice (<hi>Anſwer'd</hi> Ignatius)
and we endeavour the beſt we can, to repreſent the
Beauty of the one, and the Deformity of the other.
Truly you are pleaſant Men (<hi>ſaid the Sub-Prior</hi>) that
you dare Diſcourſe to the People of Vertue, and Vice,
without being either Philoſophers, or Divines. You
have therefore infus'd Knowledges (<hi>he added, in a
tone of Deriſion</hi>) ſince they are not acquir'd by ſtudy,
and you would do me a kindneſs to tell me, what
thoſe Revelations are, that you have had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> judg'd, that ſuch a Queſtion did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
an Anſwer. He held his peace, and tho often
urg'd by the Sub-Prior to give him an Anſwer, he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65023:48"/>
only ſaid, <hi>Father 'tis enough; if you pleaſe let us
ſtop here, I will Anſwer no farther, till my Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Superiors, to whom I owe Obedience, ſhall
Command me. But I will make you ſpeak</hi> (ſaid the
angry Sub-Prior) <hi>your ſilence ſufficiently ſhews, that
there is ſomething very unwarrantable in your
Doctrine.</hi> And then looking upon <hi>Caliſto,</hi> who
was at that time a little odly dreſt, <hi>We need but look
upon you</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to Judge, that you affect ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
and that Novelties pleaſe you.</hi> This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of <hi>Ignatius</hi> coming to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> met
a Pilgrim upon the Road extreamly poor, to
whom he gave his new Cloths in Exchange of the
Pilgrims old ones, which conſiſted of a pitiful Jacket
too ſhort for him, and a Hat with broad brims all
worn out, all which together made but a ridiculous
Figure of him: He truly confes'd what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
to take away the ſuſpicion conceiv'd againſt
them. But the Sub-Prior, no more ſatisfi'd with
the Anſwer of <hi>Caliſto,</hi> then with the ſilence of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
had them both conducted into a Cell, and
there lockt them up.</p>
               <p>Three days after, they were carri'd to Priſon by
the Order of <hi>Frias,</hi> Grand Vicar of the Church of
<hi>Salamanca,</hi> and a friend of the Sub-Prior. They
put them into a dark Dungeon, as ſeditious perſons,
and Hereticks, and fetter'd them together with a
great Iron Chain. All the night they ſpent in
ſinging Hymns, and giving Thanks to Heaven,
for having been judg'd worthy to ſuffer contumely
for the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the firſt noiſe of the Impriſonment of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
all the Town was in an uprore, from all
parts they flock'd to the Priſon, ſome to ſee the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
others to relieve them. Don <hi>Franciſco
Mendoza</hi> (who was afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Burgos</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:65023:49"/>
and a Cardinal,) going thither, and Condoling <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>'s
misfortune, he ask'd him, if his Impriſonment
was not painful to him. <hi>D'ye think</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ignatius</hi>
ſmiling) <hi>'tis any great matter to be in Priſon, and
in Chains? for my part I confeſs truly to you, that
there are not ſo many Dungeons, nor Fetters in</hi>
Salamanca, <hi>but that I ſhould be glad of more, for
the love of my Saviour</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He made almoſt the ſame Anſwer to ſome
Nuns, who mightily compaſionating his Condition,
wrote to him Letters full of tenderneſs and grief on
his behalf, and of Reſentment againſt thoſe, who
had made him be arreſted. But he condemn'd theſe
Sentiments of Nature in them, and told them, it
was a ſign, that they did not know the Treaſures,
which are hid under the Croſſes we ſuffer, for the
Service of God. This Advertiſement had ſuch an
effect upon theſe Religious Women, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
enflam'd with the deſire of Humiliations and
Sufferings.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Frias,</hi> who had much the
Character and Spirit of <hi>Figneroa,</hi> came to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
the Priſoners; <hi>Ignatius</hi> deliver'd into his
hands the Book of his Spiritual Exerciſes, and told
him the Lodging of his other Three Diſciples, to
the end they might be Examin'd. Immediately
they were apprehended, and put into a Dungeon
apart, where they could have no Communication
with <hi>Ignatius</hi> or <hi>Caliſto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Grand <hi>Vicar</hi> took the pains himſelf to read
the Book of the Exerciſes, and afterwards gave it
to three Doctors to read, of which one of his own
Name was call'd <hi>Frias,</hi> the other <hi>Paravignas,</hi> and
the third <hi>Iſidoro.</hi> After they had all four throughly
examin'd it, they ſent for <hi>Ignatius</hi> to come before
them, and propos'd to him divers Queſtions, not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65023:49"/>
only upon the Matters contain'd in his Book of
Exerciſes, but alſo upon many Theological Points,
treated of in the Schools. <hi>Ignatius</hi> acknowledged
to them, that he was no Learned Man: However
he anſwer'd ſo to the purpoſe, that the Doctors
were ſurpriz'd. One of them, to puzzel him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
a crabbed and difficult Queſtion to him out of
the Canon Law; He anſwer'd, he did not know
what the Canoniſts had determin'd upon that Point,
but in Obedience to them he told them his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of it, which prov'd to be exactly right and true.
They commanded him to explicate to them the
firſt Precept of the Decalogue, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as he uſually did to the People. He did it, but
like a man inſpir'd, and in ſuch a way, as perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them that the Holy Ghoſt ſpake by his mouth.
This notwithſtanding, they again told him, that
they much wonder'd, that he, being no Schollar,
as he confeſt himſelf, ſhould undertake in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Exerciſes to determine the difference
between a Venial, and a Mortal Sin. To which he
plainly anſwer'd that they were his Judges; And if
he had advanc'd any thing contrary to Faith, they
ought to condemn him: But if his Doctrine of the
diſtinction between a Venial and a Mortal Sin had
nothing in it but what was Catholick, he humbly
hoped, that they would approve of it.</p>
               <p>At this very time, while they were examining
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> the Priſoners broke open the doors of the
Priſon, and having kill'd, or bound the Guards,
all made their eſcape, except the Companions of
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> who were found all alone in the Priſon,
with the Doors open. This did not a little ſerve
to juſtify their Innocence. In concluſion after
two and twenty days of Impriſonment, the Maſter
and his Diſciples were cited before the Judges, to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65023:50"/>
hear their Sentence read; by which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
to be good Men, and their Doctrine to be
Sound: They are farther permitted to ſpeak of
Heavenly things, and to Inſtruct the People, as
much as they pleaſe: But, altho the difference which
<hi>Ignatius</hi> had ſet down, between Venial and Mortal
Sins, were allowed to be <hi>Orthodox</hi> by the Judges
themſelves, they forbad him to touch upon that
Point in his <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> or in his Exhortations, till
ſuch time, as he had ſtudyed four years in Divinity.</p>
               <p>Here we may wonder, that the Lords of <hi>Loyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
did not appear, during all theſe Storms, and
that, ſince the Converſion of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> none of his
Family did ever look after him. This poſſibly
may be, either becauſe <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſtill made it his
chief buſineſs to conceal his Family, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
ſo that his Kindred were wholly Ignorant,
what was become of him, or elſe God might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
for the greater Perfection of his Servant, that
he who had abſolutely abandon'd the World,
ſhould alſo be forgot by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who deſir'd not his Liberty but for the
Service of his Neighbour, was not well ſatisfy'd
with the laſt Article of his Sentence. He look'd
upon it as a Snare laid to catch him. He knew
that his Enemies had caus'd this Article to be inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
with deſign of raiſing new Quarrels, and
Complaints againſt him. Wherefore to avoid the
ill Conſequence of it, he reſolv'd to leave <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi>
and even <hi>Spain,</hi> it ſelf. He had at the
ſame time a ſtrong Inſpiration to go for <hi>France,</hi>
to continue or rather to recommence his Studies
in the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> which was at that time
the moſt celebrated in all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having found by Experience,<note place="margin">He leaves <hi>Spain</hi> to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> that the little
Progreſs which he had made in Learning at <hi>Alcala</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:65023:50"/>
and <hi>Salamanca,</hi> did much proceed from his loſing
time in begging about for his ſubſiſtance, he thought
that before he entred into a ſtrange Countrey, he
might in Conſcience raiſe a ſmall Fund, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to ſubſiſt during his Studies. Wherefore,
when he paſt through <hi>Barcelona,</hi> he made no
Scruple to accept of the Money, and Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
which his Friends offer'd him. He left
his Companions there, whom he found not over
diſpos'd to follow him, and departed alone, about
the end of <hi>December,</hi> however, with deſign that
they ſhould follow him, when he had made their
way, and prepar'd accommodations for them.
There was little Security upon the Frontiers of
the two Kingdoms, where the Souldiers on both
ſides robb'd, and ill treated Paſſengers. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a ſevere Winter, and the Snow which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
all the Ground, made the ways hardly paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Notwithſtanding he perform'd his Journey
without any Diſaſter, and came to <hi>Paris</hi> in good
health at the beginning of <hi>February.</hi> 1528.</p>
               <p>The chief End, which <hi>Ignatius</hi> had in this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
was to advance in Learning. He lodged in
the Univerſity with ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Students; And
that he might be Maſter of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, he
put himſelf again to the Study of it in <hi>Montaigu</hi>
College. Whereas he had no love for Money,
and had no Inclination to keep it, out of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of <hi>Evangelical</hi> Poverty, he truſted all that he
had with one of his Chamber Fellows: But this
Companion of his prov'd very unfaithful to him;
Part of the Money he riotouſly ſpent, and the reſt
he run away with. <hi>Ignatius</hi> who had no Recruit,
was conſtrain'd to retire to the <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>James,</hi>
where <hi>Spaniards</hi> are receiv'd, and which was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Charlemain</hi> for the Pilgrims of St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>James,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:65023:51"/>
after he had freed <hi>Spain</hi> from the Yoke of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had only his Lodging in the Hoſpital, and for
his Subſiſtance, he was forc'd to beg his Bread from
Door to Door: This alteration did much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
his Studies, for he loſt a great deal of time
in procuring Alms about the Town; and Lodging
far from the College, he could not be punctual at
the Hours of School. He would gladly have been
a Servitor to one of the Maſters of the College;
but with all his diligence and endeavour, he could
not obtain ſo mean an Employment.</p>
               <p>His Poverty however, did not hinder him from
exciting to Vertue thoſe of his Acquaintance, and
his words made great Impreſſion upon three <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
of which, one was nam'd <hi>John de Castro,</hi>
the other <hi>Peralta,</hi> and the laſt <hi>Amadore.</hi> Having
all three made the Spiritual Exerciſes, they ſold
all that they had, and gave the Money to the Poor;
after which, retiring themſelves with <hi>Ignatius</hi> to
the Hoſpital of St. <hi>James's,</hi> they liv'd as he did
upon Alms.</p>
               <p>The Friends of theſe young Men mightily
blaim'd their Conduct, and told them, that their
Devotion made them paſs for Mad-men all over the
Town. But ſeeing that they gain'd nothing that
way upon them, they had recourſe to Violence,
and one day enter'd into the Hoſpital with Armed
Men, and took away the three <hi>Spaniards</hi> againſt
their Will.</p>
               <p>This buſineſs made a great Noiſe.<note place="margin">He is inform'd againſt to the Inquiſitor.</note> 
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> is
accus'd of concealing bad deſigns under a Mask of

<hi>Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>James Govea</hi> a <hi>Portugues,</hi> who
were Acquainted with <hi>Caſtro, Peralta,</hi> and <hi>Amedoer,</hi>
ſo openly declaim'd, that ſuch a Man, who ſeduc'd
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65023:51"/>
young Scholars, ſhould be well look'd after, that
he was inform'd againſt to the Inquiſitor <hi>Matthew

               <p>Altho the Tribunal of the Inquiſition was never
eſtabliſh't in <hi>France,</hi> in the ſame manner, as it is
in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> yet there have been formerly
for many years Inquiſitors, delegated by the Pope,
to conſerve the purity of Faith, and to keep the
People in Obedience to the Church: Twelve years
after the death of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who was the firſt
Inquiſitor General, commiſſionated by Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
the Third, and by <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third,
againſt the <hi>Albigenſes, Gregory</hi> the Ninth, deputed
two Religious of the ſame Order in the year 1233,
to exerciſe the ſaid Office. And this Apoſtolical
Commiſſion was not only continu'd in the Convent
of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> but was alſo extended to many other
Monaſteries of the Kingdom. One of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
named in the cauſe of the Templers, was
the Inquiſitor General of <hi>France;</hi> one of the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners
of the Doctrine of <hi>John Petit</hi> Doctor of
the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> was alſo ſuch: And the
Hiſtory of the Maid of <hi>Orleans</hi> tell us, that in the
year 1430. <hi>John Magiſtri,</hi> Vice-Gerent of <hi>John

Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, it doth not appear, that
in <hi>France</hi> there have been any of this ſort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors,
whether it were, that the Popes did not
Judge them neceſſary in an Age, when Hereſies

zealous Man, would have <hi>Ignatius</hi> brought before
him, that he might himſelf judge of his Doctrine.
He caus'd him to be ſearch'd for, but <hi>Ignatius</hi> was
not to be found. At the ſame time that the three
young <hi>Spaniards</hi> were taken by force out of the
Hoſpital, he receiv'd Letters which told him, that
he who had robb'd him, was fall'n ſick at <hi>Rouen,</hi> in
his return to <hi>Spain.</hi> The Thief himſelf wrote, that
he was in great want in a Place where he had no
Acquaintance; and that without a ſpeedy Relief,
he muſt certainly periſh. <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not at all bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
upon what he had to do: At that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he departed, hoping to aſſiſt, at leaſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the ſick Man, if he could not otherwiſe help
him. His fervour made him go away without eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and perſwaded him, that he ſhould march more
nimbly, if he went bare-foot. He had gone but a
little way, but he found a ſadneſs at his Heart, and
a heavineſs all over him: However, he hal'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on to <hi>Argentevil,</hi> much aſham'd of his weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and reproching himſelf with want of Courage
at every ſtep that he made. When he had got to the
top of the Hill, his ſadneſs and wearineſs left him.
He was fill'd with ſpiritual Joys; and without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any Nouriſhment, he follow'd on his way with
ſo much vigour and cheerfulneſs, that he ſeem'd to
flie. He was only neceſſitated ſometimes to ſtop,
that he might ſigh at his eaſe, and give a little Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to thoſe Flames of Love, with which his
Heart did burn. At laſt he comes to <hi>Rouen,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65023:52"/>
found out the ſick Man, he embraces him, he
comforts him, he ſerves him, he begs Alms for him,
and puts him in a Condition of proſecuting his
Journey; he moreover procures a place for him in
a Merchants Ship, which was to go for <hi>Spain,</hi> and
gives him Letters of Recommendation for <hi>Barcelona.</hi>
Thus Saints revenge themſelves.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were doing, <hi>Ignatius</hi> receiv'd
News from one of his Friends at <hi>Paris,</hi> to whom he
had confided the deſign of his Journey, that the
Inquiſitor had cauſed ſearch to be made after him,
and that his abſence had render'd him more ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This made him with all diligence return back
to <hi>Paris,</hi> where in the firſt place he immediately
preſented himſelf before the Prior of the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans:</hi>
But the Prior having caus'd ſtrict enquiry to
be made, and not finding any thing amiſs in his
Doctrine or Converſation, diſmiſs'd him without
any reproof.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſuffer'd a great deal
in a Town where the Poor, that are Strangers,
have leſs ſhare in the Charities then the reſt, and
where <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not very well look'd upon,
tho' the Peace of <hi>Cambray</hi> had newly reconcil'd
the two Crowns. Wherefore his neceſſity oblig'd
him to follow the counſel of a holy Religious Man,
to go into <hi>Flanders</hi> during the vacancies of Study,
ſo to procure ſome Subſiſtance from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Merchants who Traded at <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt time that he made this Journey, paſſing
through <hi>Bruges,</hi> he ask'd an Alms of <hi>Ludovicus
Vives.</hi> This Learned Man being none of thoſe
who are puffed up with Science, and who had in
him an edifying Charity, made <hi>Ignatius</hi> eat with
him at his Table, upon no other Motive, but of
well treating a poor Man. But when he had heard
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65023:53"/>
him diſcourſe of Chriſtian Verities, and of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of an interior Life, he admir'd the Wiſdom
more then Natural which appear'd in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
and ſaid by a kind of Inſpiration, <hi>This man
is a Saint: I am miſtaken if one day he be not a
Founder of ſome Religious Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Supply out of <hi>Flanders</hi> gave him a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
for two years; after which time, not to
importune the ſame People again, he went to ſeek
Relief in <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Merchants who
reſided at <hi>London.</hi> But in the years following he
made no more of theſe Voyages: for, not only the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Merchants of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> upon the
knowledge of his Vertues, return'd him their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
to <hi>Paris,</hi> but he moreover receiv'd a new
Recruit from his Friends at <hi>Barcelona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Man of <hi>Biſcay</hi> reſiding at <hi>Paris,</hi> call'd <hi>John
Madera,</hi> diſcover'd, I know not by what means,
who <hi>Ignatius</hi> was, and was mightily ſcandaliz'd at
his proling and begging Life, which his poverty
reduc'd him to. Taking him one day apart, he
told him with freedom, that the Life he lead was a
diſhonor to the Illuſtrious Family of <hi>Loyola,</hi> and
that a Man well born, and of rich Parentage, could
not live upon begging Alms, without offending
God.</p>
               <p>Tho' <hi>Ignatius</hi> had no ſcruple upon it, yet he
thought it expedient to conſult the <hi>Sorbon</hi> upon the
Point, both for his own ſecurity, and chiefly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
<hi>Madera:</hi> He drew up the Caſe in theſe
terms; <hi>Whether a Gentleman, who having renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the World to follow</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>going about in
ſeveral Countries to beg Alms, doth any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Conſcience.</hi> The Doctors, to whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
the Caſe in Writing, all Anſwer'd, and put
their Hands to it, <hi>That there was neither ſin, nor the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65023:53"/>
ſhadow of a ſin in it.</hi> He ſhew'd to <hi>Madera</hi> the
Anſwer of the Doctors, not ſo much to juſtifie his
own Conduct, as to vindicate the honor of Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Poverty, which has been enobled by <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>Being thus at repoſe in the Matter of Subſiſtance,
as well as of Conſcience, he began now to advance
very faſt in Learning. After he had ſpent eighteen
months in the Colledge of <hi>Montaign,</hi> he made his
Courſe of Philoſophy in the Colledge of St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara.</hi>
His Study was now his principal Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and he apply'd himſelf to it the more, for
that he knew the deſign which God Almighty had
in it. It was upon this Conſideration, that during
the Courſe of his Philoſophy, he would not give the
Spiritual Exerciſes to ſeveral Perſons of the Town,
nor be engag'd in ſuch other Works of Charity,
which required much time, and would have diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Studies. He even abſtain'd to ſpeak of
heavenly things with his Chamber-Fellows in the
Hours of Study, becauſe he found, that if he enter'd
upon a Diſcourſe of Piety at thoſe Hours, he had
not the power of giving it over, nor of reaſſuming
his Notions of Study.</p>
               <p>But with all this, he no day omitted to take an
account of the ſecret motions of his Heart; And to
tame more and more his natural Inclinations, he
conſtantly made the particular Examen of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
according to the Method ſet down in the
Book of his Spiritual Exerciſes.</p>
               <p>Tho' the love of Science hindred him from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
himſelf outwardly,<note place="margin">He exhorts the Scholars to Nertue, And what happens to him.</note> and made him keep
thoſe Meaſures we now ſpoke of, yet upon good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
and at ſpare hours, he ceas'd not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Scholars with the Vanities of the World,
the Horror of Sin, and the Pains of Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:65023:54"/>
Some of them, touch'd with his Diſcourſes, left
their bad Haunts and ſinful Commerce, and enter'd
into ſo Chriſtian a Conduct, that they frequented
the Sacraments every <hi>Sunday</hi> and Feſtival Day.
It being the Cuſtom in the Colledge of St. <hi>Barbara,</hi>
to have Diſputations upon thoſe Days, for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of the young Students, the Maſter, call'd <hi>John
Pegna,</hi> ſoon found that his Scholars were more aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous
at the Church then in the School. He mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complain'd of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> and finding that Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did make Philoſophy to be every day more and
more neglected, he was ſofar tranſported, as to call
him the Diſturber of the Colledge. But that which
moſt provok'd him, was that many of his Scholars
left him, to make themſelves Religious Men.</p>
               <p>This Profeſſor, who found not his Account in
all this, and who lean'd a little more to his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
then to the ſpiritual good of his Scholars, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Juſtice of the Principal of the Colledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> declaring, that the Warning which
had been given him, ſerv'd to no purpoſe; that the
evil daily increas'd; and that the irregularity of
one Scholar, which broke all Order in the Colledge,
deſerv'd an exemplary puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Govea</hi> was Principal of St. <hi>Barbara:</hi> he
had a grudge againſt <hi>Ignatius</hi> upon the account of
the three <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and particularly for that <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
for whom he was moſt concern'd, had reſolv'd
to embrace Religious Poverty before the end of
his Studies. So that he eaſily ſuffer'd himſelf to be
prepoſeſs'd by <hi>Pegna,</hi> and without any great Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the matter, he reſolv'd to have <hi>Ignatius</hi>
publickly Corrected. They had a Cuſtom at that
time for the puniſhing ſcandalous Scholars, who
debauch'd their Companions, to aſſemble the whole
Colledge in the great Hall, at the ringing of a Bell;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65023:54"/>
The Regents came with Rods in their Hands, and
every one in their turn gave a Laſh to the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and this Correction was call'd <hi>The Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Deſign of <hi>Pegna</hi> was hereby to render <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
in a manner infamous, ſo to hinder young
Men, that were of any Quality, from having Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with him. The Buſineſs could not be
ſo ſecretly carry'd between the Profeſſor and the
Principal, but that <hi>Ignatius</hi> had intelligence of it
from ſome of his Friends in the Colledge. The
thought of ſo ſhameful a Puniſhment gave him at
firſt ſom horror; But he inſtantly ſuppreſs'd this
motion of Nature, and inſtead of diſappearing, as
his Friends advis'd him to do, or at leaſt not to come
that day to the Colledge, he came and openly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
himſelf, being glad of the occaſion of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a good Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this, he began to conſider, that the
young Men whom he had reclaim'd, might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
take ſcandal at his diſgrace, and thereupon
leave their holy Practices out of humane Reſpects;
that his words would no more have the efficacy of
perſwading them, and that they would avoid him
as a Corrupter of Youth; that altho' this Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might conduce to his own perfection, yet he
ought not to ſuffer any thing that might prejudice
the ſpiritual good af his Neighbour. In fine, his
zeal for Souls prevail'd above his love of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo that while all things were prepar'd for this
Execution, <hi>Ignatius</hi> went to the Principal, who was
not yet come out of his Chamber, and following
the inward Light which directed him, he modeſtly
declared the Reaſons of his Conduct to him, adding
withall, by a Sentiment of Chriſtian Generoſity,
that he was not afraid to ſuffer for the Cauſe of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that the Priſons of <hi>Alcala</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanca</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:65023:55"/>
had prepar'd him for the moſt ignominious
Affronts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Govea,</hi> without anſwering him any thing, took
him by the Hand, and lead him into the Hall, where
the whole Colledge was aſſembled: But when they
all look'd for the Sign of falling on, he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at the Feet of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> asking his pardon, for
too lightly believing falſe Reports. Then riſing up,
he publickly declar'd that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was a Saint, who
had no other aim but the good of Souls, and was
diſpos'd to ſuffer with joy the moſt infamous Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>So ſolemn a Reparation of Honor ſet all People
right, and made the Name of <hi>Ignatius</hi> famous.
The moſt conſiderable Perſons of the Univerſity
deſir'd to ſee him, and among the reſt a Doctor,
call'd <hi>Martial,</hi> who contracted a great Friendſhip
with him, and receiv'd from him ſuch lights in the
higheſt Myſteries of Religion, that ever after he
call'd him his Maſter; not doubting, but that a
Man ſo enlightned in the Matters of Faith, who
was yet no Divine by Profeſſion, had been inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in another School then that of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pegna</hi> himſelf, who had rais'd this Storm, ever
after lov'd <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and made it his buſineſs to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
and advance him in his Studies. To this end
he order'd a poor Youth of very good Parts, call'd
<hi>Peter Faber,</hi> to explicate and repeat to him the
Leſſons which had been taken up at School. This
<hi>Faber</hi> was a <hi>Savoyard,</hi> and liv'd in the Colledge of
St. <hi>Rarbara,</hi> with a young Gentleman of <hi>Navarr,</hi>
call'd <hi>Francis Xaverius,</hi> who was not very well
accommodated with Means, but almoſt as poor as
<hi>Faber</hi> himſelf. They had both ended their Courſe
of Philoſophy, and Lodg'd in the ſame Chamber.
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> for the convenience of his Studies, came in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65023:55"/>
to them; and by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Faber</hi> made ſuch
progreſs, that his Courſe being ended, which was
of Three years and a half, according to the Uſage
of that Time, he was judg'd, after a rigorous Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
fit to proceed Maſter of Arts, whereupon he
began his Divinity at the <hi>Dominicans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time his zeal for the Converſion of Souls
mightily increas'd upon him, and he clearly ſaw,
that God had appointed him to eſtabliſh a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Apoſtolical Men to that end, and that he
was to chuſe them himſelf out of the Univerſity of
<hi>Paris:</hi> for now he did not reckon upon thoſe whom
he had left at <hi>Barcelona.</hi> When he was robb'd by
his Chamber-Fellow, he let them know the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
which that Robbery had put him into, and
advis'd them to make an end of their Studies in
<hi>Spain:</hi> But he had quickly news of them, that they
had taken other Meaſures, and had no thoughts of
following him. Three of the four betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
again to the World, and ended miſerably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caliſte,</hi> after he had made the Voyage of the
<hi>Holy Land,</hi> went into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> to enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and dy'd a Beggar. <hi>Artiaga,</hi> who had got the
promiſe of a Biſhoprick in <hi>America,</hi> paſs'd the Seas,
and as ſoon as he was poſſeſs'd of his new Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for which he had travell'd ſo far, out of a
Principle of Avarice and Ambition, he caſually
poyſon'd himſelf. <hi>Cazeres</hi> returning to <hi>Segovia,</hi>
where he was born, and leading there a Libertine
life, at laſt took to the Trade of Soldiery, and
Serv'd up and down all <hi>Europe.</hi> He was taken for
a Spie in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>England;</hi> and once he was
ſo cruelly tortur'd, that he remain'd a lame Man
all the reſt of his days. The young <hi>Frenchman,</hi>
who had been Page to the Vice-Roy of <hi>Navarr,</hi>
had more Conduct, and better Fortune then the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65023:56"/>
reſt: He became a Religious Man, and peaceably
ended his days in a Cloyſter.</p>
               <p>The firſt Man upon whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> caſt his Eyes,<note place="margin">He makes choice of new Companions.</note>
to fill up the places of his unfaithful Companions,
was <hi>Peter Faber:</hi> He had excellent Qualities in
him, a good Nature, a ſolid Wit, a great deal of
Prudence and Learning, joyn'd with Humility and
Modeſty. He did not at firſt diſcover to him his
whole Deſign; he only directed him in the way
of Vertue, or rather ſeconded his Inclinations which
lead him to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faber,</hi> tho' perfectly chaſte, had yet very violent
Temptations, which were the more grievous to him,
in regard that from his Childhood he had made a
Vow of Chaſtity; ſo that the leaſt ſhadow of a ſin in
that kind caus'd a horror in him. He endeavour'd to
overcome theſe importunate Temptations by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Faſtings; but this did not make them ceaſe, or if
they diminiſhed a little, he had in the room of them
Sentiments of Vain-glory, as if by his own ſtrength
he had vanquiſh'd the Enemy. Whereupon a flood
of Scruples broke in upon him. Not knowing one
day on which ſide to turn himſelf, he made known
his Condition to his dear <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and told him in
confidence, that he had a great deſire to hide himſelf
in ſome wild Deſart, where he might ſee nothing to
make any impreſſion upon his Senſes, and where he
might Night and Day mortifie his Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> was too well read in Scruples, not to
diſcern, that ſo ſtrange a Reſolution was a new
Temptation. In order to cure <hi>Faber,</hi> and in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to gain him, he made him underſtand,
that the moſt ſolitary Places were not always San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries
againſt the Suggeſtions of the evil Spirit;
that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> had met with Idea's of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Ladies, even in the middle of the Deſarts of <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine;</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:65023:56"/>
And that in leaving the World, we are not
free from our greateſt Enemy, becauſe we always
carry our Selves about us: On the other ſide, that
the Macerations of the Body only, were not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Remedies againſt ſuch Temptations; And
that there had been many Men extenuated with
Faſtings, who ſtill were expos'd to thoſe carnal Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions.</p>
               <p>Next he apply'd himſelf to conduct his Friend
in the way which his practice of a Spiritual Life
made him judge moſt ſure and ſuitable for him.
He taught him therefore the uſe of his particular
Examen, ſo proper to extinguiſh thoſe corrupt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
which cauſe a Rebellion of the Fleſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Spirit. He preſcrib'd to him the Method
of interior acts of Vertue, which were directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to each particular Temptation. And this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
conſiſts in humbling our ſelves, for example,
in the proſpect of our Nothingneſs and of our Sins,
when a thought of Vain-glory aſſaults us. In the
matter of Scruples, he ſo well quieted the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of <hi>Faber,</hi> that he put him in a Condition of
making a General Confeſſion, without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
               <p>Having cur'd in this manner his ſpiritual Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
he form'd him by degrees to ſolid Vertue, by
his Diſcourſes and Leſſons upon Chriſtian Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
but he did it with ſome reſerves; for tho'
he had an earneſt deſire to make him his firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
yet he would not touch upon that Point till
after two years of trial; when one day entertaining
him with the things of God, he ſaid, (to ſound him)
that he had a deſire to go into the <hi>Levant,</hi> as ſoon
as he had ended his Divinity, and to employ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
wholly in the Converſion of Infidels. For <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
was not diſcourag'd by the bad ſucceſs of his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65023:57"/>
                  <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Voyage, and he ſtill imagin'd that God
would be ſerv'd by him in the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faber,</hi> who had been for ſome time deliberating
upon the Courſe of life he ſhould chuſe, preſently
took fire; and, as if the Holy Ghoſt had at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
determin'd his Choice, embracing <hi>Ignatius</hi>
with great affection, he told him, <hi>I will follow you,
and I will follow you even to death:</hi> Yet before he
did abſolutely engage himſelf, he reſolv'd to go into
his own Country. He was born in a Village call'd
<hi>Villaret,</hi> which belongs to the Dioceſs of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
When he was young, he was put to keep Sheep;
but his ſtrong inclination to learn the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue
made him leave thoſe Country Employments. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had Studied a while in a ſmall neighbouring
Town under a Maſter who was a very holy Man,
he was ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> by the counſel of <hi>Don George
Faber,</hi> his near Kinſman, and Prior of a Monaſtery
of <hi>Carthuſians</hi> in <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the abſence of <hi>Faber, Ignatius</hi> undertook
to gain <hi>Xaverius,</hi> who then taught Philoſophy.
<hi>Xaverius</hi> had a ſpritely Wit, an agreeable Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
a generous Soul, and a great purity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
but he was naturally vain, and lov'd oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Whareas the Quality of his Birth, his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Parts, and his progreſs in Learning, had rais'd
his Expectations in the World (notwithſtanding the
ill Condition of his impoveriſh'd Family) he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to advance himſelf by Eccleſiaſtical Preferments;
and according to the cuſtom of ambitious Men, who
feed themſelves with <hi>Chimera's,</hi> he fram'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the obtaining great Advantages, upon the leaſt
appearances. <hi>Ignatius</hi> believ'd, that a Genius of
this Character and Mould, being turn'd the right
way, might do great things in the Service of God,
but that it would be a very hard matter to bring
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65023:57"/>
him into a right temper to be wrought upon.</p>
               <p>In effect,<note place="margin">He Converts divers Perſons.</note> that innate Tumor of Vanity and
Pride, made uſeleſs all the firſt Eſſays, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes

of worldly Greatneſs. He would hardly give ear to
him, and inſtead of believing him, civilly raillied
him. This did not diſhearten <hi>Ignatius.</hi> To inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
himſelf by degrees into the good liking of our
young Profeſſor, he commended his natural Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
congratulated his Reputation, applauded in
publick the ingenuity of his Anſwers, and made it
his buſineſs to procure him Scholars.</p>
               <p>But the zeal of <hi>Ignatius</hi> was not confin'd within
the Walls of St. <hi>Barbara.</hi> He began to ſpeak
<hi>French,</hi> and was not now afraid that his Works of
Piety would injure his Studies. It is not to be told,
of how many Expedients he ſerv'd himſelf, for the
Converſion of Sinners. A Man of his Acquaintance
was deſperately in Love with a Woman, who liv'd
in a Village near <hi>Paris,</hi> with whom he held a ſinful
Commerce. <hi>Ignatius</hi> employ'd all Reaſons, both
Humane and Divine, to cure him of this ſhameful
Paſſion: But his Remonſtrances were loſt upon a
Man, abſorpt in carnal Pleaſures; and without the
ſtrange Remedy, which he invented, the Diſeaſe
had been incurable.</p>
               <p>Having learn'd out the way which this Perſon
us'd to paſs in going to this Woman, he waits for
him near a Pond ſide, which the Cold of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
had almoſt quite turn'd to Ice. As ſoon as he
perceiv'd him coming at a diſtance, he ſtript him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſtood up to the Neck in the Water; <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do you go, unhappy Wretch?</hi> (cry'd he, when
he ſaw him draw near) <hi>whither d'ye go? don't you
hear the Thunder breaking over your Head? don't
ye ſee the fiery Darts of Divine Juſtice ready to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65023:58"/>
ſtrike you? Well then,</hi> (he continu'd with a terrible
Voice) <hi>go, ſatisfie your brutal Paſſion, here will I
ſuffer for you, till the wrath of Heaven be appeas'd.</hi>
The laſcivious Man, frighted with theſe Words,
and at the ſame time confounded with the Charity
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whoſe Voice he knew, began to open
his Eyes, grew aſham'd of his ſin, and return'd
back, with the deſign of wholly changing his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſhew'd his Induſtry in another way, to
reduce a Religious Man, who was a Prieſt, but
who diſhonor'd his Character and Profeſſion by a
ſcandalous Life. He went to him upon a <hi>Sunday</hi>
Morning, deſiring him to hear his Confeſſion; and
under pretence of quieting the Scruples of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
he made a general Confeſſion to him. While
the Penitent accus'd himſelf of his ancient Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
with an extraordinary feeling and remorſe, the
Confeſſor began to feel an inward confuſion, upon
the account of his own diſſolute Life, which now
appear'd to him the more criminal, for that the
Sins of a Religious Man are of greater guilt then
thoſe of Men in the World.</p>
               <p>He alſo reproch'd to himſelf the hardneſs of his
Heart, when he ſaw <hi>Ignatius</hi> lament with ſo many
Tears his paſt Diſorders: In concluſion, his Heart
was mollifi'd, and before the Confeſſion was ended,
he found himſelf touch'd with a true Repentance.
He communicated to <hi>Ignatius</hi> the ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Soul, and ask'd his advice and help, to
raiſe him out of that diſmal Gulf into which his Sins
had caſt him. <hi>Ignatius</hi> preſcrib'd to this Religious
Man his Spiritual Exerciſes ſo ſucceſsfully, that in a
little time he put him into the way of Perfection.</p>
               <p>Going one day to ſee a certain Perſon upon a
buſineſs of Charity, he found him playing at Billi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards:
This was a Doctor of Divinity, eminent for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65023:58"/>
his Birth and for his Learning, regular enough in his
Manners, but not very devout, and more taken up
with ſecular Buſineſs then with his ſpiritual Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Doctor invited <hi>Ignatius</hi> to play: He
excus'd himſelf, becauſe he knew not the Game;
but the other ſtill preſſing him, and even his own
Vertue inclining him to a complacence, <hi>What ſhall
we play for?</hi> (ſaid he pleaſantly to the Doctor) <hi>a
poor Man as I am cannot play for Money, and there
is no pleaſure in playing for nothing; I will tell you
then</hi> (he added) <hi>what we muſt do: If I loſe, I will
Serve you for a whole Month, and do exactly all that
you ſhall command me; and if you loſe, you ſhall only
do one thing that I will ask of you.</hi> The Doctor
being in a merry humour, readily accepted the
Condition: They play'd, and <hi>Ignatius</hi> wan, he who
never before had play'd at Billiards. The Doctor
thinking there might be ſomething extraordinary
and myſterious in this matter, reſolv'd to obey
<hi>Ignatius.</hi> According to, and under his Direction,
he made the Spiritual Exerciſes a whole Month, and
ſo profited by them, that he became an Interior
Man.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe which <hi>Ignatius</hi> had brought into the
way of Devotion, one there was who fell back, and
was even upon the point of totally forgetting God:
The Saint ſpar'd no Advertiſements to reſettle him
in Vertue; but not being able to obtain any thing
upon him, he Faſted three whole days without eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or drinking, weeping at the foot of the Altars,
and praying without intermiſſion. His Faſting, his
Tears, and his Prayers obtain'd mercy from Heaven,
and reſtor'd the ſpirit of compunction and fervour
upon him for whom he did this Pennance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> alſo at this time attended to Works of
Charity in the Hoſpitals. One day he help'd to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65023:59"/>
dreſs the Sores of a poor Man, all cover'd with
Ulcers, whoſe Diſeaſe had ſomething of Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Whereas in the Dreſſing him he was forc'd
ſeveral times to touch the affected Parts, he was
ſeiz'd with an apprehenſion, that his Hands might
be infected; and this fear did ſomewhat cool his
charity for ſuch Employments: But upon reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he condemn'd himſelf for his weakneſs, and with
great remorſe he clapt his Hand into his Mouth,
ſaying, <hi>Since thou art ſo afraid for one part only,
the whole Body ſhall take its ſhare.</hi> From that time
forwards he vanquiſh'd his fear, and return'd to thoſe
Actions of Charity with greater fervour then ever.</p>
               <p>In this while <hi>Faber</hi> came back from <hi>Savoy,</hi> abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
diſpos'd to have no other Father but <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
having now diſengag'd himſelf from the Ties
of Fleſh and Blood. Tho' <hi>Ignatius</hi> found in him a
ripe Judgment, and ſolid Vertue, yet farther to trie
and fortifie him, he reſolv'd to give him the Spiritual
Exerciſes, before he would communicate to him his
whole purpoſe and deſign. <hi>Faber</hi> enter'd upon them
in the middle of Winter, not in the Colledge of
St. <hi>Barbara,</hi> but in a Houſe where <hi>Ignatius</hi> had
hir'd a Chamber for him, in the Street of St. <hi>James.</hi>
The fervour which our Recluſe felt in his Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
oblig'd him often to go down into a little
Court to take freſh Air: There he remain'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
whole Hours together, and not ſeldom a good
part of the Night. He Faſted ſix Days together,
without any Nouriſhment but the Holy Euchariſt,
and would have ſtill ſo continued, as long as his
ſtrength would have permitted, if <hi>Ignatius,</hi> ſeeing him
brought very low, had not commanded him to eat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faber,</hi> in the time of his retirement, clearly ſaw
that Heaven had ordain'd him to be a Companion
of <hi>Ignatius:</hi> So that when he came back to the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65023:59"/>
Colledge, he led ſo holy and ſo exemplary a Life,
that <hi>Ignatius</hi> made no farther difficulty of opening
fully to him his whole Deſign. He then declar'd
his Reſolution of gathering together Evangelical
Workmen to labour in the Vineyard, for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Souls to God; and from that time forwards
he look'd upon him as his beloved Son in <hi>Chriſt
Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now alſo had the Compliances of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and
the many good Offices he had done to <hi>Xaverius,</hi>
wrought a greater tractableneſs and condeſcenſion
in him. The great alteration in <hi>Faber</hi>'s way of
Living, did much run in his Head, and rais'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
in him upon his own State, which did not
a little ſtagger him. At the ſame time he came to
underſtand the Quality and Birth of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> after
which, his Diſcourſe appear'd more rational to him
then before, as if the Condition of the Perſon had
given weight and authority to his Words.</p>
               <p>Ignatius, <hi>who watch'd all the Motions of</hi> Xave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
<hi>ſeeing him one day diſpos'd to hearken to him,
did thus preſs him more cloſely then before;</hi> Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verius,
what will it avail a man to gain the whole
World, and to loſe his ſoul? If there were no other
Life but the preſent, and no other Glory but that of
the World, you would have reaſon to take care only
how to appear in it, and to raiſe your Fortunes among
Men; But if there be an Eternity, as undoubtedly
there is, with what ſenſe can you place all your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
here below, and prefer that which paſſes as a
Dream, to that which never will have end? Believe
me, (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) the vain Honors of the Earth are
too poor and inconſiderable for ſo generous a Heart
as yours: The Kingdom of Heaven is only worthy of
it. I do not pretend to exſtinguiſh that noble Ardor
which you have for Glory, nor to inſpire you with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65023:60"/>
mean thoughts: Be Ambitious, be Magnanimous;
but level your Ambition to a higher Mark, and ſhew
the greatneſs of your Soul, by deſpiſing all that is
beneath it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xaverius</hi> at that time was ſo diſpos'd, that he could
not hold out againſt the ſtrength and kindneſs of
theſe reaſons. After ſome little ſtrife within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
at laſt he yielded, and made himſelf a Diſciple
of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> The School he then taught would not
permit him to make the Spiritual Exerciſes before
the Vacation; but the pious Entertainments he had
with <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Faber,</hi> ſerv'd him inſtead of them.</p>
               <p>A certain <hi>Spaniard</hi> of mean Birth, and worſe
Life, call'd <hi>Michael Navarr,</hi> who pretended a
great concern for <hi>Xaverius,</hi> could not endure this
Change, which broke all their Commerce: His
rage fell upon the Author of it, and he believ'd,
that by the death of <hi>Ignatius</hi> he might again poſſeſs
the Friendſhip of <hi>Xaverius:</hi> He reſolv'd therefore
to kill him; and to that end he ſet up a Ladder one
Night to the Window of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Chamber: But
while he was getting up, he heard a threatning
Voice, which ſaid to him, <hi>Whither doſt thou go, thou
wretched Man? what doſt thou mean to do?</hi> At
which he retir'd trembling and agaſt, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
the horror of his Crime.</p>
               <p>The late conqueſt which <hi>Ignatius</hi> made with ſo
much induſtry and labour, was follow'd by another
of leſs difficulty. Two young Men of extraordinary
Parts, both at once came in unlook'd for to him;
one of them, call'd <hi>James Laynez,</hi> born at <hi>Almazan</hi>
in the Dioceſs of <hi>Siguents,</hi> was but One and twenty
years old: The other, call'd <hi>Alphonſo Salmeron,</hi>
born near <hi>Toledo,</hi> and only Eighteen years of age;
and yet he was Maſter of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Tongues. They had both ſtudied their Philoſophy
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65023:60"/>
at <hi>Alcala,</hi> where they had heard the Fame of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
as of a Saint. The deſire of ſeeing him, and
of putting themſelves under his Conduct, no leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
them to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> then their love and
deſign of Learning.</p>
               <p>It was an effect of Chance, or rather of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was the firſt Man they met,
entring into the Town. Such an Ayre of Prudence
and of Holineſs as appear'd in his Countenance, ſo
ſtruck <hi>Laynez,</hi> who had never ſeen him, that at
firſt ſight he doubted not but this was the Man.
They both made their application to him, and were
raviſh'd with Joy, to find in him the Perſon for
whoſe ſake they had taken ſo long a Journey. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
who appear'd as if he had gone purpoſely out
to meet them, embrac'd them as Angels ſent from
Heaven, and receiv'd them with great affection into
the number of his Diſciples. They paſs'd the trial
of the Spiritual Exerciſes, and came out of their
Retirement ſo inſpir'd with the zeal of Souls, that
they long'd for nothing more then to labour in an
Apoſtolick Life.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Spaniard,</hi> nam'd <hi>Nicholas Alphonſo,</hi> and
ſurnamed <hi>Bobadilla</hi> from the Place of his Birth,
which is a Village near <hi>Palenza</hi> in the Kingdom of
<hi>Leon,</hi> was call'd to the ſame Employment; but after
a different manner. This was a poor young Man,
of a very good Wit, who had taught Philoſophy at
<hi>Valladolid,</hi> before he came in to <hi>France.</hi> His Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
more then once made him have recourſe to
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> who had wherewithal to live decently,
upon the Charities which came in to him from all
Parts, and who thereby was in a Condition to aſſiſt
neceſſitous Scholars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> diſcover'd rare Talents in <hi>Bobadilla,</hi>
and remembring that the Poor had been choſen by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65023:61"/>
the Son of God to Preach his Goſpel, he believ'd
that this Perſon might prove a very fit Workman
for that purpoſe. He drew him by degrees with
ſpiritual Diſcourſes, which he entertain'd him with
before he gave him any Alms; and having try'd
him in a Retirement, as the others, he made him
his Fifth Companion.</p>
               <p>The Sixth was a <hi>Portugueze</hi> Gentleman, call'd
<hi>Simon Rodriguez d'Azevedo,</hi> a comely Perſon,
and very ingenious; God had prevented him from
his Infancy with the Gift of an Angelical Purity:
and his Father at his Death-bed looking upon him
in the Arms of his Mother, <hi>This Infant</hi> (he ſaid)
<hi>will one day do great Service to the Church of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rodriguez</hi> had Studied ſome Years at <hi>Paris,</hi> and
was maintain'd in his Studies by the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi>
He firſt knew <hi>Ignatius</hi> before <hi>Laynez, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron,</hi>
or <hi>Bobadilla,</hi> but after them he put himſelf
under his Direction. He had always in him a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
zeal for the Converſion of Infidels, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of making the Voyage of the <hi>Holy Land. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
obſerving theſe motions in him, ſo conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his own, without diſcovering himſelf wholly
to him, intended to gain him: But finding that his
Deſigns for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hinder'd him from aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelf with them, he then declar'd to him,
what he had done before to <hi>Faber,</hi> concerning his
own Reſolutions in that matter, and at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>Rodriguez</hi> deliver'd himſelf up intirely to <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' the choice of theſe ſix Perſons was very
happy, and promis'd ſomething extraordinary, yet
<hi>Ignatius</hi> judg'd, that unleſs they did all propoſe to
themſelves the ſame End, nothing would be done.
On the other ſide, remembring the inconſtancy of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65023:61"/>
his firſt Companions, and making reflection upon
the lightneſs and uncertainty of humane Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he perſwaded himſelf, that how good ſoever
the preſent Inclinations of his new Diſciples were,
it was expedient to fix them by ſome indiſpenſable
Engagements.</p>
               <p>To which end,<note place="margin">He propoſes to his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of gaining Souls.</note> calling them one day together,
after he had firſt caus'd each of them in particular
to Pray and to Faſt, and to beg of Almighty God
his Light to direct them in the way they ought to
ſerve him, he then told them, his deſign was to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the moſt perfect
manner he could: That he (God and Man) had no
other aim in the whole courſe of his Life, but the
Redemption of Mankind: That to follow him
cloſe, he purpos'd to labour for his own Perfection,
and for the ſaving his Neighbour's Soul; That he
was not ignorant, that Solitude had ſomething
in it more delightful, but that all things muſt yield
to the Intereſts of Gods Glory: That however, in
loſing a little repoſe, there was to be gain'd an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
of Graces and Merits; and that after all, it
did not import whether we gain'd or we loſt, ſo that
Souls might be ſav'd; that the Apoſtles had liv'd in
this ſort, after the Example of their Maſter; and
that, this kind of Life, was undoubtedly the moſt
noble, and the moſt perfect.</p>
               <p>He added, That having conſider'd all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in which the Glory of God, and the Salvation
of our Neighbour might be procur'd, he knew none
that offer'd a more plentiful Harveſt, and that was
more abandon'd, deſerving leaſt to be ſo, then
<hi>Paleſtine;</hi> that having been himſelf upon the Place,
he could not behold without extream grief, that
Land where our Saviour had Redeem'd Humane
Kind, lie under the Bondage of Infidels; that he was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65023:62"/>
inflam'd with a deſire of returning thither, and that
he ſhould eſteem himſelf moſt happy, in ſhedding
his Blood for Religion, in a Country which had
been Sanctified by that of God and Man. He
ſaid all this with ſuch a fervency of Spirit, that the
flame even appear'd in his Countenance. His whole
Diſcourſe he clos'd, with telling them, that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of a proper ſeaſon to execute this his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
he would at preſent oblige himſelf by a Vow,
to make the Voyage of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and wholly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all things of this World.</p>
               <p>Scarce had he ended ſpeaking, when they all, as
one Man, declar'd, that they had the ſame thoughts,
and the ſame intentions; whether it were, that his
Diſcourſe had wrought them to that unanimity, or
that they were all at the ſame time alike Inſpir'd by
God. After which, Recognizing him for their
Father, and cordially embracing one the other,
they interchangably promis'd never to ſeperate.</p>
               <p>Before this meeting broke up, a Queſtion was
mov'd, whether in caſe they could have no means to
paſs into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> they ſhould be obliged to
Preach the Goſpel in other parts. The matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Examin'd and Debated, they Agreed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Advice propos'd by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that when
they were at <hi>Venice,</hi> if they could not in a years time
procure any Accommodation for that Journey, they
ſhould then be releas'd from that part of their Vow,
which concern'd <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> but that, in lieu thereof,
they ſhould go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and offer their Services to
the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to be ſent into what part
of the World, he pleas'd.</p>
               <p>In the interim, for that the greateſt part of them
had not finiſhed their Divinity, <hi>Ignatius</hi> was of
opinion, that they ought not to ſhorten their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
being perſwaded, that great Enterprizes muſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65023:62"/>
be eſtabiſh't upon ſolid Foundations, and that
there would be temerity in taking upon them the
Evangelical Miniſtry, without an Exact knowledg
of the Myſteries, and Principles of Religion.</p>
               <p>And to the End, that all of them might adjuſt
their meaſures, he judged it expedient to prefix a
certain term for the ending of their Studies, which
was, from that preſent <hi>July</hi> of the year 1534, to
the Twenty fifth of <hi>January</hi> of the year 1537.
He Judg'd it alſo neceſſary, that their fervor might
not cool in them, to expedite the making of that Vow,
which they had agreed upon; for which doing, he
appointed the Fifteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons make their firſt Vow at <hi>Montmartyr.</hi>
                  </note> being
the Feaſt of the Aſſumption of our Bleſſed Lady: But,
that this might be perform'd with the Solemnity and
Devotion, which ſuch an Action requires, he choſe
<hi>Montmartyr</hi> for the place of the Ceremony. This
is a Monaſtery near <hi>Paris,</hi> upon a Hill, made Holy
by the Blood of Martyrs, whence it derives its Name.</p>
               <p>At the appointed time, and place, they all met.
<hi>Peter Faber,</hi> who ſince his Exerciſes had receiv'd
the order of Prieſthood, ſaid Maſs to them, and
gave them the Holy Communion in a Chappel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Ground, where it is believ'd, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of <hi>France,</hi> St. <hi>Denis</hi> was beheaded, which is
therefore call'd in Ancient Records the Chappel of
the Holy Martyr.</p>
               <p>After they had Receiv'd the Holy Communion,
they all made their Vows, with a loud and diſtinct
Voice, of undertaking, within the time preſcrib'd,
their Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the Converſion of
the Infidels in thoſe parts; of leaving all things,
which they poſſeſt in this World, excepting only,
what was neceſſary for their Journey thither; and,
in caſe they could not enter into, or remain in that
place, of going to caſt themſelves at the Feet of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65023:63"/>
the Pope, as it had been agreed upon. They farther
oblig'd themſelves to ask nothing for performing
their Functions; not only to the end of being more
free and diſentangled in their Miniſtry, but alſo to
ſtop the Mouths of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who reproach'd
Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters with enriching themſelves
by the Diſpenſation of Holy things.</p>
               <p>Nor was it without a particular deſign of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that among ſo many places of Piety, which
are in and about <hi>Paris,</hi> this new Patriark ſhould
chooſe <hi>Montmartyr,</hi> there to lay the Foundation of
his Order: Heaven, who Inſpir'd that thought into
him, made him without doubt, comprehend, that a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
which ſhould one day ſhed their Blood for the
Honor of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and was to be perſecuted in all
the different ways, in which the Church of God had
formerly been, ought to be born in the Sepulchre
of Martyrs.</p>
               <p>Nor was it again without Myſtery, that they
choſe the Feaſt of our Bleſſed Lady for ſo Important
an Action. It was neceſſary, that a Society wearing
the Name and Livery of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſhould be born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Auſpitious Patronage of <hi>Mary;</hi> and that
the Queen of Virgins ſhould be the Protectreſs of an
Order, which makes profeſſion of Angelical Purity.</p>
               <p>This buſineſs being over,<note place="margin">He applies himſelf to form his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> made it his
chiefeſt care to keep up the fervor of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and to maintain a perfect union among them.
He preſcrib'd to them all, the ſame practices of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety;
of making every day the ſame Meditations,
and of doing the ſame Penances; of having Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
together about Spiritual matters; of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
reading the Book of the Imitation of <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
of Examining their Conſcience often in the day;
of Confeſſing and Communicating every <hi>Sunday</hi>
and <hi>Holiday.</hi> But leaſt their Devotions and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65023:63"/>
ſhould interfere one with the other, to the
prejudice of either, he himſelf regulated the times
of each Imployment. And leaſt, notwithſtanding all
theſe precautions, their firſt fervor might inſenſibly
relax, he adviz'd himſelf of an expedient, altogether
new, which was to make them reiterate their Vows
every year, upon the ſame day of the Aſſumption, and
with the ſame Ceremony.</p>
               <p>He continually exhorted them to love one another,
and to live like Brothers; and becauſe they did not
lodge all in one Houſe, he obliged them often to
interviſit, and to walk abroad together, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to make little Repaſts, which might breed a
kindneſs and familiarity among them, conformably
to the Agapes, or Commeſſations of the Primitive
Chriſtians, in which he would ſometimes himſelf be
of the Party, when his other occaſions gave him
leave.</p>
               <p>There were many perſons at this time in <hi>Paris,</hi>
leaning towards the new ſprung Hereſies. <hi>Francis</hi>
the Firſt deſigning to re-eſtabliſh Learning in
<hi>France,</hi> invited Learned Men thither from all parts.
Some of them, coming out of <hi>Germany</hi> to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongues, inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> into many of the Univerſity: The
Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> who had been ſeduced by
<hi>Rouſſel,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oleron,</hi> a ſecret Partizan of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
favoured the <hi>Lutherans</hi> at Court, and gave
countenance to their Errors. On the other ſide, the
<hi>Sacramentarians,</hi> who alſo endeavour'd to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
themſelves into <hi>France,</hi> ſcatter'd about their
Libels in all places, againſt the holy Sacrament, and
ſuch was their Impudence, that they fixed ſome of
them upon the Gates of the <hi>Louvre: Calvin</hi> alſo,
being return'd from <hi>Bourges,</hi> where during his Study
of the Law, he had learnt of <hi>Volmar,</hi> a <hi>German,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:65023:64"/>
his Firſt Notions of a New Goſpel, had now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
and ſpread abroad the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi>
and of <hi>Zuinglius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho' the King were a great hater of Hereſie, as
he made it appear, in publickly proteſting, that
if his right Arm were infected with that Plague,
he would immediately cut it off, and alſo in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
to the Fire the Authors of Sacrilegious
Libels, yet thoſe Novelties ceaſed not to ſpread,
and to gain Ground by degrees.</p>
               <p>The principal employment of <hi>Ignatius</hi> at that
time was to confirm Catholicks in their Ancient
Belief, and to make Hereticks ſenſible of their
Errors. He caus'd many to return; who had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
their Faith, and he brought them to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor,
to be reconcil'd to the Church.</p>
               <p>But while <hi>Ignatius</hi> labour'd to ſtifle theſe growing
Errors, he did not forget his dear Sons in <hi>Chriſt
Jeſus;</hi> he offer'd them every day to God, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
himſelf in Sacrifice for them. He had a cuſtom
of retiring himſelf to the Church of our Lady in
the Fields, which is at preſent the Church of the
<hi>Carmelites,</hi> in the Suburbs of St. <hi>James;</hi> and
there he ſpent whole days in the contemplation of
Divine Myſteries. He alſo ſometimes withdrew
himſelf into a deep and dark Grotte at <hi>Montmartyr,</hi>
which repreſented to him his Cave of <hi>Manreza;</hi>
And in this place it was, that he uſed his ſevereſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities.</p>
               <p>Theſe new Rigors mightily abated his Natural
Strength, and augmented the pains of his Stomack,
which were now return'd upon him again; ſo that
he fell by degrees into ſo languiſhing a weakneſs,
as hinder'd him from applying himſelf to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
either of Piety or Study. His health not
having been very good, ſince his coming into
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65023:64"/>
                  <hi>France,</hi> and not having found any benefit from
the Remedies he uſed, the Phyſicians were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the Air of <hi>Paris</hi> was noxious to him, and
that nothing but his own Country Air would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him. His Companions, who had ſo much
the more care, and diſquiet for his weakneſs, by
how much the leſs he minded himſelf, joyned all
together in conjuring him to follow the advice of
the Phyſicians; and they importun'd him ſo much,
that notwithſtanding his great difficulty in being
ſeperated from them, he at laſt ſubmitted. But
there were other reaſons, beſides thoſe of his health,
which contributed to that Reſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xaverius, Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Laynez</hi> had ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
affairs, which oblig'd them to go into
<hi>Spain,</hi> before they could abſolutely renounce all
their Worldly goods. He was afraid leaſt this Voyage
might ſlacken their Vocation, and that, as fervent
as they were, they might want ſtrength to reſiſt the
Careſſes, and the Tears of their Families; So that,
not to expoſe the Vertue of theſe three young Men,
from whom he expected great matters, he thought
it expedient to charge himſelf with their ſeveral
Affairs, and to do their buſineſs for them. On the other
ſide, it occurr'd to him, that having in his youth
given ſo much bad example in his own Country, it
would be proper to repair that ſcandal, and ſhew,
at leaſt to his own Kindred, how much through the
mercy of God, he contemn'd Worldly Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>While he was making ready for his Journey,<note place="margin">He is again informed againſt to the Inquiſitor.</note> ſome
ill-minded people publiſh't about the Town, that
<hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Companions were ſuſpected of
being a little infected with the Novelties of <hi>Germany;</hi>
that ſo Auſtere a kind of Life in young Men, did
denote a headineſs and ſingularity, peculiar to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie;
and that ſo ſtrait a League between Perſons,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65023:65"/>
ſo different in condition, could not proceed, but
from a Spirit of Faction. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was advertis'd
of the rumour, which went about, and knew more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that they had accus'd him a freſh, before the
Inquiſitor, <hi>Matthew Ori.</hi> The principle Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
fell upon the Book of Exerciſes, where his
Enemies pretended the whole venom of his Doctrine
lay, and which they call'd the Myſterious Book.</p>
               <p>Judging, that a good Reputation was neceſſary
to the Preachers of the Goſpel, and fearing leaſt
his Departure ſhould be taken for a kind of Flight,
if he left <hi>France</hi> without juſtifying himſelf, he went
in perſon to the Inquiſitor, and pray'd him not only
to examine his cauſe, but to pronounce ſentence
therein in due form. <hi>When I was ſingle</hi> (ſaid he)
<hi>the words of Men did not affect me; but now that
I have Companions, and am call'd with them, to
Evangelical Functions, I muſt take care of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and my own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inquiſitor, who knew by former experience,
how much <hi>Ignatius</hi> abhor'd Hereſie, and not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing in his Conduct that was irregular, told
him, that he did not ſo much as give ear to his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers,
knowing that their Accuſations had neither
Foundation nor appearance. However he deſir'd
to ſee his Book of Exerciſes, not ſo much to examin
it, as to read it. He read it through, and was ſo
Edified with it, that he deſir'd <hi>Ignatius's</hi> leave to
tranſcribe it for his own particular profit, and for
the Spiritual advancement of thoſe Perſons, whom
he directed. <hi>Ignatius</hi> gave way to it; but not
contenting himſelf with theſe Teſtimonies, which
were not Authentick, and deſiring to leave a clear
Reputation behind him to his Diſciples, he appear'd
one day before the Inquiſitor, with a Notary, and
two or three Doctors of <hi>Sorbon.</hi> He pray'd him, in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65023:65"/>
their preſence to give him an Atteſtation in writing,
to certifie, that he had been unjuſtly Accuſed, and
that the Book of Exerciſes contain'd in it no unſound
Doctrine. The Inquiſitor made no difficulty of
doing what <hi>Ignatius</hi> deſir'd; But he ſet forth his
Atteſtation with ſo many Elogies and Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was much confounded at them.</p>
               <p>There being nothing now to hinder his Journey,
he took leave of his Companions,<note place="margin">He returns into his own Country.</note> after having more
then once Exhorted them to Conſtancy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to obey <hi>Peter Faber,</hi> who was the
only Prieſt among them, and whom they all honor'd
as their Senior. He Agreed with them before his
Departure, which was in the beginning of the
year 1535. that when he had recover'd his health,
and ended his buſineſs, he would go and ſtay for
them at <hi>Venice;</hi> and that they ſhould come away
upon the five and twentieth of <hi>January</hi> of the year
1537, and meet him there. His weakneſs would
not permit him to make his Journey a Foot. He
rod on a Horſe, which his Companions had bought
for him; but he had ſcarcely paſt the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi>
and breath'd the Air of <hi>Guypuſcoa,</hi> when he found
a great amendment in his health.</p>
               <p>Being at two Leagues diſtance from <hi>Loyola,</hi> he
was known by <hi>John d'Equibar,</hi> who had formerly
ſeen him there, and uſed to frequent the place:
This perſon arrived at the Inn a little after <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
and asked the Hoſt what company he had: He told
him that there was only one Horſe-man, not very
well accoutred, but who had a good Meen, and by
his Accent ſeem'd to be one of the Country, <hi>Equibar</hi>
had the Curioſity to ſee him: They told him that
the Cavalier was lockt up in his Chamber: He look'd
upon him through the chink of the Door, and ſaw
him at his Prayers upon his Knees, with a profound
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65023:66"/>
Recollection. He preſently began to call him to
mind, and having well viewed him, he no longer
doubted, but that he was the Brother of Don <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias,</hi>
Lord of <hi>Loyola:</hi> For altho' <hi>Ignatius</hi> were very
much changed by his Sickneſſes and Auſterities, yet
he had in his Countenance ſo particular an Aire, and
ſuch diſtinguiſhing Features, that he was eaſie to
be known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Equibar</hi> inſtantly took Horſe, to carry the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
new to <hi>Loyola.</hi> Don <hi>Garcias,</hi> who lately
had heard that his Brother <hi>Ignatius</hi> lead a very holy
Life in <hi>France,</hi> was over-joy'd at his coming. He
had thoughts of going forth to meet him with all
his Retinue, and to make him a magnificent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
but fearing, leaſt it might diſcompoſe
him, he was content to ſend him an Eccleſiaſtick of
great Reputation, to give him joy of his return.
<hi>Ignatius</hi> kindly receiv'd the Complement from his
Brother, but he ſent back the Church-man, who
would have waited upon him to <hi>Loyola;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of going thither, he took his way over the
Hills to the Town of <hi>Azpetia,</hi> which lies near it.
They of the Town had ſome incling of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s
coming, and all the Clergy was aſſembled to pay
him their Devoirs, and meet him with Ceremony:
So that, coming near the Town, he met this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
which waited for him. He got off, as well
as he could, from this Ceremonious Complement,
and retired to the <hi>Magdalen</hi> Hoſpital. His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and his Nephews, inſtantly came to him, and
conjur'd him to take his Lodging in the Caſtle,
telling him, it was his home, and that he ſhould be
Maſter there. He Anſwer'd them, that ſince he
had changed his courſe of Life, he did not reckon
upon having any home in this World, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of being Maſter, he only pretended to be a
Servant of the Poor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:65023:66"/>
Not being able to draw him out of the Hoſpital,<note place="margin">The Life which he leads in his own Country.</note>
they ſent him a very handſom Bed, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for his Table: But far from lying in it, he
lodged upon the Ground, till ſuch time, as they had
provided him one of the poor mens Beds: But to
conceal this from his Relations, he every Morning
tumbled and diſorder'd the fine Bed, of which he
made no other uſe. As for the diſhes of Meat, which
came every day from the Caſtle, he treated the poor
and the ſick perſons with them, without touching
them himſelf, and beg'd his own Bread about the
Town. Thus he lived amongſt the Poor, and like
a poor Man, thoſe three Months, he remain'd at
<hi>Azpetia,</hi> and in all that time, he went but once to ſee
his friends at <hi>Loyola,</hi> nor would he then have gone,
had it not been to ſatisfie the extream Importunity
of his Siſter in Law, who beg'd it of him upon her
Knees, for the Paſſion of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
During his Viſit, his whole Diſcourſe was of the
Vanity of the World, and of the blindneſs of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Men. Whereas he came thither in the Evening,
he lodged in the Caſtle; But he lay upon the Ground
all that part of the Night which he did not ſpend in
Prayer, and return'd to the Hoſpital very early in
the Morning.</p>
               <p>The ſight of thoſe Places, where he had lead a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
Life, Inſpired him with the thought of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his former Auſterities. He put on a ſharp hair
Shirt, girded himſelf with a great chain of Iron,
diſciplin'd himſelf every Night, ſo much the more
rigorouſly, by how much he found himſelf better
recover'd in his health: But withall this, not to be
unprofitable to his Neighbour, he every day taught
poor Children the Chriſtian Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Garcias,</hi> who was a wiſe Worldling, and
who look'd upon all theſe Actions of his Brother
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65023:67"/>
with Carnal Eyes, could not endure, that any of
the Name of <hi>Loyola,</hi> ſhould lead ſo abject a Life,
which he ſeveral times reproached to him. It
mightily diſguſted him; to ſee his Brother conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a Troop of little Children about him; and
once when <hi>Ignatius</hi> was going out to Catechiſe, to
diſſwade him from it, he told him, that no body
would come to hear him. <hi>If I have but one Child
at my Catechiſm</hi> (reply'd <hi>Ignatius) I ſhall be very
well content with my Auditory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this, he Preached every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and two
or three days in the Week. The Churches not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to contain the great Crouds which flock't
to him, he was forced to inſtruct them in the open
Fields. An infinite of People, from all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Towns came to hear him, and many got
upon the Trees to ſee him.</p>
               <p>The firſt time that he Preached, he told his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
that one of the reaſons, which mov'd him
to return into his Country, after an abſence of ſo
many years, was to quiet his Conſcience, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſin of his youth, and to make ſatisfaction to
an Inhabitant of thoſe parts. The Perſon, of whom
he ſpoke, was there preſent, and he had found him
out in the Croud. He told them therefore, that on
a certain time, breaking into a Garden with other
young Boys, as mad as himſelf, they ſtole and
ſpoiled a great quantity of Fruit; that a poor Man
was accus'd of the Theft, put in priſon for it, and
condemn'd to pay the Dammages. Then he rais'd
his Voice, ſaying, <hi>Be it known to all this Aſſembly,
that in ſatisfaction of the injuſtice, and the loſs,
which that Innocent man has ſuſtain'd, I do here
give and grant to him two Farms, which belong to
me.</hi> He then called him aloud by his Name, and
asked him Pardon before all the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:65023:67"/>
The words of a Preacher, whoſe Actions are of
this ſort, will eaſily perſwade. After he had Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt the Coſtly and Immodeſt Attire of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
it was preſently ſeen, that the richneſs of their
Habits, their undecent Faſhions, and naked throats
(ſo common in <hi>Spain</hi>) did all diſappear. The ſame
day, that he ſpoke againſt Play, all the Gameſters
threw away their Cards and Dice into the River, and
not a Man in the Town touched them any more in
three years time. When he Explicated the Ten
Commandements, during the ten Days between the
Aſcention and Pentecoſt, to prepare the Faithful
for receiving the Holy Ghoſt, he ſo well acquitted
himſelf, that in the Second day he quite aboliſh't,
and exterminated all Blaſphemies, and falſe Oaths,
which were too frequent in that Country. The
ſixth Day made a great Converſion of <hi>Curtezans,</hi>
of which ſome made long Pilgrimages a foot, and
the moſt famous among them, bound her ſelf to
ſerve the Sick in the Hoſpital, all the days of her
Life, ſo to Expiate their former ſins.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ignatius</hi> was in nothing more ſucceſsful, then
in reforming the manners of Church-men, who
thereabouts were great Libertines, and for the moſt
part lived in open Concubinage. He made them
change their Conduct, by laying open to them the
Holineſs of their Profeſſion; and to the end, that
temporal puniſhments might reſtrain them, if the
principles of Chriſtianity would not, he engaged
the Magiſtrates, and all Governors rigorouſly to
execute the Laws againſt Scandalous Prieſts.</p>
               <p>He did ſome other good works, which ſtill laſt,
and will laſt to the end of the World: For he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
a Confraternity of the Holy Sacrament,
for the relief of the Poor, that are not Beggars, and
he founded it with a part of his Eſtate, which he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65023:68"/>
had not yet renounounc'd; he Introduced the Cuſtom
of Praying at Mid-day for ſuch as were in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
ſin; and leaſt time ſhould wear out this practice,
he gave ſomething in perpetuity to the daily Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Bell for this Prayer. He eſtabliſh't alſo
the Prayer commonly called the <hi>Angelus Domini.</hi>
He renewed the ancient Cuſtom of the Country,
of Praying every Night for the Dead. He engaged
his own Family at <hi>Loyola,</hi> to give every <hi>Sunday,</hi>
in the great Church, twelve Loaves of Bread to ſo
many poor People, in Honor of the twelve Apoſtles;
In concluſion, he did what he pleas'd in <hi>Azpetia;</hi>
Theſe were the very Words of the Witneſſes, who
were heard after his Death, in the Proceſs of his
Canonization, and who had ſeen with their own
Eyes, what they depoſed.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Ignatius</hi> labour'd in this manner at home,<note place="margin">The number of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note>
his Companions follow'd their Studies at <hi>Paris,</hi>
without intermitting their Works of Piety. They
were all animated with his Spirit, and <hi>Faber,</hi> who
Govern'd in his abſence, had ſo well learn'd his
Maxims, that they all liv'd as if <hi>Ignatius</hi> himſelf had
Govern'd them.</p>
               <p>Their number was then increas'd by three other
Divines, whom <hi>Faber</hi> found to be very proper to
be their Fellow-Labourers, after a due trial made of
them in the Spiritual Exerciſes of their common
Father. The Firſt was <hi>Claude l' Jay,</hi> who was of
<hi>Aneſſy,</hi> a Man of an extraordinary Genius, and of
an excellent Diſpoſition. The Second <hi>John Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,</hi>
and the Third <hi>Paſquier Brouet,</hi> both of them
Learned Men, and both <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> one of the
Dioceſs of <hi>Ambrun,</hi> and the other of <hi>Amiens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the firſt Fathers of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
were Ten in number: Upon which Subject a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Hugonot</hi> Writer ſtrains hard for a Conceit, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65023:68"/>
us (a little nonſenſically) that among the <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreans</hi>
the number of Ten is ſurnamed <hi>Atlas,</hi>
and that it is not without Myſtery, that Ten Men
made up the Foundation of a Society, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Atlas</hi> doth the Heavens.</p>
               <p>Theſe three laſt made their firſt Vow at <hi>Mont
martyr,</hi> when the other ſix renew'd theirs the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time; And they were all ſo united together,
that notwithſtanding the difference of Nation and
of Humor, they all ſeem'd to have but one Heart
and one Soul.</p>
               <p>Such happy News much comforted <hi>Ignatius</hi> in
the abſence of his beloved Diſciples:<note place="margin">He cures the Sick.</note> But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
which he had gain'd in <hi>Biſcay</hi> did ſenſibly
mortifie him; and this was that which made him
reſolve to haſten his Journey to <hi>Venice.</hi> He paſs'd
every where for a Saint, and the People believ'd he
could do Miracles: Whereupon they brought to him
a Woman who had been four years poſſeſs'd, and
had all the ſigns in her of a true Poſſeſſion. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her to the Exorciſms of the Church, ſaying
that he was no Prieſt, and that a Sinner, like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
had no command over the Devils. But they
ſtill preſs'd him at leaſt to make the Sign of the
<hi>Croſs</hi> over the poſſeſs'd Perſon, which he could not
refuſe them to do, and immediately ſhe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</p>
               <p>Some few days after they brought him a Maid
whom the People would needs have to be alſo Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd;
ſhe was very raging, with violent Contor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
over all her Body; <hi>Ignatius,</hi> when he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
her, ſaid ſhe was not Poſſeſs'd, and that thoſe
extraordinary Motions proceeded from a natural
Cauſe; and that if the Devil had any part in it,
'twas only in troubling the Imagination of the ſick
Perſon. He made the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> upon her,
and her fury preſently ceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:65023:69"/>
There was in the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
a poor Man call'd <hi>Baſtida,</hi> who for many years
had the Falling-ſickneſs: He had once a long and
violent Fit in the preſence of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> the Saint
touch'd with Compaſſion, lifted his Eyes to Heaven,
made an ardent Prayer for the poor Man, and laid his
Hand upon his Head; <hi>Baſtida</hi> inſtantly recover'd
of his Fit, and was ſo perfectly cur'd of his Diſeaſe,
that it never came more.</p>
               <p>But God, who gives his Servants the power of
curing Diſeaſes, for the Glory of his Name, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them at the ſame time to be diſeaſed themſelves;
ſo to humble them, and to try their patience. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
accordingly had then a great Sickneſs: He
would not be carry'd to <hi>Loyola;</hi> but he could not
hinder his Kindreds taking care of him. Two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of Quality, his Couſin-germans, one call'd
<hi>Maria Doriola,</hi> and the other <hi>Simona d' Alzaga,</hi>
tended him, and continually watch'd with him.</p>
               <p>One Night, when they were retir'd into the next
Chamber to take a little reſt, they heard him ſigh
in an extraordinary manner. Going in to him, they
found him with his Hands joyn'd, his Eyes lifted
to Heaven, his Countenance otherwiſe enflam'd then
with his Feaver; for it ſhin'd with ſuch a light,
that it dazled their Eyes. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was in Confuſion
to be ſo found by them, and he earneſtly pray'd his
two Kinſwomen to keep it ſecret.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he was cur'd, he parted from <hi>Azpetia,</hi>
with the great regret of his Family, and of all the
Inhabitants. He accepted of a Horſe, of Money,
and of Servants, to content his Brother, and to part
fairly with him; but he had no ſooner got to the
Confines of <hi>Biſcay</hi> and <hi>Navarr,</hi> when he rid himſelf
of his Attendance. He went by the Way of <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelona</hi>
to the Caſtle of <hi>Xavier,</hi> to diſpatch the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65023:69"/>
of his Diſciple <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> and afteward to
<hi>Almazon,</hi> and to <hi>Toledo,</hi> for the Concerns of <hi>Salme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
and <hi>Laynez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having diſpatch'd all theſe Affairs,<note place="margin">What paſs'd betwixt <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſian.</hi>
                  </note> he took the
Way of <hi>Valentia,</hi> where he hop'd to find the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of a Ship for <hi>Venice:</hi> While he was wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for it, he went to Viſit <hi>Don John de Caſtro</hi> at
<hi>Segorbe,</hi> who had lately made himſelf a <hi>Carthuſian</hi>
in the Charter-Houſe of <hi>Val-Chriſt,</hi> and had not yet
ended his Noviceſhip. This was one of the three
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentlemen, who at <hi>Paris</hi> being mov'd with
the Diſcourſes and Example of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> retir'd
themſelves into the Hoſpital of St. <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Novice having a very mature Judgment,
and being moreover a great Servant of God, <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
told him in confidence his moſt ſecret thoughts;
That he intended to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> in order to make
a Voyage to the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> and that there, or
elſewhere, he intended to Inſtitute a Society, whoſe
only Aim and Buſineſs ſhould be, to perfect their
own, and to ſave their Neighbours Souls. He ſet
down to him the Scheme and Drift of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
in the manner he had then fram'd it within
himſelf, according to the preſent light he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from God. He farther told him what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
he had choſen for executing this Deſign, a
<hi>Xaverius,</hi> a <hi>Laynez,</hi> and others not unknown to
<hi>Caſtro;</hi> and then he asked his counſel in that
important Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſto</hi> did not immediately tell him his judgment
upon it; but having ſpent the Night following
wholly in Prayer, he came out of his Cell at Break-of-day
with a tranſport of Joy, which he could not
moderate, and went in great haſte to tell <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
that his Undertaking was the Work of God, and
that it ſhould ſucceed in ſpite of all the Contradictions
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65023:70"/>
of Men, and that all Chriſtendom ſhould receive
great Advantages by it: <hi>And</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to let you
ſee that I do not ſpeak at random, I offer my ſelf to
be your Companion and Diſciple; for being only a
Novice, I am not yet under any Engagement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> receiv'd this Teſtimony of <hi>Caſtro</hi> as an
Oracle of the Holy Ghoſt; but far from conſenting
that this Recluſe ſhould leave the Solitude to which
God had call'd him, he exhorted him to perſiſt in ſo
holy a Vocation as his was, and made him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that a contemplative Life was his Lot. The
thought which this Novice had of changing his
State, lets us ſee, that Perſons inſpir'd from Heaven
in the behalf of others, are not always ſo for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and that God made uſe of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle
<hi>Caſtro,</hi> as he did of <hi>Caſtro</hi> to fortifie <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
The Records of the Charter-Houſe of <hi>Val-Chriſt</hi>
mention this whole Paſſage between theſe two;
of which there are beſides Juridical Atteſtations of
<hi>Don Antonio Martin d' Atarriba,</hi> and of <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea
Soler,</hi> both <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> who depoſed that they
heard this Tranſaction from <hi>Caſtro</hi>'s own Mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> more ſettled then ever in his Deſign,<note place="margin">He Embarques for <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </note> went
immediately to <hi>Valentia,</hi> and there went on Board a
Merchants Ship, which parted for <hi>Genoua.</hi> The
famous Pirate <hi>Barbaroſſa,</hi> who had driven <hi>Mulyaſſen</hi>
out of the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis,</hi> was abroad upon the
<hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea with a Fleet of an hundred Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
pillaging the Coaſts, ſeizing all Ships, and every
where making Slaves: But ſo it happens ſometimes,
that one Evil is the cure of another.</p>
               <p>The moſt furious Tempeſt that perhaps ever was
known upon the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> brought this poor
Merchants Ship to the laſt extremity: The Rudder
was carried away with the ſtreſs of the Weather,
the Maſts were broken, the Pilot and Mariners in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65023:70"/>
deſpair. Among the Cries of ſo many People, who
look'd for nothing but preſent death, <hi>Ignatius</hi> was
the only Perſon not diſcompos'd, and ſo acquieſcing
in the Orders of Heaven, that he had not the leaſt
trouble upon him, to ſee all his holy Projects over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown:
His only ſenſible grief was for not having
correſponded with the Graces of Heaven with
that fidelity he ought. But when nothing but Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
was look'd for, the Wind, by a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Providence, carry'd on the Ship to the Port of
<hi>Genoua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was not the only Danger which <hi>Ignatius</hi>
paſs'd through in this Journey: Going from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi>
to <hi>Bologna,</hi> he loſt his Way upon the <hi>Apennine.</hi>
After having a great while wander'd through dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
Paſſages, he came at laſt to a Way wide and
even at the entring, but growing by degrees nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and craggy, which brought him in the end to
a ſteep and upright Mountain, which had at the
bottom a great Torrent of Water guſhing out of
the Rocks.</p>
               <p>Being inſenſibly engag'd into ſo dangerous a
Paſſage, he ſtopt with ſome terror at the ſight of
Precipices, which were on all ſides of him; but
after he had implor'd the ſuccor of Heaven, he
took heart again, and not knowing how to go back,
he reſolv'd to adventure forwards: Wherefore he
crawl'd up along the Rock, ſometimes hanging
upon the Shrubs, ſometimes upon the Stones, that
ſtood out, always in hazard of rowling down to
the Bottom of the Precipice which he ſaw under
him. This adventure was the moſt perilous of his
whole Life, and he was us'd to ſay, that without
a kind of Miracle, he could never have come out
of ſo great a danger.</p>
               <p>The Rains then falling, did almoſt drown the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65023:71"/>
ways, by which he ſo much ſuffer'd, that he came
very ſick to <hi>Bologna:</hi> Entring into that Town, as he
paſt over a narrow Bridg, his foot ſlipt, and he fell
into a Ditch full of Mire, out of which he came
forth ſo cover'd with dirt, that he was a frightful
ſpectacle. However, he was not nice to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
about the Town, as dirty as he was, and to
beg Alms: But whether it were, that his figure
made him leſs acceptable, or that Charity was very
cold, he could not all that day get one piece of
Bread, and he muſt have ſtarv'd, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
who in that Town have a rich Colledg, had not
taken pity of him. As ſoon as he had a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
his ſtrength, he went forwards on his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and came to <hi>Venice</hi> about the end of the
year 1535.</p>
               <p>From his firſt coming thither, he employed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Service of his Neighbour, following the
Spirit of his Vocation.<note place="margin">He is employ'd in the Service of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> Two Brothers, Gentlemen
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the one called <hi>Stephen,</hi> the other
<hi>James d'Eguia,</hi> were newly return'd from the <hi>Holy
Land.</hi> They both had ſentiments of Piety, and
ſome thought of quitting the World, but were held
back by other humane motives. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who
had ſeen them at <hi>Alcala,</hi> engaged them to make
the Spiritual Exerciſes, that ſo they might be well
directed in chuſing their courſe of Life. They
found, during their retirement, that God had deſign'd
them one day to be the Children of <hi>Ignatius:</hi> They
promis'd to follow in due time the Grace which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them, and they were ſo true to their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that as ſoon as the Society of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was form'd,
they both enter'd into it.</p>
               <p>There was in the Town another <hi>Spaniard</hi> of
<hi>Malaga,</hi> of an Ancient Family, that came out of
<hi>Cordova,</hi> and was called <hi>James Hozez:</hi> He was
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65023:71"/>
Batchelor of Divinity, a Man of good Life, and
a declared enemy of the Novelties of <hi>Germany.</hi> The
deſire of his Spiritual profit made him ſeek out <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
who had been repreſented to him, as a great
Maſter in the Science of the Saints: But having learnt
that he had been ſuſpected of Hereſie, in <hi>Spain</hi> and
in <hi>France,</hi> he durſt not wholly rely upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
However he one day, reſolv'd to begin the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Exerciſes, firſt Arming himſelf with preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
againſt any Poyſon, that he might find in them.
He took therefore along with him an Abridgment of
the Councels, ſome of the Holy Fathers, and a great
many Books of Divinity, to examin the Doctrine
of the Exerciſes by ſolid and certain Rules.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had he ended the firſt Meditations, but
he found a Character of Truth, where he was afraid
he ſhould have met Errors. Going forwards, he
clearly ſaw that nothing was more Orthodox then
the Faith of <hi>Ignatius:</hi> But that, which moſt of all
convinced him, was what <hi>Ignatius</hi> himſelf declared
to him of his Sentiments about Religion: That
true Chriſtians ought to ſubmit themſelves to the
deciſions of the Church, with the ſimplicity of an
Infant; that in order to this, we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Spirit of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
doth animate his Spouſe the Church, and that the
ſame God, who in former times gave the Precepts
of the Decalogue, to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> doth govern at
this day the Society of the Faithful: That far from
diſapproving the Cuſtoms in ure among Catholicks,
we ought always to be provided with reaſons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them againſt Libertines, and Hereticks; that
we muſt receive with profound ſubmiſſion the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Eccleſiaſtical Superiors; and, when their
lives ſhould not be ſo blameleſs, as they ought to be,
to abſtain from ſpeaking againſt them, becauſe ſuch
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65023:72"/>
Invectives always cauſe Scandal, and make the
Sheep revolt from their Paſtors; that we cannot too
much eſteem the Science of Theology, whether
Scholaſtick, or Poſitive; That the chiefeſt aim of
the Ancient Fathers, was to excite Mens hearts to
the love of God, but that St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the other
Doctors of the laſt Ages propos'd to themſelves, to
reduce the Principles of Faith, into an exact Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
for more ſurely confuting Hereſies; that we
cannot be too wary in ſpeaking of Prediſtination,
and of Grace; and that Preachers ought to be very
circumſpect, when they treat of thoſe Myſteries,
that they may not ſeem to take away the Power of
our free will, and the Merit of good works, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting
Predeſtination, and Grace; nor on the other
ſide, to undervalue Predeſtination and Grace, in
raiſing the Power of our will, and the Merit of our
works; that often by exagerating the Excellency
of Faith, without any diſtinction or farther expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
the People are made prone to neglect the
practice of Virtues. In concluſion, that tho' it be
the part of a good Chriſtian, to ſerve God out of
a Principle of pure love, we muſt not neglect to
recommend the fear of God, nor that only, which
we call Filial, which is moſt Holy, but that alſo,
which is called Servile, becauſe it may help a ſinner
more readily to get out of his ſinful ſtate, and may
diſpoſe him to that other fear, which unites the Soul
with God.</p>
               <p>All theſe Articles and Rules of an Orthodox Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
as the Saint calls them in his Book of Exerciſes,
into which he has inſerted them, made <hi>Hozez</hi> aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the diſtruſt he had concerning the Doctrine
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to whom he made a Confeſſion of it,
ſhewing him the Books he had Arm'd himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
by way of prevention, and now without any
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65023:72"/>
fear, he ſo adheared to his Director, that he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the ſame form of life, with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and
his Companions.</p>
               <p>Many Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> did put themſelves under
the Direction of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as the three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
had done, and among the reſt, <hi>Peter Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi>
Adminiſtrator of the Hoſpital of St. <hi>John</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Batto.</hi> He found great
advantage for a Spiritual life in the Exerciſes, and
if afterwards he did not embrace the inſtitute of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
as ſome of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility did, it
was only, that he might be the Protector, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the whole Order.</p>
               <p>The World,<note place="margin">He is decryed in <hi>Venice,</hi> and afterwards cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up again.</note> which commonly miſconſters, what
it doth not underſtand, could not look upon the good
Actions of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> without Judging ill of them;
They imagin'd him, to be an Heretick in <hi>Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,</hi>
and that, after he had infected <hi>Spain,</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> he was now come to do the ſame in <hi>Italy,</hi>
ſome were ſo mad, as to ſay, that he had a <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,</hi>
which informed him of every thing, and that
when he was diſcover'd in one place, he ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in another, before Juſtice could take hold of
him.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Ignatius</hi> heard what Rumors were
ſpread of him, he apply'd himſelf to <hi>Jerome Veralli,
Nuncius</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, with the Republick,
humbly to requeſt him, that if according to theſe
Reports, he were culpable, his Proceſs might be
made. The <hi>Nuncius,</hi> having well examin'd the
matter with <hi>Gaſpar de Doctis</hi> his Aſſeſſor, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no ſufficient ground for theſe Calumnies, he
paſt a Juridical ſentence in favor of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eſteem, which <hi>John Peter Caraffa</hi> ſhewed
for <hi>Ignatius,</hi> did not a little ſerve to diſſipate theſe
Slanders. This is that <hi>Caraffa,</hi> who was exalted
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65023:73"/>
to the Soveraign Pontificate under the name of <hi>Paul</hi>
the Fourth, and who before that, leaving the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick
of <hi>Theate,</hi> to make himſelf a Colleague
of <hi>Caietan Thyene,</hi> had Founded the Order of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Clericks, call'd <hi>Theatins,</hi> from the name of
the Arch-biſhoprick, which by a Spirit of Humility
and Penance he had quitted. He was at that time
in <hi>Venice,</hi> and lived the life of an exact Religious
man. The great correſpondence with <hi>Ignatius</hi>
held with <hi>Caraffa,</hi> made the World believe, that he
was become a Diſciple of <hi>Caraffa,</hi> and thence cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it came, that the People in thoſe times called
<hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Companions, <hi>Theatins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this while, the War was kindled more fircely
then ever, between <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Charles</hi> the
Fifth, by the Death of <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain;</hi>
both theſe Princes had pretentions on that
Dutchy. The Emperor, perſwaded that in theſe
occaſions, dilligence and ſtrength doth beſt decide
matter of right, immediately took up Arms, and
made an irruption into <hi>Provence,</hi> with the choice of
his Troops.</p>
               <p>Upon the Firſt rumor of the War,<note place="margin">His compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons go to meet him at <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </note> the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who were not to have departed
from <hi>Paris,</hi> till the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> of the year
enſuing, according to the firſt agreement, reſolv'd
to Anticipate the time of their Journey, and to go
out of the Kingdom, before the Paſſages upon the
Frontiers were ſtopt. They ſet forth the <hi>15th.</hi> of
<hi>November</hi> of the year 1536; with no other Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
but a ſtaff in their Hands, and a little Valice
on their Backs, in which they carried their Writings.
To avoid <hi>Provence,</hi> they went by the way of
<hi>Lorrain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Troop marched with great Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
and modeſty, ſometimes Praying, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65023:73"/>
Diſcourſing of Heavenly things, other while
ſinging Pſalms, or Church Hymns. <hi>Faber, Le
Gay,</hi> and <hi>Brouet,</hi> who were Prieſts, every day ſaid
Maſs; the others alſo Communicated as often, to
fortifie themſelves with the Bread of Life, againſt
all the hazards, and difficulties of their Journey,
in ſo bad a ſeaſon. They paſt through <hi>Germany</hi>
with their Beads about their Necks, as it were to
make a publick profeſſion of their Faith in thoſe
places, where Hereſie began to be Triumphant.</p>
               <p>Coming one Night to a Burrough, near <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
where they were all Hereticks, the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
an Apoſtate Prieſt, and who before had been
Curat of the Place, followed them into the Inn
where they went to lodge: They having a plain
and a ſimple outſide, he thought he might deal very
well with them, by way of diſputation, and gain
a ſignal Victory over nine Papiſts at once. He
began with them by laughing at their Beads, and
then fell to Argumentation about Religion. As
weary, as they were they would not decline the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement;
and <hi>Laynez</hi> was the perſon, who firſt
undertook him; He diſputed ſo vigorouſly and ſo
ſolidly, and the Miniſter was ſo non-plus'd, that he
cryed, <hi>Gentlemen, let us go to Supper, and let us
Sup altogether, and afterwards we ſhall be better able
to Diſpute.</hi> They conſented to renew the Diſpute,
but they would not eat with the Heretick. They
made a ſober Meal by themſelves according
to their cuſtom, while the <hi>Dutchman,</hi> in another
Room, eat and drank at his own rate. After Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
they reſumed the debate, and now a great many
People were got together to hear the Diſputation:
But the Miniſter, who had drunk a little too plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
at Supper, not being able to Anſwer any one
Argument of his Adverſaries, fell a ſwearing in his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65023:74"/>
own Tongue, and in great fury went out of the
Inn.</p>
               <p>The next Morning they followed on their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where the Hereſie of <hi>Luther</hi> had
been receiv'd, both by the Magiſtrates, and the
People. Coming near the Town, hard by the
Hoſpital for the infected of the Plague, they ſaw
an old Woman, who ſeemed raviſht with Joy, at
the ſight of them and their Beads, and lifting up her
hands to Heaven, ſhe made the ſign of the Croſs.
The <hi>Lutherans</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> could not prevail upon
her, neither by fair means, nor by foul, to change
her Religion; whereupon they baniſht her out of
the Town. The good old Creature often kiſs'd
their Beads, and knowing no Language but her own,
ſhe made ſigns to them to ſtay a little while for her,
in the place where they were. She preſently went into
the Hoſpital, where her aboad was, and returning
again, ſhe brought with her a great many pieces of
broken Crucifixes, intimating to them, that thoſe
were the greateſt Treaſure ſhe had. To make a
kind of Reparation to the Honor of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
ſo ill treated in Effigies by the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> they
proſtrated themſelves upon the Snow, which all
covered the Ground, and devoutly kiſſing thoſe
broken Crucifixes, they ador'd the Crucified.</p>
               <p>After which the Woman, returning back to
the Hoſpital, and followed by our Catholick
Troop, told thoſe, whom ſhe met; <hi>Look ye, you
miſcreants, what you ſay is not true, that all the
World believes in</hi> Luther, <hi>and that the</hi> Roman <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is quite extinct, Pray, whence came theſe Men
with their Beads? Are not they of this World?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nine Travellers paſs'd out of <hi>Germany,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the great rigor of the Winter, and
after much hardſhip endured, with their earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

they were preſented to the Pope by <hi>Peter Ortiz,</hi>
that <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Doctor, who had received in <hi>France</hi>
ill Impreſſions concerning <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,

reſt, whom he had ſeen at <hi>Paris;</hi> And did them
all ſorts of good Offices, in conſideration of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
He told the Pope, that they were very Learned
men, diſengaged from the World, lovers of Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
very zealous for the Converſion of Souls, and
that the only motive of Preaching the Goſpel to
Infidels, made them beg leave, to paſs into the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, who loved Men of Learning,
and had a cuſtom in time of his Meals, to have the
choiceſt Queſtions both of Humane, and Divine
Sciences, Treated and Diſcourſed before him, had a
mind to ſee theſe Perſons, whom <hi>Ortiz</hi> had ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
and bad the Doctor bring them to him the
day following. He propos'd to them himſelf a point
of Divinity, upon which they ſpoke ſo Learnedly,
and with ſo much reſpect and modeſtly, that Charm'd
with their Diſcourſes, he roſe from his Chair, and
ſaid with a loud voice, <hi>We are Extreamly pleas'd
to ſee ſo much Erudition, and ſo much modeſty joyn'd
together.</hi> He ask'd them, what it was they deſired
of him, and being told by them, that they only
requeſted, what <hi>Otiz</hi> had already ſaid, He gave
them his Benediction, with all the Marks of a Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
kindneſs; telling them withall, that he did not
believe, they would be able to make the Voyage of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by reaſon of the League which was upon
making between the Emperor, the Republick of
<hi>Venice,</hi> and the Holy See, againſt the Turk, and
which would break out very ſuddenly.</p>
               <p>He gave them Sixty crowns of Gold by the hands
of <hi>Ortiz,</hi> and granted to thoſe, who were not yet
Prieſts, permiſſion to receive Holy Orders from any
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65023:75"/>
Biſhop whatſoever. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was comprehended
in this conceſſion, upon the Teſtimony, which
<hi>Ortiz</hi> gave his <hi>Holineſs</hi> concerning him, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Anthony Pucci</hi> Iſſued forth a Diſpenſation out
of the <hi>Penitentiaria,</hi> for <hi>Alphonſo Salmeron,</hi> that he
might receive the Order of Prieſthood, with the

               <p>After they had viſited the Principal Churches of
<hi>Rome,</hi> they took their way back again to <hi>Venice,</hi>
living upon Alms, and keeping for their Paleſtine
Journey the ſixty Crowns of the <hi>Pope,</hi> with an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and forty more which other Charitable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
had beſtowed upon them. Being come thither
they made the Vow of Poverty, and of perpetual
Chaſtity, in the preſence of the <hi>Nuncius Veralli,</hi>
and fell to their works of Charity in the Hoſpitals,
which <hi>Ignatius</hi> had continued in their abſence.</p>
               <p>Upon the Nativity of St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt,<note place="margin">He receives the Order of Prieſthood with his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> they were
Ordain'd Prieſts by <hi>Vincent Niguſanti,</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Arbe,</hi> and during the Ceremony, they had ſuch
moving ſentiments of Religion and Devotion, that
the Biſhop even with Tears proteſted, that he had
never been ſo Edified in all the Ordinations, he had
ever made.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the League was concluded; and
the <hi>Venetians</hi> having declared War againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi>
there was nothing but Armies and Fleets preparing
on both ſides. Tho' now there was no more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
between thoſe two States, nor any hopes of
paſſing into the <hi>Levant,</hi> yet <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
would not go out of the Teritories of the
Republick, to keep their Vow, which obliged them
to expect there one whole year.</p>
               <p>The new made Prieſts, made uſe of this time, to
prepare and diſpoſe themſelves for ſaying their firſt
Maſſes, and the better to do it, they went out of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65023:76"/>
                  <hi>Venice</hi> into ſome ſolitary Places, where nothing but
Divine objects might enter into their thoughts; and
they choſe their quarters in ſuch manner, that altho'
they were ſeparated, they might eaſily come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in caſe any opportunity ſhould offer it ſelf, of
paſſing into the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> made choice of a forlorn Cottage,<note place="margin">He prepares himſelf for his firſt Maſs.</note> not
far from <hi>Vicenza,</hi> which was ready to fall. He
lived there much after the rate of the Ancient Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
of <hi>Thebais,</hi> faſting every day, inceſſantly Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and never coming forth unleſs to get a little
meat: But he received there ſuch overflowing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations,
that through the abundance of his Tears,
he was in danger of loſing his ſight. and yet after
forty Days of Retirement, and Penance, he would
not preſume to approach the Holy Altar; and tho'
his Companions ſaid their firſt Maſſes before the end
of <hi>September,</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> he did not ſay his, before
<hi>Chriſtmaſs-day</hi> of the year following defering it
from Month to Month, according to the light
which he received from God; ſtill judging himſelf
more and more unworthy for executing that Holy
Function: So profound was his Reverence of thoſe
Sacred Myſteries.</p>
               <p>Waiting the end of the year, our new Prieſts,
animated with a new Spirit and Fervor, were diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
into the Towns, and Burroughs adjacent to
their ſolitary Manſions, in company of the Antient
ſtanders, who had been formerly Ordain'd, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in their Vocation of ſaving Souls. <hi>Ignatius,
Faber,</hi> and <hi>Laynez,</hi> went to <hi>Vicenza, Xaverius</hi> and
<hi>Salmeron</hi> to <hi>Montſelioe, Codurus</hi> and <hi>Hozez</hi> to <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vtſa,
le Jay</hi> and <hi>Rodriguez</hi> to <hi>Baſſano, Brouet</hi> and
<hi>Bobadilla</hi> to <hi>Verona;</hi> they commonly got upon
ſome Stone, in the middle of Market places, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
the Paſſengers to hear them. Whereas they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65023:76"/>
had the meen of Strangers, and ſpoke bad <hi>Italian,</hi>
the People who took them for Mountebanks, come
out of ſome far Country, flockt about them in
great numbers. But God beſtowed ſuch power
upon their words, that ſuch as came thither only to
laugh at them, went away weeping for their ſins.</p>
               <p>They only Preached Repentance and Penance,
and to look upon their pale and mortifi'd Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
they appear'd to be true Penitents themſelves,
who had newly come forth out of ſome Deſert.
After having labour'd the whole Day, without other
ſuſtenance then a little Bread beg'd from Door to
Door; they paſt the Night in ſmall Cottages or
Huts, lodging on the Ground, with a little Straw
under them.</p>
               <p>They could not long hold out in ſo Auſtere a
courſe of Life, the greateſt part of them fell ſick,
and amongſt the reſt <hi>Simon Rodriguez</hi> was brought
to Deaths door. He and <hi>le Jay</hi> were retired into
an Hermitage, built on the top of an Hill, near
<hi>Baſſano.</hi> The Hermit, who was called <hi>Antonio,</hi>
and was a Holy Man, ſpared no pains to aſſiſt and
comfort him, but the Violence of the Diſeaſe did
not yield to any remedies.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt news of this dangerous Sickneſs,<note place="margin">He goes to the Relief of one of his Companions who was ſick and tempted.</note> 
                  <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
parted from <hi>Vicenza,</hi> which is a days Journey
diſtant from <hi>Baſſano.</hi> He had at that time a ling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Feavor upon him, and yet walkt ſo faſt, that
<hi>Faber,</hi> who was ſtrong and healthy, could not keep
pace with him. Having always the Van of his
Companion, he now and then ſtaid for him, and in
theſe pauſes, he beg'd of God upon his Knees, the
Recovery of his Diſciple. Nor did he pray in vain,
even in his Journey he had an aſſurance of being
heard, and he told <hi>Faber,</hi> that <hi>Rodriguez</hi> would
not die. However, they found him ſo ill, that the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65023:77"/>
Phyſitian, who viſited him, and the Hermit both
diſpair'd of his Life. But <hi>Ignatius,</hi> embracing the
ſick Man, confidently told him, <hi>fear nothing, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
you ſhall recover.</hi> From that moment, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driduez</hi>
began to mend, and in few days was quite
recover'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the evil Spirit endeavour'd to rob</hi> Ignatius
<hi>of him, whom Heaven had newly reſtored to him:
For</hi> Rodriguez, <hi>a while after, being charm'd with
the delights of Solitude, and comparing the quiet
life of the Hermit</hi> Antonio, <hi>with the reſtleſneſs and
fatigues of</hi> Ignatius, <hi>was tempted to make himſelf
an Hermit.</hi> Nothing unites us more to God (<hi>ſaid
he within himſelf</hi>) then the Exerciſes of an interior
life: All theſe outward Employments diſſipate the
Spirit in Saints, tho' never ſo great, the Commerce
of Men in the World cannot be but dangerous for
him, who deals with them, tho' it be to ſave them,
and it is always moſt ſecure, only to mind our own
Soul.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons much prevail'd upon him; but the
remembrance of his Vow, and the conſideration of
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> held him in ſuſpence: Not being able to
reſolve, it came into his thoughts to conſult the
holy Man <hi>Antonio,</hi> and implicityly to follow his
Councel. For this end, ſtealing away from <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Faber,</hi> and <hi>le Jay,</hi> with whom he was at <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſano,</hi>
he went towards the Hermitage. He was
hardly got out of the Town, when a Man of a
terrible aſpect, and of a Giants ſtature, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before him, with a naked Sword in his hand;
at firſt he was terrified: But after a while, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it might be only fancy, and that his Eyes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him, he followed on his way. Immediately
the ſame Man in a greater rage, then before, look'd
dreadfully upon him, and threaten'd him with his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65023:77"/>
Sword, as if he meant to run him through; ſo that
<hi>Rodriguez,</hi> trembling and frighted, ran back with
full ſpeed to the Town. <hi>Ignatius</hi> received him
with open Arms, and with a ſmile, full of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>Thou man of little Faith</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>why haſt
thou doubted?</hi> Theſe words made <hi>Rodriguez</hi> aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but they Confirm'd him in his Vocation, and
at the ſame time gave him to underſtand, that God
had reveal'd the whole matter to <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Charity, which the Hermit of <hi>Baſſano</hi> had
ſhewed to <hi>Rodriguez</hi> in the time of his Sickneſs,
obliged <hi>Ignatius</hi> to take his leave of him, before he
return'd to <hi>Vicenza.</hi> They had often ſeen one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the <hi>Recluſe,</hi> who highly valued his own way
of life, and to whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
himſelf, had no great eſteem for a Man,
in whom he ſaw nothing extraordinary, either in
his outſide, or in his diſcourſe. This laſt time of
ſeeing him, he undervalued him even more, then
formerly: But when <hi>Ignatius</hi> was departed, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by a light from above, that he, of whom
he made ſo little Reckoning, was a Veſſel of Election,
and a Man fill'd with the Spirit of God.</p>

oblig'd them to offer their Service to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Here we cannot too much admire the Conduct
of Providence, which doth ſometimes infuſe
Thoughts and Deſigns into the Minds of Saints,
not intending that they ſhould be executed, and yet
expecting from them their Obedience and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
towards the Execution of them. It is a thing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65023:78"/>

omit going in the Year 1537. Doubtleſs the Divine
Wiſdom, which conducted his Servants by ſecret

               <p>It was reſov'd, that <hi>Ignatius, Faber,</hi> and <hi>Laynez,</hi>
ſhould firſt go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and repreſent to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               <p>1. That they ſhould Lodge in Hoſpitals, and
live only upon Alms. 2. That ſuch as were of a
Company, ſhould be Superiours by turns, each in
his Week, leſt their fervour ſhould carry them too
far, if they did not preſcribe Limits one to the other,
for their Pennances and Labour. 3. That they
ſhould Preach in all publick Places, and in ſuch
other where they could be permitted to do it. That
in their Sermons they ſhould ſet forth the Beauty
and Rewards of Vertue, with the Deformity and
Puniſhments of Sin; and that they ſhould do it in
a plain Evangelical manner, without the vain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of Eloquence. 4. That they ſhould teach
Children the Chriſtian Doctine, and the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

no Money for executing their Functions, and that
in ſerving their Neighbour, they ſhould ſeek the

They all conſented to theſe Articles:<note place="margin">He gives to his Company the Name of <hi>The Society of Jeſus.</hi>
                  </note> But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they were often asked who they were, and
what was their Inſtitute, <hi>Ignatius</hi> declared to them
in preciſe terms what they were to anſwer thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
He told them, That being united together to
fight againſt Hereſies and Vices, under the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the only Name which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
their Deſign, was, <hi>The Company of Jeſus.</hi>
He had this Name in his thoughts ever ſince his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
at <hi>Manreza;</hi> and it is believ'd, that God
reveal'd it to him in his Meditation of the two Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards,
in which was ſhew'd him the firſt Draught,
and the general Scheme of his Order, by Military
Repreſentations.</p>
               <p>But that which happen'd to him in his Journey
to <hi>Rome,</hi> much confirm'd him in the thought, that
this Name was inſpir'd by Heaven. In his whole
Voyage he every day receiv'd the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
from the Hands of <hi>Laynez</hi> or <hi>Faber.</hi> He was
all the way in conſtant Meditation upon the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of our Saviour, with a feeling Devotion.
Lighting upon a ruinous Chappel in the Road from
<hi>Sienna</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> he went all alone into it, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
that little Company to God, which he was
now going to offer to the Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
Scarce had he begun his Prayer, when he was rapt in
ſpirit. He ſaw the Eternal Father, who preſented
him to his Son; and he ſaw <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> loaden
with a heavy Croſs, who after receiving him from
the hands of his Father, ſaid to him theſe words, <hi>I
will be propitious to you at Rome.</hi> The ſight of the
Croſs aſtoniſh'd him; but the Promiſe of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
fill'd him with aſſurance and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Being come to himſelf, he went out of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
with a tranſported Countenance; and joyning
his two Companions, <hi>I know not, Brethren</hi> (he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65023:79"/>
ſaid) <hi>what is prepar'd for us at</hi> Rome, <hi>and whether
we may not be ill treated there; but this I know, that
whatever our treatment ſhall be,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>will
be propitious to us.</hi> After which, to fortifie them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all that might happen, he told them what he
had ſeen. This heavenly Viſit is one of the moſt
remarkable which St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> ever had, and is ſo
well atteſted, that there is no ground for a doubt
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laynez,</hi> when he was General of the Society,
made a Relation of it to all the Fathers of <hi>Rome,</hi> in
a Domeſtical Conference; and <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> who
firſt writ the Story of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> ſays he was preſent
at it. When any body asked St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Particulars of it, he referr'd them to Father
<hi>Laynez,</hi> to whom, he ſaid, he had formerly given a
true account of it. Nevertheleſs, at the time when
he made the Rules and Conſtitutions of his Society,
and ſet down the Sentiments which God inſpir'd
him with at the Altar,<note place="margin">Quando el Padre Eterno me puſo conſu Hijo.</note> he once writ, that he found
himſelf in the ſame inward diſpoſition and ſtate as
he was when the Eternal Father appear'd to him,
and recommended, or <hi>Put him with his Son,</hi> to uſe
the Saint's own Term.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius, Faber,</hi> and <hi>Laynez,</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the end of the Year 1537. At their firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
they had Audience of his Holineſs, <hi>Paul</hi> the
Third, by the means of <hi>Ortiz.</hi> His Holineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
with joy the Offers which <hi>Ignatius</hi> made
him, and ſeem'd very well ſatisfi'd to ſee him. To
try, and employ his new Workmen, he deſir'd that
<hi>Laynez</hi> and <hi>Faber</hi> might teach Divinity in the
College of <hi>Sapienza,</hi> the firſt, Scholaſtick, and the
other, the holy Scripture. <hi>Ignatius</hi> undertook, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Apoſtolical Authority, the reformation of
Manners, by the means of his Spiritual Exerciſes,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65023:80"/>
and of Chriſtian Inſtructions. He firſt reſtor'd all
the Money that he and his Companions had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for their Journey of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he even ſent
back four Crowns of Gold as far as <hi>Valentia,</hi> which
<hi>Martin Perez</hi> had given him.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Jaſpar Contarini,</hi> one of the moſt
Learned Men, and moſt Ingenious of his Time,
was ſo charm'd with the Diſintereſſedneſs and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that he ſaid he now had met with
ſuch a Director as he had long wiſh'd and ſought
for. He gave himſelf up wholly to him, and in his
own Hand wrote out the Book of the Exerciſes.</p>
               <p>According to the Example of <hi>Contarini,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Mont-Caſſin.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ortiz</hi>
put himſelf under the Direction of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> But
that he might make the Exerciſes with more liberty,
he went out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and took <hi>Ignatius</hi> with him
to <hi>Monte-Caſſino.</hi> This Place, equally ſolitary and
Religious, ſeem'd to him very proper for his deſign
of forgetting for a whole Month, all the Buſineſs
of the World, and of minding no other but that of
his Soul. As far advanc'd in years as he was, he
made himſelf <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Scholar; and he ſaid after
his retirement, that the Divinity which he had
learn'd at <hi>Monte-Caſſino,</hi> in the ſpace of Fourty
days, was incomparably better then that which he
had taught in ſo many years. He ſaid alſo, there
was a great deal of difference between ſtudying to
inſtruct others, and ſtudying to perfect ones ſelf;
that in the firſt we only deſign to make our ſelves
able Men, in the ſecond to become Saints. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
he more valu'd one ſingle Notion, gain'd
in his Solitude, then all the curious Speculations of
humane Sciences.</p>
               <p>In this while <hi>Xaverius</hi> and <hi>Bobadilla</hi> were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in <hi>Bologna</hi> about ſaving of Souls; <hi>Le Jay</hi>
and <hi>Rodriguez</hi> were at the ſame Work in <hi>Ferara,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65023:80"/>
Paſquier</hi> and <hi>Salmeron</hi> in <hi>Sienna, Codurus</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zez</hi>
in <hi>Padua.</hi> From <hi>Venice</hi> their Reputation was
every where ſpread about; and the Marchioneſs of
<hi>Peſcara</hi> being at <hi>Ferara,</hi> deſir'd to be acquainted
with the two who Labour'd there. Meeting one of
them by accident, ſhe asked, if he were not one of
thoſe Prieſts come into <hi>Italy,</hi> to go into the <hi>Holy
Land,</hi> and where he Lodg'd. She was inform'd by
him, that their Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and that they Lodg'd in the Hoſpital. She
went thither the very ſame day; but before ſhe
call'd for them, ſhe enquir'd in what manner they
liv'd. She was told that they were great Saints; that
they ſpent part of the Night in Prayer, and in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Office together; that every day they
begg'd their Bread about the Town, and would not
eat in the Hoſpital what belong'd to the Poor; that,
as thin clad as they were, they never came to the
Fire in the coldeſt Weather; that they never ſpoke
but of Heavenly things, and that they were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
employ'd in the Service of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>The Marchioneſs, who had true Sentiments of
Piety, was overjoy'd to find Directors of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
She gave them an account of her Interior,
and oblig'd them to come and Lodge for a time,
near her Palace. It was ſhe who firſt made them
known in the Court of <hi>Ferara,</hi> and who induced the
Duke <hi>Hercules d'Eſte</hi> to chuſe <hi>Claude le Jay</hi> for his
Confeſſor.</p>
               <p>But of three other of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Companions, God
was pleas'd to try the Vertue, and to exerciſe their
Patience. <hi>Xaverius</hi> had a great Sickneſs at <hi>Bologna,</hi>
of which he was brought to Deaths-door. <hi>Codurus</hi>
and <hi>Hozez</hi> were put in Priſon at <hi>Padua,</hi> by order of
the Biſhops Suffragan, who ſuſpected them of ill
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65023:81"/>
Deſigns, and ſome Contrivances againſt the State
of <hi>Venice:</hi> But the whole Town was concern'd in
their behalf; ſo that they lay but one Night in
Priſon. As ſoon as they fell to their Employment
again, <hi>Hozez</hi> was ſeiz'd with a moſt violent Feaver,
which carry'd him off in few days. The Diſeaſe
took him after he had newly Preach'd to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon theſe words of the Goſpel, <hi>Watch and
pray, becauſe you know not the day nor the hour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who had the News brought him to
<hi>Monte-Caſſino,</hi> of <hi>Hozez</hi> Sickneſs, knew it would
be mortal.<note place="margin">He ſees the Soul of <hi>Hozez</hi> enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> At the very inſtant of his Expiring the
Saint ſaw his Soul, ſhining and glorious, enter into
Heaven, in the ſame manner as St. <hi>Bennet</hi> in that
Place had formerly ſeen the Soul of St. <hi>Germanus,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Padua,</hi> carry'd by Angels into <hi>Paradice,</hi>
as it is related by St. <hi>Gregory. Ignatius</hi> had the ſame
Viſion more then once: for being one day hearing
Maſs, at thoſe words of the <hi>Confiteor, Et omnibus
Sanctis,</hi> he ſaw Heaven open'd, and among the
numerous Troop of the Bleſſed, his Companion
more reſplendent then the reſt; not that he was
more holy, or more elevated in Glory, but becauſe
God, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> himſelf obſerv'd, would have him
ſo diſtinguiſh'd, that he might take notice of him.
This Viſion ſo wrought upon him, that he wept for
many days together. And that which made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that it was no Illuſion, was, that the Body it
ſelf of the Deceaſed ſeem'd to give ſome aſſurance
of the glorious ſtate of his Soul: for <hi>Hozez,</hi> who,
living, was of a ſwarthy Complexion, and very
hard-featur'd, becaMe ſo handſom and well-colour'd
after his Death, that <hi>Codurus,</hi> who never left him,
could hardly know him for the ſame Man.</p>
               <p>To increaſe his comfort,<note place="margin">He gets a new Companion.</note> 
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſtay'd not long
without finding another Companion, to fill his room
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65023:81"/>
whom he newly had loſt, or rather whom it pleas'd
God to take into his own Kingdom: Nor could
he reckon it a loſs to himſelf, that this holy Man
ſhould be the firſt to take poſſeſſion of Heaven, out
of that Society which was hardly yet well eſtabliſh'd
upon Earth, and from whom he hop'd for more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
(in that bleſſed State he had ſeen him) then
he could have had ſervice or aſſiſtance from him, if
he had continu'd longer in the World.</p>
               <p>Coming back from <hi>Monte-Caſſino,</hi> he met a
young <hi>Spaniard</hi> of his Acquaintance, call'd <hi>Francis
Strada,</hi> who was come to <hi>Rome</hi> to make his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
Doctor <hi>Ortiz</hi> had plac'd him with Cardinal
<hi>John Peter Caraffa.</hi> But <hi>Strada,</hi> who was full of
ſpirit and fire, grew quickly weary of a Court,
where all things go ſlowly on. He therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to turn Soldier, to advance himſelf that way;
and he was then going to find Employment at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
It is the cuſtom for Men, uneaſie in their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
to be always complaining. He told <hi>Ignatius</hi>
his Diſguſts againſt the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> call'd it
Deceitful and Ungrateful; but ſtill he comforted
himſelf with the proſpect of a freer Life, in which
at leaſt he ſhould gain Reputation.</p>
               <p>You have no reaſon to complain (<hi>ſaid</hi> Ignatius <hi>to
him).</hi> The World, in deceiving you, has only done what
it uſeth to do: you have rather cauſe to rejoyce, then
to complain; for it was rather a Kindneſs then a
Deceit, to let you know at firſt what the Court is,
and how ill-grounded all Hopes are there. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
World, which has ſo ill recompenc'd your
Services, doth in a manner it ſelf admoniſh you to
leave it: but you do like him, who ſuffers Shipwrack
upon one Sea, and preſently Embarques again upon
another. You leave <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Naples,</hi> as if the
Court were not ſtill the Court as well at <hi>Naples</hi> as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65023:82"/>
at <hi>Rome.</hi> For my part I have pity of you, not ſo
much for the Hopes you have already loſt, as for
thoſe you have ſtill before you. If you will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
renounce all your vain Pretenſions upon Earth,
and truſt only to God, who is only faithful, and can
only make you happy.</p>
               <p>Theſe words made ſuch Impreſſions upon the
young Soldier, that he laid down his new Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to make himſelf a Diſciple of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> He went
back with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in proceſs of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
one of the moſt famous Preachers of <hi>Europe.</hi>
Other young Men, conſiderable for their natural
Parts and for their Piety, almoſt at the ſame time,
follow'd the Example of <hi>Strada.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time God beſtow'd upon <hi>Ignatius</hi> more
diſtinct Notions of the Inſtitute of which he was to
be the Founder,<note place="margin">He propoſes to his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> together with a ſtrong deſire of
Eſtabliſhing it out of hand. He conferr'd with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
and <hi>Laynez</hi> about it, and he ſent for the reſt of
his Companions, who were diſperſed up and down
<hi>Italy.</hi> Upon his firſt Order they came to <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the end of <hi>Lent,</hi> in the Year 1538. They
Lodg'd all together with a <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman, call'd
<hi>Guirino Garzonio,</hi> whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> had brought into
the Service of God, and whoſe Houſe he accepted
of, that he might Treat more commodiouſly with
his Companions about the great Buſineſs in hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having one day call'd them together,</hi> Can you
think, Brethren (<hi>ſaid he,</hi>) that Providence has ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
us out of ſo many different Countries, and
united us with ſo ſtrait a band of perfect Charity,
with intention, that after ſo long Studies, and ſuch
painful Voyages, every one ſhould go home again at
his pleaſure? No, no, (<hi>he added</hi>) God would have
us engag'd in his Service for ever; and even that
we leave behind us Succeſſors that ſhall embrace the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65023:82"/>
ſame manner of Life. Heaven has been pleas'd to
ſtop our Entrance into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and yet I can ſay it
to the glory of God, that our zeal for his Service has
ſtill increaſed from day to day. Ought we not to
judge from thence, that we are call'd to enlarge the
Kingdom of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not with a ſingle Nation
or Country, but with all the Nations and Countries
of the World?</p>
               <p>The ſmall number which we were at firſt, did not
ſuffice for ſo vaſt an Enterprize. New Succours are
now come in to us, and more are daily coming. But
what benefit ſhall we receive from thoſe who aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
with us, if we all live in an Independency? and
what great thing can we perform, if our Company
be not Erected into a Religious Order, capable of
multiplying it ſelf in all Places, and ſubſiſting to the
end of the World?</p>
               <p>I doubt not but this Deſign will meet with great
oppoſition: The Contradiction of Men is a Character
and Mark of the Works of God: But neither Earth
nor Hell can prevail againſt the Decrees of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Wiſdom. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has promis'd us to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to us; and what may we not hope upon his
Word? and what can we fear with his Aſſiſtance?
After all, I am if opinion, that you and I ſhould take
a little time to prepare our ſelves by Prayer, to make
a farther diſcovery of his Divine Will, and faithfully
to Execute it, when it ſhall appear to us.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe of <hi>Ignatius</hi> fully convinc'd the
whole Company; yet in Obedience to him, they
did not deliver their Opinions upon the Matter till
they had taken ſome time to recommend it to God
in the manner by him preſcribed; which being
done, they aſſembled a ſecond time, and agree'd
by a common conſent, that their Society ſhould be
Erected into a Religious Order; that no time ought
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65023:83"/>
to be loſt in undertaking it; and that the firſt ſtep
to be made, ſhould be to prepare the Mind of the
Pope, which ſeem'd to be averſe from theſe new
Eſtabliſhments.</p>
               <p>While they ſought out means to bring this to
effect, <hi>Paul</hi> the Third parted from <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Nice,</hi>
a Maritime Town in <hi>Provence,</hi> where there was to
be an Interview between <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth. The Deſign of the Pope was to
Compoſe the Differences of thoſe two Princes, by
a Treaty of Peace, or at leaſt to obtain of them a
long Truce: for he had reaſon to fear, that their
Diviſions would hinder the progreſs of the League
made againſt <hi>Soliman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was a great pain to <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He continues his Works of Piety.</note> to ſee the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God retarded: he drew his comfort only
from him, who permitted this delay, and in the
mean time he employ'd himſelf in the Service of
his Neighbour. Having obtain'd leave of Cardinal
<hi>Caraffa,</hi> whom the Pope had made his Legate in
<hi>Rome,</hi> to Preach in what Places he would, he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
his Companions into ſeveral Churches of the
Town. He choſe for himſelf our <hi>Ladies</hi> of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerrat,</hi>
out of the Devotion which he always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
towards the miraculous Image, which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor'd
at the Place of <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> where he made his
Renunciation of ſecular Warfare.</p>
               <p>He Preach'd very feelingly; and his Talent was
to make the Truths of the Goſpel enter into the
Heart, by laying them forth in a plain manner,
ſuch as they are in themſelves, and as he himſelf
reliſh'd them: ſo that pious Perſons, and of good
ſence, who us'd to hear his Sermons, were wont to
ſay, That the Word of God, naked and plain, had
in the Mouth of <hi>Ignatius</hi> its full Majeſty and force.
<hi>Faber, Xaverius, Laynez,</hi> and the reſt, did alſo
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65023:83"/>
Preach with great fervour, and with no other aim
but the good of Souls.</p>
               <p>From their firſt Sermons there was obſerv'd a
remarkable change in the Manners of the People.
The frequentation of the Sacraments, which was
then little in uſe, was reſtor'd according to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of the firſt Ages of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and 'tis ſince
that time, that ſo holy a Cuſtom has been introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into all Catholick Countries, as well as that of
making Catechiſms to the Children, and Sermons to
the People every <hi>Sunday</hi> and Holy-day.</p>
               <p>This Eavngelical Miniſtry did not hinder <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
from often Treating with his Companions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Project of his Inſtitute:<note place="margin">He confers with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions about his Inſtitute.</note> for tho' he
had the Model of it within him, yet he would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it without their concurrence. Being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
all the day either in inſtructing the People
in publick, or in directing Conſciences in private,
they took the Night for the time of their Conſults.
They reſolv'd in one of their Aſſemblies, by the
direction of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that beſides the Vows of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
and Chaſtity, which they had made at <hi>Venice,</hi>
they ſhould make another of perpetual Obedience;
the more to conform themſelves to the Son of God,
who was obedient even to death; That to this end
they ſhould elect a Superior General, whom they
muſt all obey, as God himſelf; That this Superior
ſhould be perpetual, and that his Authority ſhould
be abſolute.</p>
               <p>At another Meeting they agree'd, That ſuch as
were Profeſs'd in their Society, ſhould add to the
three Vows of Poverty, Chaſtity, and Obedience,
an expreſs Vow of going whereſoever the Vicar of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſend them, to labour in the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Souls; and even to go without any <hi>Viaticum,</hi>
and living upon Alms, if his Holineſs ſhould think it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65023:84"/>
fit. They had alſo other Conferences, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd,
That the Profeſs'd ſhould poſſeſs nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in particular nor in common: but that in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities
they might have Colleges with Revenues
and Rents, for the ſubſiſtence of thoſe who Study.</p>
               <p>After this manner they were employ'd,<note place="margin">He oppoſes an Heretical Preacher.</note> in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of the Pope's return; and the Bleſſing which
God beſtow'd upon their Labours, made them hope
for a happy ſucceſs in their grand Deſign; when on
the ſudden a Tempeſt was raiſ'd, which almoſt
over-turn'd all their hopes. There was at <hi>Rome</hi> a
famous Preacher, by Nation a <hi>Piemonteſe,</hi> and a
Religious of the Order of the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Hermits,
a reform'd Man in appearance, but unworthy of the
holy Habit which he wore, and a <hi>Lutheran</hi> in his
heart. The abſence of his Holineſs gave him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
from his Pulpit, to vent the Errors of that
<hi>Hereſiarch.</hi> The better to ſurprize the People, he
mightily lamented the relaxation of Diſcipline, and
of Doctrine in point of Manners and Chriſtian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals:
And thereupon he would inſinuate ſome ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
Propoſition, which he fail'd not ſeemingly to
back with the Authority of holy Fathers, and with
the Example of the firſt Ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> could not imagine, that a Religious
Man ſhould be capable of Preaching Hereſie in the
middle of <hi>Rome;</hi> and he believ'd at firſt that they
had put a wrong ſence upon the words of the
Preacher, or that the Propoſitions which made ſo
much noiſe, had negligently ſlipt from him without
deſign. However, to be throughly inform'd of the
truth, he order'd <hi>Salmeron</hi> and <hi>Laynez,</hi> who had
formerly Diſputed with the Hereticks in <hi>Germany,</hi>
and knew the bottom of <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> to go at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times to hear him.</p>
               <p>Being aſcertain'd by them that he taught the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65023:84"/>
very Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> under a ſpecious pretence of
teaching that of the Primitive Church, he procur'd
him to be admoniſh'd in ſecret, that his Doctrine
had caus'd a great deal of ſcandal; and this Advice
was given him with all the precautions which Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Charity require.</p>
               <p>But 'tis the nature of Hereſie to affect Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when 'tis undiſturb'd and let alone, and to be
violent in the higheſt degree, upon any oppoſition
made againſt it. The Preacher, (whom all <hi>Rome</hi>
follow'd as an Oracle) made haughty by his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and ſo much the more irritated by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances
which had been made him, by how
much they were founded upon Truth; he vented
his rage againſt thoſe who ſuſpected his Doctrine,
and boldly maintain'd all thoſe Propoſitions which
he had advanced. <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſeeing that a ſecret Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
had been unprofitable, and that ſweet
Remedies increaſed the Diſeaſe, thought it his duty
publickly to oppoſe the Enterprize of a Man, who
made it his Buſineſs to corrupt the purity of Faith
in the Capital City of Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he and his Companions went into the
Pulpit, and with all their might confuted his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
by defending the neceſſity of Good-works, the
Vows of Religion, the Authority of the Church,
and ſuch other Catholick Articles as are Impugned
by the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> The ten Preachers did not Preach
in vain; the Fryar became ſuſpected of Hereſie:
but being a Man very dextrous and intriguing, he
wanted neither Artifice to juſtifie himſelf, nor Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to be ſupported.</p>
               <p>His firſt Addreſs was to retort upon <hi>Ignatius</hi> the
ſuſpicion of Hereſie,<note place="margin">A Perſecution rais'd againſt him in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> ſaying aloud, That it was the
cuſtom of cunning Hereticks, to impute Errors to
whom they pleas'd, that by raiſing a duſt, they might
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65023:85"/>
undiſcover'd, and with Impunity vent worſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
But the better to corroborate what he would
have believ'd, he drew into his Cabal three <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
who had an honeſt and ſober out-ſide, very
proper to authorize a Calumny. One of them was
call'd <hi>Mudarra,</hi> another <hi>Barrera,</hi> and the third
<hi>Caſtilla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were not contented to defame <hi>Ignatius</hi> only
as a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and a wicked Man, but they ſuborn'd
<hi>Michael Navarr,</hi> and engag'd him to depoſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of a heinous nature againſt him. This is that
<hi>Navarr</hi> who at <hi>Paris,</hi> being inrag'd at the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Xaverius,</hi> made an attempt upon the Life of
<hi>Ignatius.</hi> He was come to <hi>Rome,</hi> after he had run
about the greateſt part of <hi>Europe;</hi> and he hated
<hi>Ignatius</hi> the more, for that having offer'd himſelf to
be one of his Diſciples, he was not judg'd worthy.</p>
               <p>This Man then declar'd before the Governor of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that the Ring-leader of certain <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Prieſts, was an Heretick and a Sorcerer, who had
been burnt in Effigie at <hi>Alcala,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and at
<hi>Venice.</hi> He proteſted upon Oath, That nothing
but his Conſcience forc'd him to accuſe a Man of
his own Nation: that he averr'd nothing but what
he had ſeen with his own Eyes, and of which he
could produce indiſputable Proofs.</p>
               <p>There needed no more with the People, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of their own Nature, and prepoſſeſs'd in favour
of the Fryar, to change their Sentiments in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> The Men whom lately they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
in the Pulpit, and whoſe Life ſeem'd to them
ſo Apoſtolick, were now pointed at as Hypocrites
and falſe Prophets. No body dar'd to appear in the
Company of miſerable Wretches, who they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
would ſuddenly be brought to the Stake; and
two Prieſts, whom the Cardinal Legat had aſſign'd
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65023:85"/>
them, to be their Aſſiſtants in hearing Confeſſions
fled out of the Town, for fear of being involv'd in
their deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The Fryar and his Confidents congratulated
with one another the ſucceſs of their Enterprize.
But <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whoſe hopes were the ſtronger in the
protection of God, by how much more deſperate
his Condition ſeem'd to be, encourag'd his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and excited himſelf to fear nothing. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
O Lord,</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>the accompliſhment of that
which the heavy Croſs did prognoſticate, when I ſaw
you loaded with it in my Journey to</hi> Rome. <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
alſo the reſt, and refuſe us not the Aſſiſtance
which you then promis'd us.</hi> His Prayer was heard;
and to the end it might appear, that God only did
lay the Tempeſt, the Calm enſu'd by thoſe means,
from which humanely it could not be expected.</p>
               <p>Of all the Friends of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> there was none
but <hi>Guirino Garzonio,</hi> who did not abandon him.
The particular knowledge he had of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Perſons, by having Lodg'd them ſo long before
their Perſecution, had given him ſo high an Idea of
their Vertue, that the Reports of <hi>Rome</hi> made no
impreſſion upon him. It being his Cuſtom to ſpeak
in favour of them upon all occaſions; Cardinal <hi>John
Dominique de Cupis,</hi> Dean of the ſacred Colledge,
his Friend and Kinſman, one day reprehended him
for it, and above all, advis'd him to avoid <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
not onely for the diſhonor which the Company of
ſuch infamous Perſons always brings, but for the
danger of being infected by keeping the Company
of wicked and impious Perſons. <hi>I aſſure you</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
<hi>Garzonio) that if you knew him, as I do, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of forbidding me his Company, you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
and ſeek it your ſelf. I ſee</hi> (reply'd the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
a little ſharply) <hi>that this Wretch has diſturb'd
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65023:86"/>
your Reaſon, and that you are not leſs inchanted by
him, then the Diſciples that follow him; for they ſay
he is a great Sorcerer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Garzonio</hi> gave an account the very ſame day to
<hi>Ignatius</hi> of the Converſation he had with the Dean
of the ſacred Colledge.<note place="margin">The Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by degrees.</note> 
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> prais'd the zeal of
the Cardinal, who ſince he had an ill opinion of the
Manners and Doctrine of a Man, would not have
him convers'd withal; he only added, that if he
might be ſo happy as to wait upon the Cardinal,
he did not doubt but he ſhould undeceive him.
<hi>Garzonio</hi> engag'd to procure him an Audience, and
he eaſily obtain'd it; for the Cardinal had a mind
to ſee a Man ſo much talk'd of, and to reproch
him with his Crimes; ſo that when he granted the
Audience, he ſaid, <hi>Let your</hi> Ignatius <hi>come, and I
will treat him as he deſerves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> appear'd before the Cardinal with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
aſſurance, ſuch as Innocence only can give.
It is not preciſely known what they ſaid; but this
is certain, that they were together about two hours,
and that the Cardinal wholly diſabus'd, threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at the Feet of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to ask his pardon; that
he brought him forth with great marks of eſteem
and good-will; and that from that time forwards
he ſent him every Week a large Alms.</p>
               <p>Tho' <hi>Ignatius</hi> found that Heaven began to be
favourable to him, yet he fail'd not to be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
on his part, according to his grand Maxim,
That in difficult Occurrences we ought to relie
wholly upon God with an intire aſſurance, as if the
good ſucceſs of the thing were to come from Heaven
by a kind of Miracle; and nevertheleſs, that we muſt
uſe our utmoſt endeavour on our parts to make it
ſucceed, as if we were to receive no ſuccour at all
on the part of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:65023:86"/>
His firſt ſtep was to Preſent himſelf before <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict
Converſin,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bertinero,</hi> Governor of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and to ſollicit himſelf, that his Cauſe might
come to a Hearing. The Governor having ſet a
day, the two Parties, <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Navarr,</hi> who
had accus'd him, appear'd in Court. The Accuſer
maintain'd all that he had before depos'd, and ſwore
it over again by all that was ſacred. In Anſwer to
all this, <hi>Ignatius</hi> only produc'd a letter, and asked
<hi>Navarr</hi> if he knew the Hand. <hi>'Tis mine,</hi> ſaid he,
not miſtruſting any thing. He ſaid true, for he had
writ that Letter to an Acquaintance ſome Months
before. It contain'd, That <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
led an unblameable Life; That he had
known them at <hi>Paris,</hi> and at <hi>Venice,</hi> and that they
were truly Apoſtolical Men.</p>
               <p>The Letter was read, and had all the effect
which <hi>Ignatius</hi> promis'd to himſelf. The Accuſer,
who ſpoke with ſo much boldneſs, ſeeing himſelf
convinc'd of falſity under his own Hand, was ſtruck
dumb; or what he ſpoke was ſo confus'd and
incoherent, that it made his Perjury more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
               <p>But that which abſolutely diſſipated the Calumny,
was, that the three Judges who had declar'd <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>'s
Innocence in the three Cities where <hi>Navarr</hi>
maintain'd that he had been Condemn'd to be
burnt, were all preſent in <hi>Rome</hi> at that time; <hi>Jaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par
de Doctis,</hi> Aſſeſſor of the <hi>Nuncius Veralli,</hi> was
come thither from <hi>Venice;</hi> the Grand Vicar <hi>John
Figueroa,</hi> from <hi>Alcala;</hi> and the Inquiſitor <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew
Ori,</hi> from <hi>Paris;</hi> each upon his private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
or rather for thoſe of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whoſe Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
God would have to be made authentically
manifeſt in the Capital City of the Chriſtian World.
Of Judges, as they had been, they became Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65023:87"/>
and all three depos'd the Truth againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
of <hi>Navarr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Impoſtor was condemn'd to a perpetual Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
and would have been more rigorouſly
puniſh'd if <hi>Ignatius</hi> had not interpos'd in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
For the other three <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
what they had ſaid, in the preſence of the
Governor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Cardinal Legat.
There now remain'd nothing for the abſolute Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
of the Maſter, but to vindicate alſo his
Diſciples. Upon the Reports which were ſpread out
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Companions of <hi>Ignatius</hi> were
Men of bad Lives, the Grand Vicars of <hi>Padua,</hi> of
<hi>Bologna,</hi> of <hi>Ferara,</hi> and of <hi>Sienna,</hi> immediately ſent
of their own accords very ample Atteſtations of their
holy Life. And <hi>Hercules d' Eſte,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferara,</hi>
gave order to his Miniſters then with the Pope, to
interpoſe his Authority and Teſtimony in behalf of
the unſpotted Lives of <hi>Le Jay</hi> and <hi>Rodriguez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So many Proofs did not yet ſatisfie</hi> Ignatius,<note place="margin">He ſollicits to have a Sentence paſs to juſtifie him, and at laſt obtains it.</note> 
                  <hi>he
would have a Sentence Juridically paſs'd, to remain
upon Record. He ſaid, that in time the Baniſhment
of his Accuſer might be forgotten; and if there
were no publick Act in favour of the Accuſed, it
might hereafter be believ'd, that by their Intrigues
and their Credit they had ſtopt the Courſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
as fearing a bad Iſſue of their Cauſe. That
which the more induc'd him to ſollicit for a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
was, that he might once-for-all juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
alſo of thoſe Accuſations at</hi> Alcala, Paris, <hi>and</hi>
Venice. I know (<hi>ſaid he, Writing to Signior</hi> Peter
Contarini) that in ſo doing we ſhall not ſilence bad
Tongues, nor am I ſo ill-advis'd as to pretend to it:
We only intend to ſave the Honor of Religion, which
is in ſome manner joyn'd with our own. It doth not
much concern us, that they make us paſs for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65023:87"/>
or for Men of a bad Life: but that the
Doctrine which we Preach ſhould paſs for Heterodox
in the Minds of the People, and that the way in
which we conduct Souls ſhould be eſteem'd the way
of Perdition, is that which we cannot permit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
betraying our Miniſtry, ſince it is the very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and the very way of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' this Enterprize, which <hi>Ignatius</hi> laid ſo
much to heart, was very juſt, and did not appear
very difficult, yet he found Obſtacles on all ſides.
The Governor, a juſt, but a weak Man, who was
afraid of drawing Enemies upon himſelf, if he
ſhould ſhew too much favour to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> neither
daring to grant nor to refuſe his Requeſt, ſpun out
the matter in length. On the other ſide, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Legat was not of opinion that the Buſineſs
ſhould be farther proſecuted; and there wanted not
thoſe, even among the Companions of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
whoſe Sentiments did not agree with his upon this
Matter. They ſaid it was enough for them to be
found innocent, and that any thing more would
have an Ayre of Revenge, which might diſedifie
the People. Theſe Oppoſitions did not ſtartle <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
no leſs jealous of his Honor, when the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of Religion requir'd it, then greedy of Reproch
and Ignominy in other occaſions.</p>
               <p>Tir'd with the put-offs of the Governor, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
of ever obtaining any thing from him, he
thought the ſhorteſt and moſt ſecure way would be
to addreſs himſelf immediately to the Pope, who
return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> while theſe things were tranſacted,
and was gone to paſs part of the Autumn at <hi>Fraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati,</hi>
to reſt himſelf after his Journey from <hi>Provence.</hi>
Thither <hi>Ignatius</hi> went to him, and the Juſtice of
his Cauſe gave him ſo much aſſurance, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
look'd out for a Mediator, nor an Introductor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:65023:88"/>
The Pope had no ſooner heard the Reaſons of
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> but he order'd the Governor to give him
content. The Governor obey'd; and after having
caus'd the Book of Spiritual Exerciſes to be Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
he drew up a Sentence according to Form,
which contain'd great Commendations of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
and intirely clear'd them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſent Copies of the Sentence round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
even as far as <hi>Spain:</hi> but the unhappy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny
of his Enimies, did yet farther vindicate him.
<hi>Navarr</hi> liv'd miſerably and agitated with remorſe
of his Conſcience. <hi>Barrera</hi> dy'd a few days after of
a violent Diſeaſe. <hi>Mudarra</hi> and <hi>Caſtilla</hi> were both
accus'd of Hereſie: the firſt was condemn'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Impriſonment; and the other, who appear'd
more obſtinate, to be burnt. As for the <hi>Piedmont</hi>
Fryar, he fled from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and there
declar'd himſelf openly an Heretick; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
wrote a violent Book againſt the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> Entitled, <hi>The Summary of Scripture.</hi> In
concluſion, the Impieties of this Apoſtate came to
ſuch an exceſs, that falling at laſt into the hands of
the Inquiſition, he ended his life at the Stake.</p>
               <p>Our ten holy Strangers having recover'd their
Honor,<note place="margin">He helps the People during a Famine.</note> began to appear again in publick; and
there was preſented to them an occaſion of ſuccour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Neighbour, which they were careful to
take hold of. The Winter at <hi>Rome</hi> was at that time
exceeding ſharp, and there was ſo great a Dearth,
that many of the Common People almoſt famiſh'd,
lay up and down in the Streets, having hardly
ſtrength enough to ask for Relief. Tho' <hi>Ignatius</hi>
and his Companions, who liv'd only upon Alms,
felt their ſhare of the Famine, however they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,
upon the Fund of Providence, to relieve theſe
poor Wretches. They all ſet their hands to take
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65023:88"/>
them up in the Streets, and carry'd them on their
Backs into the Houſe where of late they Lodg'd
themſelves. They give their Beds to the weakeſt
among them, and accommodate the reſt as well as
they can, with Straw laid upon the Ground. The
Providence on which they reckon'd, did not fail
them: They receiv'd ſo great a Supply of Meat
and Money all at a time, that they had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal,
not only to feed above Four hundred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but alſo to clothe the moſt neceſſitous, who
were almoſt ſtarv'd both with Cold and Hunger.</p>
               <p>The Charity of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Companions,
drew a great many Spectators. Some, who came
only out of curioſity to ſee what they did, being
mov'd at the ſight, ſtript themſelves of part of
their Garments, to clothe the half-naked, who were
not yet provided of Clothes: And many Perſons
of Quality rais'd a Stock for the ſubſiſtance of three
or four thouſand Perſons, whom Famine had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to extreameſt miſery. But the care of <hi>Ignatius</hi>
was not confin'd to the relief of their Bodies, he alſo
inſtructed thoſe poor Wretches in all the Duties of
<hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> he made them Pray orderly every
day together, and engag'd them to make their
Confeſſions.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were doing,<note place="margin">He Preſents to the Pope the Project of his Inſtitute.</note> 
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who
had the Benedictions and Praiſes of all <hi>Rome,</hi> and
was call'd the Father of the People, thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to make uſe of ſo favourable a Conjuncture
for the Execution of his Deſign. Having made an
Abſtract of the Inſtitute which he and his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had form'd, he Preſented it to <hi>Paul</hi> the Third,
by the Mediation of Cardinal <hi>Gaſpar Contarini.</hi>
The Pope receiv'd the Writing very ſatisfactorily,
and gave it immediately to be Examined to <hi>Thomas
Badia,</hi> then <hi>Magiſter Sacrae Palatiae,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65023:89"/>
made Cardinal of St. <hi>Silveſter. Badia</hi> kept
it by him two Months, after which time he brought
it back to his Holineſs, declaring that he found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it, but what was very commendable. The
Pope read it himſelf, and 'tis ſaid, that after reading
it, he cry'd, <hi>The Finger of God is here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> at the ſame time beſought his Holineſs,
that he would be pleas'd Authentically to Confirm
what he had already vouchſafed to approve by
word of Mouth. Tho' <hi>Paul</hi> the Third ſtood well
enough inclin'd, yet he would do nothing in it
without the advice of three Cardinals: Of whom
the firſt and principal was <hi>Bartholomew Guidicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi>
a Man of great merit, and ſo worthy of the
Papacy, that when he dy'd, the Pope ſaid, <hi>His Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
was dead;</hi> but of ſo auſtere Vertue, and ſo
much an Enemy to Novelties of all kinds, that far
from approving new Religious Orders, he thought
that ſome of the old ones ſhould rather be ſuppreſt,
and all of them reduc'd only to four. His zeal in
this matter went ſo far, that he ſet out a Book with
his Reaſons for it, which were grounded upon the
Decrees of the Councils of <hi>Lateran</hi> and of <hi>Lyons,</hi>
under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Tenth,
concerning the multiplication of Religious Orders.
With this diſpoſition of Mind he would hardly look
upon the Memorial that was put into his Hands;
and he often ſaid, <hi>That whatever the Inſtitute were,
the Church had no need of it.</hi> The Authority of
<hi>Guidiccione,</hi> who was an able Divine, and a great
Canoniſt, drew along with it the other two Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time that <hi>Paul</hi> the Third nam'd theſe
three Commiſſioners,<note place="margin">Some of his Companions are employ'd by the Pope.</note> he ſpoke to <hi>Ignatius</hi> for ſome
of his Companions, to be employ'd in ſome neceſſary
Occaſions of the Church. This he did at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65023:89"/>
of ſome Princes, Biſhops, and other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Perſons, who had knowledge of the Diſciples
and of the Maſter. <hi>Paſquier Brouet</hi> was ſent to
<hi>Sienna,</hi> to reform a Monaſtery of Religious Women,
which was in great diſorder; <hi>Claude le Jay</hi> to
<hi>Breſcia,</hi> to extirpate the Hereſie which ſome Unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Preachers had there ſow'n; and <hi>Nicholas
Bobadilla</hi> to the Iſland <hi>Iſchia,</hi> upon the Coaſts of
<hi>Naples,</hi> to make Peace among the principal Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
who had mortal Feuds among them. <hi>James
Laynez</hi> and <hi>Peter Faber</hi> attended the Cardinal of
St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> in his Legantine Voyage to <hi>Parma:
Laynez</hi> was left at <hi>Placentia,</hi> and <hi>Faber</hi> at <hi>Parma;</hi>
from whence he was afterwards recall'd, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
Doctor <hi>Ortiz,</hi> who had receiv'd Orders from
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, to be preſent at <hi>Worms,</hi> where
there was to be a Colloquie between the <hi>Catholicks</hi>
and the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Simon Rodriguez</hi> and
<hi>Francis Xaverius</hi> parted towards the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the
occaſion of their Journey was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>James Govea</hi> (that <hi>Portuguez</hi> Principal of the
Colledge of St. <hi>Barbara,</hi> who penitently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
the Innocence of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> when he was upon
the point of expoſing him to publick ſhame) being
yet at <hi>Paris,</hi> and hearing the great things which
<hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Companions had done in <hi>Italy,</hi>
judg'd, that Men of their Mould would be very
uſeful in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which were newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
by the <hi>Portuguez.</hi> He writ about it to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> whoſe Sentiment he would firſt know,
before he made any Overture of it in the Court of
<hi>Portugal.</hi> The Father prais'd God that he had
open'd to him the Door of a new World, after ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that of the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> and he conceiv'd an
ardent deſire of going himſelf, to carry the Goſpel
into ſo many Idolatrous Nations. He anſwer'd
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65023:90"/>
                  <hi>Govea, That he and his Companions were ready to
go into any Place in the World, where the Vicar of</hi>
Jeſus Chriſt <hi>ſhould pleaſe to ſend them; That they
had devoted their Service to him upon the account
of Miſſions, and that they could not diſpoſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
without the leave and good liking of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Govea</hi> ſent the Anſwer of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to <hi>John</hi> the
Third, King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> together with his own
Thoughts concerning the Converſion of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
This Prince, who was very Religious, and no
leſs careful of Eſtabliſhing the Kingdom of <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> in thoſe Countries newly diſcover'd, then of
Enlarging the Dominion of <hi>Portugal,</hi> gave Order
at the ſame time to <hi>Don Pedro Maſcaregnas,</hi> his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
at <hi>Rome,</hi> to obtain of his Holineſs ſix at
leaſt of theſe Evangelical Labourers recommended
to him by <hi>Govea,</hi> and to bring them along with
him.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador,<note place="margin">He appoints two of his Companions for the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </note> who was particularly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and even made uſe of him for his
Confeſſor, ſhew'd him the Order of his Maſter.
The Father anſwer'd, <hi>That it belong'd to the Pope
to determine upon the matter; but if he might ſpeak
his own thoughts, he was of opinion, that two of the
Fathers were as many as could well be ſpar'd for the
Indies.</hi> When <hi>Maſcaregnas</hi> inſiſted upon the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
prefix'd by the King, <hi>Good God!</hi> (reply'd <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius)
if of ten that we are, ſix ſhould go to the</hi>
Indies, <hi>what would there remain for all the other
Countries of the World.</hi> The Pope, to whom <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caregnas</hi>
made all poſſible inſtance, referr'd the
Matter to Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who ſtill adher'd to his
firſt Sentiment: So that the Ambaſſador brought
away no more with him but <hi>Simon Rodriguez</hi> and
<hi>Francis Xaverius;</hi> a ſmall Supply indeed, if we
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65023:90"/>
look only upon the number, but very conſiderable
in weight and value.</p>
               <p>The two Miſſionaries being arriv'd at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
there for the good of Souls, while they waited
for the departure of the Admiral, in which they were
to Embarque, in Company of <hi>Martin Alphonſo
Soza,</hi> who Commanded the Fleet. And their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
from the very beginning gain'd them the
Title of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which in that Kingdom remains
at this day to their Succeſſors. Some Lords of the
Court, inamor'd with the zeal of <hi>Xaverius</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driguez,</hi>
repreſented to the King, that perhaps it
would be more advantageous to keep them both in
<hi>Portugal,</hi> then to ſend them to the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two Fathers, who had their Miſſion appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the new World, having ſome inkling of the
Deſign of the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> wrote preſently to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and conjur'd their Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> to Intereſt his
Holineſs in behalf of their Miſſion. <hi>Paul</hi> the Third
would not appear in it, but was of opinion the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of it ſhould be left to the King. Accordingly
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſent to the two Fathers, that they
ſhould follow the Direction of the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
whom they were to obey in this Circumſtance
as God's Vicegerent. But he added, that if perchance
the King ſhould ask what his Opinion was of it,
they might tell him his Judgment was, That <hi>Xave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
ſhould go to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and that <hi>Simon Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi>
ſhould remain in <hi>Portugal.</hi> The King recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this Advice as an Oracle; and as <hi>Ignatius</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
ſo it was Executed: Wherefore for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
alone we may in a manner attribute to him all
thoſe glorious things done by St. <hi>Xaverius</hi> in the
<hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Joy which <hi>Ignatius</hi> had to ſee his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
preferr'd to be Apoſtles of a new World, was a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65023:91"/>
little allay'd by the oppoſition made to his chief-Deſign,<note place="margin">He perſiſts to have his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Approv'd by the Holy See.</note> by the three Cardinals. However he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
his Applications to the Pope with more
warmth then ever. At the ſame time he redoubled
his Prayers to the Divine Majeſty with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence;
and, as if he were certain of ſucceſs, he
promis'd one day to God three thouſand Maſſes, in
acknowledgment of the Grace which he hoped to
obtain.</p>
               <p>His hopes were not deceiv'd; Cardinal <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diccione</hi>
found himſelf chang'd all in an inſtant, not
knowing why: and this ſudden change ſeem'd to
himſelf ſo extraordinary, that he doubted not but
God was the Author of it. Now he read the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial,
which before he would not look upon; and
after well Examining it, he ſaid his Sentiment was
ſtill in general the ſame, that new Orders of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
were not to be admitted; but for this, which
was now Preſented, he could not oppoſe it. He
farther declar'd, that he even thought it neceſſary
for the preſent State of Chriſtendom, and above all,
for ſtopping the Courſe of Hereſies, which began
to over-run all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In effect, there hardly appear'd any footſteps of
the ancient Religion in the greateſt part of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
where the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>
(branch'd out into many contrary Sects) only agreed
together to deſtroy the Catholick Faith. <hi>England</hi>
ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> follow'd the Deviations of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, whom ſhe acknowledg'd for
Head of the <hi>Anglicane</hi> Church. <hi>Switzerland, Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and all the Neighboring Parts,
were infected with the Errors of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and
<hi>Oecolampadius. France</hi> was every where tainted
with the Contagion of <hi>Geneva,</hi> even into <hi>Italy</hi> it
ſelf the Venom had crept, whither <hi>Calvin</hi> had ſent
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65023:91"/>
his <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> Tranſlated into <hi>French,</hi> and had ſo
inſinuated himſelf and his Doctrine into the good
liking of <hi>Renée,</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Ferara,</hi> who was
Daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, that ſhe and part
of her Court had embrac'd the Hereſie.</p>
               <p>The Pope judg'd, that in ſo fatal a Juncture the
Church had need of extraordinary Succors. He
underſtood at the ſame time, that the Diſciples of
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> who were employ'd out of <hi>Rome,</hi> did
every where awaken and ſtir up the Spirit of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;</hi>
and that the moſt harden'd Sinners could
not reſiſt the force of their Exhortations. Among
the remarkable Converſions, that of a Prieſt of
<hi>Sienna</hi> was moſt admir'd by the Pope. This Prieſt
had liv'd a very diſſolute Life: He was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
only to compoſe Comedies to entertain the
People, but he would ſometimes Act in them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to the high ſcandal of all good Chriſtians,
who could not endure to ſee the ſame Man, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at the Altar, and ſometimes upon the Stage.
<hi>Brouet</hi> and his Companion <hi>Strada</hi> (that young
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> had gain'd in his return
from <hi>Monte-Caſſino</hi>) had toucht him ſo to the quick
with their Diſcourſes, that after having made a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Retirement, he (with the leave of the Grand
Vicar) publickly asked pardon of the People with
a Rope about his Neck, for the Scandal he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and afterwards ſhut himſelf up in a Convent
of Recollects, where he ſpent the reſt of his days in
rigorous Pennance.</p>
               <p>The Pope,<note place="margin">The Society of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by the Pope.</note> being mov'd with ſo many extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Actions, and more powerfully incited by
an inward Impulſe, confirm'd at laſt the Inſtitute
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> under the Title of <hi>The Society of Jeſus,</hi>
by the Bull, <hi>Regimini Militantis Eccleſiae.</hi> This
Bull which was Expedited the 27th of <hi>September,</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:65023:92"/>
in the year 1540, contains the Elogy of the firſt
ten Fathers, and ſays in expreſs words, that there
is nothing but what is Good and Holy in this new
Inſtitute. The <hi>Pope,</hi> by the ſame Bull gave them
leave to make Conſtitutions, ſuch as they ſhould
think moſt proper for their own perfection, for the
Good of their Neighbour, and for the Glory of
God. It is true, that he limited the number of
the Profeſſed, and reſtrain'd them to Sixty; but
this reſtriction he took away two years after by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bull; and it was the Intereſt of Chriſtianity,
which oblig'd him ſo to do, as he himſelf declares.</p>
               <p>As ſoon, as the Holy See had approved the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Jeſus, Ignatius</hi> judged it neceſſary to begin
with chuſing a Superior; and to this effect, he called
to <hi>Rome,</hi> with leave of the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſuch of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
as were free to come; For <hi>Xaverius</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driguez</hi>
were at the Court of <hi>Portugal, Faber</hi> was
at the Dyet of <hi>Worms,</hi> and <hi>Bobadilla</hi> had Order ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
from the <hi>Pope</hi> not to leave the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples,</hi> till the buſineſs committed to him was ended.
So that theſe four Fathers aſſiſted not at the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
The two firſt left their ſuffrages behind them,
when they left <hi>Rome; Faber</hi> ſent his, and tho' <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badilla</hi>
did not do ſo, either for want of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
or for that he hoped from day to day to be
back in <hi>Rome,</hi> yet at his return, he confirm'd the
choice, which the others had made.</p>
               <p>When <hi>le Jay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ignatius</hi> is choſen General of the Society.</note> 
                  <hi>Brouet,</hi> and <hi>Laynex,</hi> were come,
they took three Days ſeriouſly to conſider, whom
they ſhould chuſe, which time they paſt in Prayer
and Recollection. The fourth Day they met, and
all the Voices were for <hi>Ignatius,</hi> except his own,
which he gave to him, who ſhould have moſt Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages,
but ſtill excepting himſelf. He did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
for any body by Name, either becauſe he could
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65023:92"/>
not decide who was moſt worthy, or that he would
not ſhew any partiality, but hold the ballance even.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereas ſome of theſe Suffrages, which every
one gave in Writing, are ſtill preſerved, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
perhaps may be curious to ſee them, as they
are taken out of the Originals.</hi> I proteſt, <hi>ſays</hi>
Francis Xaverius, <hi>in his own Tongue,</hi> that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having been ſolicited by any Perſon, I judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my Conſcience, that we ought to chuſe for
Head of our Society, our antient Superior, and true
Father, Don <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who after having gather'd
us together with ſo great pains, will beſt know how
to maintain, and govern us, as beſt knowing each
of us in particular.</p>
               <p>Our thrice honor'd Father, Don <hi>Ignatius de Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola
(ſays</hi>
John Codurus in <hi>Latin</hi>) is he, to whom I
give my voice, as having always found him inflam'd
with the Zeal of Gods Glory, and of the good of
Souls. I farther believe, that he ought to be the
Superior over the reſt, becauſe he has always made
himſelf the leaſt, and has ever been the ſervant of
us all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Suffrage of</hi> Salmeron <hi>is the moſt in Form, and
the Largeſt.</hi> In the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt (ſays he</hi>) I
<hi>Alphonſus Salmeron,</hi> moſt unworthy of this Society,
after having beſought God, and duly examin'd the
thing in queſtion as far as I am capable, do hereby
chuſe, and declare, Don <hi>Ignatius</hi> of <hi>Loyola</hi> for my
own, and the whole Societies Superior General. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
by the wiſdom, which has been Communicated to
him from above, he hath ingender'd us all in <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> and nouriſht us with Milk in our Spiritual
Infancy; now that we are grown more adult, and
ſtrong in our Lord, he will give us the Solid nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Obedience, will conduct us in the Celeſtial
Paſtures to the Fountain of life; to the end, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65023:93"/>
when he ſhall give up this ſmall Flock to the
chief Paſtor, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we may truly ſay,
We are his People, and the Sheep, which his
hand has conducted, and that he, with joy, may alſo
ſay, Lord, I have loſt none of thoſe, which you have
given me. May the Good Paſtor, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> give us all
this Grace. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ignatius <hi>afflicted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He refuſes the charge of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note> 
                  <hi>and even ſurpriz'd to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
choſen General,</hi> Brethren (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) I am not
worthy of this imployment; and I aſſure you, I
ſhall not be able to diſcharge it; For how ſhall I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
others, who am not able to conduct my ſelf. I
ſpeak to you with all poſſible ſincerity, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the diſorders of my former life, and the weakneſſes
of my preſent life, I cannot reſolve to accept of this
charge of General, wherefore I conjure you, in the
Name of God, not to take it ill, that I refuſe it, and
that you would again, for the ſpace of three or four
Days, implore the Divine aſſiſtance, ſo to enlighten
us all, that we may chuſe for our Father and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
<hi>him,</hi> who is moſt capable of well governing our
Society.</p>
               <p>Tho' this refuſal ſerv'd only to confirm them in
their firſt choice, yet in deference to him, they
ſubmitted to a new Election. After four Days of
Faſting and Pennance, he was choſen the ſecond time,
but he made a ſecond endeavor to wave the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
He ſaid, that he would put the buſineſs
into the hand of his Confeſſor, and if he, who knew
all his bad inclinations, ſhould command him, in
the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to ſubmit, he would then
blindly obey.</p>
               <p>The Fathers had great difficulty to yield to him
in it; They ſaid, that the will of God was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
manifeſted, and that it would be a kind of
oppoſing it, any longer to ballance upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65023:93"/>
But at laſt his Authority carry'd it, and he
went to find out a Religious man of the Order of
St. <hi>Francis,</hi> called Father <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> to whom he
ordinarily had uſed to Confeſs, and only left him,
ſince the Holy See had confirm'd the Inſtitute. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
expoſing to him in a private conference both
his Spiritual and Corporal Infirmities, he made his
Confeſſion to him of his whole life in the three laſt
Days of the holy Week. Father <hi>Theodoſius</hi> told
him plainly, that he reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
his Election, and commanded him, on the
part of God, to accept of the charge of General.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> did then yield,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons make their Profeſſion.</note> and out of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
took upon him the Government of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Jeſus,</hi> upon <hi>Eaſter-day</hi> in the year 1541.
at which time they all agreed to make their ſolemn
Profeſſion the ſame Week, which they did upon the
<hi>Friday</hi> following, being the <hi>22th.</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> In
this manner the Ceremony was perform'd; They
all went to viſit the Seven Churches, which are the
principal Stations of <hi>Rome:</hi> Being come to St. <hi>Pauls,</hi>
which is without the Walls of the Town, Father <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
ſaid Maſs at the Altar of our Lady. Before he
took the Communion, he turn'd towards the People,
and holding in one hand the Sacred Body of our
Lord, and in the other, his Vows in Writing, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
them all, with a loud voice, and then took
the Communion. After which, turning again to
his Companions, who were upon their Knees at
the Foot of the Altar, and holding five Hoſts upon
the Patten, he receiv'd their Profeſſions, and then
Communicated them. They all engaged, as he
did, to obſerve perpetual Poverty, Chaſtity, and
Obedience, according to the form of life contain'd
in the Bull of their Inſtitution. They promiſed
moreover a ſpecial Obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65023:94"/>
of Miſſions, ſet down in the ſaid Bull, and
they obliged themſelves to teach Children the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Doctrine.</p>
               <p>There was this difference between the Profeſſion
of Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and that of the others; He made
his Promiſe immediately to the Vicar of <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> and the reſt made theirs to him, as to their
General and Chief. The Maſs being done, they
went altogether to the great Altar, where the Bones
of the Bleſſed Apoſtles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> are laid,
and there embracing their common Father, they
humbly kiſs'd his hand, in token of their Submiſſion
and Obedience.</p>
               <p>The General began his Office with Catechizing,<note place="margin">He Catechizes with great fruit.</note>
in the Church of St. <hi>Mary de Strata,</hi> which <hi>Peter
Codacius,</hi> an Officer of the Pope, and Powerful in
<hi>Rome,</hi> caus'd to be given to the Fathers, when
they yet dwelt in an hired Houſe. This is he, who
charm'd with their holy life, quitted great Benefices,
and by a Spirit of retirement ranged himſelf among
them, with no other intent but of taking care of
their Temporals, and of procuring them Alms.</p>
               <p>Tho' the new Superior made his Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
principally for Children, according to his
Vow; yet all ſorts of People came to hear him,
even Men and Women of Quality, Divines, and
Canoniſts; He explicated in <hi>Italian</hi> the Myſteries
of Faith, and the Commandments of God, in a
plain, eaſie way, accomodated to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the People. In theſe explications he ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſome lively touches, and incitements to Piety,
and Devotion; and tho' his Language were a little
Barbarous, he made ſuch Impreſſion upon their minds,
that after having heard him, they went away in
ſilence, with Tears in their Eyes, and Compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in their Hearts: Their ſorrow was ſometimes
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65023:94"/>
ſo exceſſive, that when, after the Catechiſm, they
would go to Confeſſion, they could not ſpeak for
ſighing and weeping. He continued this Exerciſe
forty Days together in the ſame Church; and 'tis
according to this example, that the Superiors of the
Society make forty Days of Catechiſm; when they
enter into their Office.</p>
               <p>But whereas nothing was more eſſential, then
to regulate the Conduct of the Members of this
newly born Society, before making any Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in exact form, he drew up, for the preſent, ſome
general Regulations.</p>
               <p>I. That as much,<note place="margin">The firſt Rules which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd to his new Society.</note> as poſſibly they can, they ſhould
always have God before their Eyes; and that they
ſhould propoſe the life of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of their own.</p>
               <p>II. That they ſhould look upon God in their
Superiors, to execute their Orders, and to honor
their Dignity; and that they ſhould be perſwaded,
that obedience is a Guide, which never miſleads,
an Oracle, which never deceives; That they ſhould
diſcover to their Superior the bottom of their Souls,
that ſo they may be rightly directed; That they
ſhould abhor nothing more, then being their own
Guide; and that they ſhould wholly miſtruſt ſelf-love,
by ſo much more blind, by how much it
thinks it ſelf clear-ſighted.</p>
               <p>III. That in the Commerce of the World, they
ſhould uſe the circumſpection of thoſe, who ſuccor
Men that are drowning, and that they ſhould take
heed, not to loſe themſelves in the endeavoring to
ſave others; That they ſhould not only love all as
their Brothers, but that every one ſhould love his
Brother, as himſelf; That they ſhould never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
in words, with obſtinacy and heat, which
often cools Charity, if it doth not put it out, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65023:95"/>
when they differ in opinion, that the love of truth
ſhould rule their diſpute, and not the vain deſire of
getting the better.</p>
               <p>IV. That ſilence be exactly kept among them,
unleſs it be, when neceſſity obliges them to break it;
and that when they muſt ſpeak, they do it in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and Religious way; That what great things
ſoever it ſhould pleaſe God to work by their Miniſtry
they ſhould not think any thing better of themſelves,
nor Uſurp the Glory of any good Action; for the
Inſtrument is nothing by its ſelf, but derives all its
Vertue from the Arm, which Governs it; That
they ſhould reckon, Wit, Eloquence, Learning, as
nothing in compariſon of Vertue; and that they
ſhould never think themſelves better rewarded, and
paid for what they do, in behalf of their Nighbour,
then when they ſhall receive affronts, and outrages,
the only recompence which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> receiv'd
from the World for his Labours, and Sufferings.</p>
               <p>V. That if they ſhould fall into any publick fault,
which might ſeem to diſhonor them, far from loſing
courage, they ſhould give thanks to God, for having
made them know their own weakneſs, by permitting
their fall, and for having undeceiv'd the World,
which thought them to be greater Saints then they
were; and that for the future, they ſhould always have
their fall before their Eyes, to make them more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and to walk more warily; that others alſo may
learn by their example, to have a care of falling,
even when they think themſelves leaſt in danger.</p>
               <p>VI. That in the hour of Recreation after
Meals, they ſhould be mindful of that Modeſty,
which the Apoſtle requires in our converſation;
to be chearful without Levity, and to be ſober
without fullenneſs; That in their exterior Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they ſhould never let paſs the occaſions of a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65023:95"/>
preſent and certain good, out of imaginary hopes
of ſome great good to come, which is uncertain.
In concluſion, that they keep themſelves firm in
their Vocation, and continually upon their Guard,
againſt the deceits of the malignant Spirit, who
labors to draw every one out of his way, tempting
Monaſticks to outward Imployments,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons imploy'd in the Service of the Church.</note> and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
men to the repoſe of Solitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis Xaverius,</hi> for whom the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
had procured, without his knowledge, a
Brief of Legate Apoſtolical in the <hi>Indies,</hi> parted
about this time from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and left there <hi>Simon
Rodriguez.</hi> The ſame year <hi>Paul</hi> the Third ſent
<hi>Alphonſo Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Paſquir Brouet</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi>
with the Characters of <hi>Nuncius,</hi> to maintain the
Catholick Faith among thoſe People, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Edicts of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in Communion with the Holy See. The
Common-wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> demanded <hi>James Laynez,</hi>
Doctor <hi>Ortiz</hi> carry'd <hi>Peter Faber</hi> along with him
to <hi>Madrid; Nicholas Bobadilla,</hi> and <hi>Claud le Jay,</hi>
went to ſucceed in the place of <hi>Faber,</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi>
and at <hi>Ratisbone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While theſe Goſpel Laborers, animated with the
Spirit of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> were at work in ſo many different
places, for the good of Souls, <hi>Ignatius</hi> upon the
ſame account, was in his own perſon no leſs active
at <hi>Rome.</hi> Aſſiſting the ſick in the Hoſpitals, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
he found that the greateſt part of them went
not to Confeſſion, till almoſt at the hour of death,
when for the moſt part Repentance is ineffectual.
He repreſented this diſorder to the Pope, and at firſt
humbly propos'd to him, to renew the Decretal of
<hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, which Ordains, that the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
ſhall not viſit the ſick, till they have firſt been
at Confeſſion. But afterwards he judged, that to the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65023:96"/>
end ſuch a Decree might be more duly obſerv'd, it
ought to be a little moderated, ſo as it might be
lawful for the Phyſitian to make two viſits to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
before Confeſſion, but that the third ſhould be
forbidden under grievous Penalties. The Pope fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the advice of Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and this Chriſtian
practice is exactly obſerv'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> even to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> was at that time full of <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He makes the Eſtabliſhments for the Jews and Curtezans Converted.</note> and ſome of
them open'd their eyes to the Truth, ſince the new
Society explicated the Myſteries of Faith; but the
fear of Poverty hinder'd them from declaring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> offer'd his houſe to thoſe
who would be made Chriſtians, and many there
were, who abjured Judaiſm: The number of the
Converts daily increaſing by the Converſion of
ſome prime Men of the Synagogue, who diſabus'd
he reſt; he undertook to found a Houſe, where all
ſuch <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be inſtructed, who demanded
Baptiſm; and he engag'd divers Perſons of Piety to
concur in ſo holy an Eſtabliſhment. He obtain'd
of the Pope, that the <hi>Jews</hi> who were Converted,
ſhould loſe no part of their Goods, which were
lawfully gain'd; that ſuch Goods as had been gain'd
by Uſury, and of which reſtitution could not be made,
for want of knowing to whom they belong'd, ſhould
be imploy'd towards the relief of the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
and that the Children, who embraced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
againſt the will of their Parents, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit,
as if they had not chang'd their Religion.</p>
               <p>There were alſo in the City, many Maids and
Women, whom neceſſity had caſt into evil courſes;
ſome of them, who had not quite loſt the fear of
God, had a horror of their infamous life, but yet
they continu'd it, as not knowing whither to
go, or how to live. There was indeed at that time
a Monaſtery eſtabliſh'd of the <hi>Magdaleniſts;</hi> but
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65023:96"/>
they receiv'd only ſuch, as would be Religious, and
would paſs the reſt of their days in Solitude, and
Penance. Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> conſidering, that the
Grace, which excites ſinners to leave Vice, doth
not always carry them ſo far, as to leave the World,
and that the ſtate of Marriage is not conſiſtent with
that of Religion, Form'd the deſign of another
Houſe, where ſecular Maids, and Married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
might be indifferently admitted. He communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
this Project to the principal Gentlemen of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who all approv'd it, and promis'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to ſo beneficial a Foundation, provided that
ſome body would undertake to begin the Work.
The Father finding that no body would be the
firſt to embark in it, boldly began it himſelf.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Codatius,</hi> Procurator of the <hi>Caſa Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſa,</hi>
caus'd ſome great Stones to be drawn out of
the ruins of Antient Buildings, in a place belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the new Society, which ſtood before their
Church. Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> order'd him to ſell as much
as came to a hundred Duckets, and having receiv'd
the Mony, he carry'd it to thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen,
who durſt not venture to lead the Dance, in ſo Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an undertaking. <hi>If no body will be the firſt</hi>
(he ſaid ſmiling) <hi>at leaſt let ſome body ſecond me,</hi>
and threw down his Mony before them. They all
of them furniſht great Sums, and in leſs then a
Month, a Houſe was built for the Married, and
Unmarried Penitents, called the Monaſtery of
St. <hi>Martha.</hi> He carried them thither himſelf, and
was not aſhamed to appear about the Town in the
company of Publick ſinners. He was ſometimes
told that he loſt his time, and that ſuch Women
were never heartily converted. <hi>If I did hinder
them but one night from offending God</hi> (he reply'd)
<hi>I ſhould think my time, and my labour well imploy'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:65023:97"/>
He alſo took great care of young Maids,<note place="margin">He doth other works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> that
were expos'd to great hazard, either for want of
Education, or for want of means; and for theſe
he caus'd another Monaſtery to be Founded, by
the name of St. <hi>Catharine.</hi> The method which he
obſerv'd in this ſort of good Works, was firſt to
engage as many Rich and devout Perſons, as he
could; next to chuſe ſome Cardinal of great Piety
to be their Protector, and then to ſettle Truſtees
for the Temporal, and Directors for the Spiritual,
who might prudently govern ſuch Houſes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to thoſe Statutes, they ſhould agree upon:
But when the buſineſs was well Cemented, and
went currantly on, it was his cuſtom to withdraw
himſelf, that he might not give jealouſie to any body,
and to betake himſelf to ſome other work, that
might be profitable to the Publick.</p>
               <p>The next affair that he chiefly labour'd in, was
to procure a Fund for the ſubſiſtance of Orphans;
in which he alſo ſucceeded, and two Houſes were
Erected in <hi>Rome,</hi> the one for Boys, and the other
for Girls, and theſe two Eſtabliſhments, which he
regulated himſelf, have ever ſince ſubſiſted; Laſtly
he endeavor'd to purge the Town of ſome enormous
Vices, which the Corruption of the Age had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd,
and which cuſtom did in ſome manner
countenance.</p>
               <p>All theſe Actions of Charity did not ſo take him
up,<note place="margin">He begins to write the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of his Order.</note> but that even then he apply'd himſelf to Model
the Conſtitutions of his Order. He employ'd many
hours of the day upon it, and ſome part of the
Night. His Method was this, Firſt he Examin'd
every Article according to the Rules of good Sence,
and ſet down all the Reaſons <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con.</hi> Theſe
Reaſons were neither few in number, nor light in
ſubſtance; for upon one only Point, which is none
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65023:97"/>
of the moſt important, there have been found in his
Papers written with his own Hand, Eight Reaſons
for one ſide, and Fifteen for the other; every one
of them of weight, and capable of holding the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in ſuſpence. After this, laying aſide all
Self-love, and private Intereſt, he exactly weighed
all the Reaſons of each ſide, one againſt the other,
the better to diſcern which were the weakeſt, and
which the ſtrongeſt.</p>
               <p>After having done all that Prudence requir'd, he
conſulted God with the ſimplicity of an Infant; as
if he had nothing to do, but to write down that
which God ſhould dictate to him. Viewing it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all over again by the light of eternal Verities,
he ſupplicated <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by the Interceſſion of
the Holy Virgin, to make him ſee what ſhould be
moſt conducing to the Service of his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and to the good of the Society.</p>
               <p>Tho' ſometimes he found his Judgment ſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to one ſide, as ſeemingly to exclude all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of doubt, he would nevertheleſs continue his
Prayers, that he might more diſtinctly know what
was beſt; inſomuch that upon a certain occaſion,
when he had taken his laſt Reſolution in a Matter
before him, after ten days of Communication with
God, he made his Prayer again upon the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
and Meditated farther upon it thirty days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
All this while the Matter was not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable;
it was only to determine, Whether the
Churches of the Profeſs'd Houſes ſhould have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
or whether they ſhould be maintain'd by
the Charity of the Faithful.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when he had written a Conſtitution, he
laid it upon the Altar when he ſaid Maſs, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
it to God together with the Divine Sacrifice;
to the end, that the Father of Lights would caſt his
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65023:98"/>
Eyes upon it, and make him know whether it were
conſonant to the Rules of Evangelical Perfection.
He did this in imitation of the holy Pope St. <hi>Leo,</hi>
who before he ſent to the Biſhop <hi>Flavian</hi> the Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Epiſtle which he had written againſt the
Hereſie of <hi>Eutiches,</hi> laid it upon the Altar of the
Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and there kept it Fourty days,
Faſting all that time, and inceſſantly praying the
Prince of the Apoſtles to Correct it himſelf, and
with his own Hand to blot out all that ſhould not
be Orthodox.</p>
               <p>The interior Anſwers which the Holy Ghoſt
made to Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> gave him at leaſt an intire
aſſurance, and a perfect quiet in his Underſtanding,
concerning the Reſolution he had made. Wherefore
having one day asked Father <hi>Laynez,</hi> if he did not
think that God had reveal'd to Founders of Orders
the Form of their Inſtitute; and Father <hi>Laynez</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
anſwer'd him, That it ſeem'd very probable
to him, at leaſt in regard of the Eſſentials. <hi>I am of
your opinion</hi> (reply'd the Saint); and it was, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, his own Experience that made him
judge ſo.</p>
               <p>He began the Platform of which we ſpeak,<note place="margin">The End of the Society of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                  </note> with
ſetting down the End of his Order, which he made
to be not only (with the aſſiſtance of God's Grace)
to ſave and cultivate their own Soul, but alſo, with
the help of the ſame Grace, to employ all their
might for the Salvation and Perfection of their
Neighbour: For he would have it, that theſe two
ſhould make but one, and the only end of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and ſhould equally depend one on the other;
being perſwaded, that as nothing contributes more
to our own ſanctification, then to devote our ſelves
intirely to the ſaving of Souls, ſo on the other ſide,
nothing renders us more fit and proper to ſave
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65023:98"/>
Souls,<note place="margin">The Means which the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety makes uſe of to obtain their end.</note> then the ſanctifying of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Having eſtabliſht the End, he thought upon the
Means which were neceſſary to obtain it; and he
ſet before his Eyes the two different Forms of Life:
the one of which, by the Model of <hi>Martha,</hi> is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
employ'd in the Service of our Neighbour; and
the other, by that of <hi>Magdalen,</hi> is wholly taken up
with the Repoſe of Contemplation. He eaſily
diſcern'd, that the Functions of theſe two States,
taken in ſeveral, and in the whole extent, did not
agree with his Deſign; and that he ought to chuſe
that which was beſt out of them both, and ſo even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to mingle them, that they ſhould help, and not
hinder one the other: for in concluſion, as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
as there is between <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi>
they are ſtill Siſters, and not Enemies.</p>
               <p>He took therefore out of the Contemplative Life,
Mental Prayer, the Examens of Conſcience, the
Reading of the Holy Scriptures, the Frequentation
of Sacraments, Spiritual Retirements, the Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Preſence of God, and ſuch other Practices
of Devotion.</p>
               <p>He took out of the Active Life, all that might
contribute to ſave, and bring to perfection our
Neighbours Souls; Preaching, Catechiſing, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as well amongſt the Faithful, as amongſt the
Infidels, maintaining Controverſies againſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
Entertainments of Devotion with ſecular
Perſons, Viſiting Priſons and Hoſpitals, the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Conſciences, and the Inſtruction of Youth.
But this laſt he moſt particularly regarded; for in
that general Corruption which then reign'd, he
thought he could no better way reform the World,
then by infuſing the love of Vertue into Children,
before they had contracted evil Habits. He hoped
that thee young Plants growing up with Chriſtian
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65023:99"/>
Impreſſions, would make Innocence flouriſh again
in all States and Conditions of Civil Life: And he
doubted not, but theſe firſt Seeds of Piety would
continue in them as long as they liv'd, tho' poſſibly
they might be ſmother'd for a time by thoſe Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which the heat of Youth doth commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender.</p>
               <p>It may be alſo, that being inform'd how the
new Hereſiarchs took the way of perverting Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and how one of their falſe Doctors of <hi>Geneva</hi>
taught them Songs againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, he
would employ the ſame Means to maintain <hi>Religion,</hi>
which they made uſe of to deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>But foreſeeing that there would be no great
Concourſe to the Schools of the Society, if only
Piety, and nothing elſe ſhould there be taught; and
conſidering on the other ſide, that the Univerſities
were daily infected with the Venom of Hereſie, he
conceived, that to draw Scholars, and to keep them
from Error, it was neceſſary to hold publick Schools,
where all Sciences proper for Religious Men to
teach, might be taught <hi>gratis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, for the firſt four or five years after the
Confirmation of the Order, the Children were
only inſtructed in their Catechiſm. The firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were ſo full of other Employments, that they
could not keep Schools, and thoſe who were aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
to them, had not ability at firſt to do it. The
General would have them finiſh their own Studies
in Philoſophy, Divinity, and the Holy Scripture,
before they were employ'd to Teach. And thence it
comes, that the firſt Colledges of the Society were
only for teaching the young Men of their own Body.</p>
               <p>It was to facilitate the uſe of all theſe Means,<note place="margin">The Society has no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Habit.</note> ſo
proportionate to the End of an Apoſtolical Calling,
that Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> made choice of a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65023:99"/>
Life, according to the Model of that of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Whereas he was a Prieſt, and that his
Order was no other then a Congregation of Prieſts
or Regular Clericks, he appointed no other Habit
for his Religious, then what was us'd by Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Perſons; nor did he preſcribe to them any
ſuch Uniformity of Habit, as was us'd in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Societies: He only order'd in general, that
theirs ſhould be decent, according to the Uſage of
the Country, but ſuch as ſhould not be contrary
to Religious Poverty. The Deſign which he had to
Convert all Men, if it were poſſible, made him
judge, that the Society having to treat often with
Hereticks and Libertines, who are apt to deride the
holy Habits of other Orders, it was moſt expedient
for them, not to take any, that was remarkable and
ſingular, that ſo they might have freer acceſs every
where.</p>
               <p>He regulated the Lodging,<note place="margin">The Society has no Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> Diet, and the reſt, as
he did the Habit, according to the Laws of Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Poverty. This Principle of a Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Life, determin'd him alſo not to command in
his Rule any Auſterity by Obligation. He well
knew, that Religious Societies are compos'd of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who are not all of the ſame Conſtitution or
Age; that when Auſterities are of Obligation, they
muſt have recourſe to Diſpenſations, in favour of
Perſons infirm, or Aged; and that Diſpenſations,
how legitimate ſoever they may be, have almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
troubleſom Conſequences.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, he foreſaw that the Macerations
of the Body, Eſtabliſht by the ancient Founders of
Orders, according to the Form of their Inſtitute,
would be great Obſtacles to the Functions and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of his. And yet, in not preſcribing any ſet
meaſure of Pennances for all in his Society, he doth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65023:100"/>
not pretend to exclude all Auſterities; On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he will have every one mortifie his Body as
much as his Health and his Employment will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
But leſt Self-love ſhould hold back, or Fervor
ſhould too much drive on, he appoints that Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
ſhall be Judges in theſe Matters, who conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on one ſide the End of the Inſtitute, to which
all the Means muſt be ſubordinate; and on the other
ſide, the Conſtitution and Strength of the ſeveral
Perſons, are to keep a Mean between a Relaxation
hurtful to the Soul, and an Exceſs ruinous to the
Body.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding his Devotion to hear the Praiſes
of God Sung,<note place="margin">Why the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety doth not keep Quires.</note> and his Veneration for thoſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Perſons who Sing them Night and Day, yet the
Injunction of keeping Quires he left out of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
upon conſideration that the Employments of his
Inſtitute, were incompatible with that pious Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
which however is not eſſential to a Religious
Profeſſion; for the Military Orders, and thoſe which
are employ'd upon Works of Mercy, have no Quire;
even the Order of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> it ſelf had none at
the beginning; and in the moſt reform'd Orders,
Maſters of Divinity, Preachers, and Miſſioners are
therein diſpenced. The Authority of the holy Pope
St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> who in a Council at <hi>Rome</hi> forbids
Deacons that are Preachers, to Sing: And that of
St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who teacheth, that it is better to raiſe
mens Hearts to Heaven only by the Miniſtry of
the Word of God, then by Singing and Muſick,
did not a little ſerve to confirm St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> in this
Reſolution. And it may be ſaid, that in reſerving
himſelf wholly for Evangelical Functions, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſays of himſelf,
<hi>That Jeſus Chriſt did not ſend him to Baptize, but
to Preach.</hi> Not but that it was a holy and laudable
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65023:100"/>
Action to Baptize, but in regard he had been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to publiſh the Goſpel, and there wanted not
others to confer Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Whereas the divers Employments of a Society,<note place="margin">How Perſons are to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and what hinders from being receiv'd into the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note>
devoted to the good of Souls, would require excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Workmen, the Founder did forecaſt all that
was neceſſary thereunto. For in the firſt place he
ordain'd, that good choice ſhould be made of thoſe
who are received; and he ſets down himſelf the
principal Qualities which they ought to have; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others, a good Nature, a good Wit, a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Conſtitution, a Body well made, and a fair Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:
As for Nobility, and the Advantages of
Fortune, he reckons them as nothing, if the reſt be
wanting: But he would have them conſider'd, when
they are joyn'd with Talents requiſite; and for this
Reaſon, becauſe Men of great Birth, and ſuch as have
been conſiderable in the World, are very proper
to be hearkned to by the People, to ſpeak to Great
Men, and to maintain the Intereſt of the Church.</p>
               <p>He excludes thoſe, who having been born <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
ſhall have abjured their Faith among Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
or held publickly Heretical Opinions. To
whom he adds Infamous Perſons, and ſuch as have
been Convicted of enormous Crimes; all Perſons
ſubject to Lunacy, or Diſtempers of the Brain;
Laſtly, all thoſe who have worn the Habit of an
Hermit, or of any Religious Order, tho' but for a
day. And all thoſe Excluſions are grounded upon
this, that St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> requir'd for his Inſtitute, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Religion well ſettled in the Heart, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
Reputation, a ſound Judgment, and a Will
conſtant in the good Courſe which once it hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Impediments, which are not ſo Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential,
but that the Holy See may diſpence with
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65023:101"/>
them for juſt Cauſes, and in extraordinary Caſes,
there are others of leſs Conſequence, which the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
themſelves, according to diſcretion, may
diſpence withal; as being, for Example, under Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of age, or above Fifty; having violent
Paſſions, bad Habits, indiſcreet Devotions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To have a perfect knowledge of thoſe who Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
themſelves, the Founder requires, and directs a
very exact Scrutiny, even to know whether they be
born in lawful Wedlock; Whether they be only
Sons; What their Family is; If they have any
Engagement upon them, either by Holy Orders,
or by Promiſe of Marriage, or by Vow.</p>
               <p>Above all, he recommends, that their inward
Diſpoſitions ſhould be narrowly look'd into, and
chiefly that their Vocation ſhould be well Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd;
Whether, ſince their being call'd, they
had not chang'd their mind, or ſuffer'd their holy
Deſires to grow cold; Whether any of the Society
had not allur'd them; And in ſuch caſe, tho' it
might have been done with good intention, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that a reaſonable time ought to be given
them, to re-conſider upon ſo important an Affair,
by the only Rule of Gods greater Glory, and as if
no perſon had ever mention'd it to them.</p>
               <p>But to draw out of this Examen the deſir'd Effect,
he requires from thoſe who are Interrogated, a great
openneſs and freedom, and preſcribes to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
a profound Secrecy. Laſtly, when after all
theſe Interrogatories, the Perſons are judg'd proper
for the Inſtitute, he will have them, before they are
received, made to underſtand, that if they ſincerely
deſire to be admitted, they muſt be ready wholly
and intirely to Conſecrate themſelves to God.
Moreover, he preſcribes, that the moſt humiliating
and painful part of a Religious Profeſſion, ſhould be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65023:101"/>
propos'd to them, and even that they ſhould be ask'd
whether they will be content to be admoniſh'd, not
only of all the Faults that ſhall be obſerv'd in them,
but that whoever ſhall know their Faults by any
other way but by Confeſſion, ſhall inform the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
that he may correct them; and whether they
themſelves be diſpos'd to inform him, with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Charity, of the Faults of others, when he
ſhall ask them, to the greater Glory of God.</p>
               <p>The Choice being thus made,<note place="margin">In what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Novices are to be try'd and train'd.</note> the Saint will
have trial made of the Perſons ſo choſen, after this
manner. That upon receiving them into the
Houſe, they enter into the Spiritual Exerciſe, and
that after a whole Month of retirement, without
any Communication whatſoever, but with their
Director, they ſhall make a general Confeſſion of
their whole Life.</p>
               <p>After this, they ſhall take the ordinary Habit of
the Society, unleſs it be judged expedient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
them in their ſecular Attire, as the Saint him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
order'd it, in the caſe of <hi>Antonio Araos,</hi> his
Kinſman, and of a <hi>Neopolitan</hi> Gentleman, who
had been Captain of the Caſtle of St. <hi>Elm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Noviciate ſhall laſt two years, becauſe
a leſs time of tryal will not ſuffice for thoſe, who
being deſign'd for outward employments, have need
of a great ſtock of Vertue.</p>
               <p>That during the Noviceſhip, beſides learning
every day ſomething without Book to cultivate the
memory, which loſeth its vigor for want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
they ſhall not ſtudy at all.</p>
               <p>They ſhall ſerve the Sick in ſome Hoſpital for
the ſpace of a Month; the ſame ſpace of time they
ſhall alſo ſpend in making ſome Pilgrimage of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
a Foot, without <hi>Viaticum,</hi> begging Alms.
Inquiry ſhall be made of the Adminiſtrators of the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65023:102"/>
Hoſpital, how the Novices behave themſelves, and
alſo in the places, through which they paſs, what
their comportment was.</p>
               <p>That being well inſtructed themſelves, they
ſhall teach the Chriſtian Doctrine to Children, and
to the meaner ſort of People, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be accuſtom'd to it. Laſtly, that they ſhall
be only employ'd in the Practices of a Spiritual life,
and that their whole care muſt be, to acquire ſolid
Vertue, particularly Humility, and Self-abnegation.</p>
               <p>Whereas Piety alone is not ſufficient for Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Functions,<note place="margin">The Order of Studies for thoſe who have ended their Noviceſhip.</note> Learning being abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for them, he Ordains that after the two years of
Noviceſhip, they ſhall apply themſelves to Study:
He ſets down the Sciences which they ſhall learn,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Learned Tongues, Poetry, Rhetorick,
Phyloſophy, Divinity, Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, the
Holy Scripture: But he leaves it to the prudence of
Superiors, to regulate the Studies of every one in
particular, according to their Age and Talents;
ſo that ſuch Wits, as are capable of all, ſhall be train'd
in all the Sciences, and ſuch as are not ſo univerſal
ſhall learn that in which they are likelieſt to excel.</p>
               <p>But ſome Rules he ſets down, which are to be
fix'd and univerſal; he will have them inſtructed
in Grammar, Poetry, and Rhetorick, before they
begin their Phyloſophy; That they ſhall not Study
Scholaſtical Divinity, before they have finiſh'd
their courſes in Logick, Phyſick, Metaphyſick,
and Moral Phyloſophy, nor be apply'd to caſes of
Conſcience, till they have had an entrance in Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical
Divinity. That they ſhall not proceed
from one Science to another, till they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
a rigorous Examen; that in each Faculty,
they follow the beſt grounded opinions, and the moſt
approved Authors, that in ſtudying the holy
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65023:102"/>
Tongues, their aim muſt be, throughly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Scripture, and alſo to defend the verſion,
Authoriz'd by the Church. The want of method,
which <hi>Ignatius</hi> found ſo prejudicial in his Study at
<hi>Alcala,</hi> and the danger, which the reading of a
ſuſpected Author expos'd him to, made him uſe all
theſe Precautions.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe remember'd, how his Exerciſes of
Charity, and ill-tim'd Devotion, had hindred his
progreſs in Learning; He therefore order'd that the
Students of the Society ſhould not be employ'd
abroad; that the time of their Prayers ſhould be
limited, and that they ſhould not receive the Order
of Prieſthood, till towards the latter end of their
Studies.</p>
               <p>Moreover whereas his Infirmities and Sickneſs
had much obſtructed his own advancement in the
Sciences,<note place="margin">The care of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> for the health and progreſs of Students.</note> he thought it very material to take great
care of their Health, that their application ſhould
not be too violent, that they loſt none of their ſleep:
That they ſhould not Study at unſeaſonable hours,
nor be longer at it then two hours together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
interruption. He order'd for them days of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
and even from that time, deſign'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Houſes in the Country; where they might go
once every Week for their Diverſion.</p>
               <p>And in regard, that the extream Poverty, to which
he had been reduc'd in the Univerſity at <hi>Paris,</hi> was
one of the greateſt obſtacles in his Studies; He
thought it not expedient to oblige thoſe, who Study
to live upon Alms, and therefore reſolv'd, that ſuch
Colledges of the Society ſhould have Foundations.</p>
               <p>But if on one ſide, he hath ſo great conſideration
and Indulgence, for the young Men of his Order.
He is no leſs ſtrict on the other, to have them kept
cloſe to their buſineſs. He will have them take pains
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65023:103"/>
and labour at it, always to be Exerciſed, either in
private Conferences, or in publick Diſputations. He
chargeth the Rectors of Colledges to excite and
ſpur on thoſe, that are heavy and ſlothful, and to
withdraw ſuch from the Study of Sciences, who
make no progreſs in them, either for want of wit, or
application; Laſtly, to have continually his Eye
upon them, and even to obſerve whether their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
do their duty.</p>
               <p>But to prevent,<note place="margin">Piety joyn'd with Study in the Society.</note> leaſt the love of Science ſhould
inſenſibly weaken the Spirit of Devotion, he fail'd
not to preſcribe divers means for the maintenance
and increaſe of it; of which the Principal are, to
frequent the Sacraments once a Week, to examin
their Conſcience twice a Day, to make every Year
the Spiritual Exerciſe, and to renew their Vows
twice in the Year, with great Preparatives, that is
to ſay, during three days of Retirement, of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
of extraordinary Penance; of a ſincere
declaration of their inward ſtate to their Superior,
and a general Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>But judging it almoſt impoſſible, that much Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and ſpeculation ſhould not in time cauſe ſome
diſſipation, and drineſs in that Unction, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which belongs to a Religious life, he advis'd of an
expedient, altogether new, to reform the inward man,
when their Studies were ended. To which purpoſe,
he appointed a third year of Noviceſhip, in which
they ſhould wholly apply themſelves to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
of a Spiritual life, without the leaſt attention
to human Learning. Whereas this ſecond Novice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is the laſt tryal of thoſe that are admitted into
the Society, the Saint would have them exerciſed
more then ever, in all thoſe things that may improve
them in the contempt of the World, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
That, only minding Prayer, and the reading
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65023:103"/>
of ſuch Books, as may render them more Devout,
and not more Learned, they ſhould be employ'd to
teach the Chriſtian Doctrine, and perform their
Miſſions in Towns and Villages.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ways, by which the General of the
new Society, intended to form Apoſtolical Men,
that ſhould be eminent in Science, and Vertue;
So that his firſt intention was, to raiſe ſuch accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
Workmen; But Nature, which tends to
perfection in all its works, doth not always arrive
to it. He diſcern'd that of many Perſons, who were
admitted, ſome there would be, who for want of
natural Talents, or of Qualities acquir'd, would
not come up to that perfection, which the Inſtitute
requires: He alſo at the ſame time comprehended,
that the productions of Nature, which are not the
moſt perfect, ceas'd not however to be profitable;
and that an indifferent Talent, well manag'd,
might ſerve to great things; and that Workmen,
who are not excelling, may aid and aſſiſt the great
Maſters.</p>
               <p>To this end,<note place="margin">The different Degrees in the Society.</note> he conſtituted two different degrees
in his Order; one of the Profeſt, and the other of
Spiritual Coadjutors. The Profeſt make publickly
the three ſolemn Vows of Religion, and add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
one of ſpecial Obedience to the Head of the
Church, in regard of Miſſions among the Faithful,
and Infidels. The Coadjutors alſo make in publick
the Vows of Chaſtity, Poverty, and Obedience; But
they make not the fourth concerning Miſſions. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
from this conſtitution of ſeveral Degrees, that
there are three ſtates in the Society, not to ſpeak of
Lay Brothers, who are called Temporal Coadjutors.
The firſt is of Scholars approv'd, ſo they are called
who are in the <hi>Way,</hi> during their Studies; The
ſecond is of Spiritual Coadjutors; And the third of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65023:104"/>
Fathers Profeſt, both which laſt, are come to their
<hi>Station.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas the State of Tryal doth not imply a
certain and fix'd Scituation, St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> judged,
that the Society, propoſing to themſelves to try
their Scholars, ought not to be oblig'd or bound to
them, but under conditions; but, whereas it was
incongruous that young Men ſhould ſo long remain
at liberty, and Maſters of themſelves, he judged,
that for their particular good, and for that of the
whole Body, they ought, on their part, to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
ingag'd to the Society, by promiſing to
live and die there, in the obſervance of the Vows
of Poverty, Chaſtity, and Obedience; and alſo
by tying themſelves in a Vow expreſs, to accept
of any ſuch degree, as ſhould afterwards be found
to be ſuitable for them.</p>
               <p>By the Vows of Chaſtity, of Poverty, and of
Obedience, the Founder unites them to the Society,
and makes them truly Religious men, ſince the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of a Religious State conſiſts in the Promiſe,
which is made to God, of perpetually obſerving the
Evangelical Councils, as much as lies in us. But
in ordaining, that the Vows of the Scholars ſhould
be ſimple Vows, he leaves to the Society, under the
good pleaſure of the Pope, the Power of Diſpenſing
with them. By this means, he leaves to the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
themſelves the right and property of their
Goods, tho' he takes from them the power of uſing
and diſpoſing of them, independently of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors:
and this is an uſage, receiv'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and in all other Countries, except
in <hi>France,</hi> where the Parliaments have not thought
fit to permit, what the Holy See, and the Council
of <hi>Trent</hi> have granted, in approving the Inſtitute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:65023:104"/>
As for the Fathers profeſt, who make the Eſſential
part of the Society, the Saint obliges them to an
exact obſervance of Evangelical Poverty; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that the Profeſt Houſes ſhall have no Revenue,
tho' Noviciates, and Colledges ought to have them,
in regard that it is not juſt for Novices, and Scholars
to live at the charge of the publick, before they are
in a condition of ſerving it; not to ſay any thing of
the hindrance, which the care of a livelihood might
bring to their Devotions and Studies.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, conſidering that Poverty is as
it were the Bulwark of a Religious State, and that
the moſt flouriſhing Orders, are almoſt fallen to Ruin,
for not having well obſerv'd it, he ordains that the
Profeſt ſhall make a particular Vow, never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to change any thing in the Society, in relation
to Poverty, unleſs it be, to make it ſtricter then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>After having made ſo many Ordinances concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Diſpoſition and Form of the whole Body,<note place="margin">The General of the Society Perpetual and Abſolute.</note>
he made others relating to the Head, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
He decreed in the firſt place, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſhould be Perpetual and Abſolute, according to
what he and his Companions had agreed upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Society was approv'd by the Holy See; and
many reaſons determin'd him to it.</p>
               <p>As to the perpetuity, he thought that the firſt
Charge being once fill'd, and not to be vacant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Death of the Incumbent, there would be
no ground for a Temptation in any, to aſpire to it;
That it would be leſs difficult to find one Man, that
was capable of the place, then to find many;
That a General, who is only temporary, can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
no great thing in the Service of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
great enterprizes require a conſiderable time
to have them well executed; Laſtly, That perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65023:105"/>
draws Reverence and Submiſſion from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors,
by giving the Superior a Character in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible.</p>
               <p>As to the Authority of the General, he will have
it to be Abſolute, and he leaves him the Power of
making Provincials, Superiors of Profeſt Houſes,
and Rectors of Colledges, and Noviciates. The aim
of the Saint was, to keep all the Members in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
dependance of the Head, and to free the Body
of the Society, as much as might be, from thoſe
Commotions, which almoſt always precede, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
Capitular Elections; and ſo to contrive it,
that this firſt Superior, being at a diſtance from the
greateſt part of his Subjects, might Govern with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Paſſion, and without any other Intereſt, but that
of the Order.</p>
               <p>And to the end, that the General may have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ſo many Perſons, whom he never ſees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that the Subordinate Superiors give him an
Account in general every year of thoſe, that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their charge, they alſo ſend him, from three years
to three years, Catalogues of every Province, in which
are ſet down the Age of every one, their Ability, their
natural Tallents, their advancement in Learning
and in Vertue, in a word, all their good or bad Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:
And leaſt ſuch faithful Memories ſhould be
loſt, or ſhould fall into the hands of Strangers, a
Deputy, elected by the Provincial Congregation,
which is held every three years in all the Provinces,
and which is compos'd of the Rectors, and of the
moſt Ancient Profeſt, carries theſe Catalogues to
<hi>Rome,</hi> with Inſtructions to inform the General of
the State and Condition of the Province, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
him.</p>
               <p>Moreover there are extraordinary occaſions, in
which Informations are made, of the life and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65023:105"/>
of particular Perſons, the better to inform the
General, and this is done when any are to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Degrees, or to Superiorſhips in the Society. But
to the end, that theſe Informations may be certain
and true, or ſuch at leaſt, as that out of them, he
may be able to collect the very Truth, they are
made in great ſecrecy, by three different Perſons,
who are to have no Communication upon the matter,
nor one to know what the other doth: So that the
General, joyning all theſe Reports together, and
confronting the particular Informations with the
aforeſaid Catalogues, may eaſily enough know,
what his Inferiors are capable of.</p>
               <p>This firſt Superior would not be able to fulfil his
Office, if he had not Talents proportionable to a
charge of ſo great extent. Wherefore St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>
in his conſtitutions draws the Caracter of a General,
by marking down all the Qualities, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
in him; one may ſay that he drew himſelf
to the life, not knowing what he did: But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Idea which he had of himſelf, was ſo far
diſtant from that, which he fram'd of a General,
we are not to wonder, if he judg'd himſelf ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of that Office.</p>
               <p>The General therefore, according to the Saints
Idea, ought to be in a cloſe Union with God, in all
his Exerciſes of Piety, and in all the Actions of his
Life, to obtain from his Divine Majeſty a plentiful
ſupply of Grace for the whole Body of the Society,
and that he would be graciouſly pleas'd to bleſs the
means and endeavours of his Servants in the gaining
of Souls. It is moreover neceſſary, that by his example,
he ſhould animate his Subjects to the practice of all
ſorts of Vertues; that Charity to our Neighbour
ſhould eminently appear in his Actions, with a true
humility, to render him acceptable to God and to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65023:106"/>
Men; that he muſt have no irregular Paſſion; and
that he be ſo compos'd in his exterior, ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
in his words, that nothing may be obſerv'd,
neither in his Perſon, nor in his Conduct, but what
is winning and edifying.</p>
               <p>He ought ſo well to temper Severity with Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as never to relent, or to recede, from what he
judges moſt conformable to the will of God; and
that he ſhew ſuch tenderneſs to his ſubjects, that
even they, whom he reprehends, or puniſheth, may
be ſenſible of his Charity and Equity, how greivous
ſoever his reprehenſion or puniſhment ſhould be to
them.</p>
               <p>He had need of no common ſtrength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
to bear with the Infirmities of his Inferiors;
to undertake and execute the moſt difficult things
for the Service of God, and to be Proof againſt the
Menaces, or the Intreaties of the Powers of the
Earth; neither to be dejected by croſs Accidents,
nor to be elevated with favourable; always Maſter
of himſelf, and of his Buſineſs; and always ready to
ſuffer death for the good of the Society, when the
Honor of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall require it.</p>
               <p>It is moreover neceſſary, that there be joyn'd
in him a ſolid Judgment with a clear-ſighted Wit,
that he may be able to carry himſelf equally well,
in Matters of Speculation and of Practice. And
tho' the Head of ſo many Learned Men muſt have
no common ſhare of Learning, yet the Science of
the Saints is that which is moſt neceſſary for him,
to diſcern the divers interior Spirits, and to cure the
ſpiritual Diſeaſes of thoſe whom he Governs.</p>
               <p>Yet there will be requir'd in him great Prudence
and Sagacity, for the management of ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Affairs, both within and without his Society;
which Prudence muſt be accompanied with no leſs
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65023:106"/>
Vigilance, to lay hold on all occaſions of acting for
the good of his Community, and for the Glory of
God; and with equal Vigor to proſecute, and to
finiſh what he undertakes.</p>
               <p>For what concerns the Age, the Exterior, and
the Health of a General, they muſt be ſuch as may
ſuit with the Authority, the Dignity, and with the
Burden of his Office, that he may worthily perform
all the Duties of it, to the greater Glory of God.
Greatneſs of Birth, Titles of Honor, and Riches
formerly enjoy'd in the World, are Qualities not
to be neglected in him. But above all, regard muſt
be had, that he who is elected, have a clear Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and not the leaſt flaw in his paſt Conduct.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he muſt be of the number of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd;
and that, if he hath not all the Talents that
were to be deſir'd in him, he be at leaſt furniſh'd
with an exact Probity, a good Judgment, a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
proportionable to his Employment, and a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Love for the Society.</p>
               <p>But St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> judging that the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht
Perſon could not ſuffice alone, to do all that
was neceſſary in a Government of ſo great extent,
aſſigns to the General four or five Perſons of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated
Experience, and of indefatigable Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
to be his Coadjutors, whom he calls <hi>Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;</hi>
and they bear the Name of the Kingdom
or Country from whence they come: for Example,
of <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and of
<hi>Portugal.</hi> Each of theſe has the care of preparing
the Matters of his Aſſiſtancy, and of putting them
in ſuch an order as may facilitate their Expedition.
'Tis by them that the Inferiors and the Superiors
within their Diſtrict, regularly make their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the General; I ſay regularly, for if any of
theſe Aſſiſtants be upon a juſt ground ſuſpected,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65023:107"/>
they may Apply immediately to the Head.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">How the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the General is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd.</note> the Founder, upon reflection that the
General might poſſibly at ſome time make ill uſe
of his Sovereign Authority, thought fit to qualifie
the Generalſhip with ſome Counterpoizes or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectives.
For which end, theſe Aſſiſtants are not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
by the General, but by a general Congregation
of the whole Society, which alſo chuſes the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
And tho' they be particularly eſtabliſht to eaſe
and aſſiſt him in his Charge, yet they are alſo, in
ſome ſort, to obſerve his Conduct; ſo that in caſe
he ſhould commit a ſcandalous Fault, or ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate
the Revenue of Colledges, or ſhould ſwerve
from the ſound Doctrine of the Faithful, they may
againſt his Will call a general Congregation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him, according to Form; or if the Evil be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and will not admit of ſo much delay, they
have power to depoſe him themſelves, after having
firſt by Letters taken the Suffrages of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>So that, as abſolute as the General of the Society
is, his Power is no longer in aſſurance then his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
is regular. And upon this account it is, that
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> has order'd, That the Provincial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
which are held every three years, ſhould
in the firſt place deliberate, Whether there be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of aſſembling a general Congregation; That
the Deputies of each Province, when arriv'd at
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould confer together upon this nice Point,
without the participation of the General; and that
in the Aſſembly which is held upon this Subject,
every one ſhould give his Vote in Writing, to the
end, that being ſecret, the Suffrages might be free.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, the General has always near him, as
alſo the other Superiors have, a Perſon diſcreet and
vertuous, from whom upon occaſions he is to receive
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65023:107"/>
Admonitions. This Perſon, who is choſen by the
general Congregation, is to repreſent to the General,
what he or the Aſſiſtants ſhall obſerve to be Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in his Government, or in his Perſon; but he
muſt do it with all poſſible Reſpect and Moderation.</p>
               <p>After all theſe Precautions and Preſervatives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ill Conſequences that poſſibly may attend
the Abſoluteneſs of a ſingle Perſon,<note place="margin">The Union of the Members with their Head, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> in a Religious
Society, the Saint in the next place provides Means
to preſerve the neceſſary Union which the Members
ought to have with their Head, and among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
without which no Body, whether Natural or
Politick, can ſubſiſt; And theſe are many. 1. That
the General ſhould have a fix'd Habitation, and that
his ordinary Reſidence ſhould be at <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſo
an eaſie Communication may be held with him from
all the Parts of the World. 2. That the Provincials
and Rectors ſhould write very often to him, that is
to ſay, every Week, if conveniently it might be
done, or at the leaſt every Month. 3. That every
particular Perſon may Addreſs to him when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as a Child to his Parent, to open to him his
Wants, or tell him his Grievances, and that he
ſhould treat him in a tender and Fatherly way.
4. That Obedience being the Bond which moſt of
all unites the Members with the Head, it ſhould be
preſerv'd in its full vigor; that a perfect depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
ſhould be exacted from the ſubordinate Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
upon thoſe who are immediately above
them; and that according to the Rules of Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
the Rectors ſhould not be leſs ſubject to the
Provincials, and the Provincials to the General, then
each particular Perſon is to the one or to the other.
5. That notwithſtanding the diverſity of Climates,
and the antipathy of Nations, they ſhould obſerve
every where the ſame form of Life; That every
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65023:108"/>
one ſhould prevent his Brother in good Offices, and
kindly treat him upon all occaſions; That they
ſhould expreſs a particular affection to Strangers;
and in concluſion, That all Breakers of Fraternal
Charity ſhould be rigorouſly puniſhed.</p>
               <p>But to hinder the Body from altering and decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Time,<note place="margin">Means found out by St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> to preſerve the Society.</note> he found out two Expedients very
efficacious. The firſt conſiſts in Expelling all ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
or incorrigible Perſons, and ſuch who make
Diſſention, or machinate, or contrive any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Order. And the Saint Ordains, That no
regard ſhould be had either to their Birth or to their
Learning; nor that the General himſelf ſhould be
ſpared, if found guilty of ſuch Miſdemeanors. He
alſo Wills, That ſuch Perſons, who through their
Lazineſs are wholly uſeleſs; and ſuch who have
eſſential Impediments, which at firſt they did not
diſcover, ſhould be Diſcarded. But he will have
Rules obſerv'd in the Diſmiſſion of all ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
That no body ſhould be put out without a
manifeſt Cauſe, and mature Deliberation; That
the Scholars approv'd, and the Spiritual Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
ſhould in ſuch Caſe have Diſpenſations from
their Vows, which being only ſimple, are diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
And if at their Entrance, or afterwards,
they have given any thing to the Society, it ſhould
be punctually reſtor'd to them; That care be had
to ſave the Reputation, as much as may be, of ſuch
as are Diſmiſſed; and that if the Fault for which
they are Excluded be not of it ſelf notorious, it
ſhould be kept ſecret.</p>
               <p>He will not have them Expell'd only for Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Infirmities, eſpecially if they be contracted ſince
their Admiſſion. In concluſion, he Orders, That
when any one is to be Diſmiſs'd, the Superiors
ſhould uſe the ſame Precautions which skilful Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65023:108"/>
are wont to have, when a Leg or an Arm
is to be cut off.</p>
               <p>The Second extraordinary Means which St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
has contriv'd, to make his Order continue
and flouriſh, is to Exclude all Ambition, and to
keep their beſt Subjects within the Body, by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Profeſs'd to make a Vow, never to ſeek
after any Superiority in the Society, nor any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
of Prelature out of it; but to inform the
General of all ſuch whom they ſhall know to be any
ways engag'd in ſuch Contrivances.</p>
               <p>The Saint, not content only to charge the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of ſuch as ſhall ſollicit for any Office, alſo
renders them incapable of ever poſſeſſing any, from
the moment that they are found guilty of ſuch Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation.
As for Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, they are
not only forbid to ſeek them directly or indirectly,
but they are moreover bound not to accept of them
upon any account, unleſs the Supream Paſtor by
expreſs Command, and under pain of Mortal ſin,
ſhould oblige them to it. Thus the Founder of the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> provides that his Religious, ſpending their
days in the Service of their Neighbour, ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to themſelves no other Emolument but the
Glory of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And to render their Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſedneſs
more perfect, according to the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the holy Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who teſtifies of
himſelf, that he had rather die then Preach for
Gain, St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> Ordains, That none of his Body
ſhall receive any thing by way of Salary or Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
for any of their Functions. This is the true
Platform of an Inſtitute, of which ſo many falſe
Copies have been made, which have almoſt equally
impos'd upon the Wiſe, and upon the Simple.</p>
               <p>After he had traced out his Conſtitutions in the
manner whith I have related,<note place="margin">The Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety divided into Ten Parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> he afterwards gave
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65023:109"/>
them a new Form, and divided them into Ten
Parts, which have an eſſential Connection. The
Firſt Part contains what Qualities are neceſſary for
Admiſſion, and what hinder it, or make it void.</p>
               <p>But in regard that all thoſe who are received, do
not always anſwer Expectation, and that it will be
neceſſary to Diſmiſs ſome of them; the Second Part
ſets down the Reaſons for which they are to be
Diſmiſs'd, and the Manner of doing it. Whereas
thoſe who continue, and are upon trial, till ſuch
time as they are Incorporated into the Society, have
need of help and aſſiſtance to become good Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
The Third and Fourth Parts treat of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
of Health, and of Studies. Theſe four Parts
contain that which diſpoſeth to the Profeſſion of the
four Vows. Wherefore the Fifth Explicates the
Conditions of this eminent Degree, and alſo thoſe
of the inferior Degree. The Sixth and the Seventh
preſcribe Rules to the Profeſs'd, and to the Spiritual
Coadjutors, for their Conduct in their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
according to the Inſtitute. Theſe Seven
Parts regard the whole Body of the Order; the
Two following more nearly relate to the Head;
how he is to be qualifi'd, the Form of his Election,
his Authority, and all that which appertains to him.
Laſtly, the Tenth ſets down ſeveral Means for the
Preſervation and Growth of the Society.</p>
               <p>He wrote all his Conſtitutions in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and
Father <hi>John Plancus,</hi> his Secretary, Tranſlated
them into <hi>Latin.</hi> They are fill'd with the Spiritual
Unction of Grace, which an attentive Reader may
eaſily feel; and an Apoſtolical Zeal is every where
ſo diffus'd in them, that in every Page, and almoſt
in every Line, theſe following Words are found:
<hi>For the Good of Souls, For the Service of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
For the Honor of His Divine Majeſty, For
the greater Glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:65023:109"/>
Whereas Laws do not always deſcend to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
with Explanations, but that they have often
need to be interpreted, the Saint adds to his, in
Form of a Gloſs, Chapter by Chapter, certain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
which have the ſame Authority with the
Conſtitutions, and have alſo the ſame Spirit.</p>
               <p>Tho' before he wrote them, he had read the Rules
and Hiſtories of other Religious Orders, yet at the
time of Writing them he never had in his Chamber
any other Book but the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
a Kempis.</hi> During that time there was often
ſeen a Flame over his Head, not much unlike that
which appear'd in Tongues of Fire over the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
when the Holy Ghoſt deſcended from Heaven:
And his Hours were ſpent in Tears of Devotion, in
holy Ardors, in Raptures, and in Celeſtial Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as we read in a Paper-Book written with his
own Hand, which Providence hinder'd from being
burnt with many other Papers of the ſame nature,
which he caus'd to be caſt into the Fire ſome few
days before his Death.</p>

<hi>France,</hi> where the Society, tho' in that Place it had
its Birth, made the leaſt progreſs; whether it were
that the Hereticks, who were then ſpread about in

and even <hi>French,</hi> embraced the Inſtitute of
<hi>Ignatius;</hi> they came to <hi>Rome,</hi> to put themſelves
under the Direction of the Saint, and to learn of
him the <hi>Science of Salvation.</hi> One of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
was <hi>William Poſtel,</hi> born at <hi>Barenton</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
and Profeſſor Royal in the Univerſity of
<hi>Paris:</hi> He had in point of Learning the greateſt
Wit of his Age, vivacious, penetrating, and joyn'd
with a prodigious Memory; an univerſal Genius,
which was ignorant of nothing, and which excell'd
particularly in the knowledge of Tongues: Beſides
the <hi>Latin,</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the <hi>Chaldaic,</hi> and
the <hi>Syriack,</hi> he ſo perfectly knew all thoſe that are
now ſpoken, and are the living Languages, that he
has been heard to ſay, he could go the whole Round
of the Earth without an Interpreter. <hi>Francis</hi> the
Firſt, a Lover of Learning, and the Queen of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr</hi>
his Siſter, not unskill'd in Literature, look'd
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65023:111"/>
upon <hi>Poſtel,</hi> as the Miracle of the Age. The greateſt
Perſons, and among the reſt, the Cardinals of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and of <hi>Armagnac,</hi> were greedy of
his Company, and in a manner, made their Court to
him. The moſt Learned admir'd him, and in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him, it was a common Saying, <hi>That there
came out of his Mouth as many Oracles as Words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reputation of the Society of <hi>Jeſus</hi> all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
over, rais'd a Curioſity in <hi>Poſtel,</hi> to ſee the
Founder of this new Order, which made profeſſion
of Learning. Being come to <hi>Rome</hi> on this account,
and having ſeen Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> more then once,
he was ſo charm'd with his way of Proceeding, his
Maxims, and with the Character of his Inſtitute,
that Viſiting the Seven Churches, he made a
Vow to enter into his Society. And afterwards with
ſo much inſtance he preſs'd his Admiſſion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
ſo much zeal for the Converſion of <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Idolaters,</hi> that Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who well knew
the Abilities of <hi>Poſtel,</hi> could not refuſe to receive
him.</p>
               <p>But the Saint ſoon perceiv'd that a fair out-ſide
had dazled his Eyes; whereas he knew that Science
breeds Pride, and that without profound Humility,
the greateſt Wits are the leaſt proper to do great
things in the Service of God, he himſelf took the
charge of the Conduct of <hi>Poſtel.</hi> This Novice,
who was about Forty years old, and who before his
Voyage into <hi>Italy,</hi> with much Reading of <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
and Contemplating the Stars, had rais'd Viſions in
his Brain concerning a new Coming of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
could not ſo well contain himſelf, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
theſe Extravagancies would come from him.
The Father, who found at firſt, that <hi>Rabbiniſm</hi> and
<hi>Judicial Aſtrology</hi> had a little turn'd his Brain, us'd all
poſſible means for Two years together, to ſet him
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65023:111"/>
right in his Wits: After having try'd charitable
Remonſtrances, and ſevere Reprehenſions, he put
him into the hands of <hi>Laynez</hi> and <hi>Salmeron,</hi> who
endeavor'd to undeceive him with ſolid Reaſons,
and advis'd him to read only St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> He more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
Addreſs'd him to the Pope's Vicar, a Man
Learned, Prudent, and every way Accompliſh'd for
the curing a diſtemper'd Wit. But ſeeing that all
theſe Remedies were unprofitable, and that <hi>Poſtel</hi>
became every day more and more Viſionary, to the
degree of playing the Prophet, he Expell'd him
from his Order, and forbad all thoſe of the Society
to have any Commerce with him.</p>
               <p>The Event did juſtifie the Conduct of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
As ſoon as <hi>Poſtel</hi> was Diſmiſs'd, he ſet himſelf to Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize
in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaying, for a colour of his leaving
the Order, <hi>That it was not to be wonder'd at, if he
could not agree with the holy Man</hi> Ignatius, <hi>ſince
even St.</hi> Paul, and <hi>St.</hi> Barnabas <hi>were not of the ſame
mind.</hi> Afterwards retiring to <hi>Venice,</hi> where he
thought he ſhould be more in ſafety. He was ſo
infatuated concerning a certain Religious Woman,
call'd <hi>Mother Joan,</hi> as to hold forth, That in this
Coming of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which according to his
Predictions was to happen in few years, ſhe ſhould
be the Redeemereſs of Women, as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was
to be the Redeemer of Men; and he compos'd a
Book on this Subject, Entituled, <hi>De Virgine Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As we wander without end, when we leave the
ſtraight Line of Truth, and whereas <hi>Fanaticiſm</hi>
borders upon Phrenzy, <hi>Poſtel</hi> publiſh'd in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Books, That all Sects ſhould be ſaved by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt;</hi> That the greateſt part of the Myſteries
of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> were only Fables; That the Angel
<hi>Raphael</hi> had reveal'd to him the Divine Secrets, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65023:112"/>
that his Writings were the Dictates of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
himſelf.</p>
               <p>So many Impieties would perhaps have coſt him
his Life, if he had not been judg'd Diſtracted. He
was ſhut up for his Extravagances, and remain'd
ſeveral years in Priſon; at laſt he made his eſcape,
and after having a long while roam'd about, he
return'd into <hi>France</hi> by the way of <hi>Geneva,</hi> more Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine,
and more Extravagant then ever. Yet at laſt
it pleas'd God to give him his Wits, and the Grace to
acknowledge his Impieties, in an extream old Age,
and to die in the Communion of the Church. It is
ſaid that he liv'd an hundred years, and that about
the end of his days, he in a manner grew young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
ſo that his white Hairs return'd to be black.</p>
               <p>About the time that Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> Expell'd
Doctor <hi>Poſtel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He chuſeth <hi>Laynez</hi> and <hi>Salmeron</hi> for the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>

Society, who ſhould Aſſiſt in his Name with his
Legats, at the General Council to be held at <hi>Trent.</hi>
The Father choſe <hi>James Laynez</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus
Salmeron;</hi> both of them indeed very young, the firſt
being Four and thirty, and the other but Thirty
years old, but both of them ſo Learned, and ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed

Divines look'd upon them as their Maſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laynez,</hi> whom the <hi>Venetians</hi> obtain'd, from the
time that the Inſtitute was firſt Approv'd by the
Holy See, was Employ'd over the whole State of
the Signiory; and the chief of his Buſineſs was to

after his return from <hi>Ireland,</hi> he had been call'd
by the Cardinal <hi>John Moron,</hi> Biſhop of the Town;
into which Place thoſe new Hereſies had alſo found
their way.</p>
               <p>Tho' Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> did much relie upon the

                  </note> yet the fear
he had leaſt the Title of <hi>The Pope's Divines,</hi> in the

dazle Men ſo young, oblig'd him to give them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their departure, ſome Advertiſements and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
for their Conduct. After recommending
to them in general, to ſeek in all things, during the
Council, the greateſt Glory of God, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good of the Church, without neglecting their
Neighbours Souls, and their own Perfection, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
to them in Particular theſe following Rules.
Always to give their Opinions with modeſty, and
in thoſe occaſions to ſhew more Humility then
Learning; To obſerve with great attention the
Sentiments and Reaſons of thoſe who firſt Opine,
that afterwards they may either ſpeak or be ſilent,
as the Matter requires; When any Points are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
always to ſet forth the Reaſons on both ſides,
that they may not appear wedded to their own
Judgment; and never to quote any living Author
for a Guarrantie of their Opinions, that they may
not ſeem to be ty'd up to any Man's Judgment;
To Viſit Hoſpitals at leaſt every Fourth day, to
Catechize Children, to Preach Pennance to the
People; but without touching in their Sermons
upon any Point of Controverſie which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
their Underſtandings; but only in general
exhorting them to ſubmit their Judgments to the
Deciſions of the Church. Laſtly, to excite their
Auditors inceſſantly to pray for the good ſucceſs of
the Council. This farther Advertiſement he gives
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65023:113"/>
them, That as in the Aſſemblies where Queſtions of
Faith are Treated, a moderate and conciſe Diſcourſe
is moſt ſuitable; ſo when they come into the Chair,
they ſhould be more diffuſe and vehement.</p>
               <p>He afterwards declar'd to them, that theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
did as well regard <hi>Claude le Jay,</hi> who was
at that time in <hi>Germany,</hi> much employ'd in making
head againſt the Hereticks, and whom Cardinal <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> was upon ſending to <hi>Trent</hi> in
Quality of his Divine, and of his Legat. He added,
That when they ſhould be all three together, they
ſhould live in a perfect Concord, without interfering
in Opinions and Judgments; That every Night
they ſhould confer upon what had paſs'd that Day,
and deliberate every Morning upon what they had
to do the reſt of the Day; That they ſhould let ſlip
no occaſion of doing good Offices to every body,
and to themſelves, in admoniſhing one another of
their Faults, in not leaving any thing uncorrected,
and in mutually animating one another to lead an
unblameable Life.</p>
               <p>The ſatisfaction which Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had to ſee
the Council open'd at laſt,<note place="margin">He reconciles the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> and the Pope.</note> after ſo many Lets and
Delays, was much allay'd by the Miſunderſtanding
then happening between the Pope, and the King
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which aroſe upon the account of the
famous <hi>Michael de Silva.</hi> This <hi>Portuguez,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from the Illuſtrious Houſe of the Counts
<hi>de Portalegre,</hi> and Son of <hi>Don Diego de Silva,</hi> who
had been Governor to the King <hi>Don Emanuel,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reſided a long time with the Popes, <hi>Leo</hi> the
Tenth, <hi>Adrian</hi> the Sixth, and <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh,
was call'd back from his Embaſſy of <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Don
John</hi> the Third, Succeſſor to <hi>Don Emanuel,</hi> and
provided at his return, not only with the Biſhoprick
of <hi>Viſeu,</hi> but alſo with the Office of Protonotury, of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65023:113"/>
Secretary of the Kingdom. He was afterwards no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
Cardinal by <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, who had
known him in the former Pontificates.</p>
               <p>Whereas his Promotion was properly the Work
of Cardinal <hi>Alexander Farneſius,</hi> his Friend, and the
Pope's Nephew. <hi>Portugal</hi> being wholly a Stranger
to it, it ſhockt the King, who would not have his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
owe their Preferment to any but himſelf: So that
this Prince would never be induc'd to give way that
the Biſhop of <hi>Viſeu</hi> ſhould receive his Cap.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop, perſwaded that Princes do not eaſily
recede, and that having loſt the good Graces of his
Maſter, he had more yet to fear, departed ſecretly
out of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and went into <hi>Italy,</hi> whither For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ſeem'd to call him. Being come to <hi>Rome,</hi> he
was made Cardinal with great Solemnity, and his
Diſgrace in <hi>Portugal,</hi> joyn'd with his great Merit,
were the occaſion of extraordinary Honors done
him.</p>
               <p>The King, irritated with the Flight, and with
the Reception of the Biſhop, began his Reſentment
by depriving him of the Revenue of his Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
and by forbidding his Subjects, under grievous
Penalties, to have any Communication with him.
He highly complain'd of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
above all, againſt Cardinal <hi>Farneſius,</hi> who Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
Cardinal de <hi>Viſeu</hi> in the moſt important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Church. That which gall'd him moſt,
was, that Cardinal <hi>Contarini,</hi> Legat of <hi>Paul</hi> the
Third with the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, being
dead in his Legatſhip of <hi>Spain,</hi> they ſent <hi>Michael de
Silva</hi> in his Place, with the Character, and the full
Power of a Legat Apoſtolical.</p>
               <p>The Pope no leſs diſpleas'd on his ſide, condemn'd
the Proceedings of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and upon
occaſions, made his Complaints to Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:65023:114"/>
who was wont to ſpeak to him of this Prince,
as of the moſt Religious Monarch in <hi>Europe.</hi> The
Breach began to widen, and to produce ill effects
in behalf of Religion, when the Father undertook to
heal it. In the firſt place, he had his recourſe to
God, in whoſe hands are the Hearts of the Great ones
of the Earth, and he order'd Prayers in his whole
Society, to draw a Bleſſing from Heaven upon his
undertaking. He wrote at the ſame time to <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
where his Councels were well receiv'd: He treated
with Cardinal <hi>Farneſius,</hi> and with the Pope, who
both had confidence in him, and he ſo well manag'd
the Parties, and the Buſineſs, on both ſides, that ſo
nice and ſo difficult a matter was eaſily compos'd.
In teſtimony of a ſincere Reconciliation, the King
reſtor'd Cardinal <hi>de Viſeu</hi> into Poſſeſſion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of his Biſhoprick, and the Pope granted to
the King conſiderable Priviledges, in favour of the
Tribunal of the Inquiſition, Eſtabliſht in <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Forreign Imployments did not hinder Father
<hi>Ignatius</hi> from diſcharging at home all the Duties of
his Charge.<note place="margin">His Domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> He made divers Regulations, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the diverſity of Occurrences; He gave all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Orders, but after a way, rather of Intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then Commanding. In diſtributing imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he had regard to the inclinations of thoſe
whom he imploy'd, tho' on their parts, he will have
them indifferently diſpos'd to any.</p>
               <p>It was his cuſtom to chuſe perſons of great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
for Offices in the Society; And yet he would
not ſtick ſometimes to put in leſs experienc'd ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to govern under him in <hi>Rome:</hi> This he did,
to try their Talents, and to form them himſelf, by
obſerving their deportments. But he never ſent in
laborious miſſions any but Men of try'd vertue. He
ſpar'd the weak, and the leſs perfect, ſometimes with
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65023:114"/>
deſign of making them take notice of their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to the end, that ſhame ſhould ſtir them up to
become more Vigorous; or if he gave them Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ſome hardſhip, it was at their own requeſt,
and upon condition, that if they found themſelves
over burden'd, they ſhould freely declare it to him.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, when he met with thoſe rough, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docible
tempers, whoſe harſhneſs of Nature was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compani'd
with a robuſt Conſtitution, he would load
them with imployments, harder then the reſt; and
if peradventure they fell ſick, he was not much
troubl'd at it, as thinking, that the Infirmity of
their Body, might tame their diſpoſitions, and prove
beneficial to their Souls.</p>
               <p>When they ask'd him any thing of Conſequence,
he commonly told them the reaſons he had to refuſe
it them, to the end, that he who obtain'd it not,
ſhould be the better content, and that he, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a ſavour, ſhould be more reſerv'd in asking
new ones. But for the moſt part, he never deny'd
any, but when his Conſcience would not permit
him to grant it; and even his refuſal he ſweetened
with ſuch obliging terms, that they always went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
ſatisfi'd. His very reprehenſions he ſeaſon'd
with ſo much civillity, or at leaſt he ſo temper'd
them, that altho' they were ſmart and penetrating,
yet they were not harſh nor reflecting.</p>
               <p>He had ſo good an opinion of his own, that he
could not believe any thing, that was ſaid againſt their
Honor; and he lov'd them all ſo well, that every
one thought himſelf to be the moſt beloved: He
ſo accommodated himſelf to the humor of every one
in particular, as if his own had been tranform'd into
theirs, and this with an Air ſo plain, and natural, that
one would have ſaid, he was born that which he
ſeem'd to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:65023:115"/>
Tho' he would have the Novices well try'd,<note place="margin">His Conduct towards the Novices.</note> yet he
treated them like tender Plants, newly tranſplanted,
which ſtill partake of the Soil, whence they came.
A Rich man, who was receiv'd into the Society, had
a Crucifix well wrought, and of great Prince, of which
he was very fond; the General let him have it. In
the mean time the Novice made great progreſs in
Vertue, and particularly labour'd in the overcoming
himſelf. As ſoon as the General perceiv'd it. <hi>This
go's well,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſince the Brother is not only
diſingag'd from the World, but alſo from himſelf, we
may venture to take out of his hands the Image of
Chriſt Crucifi'd, for now he has him in his Heart.</hi>
And in effect he took away the Crucifix, and the
Novice, who was now well wean'd, without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
parted with it.</p>
               <p>The Conduct, which he obſerv'd towards Perſons
Illuſtrious, by their Birth, or by their Learning, who
embrac'd the Inſtitute, is very remarkable. He
ſhew'd great conſideration for them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
he call'd them Counts, Marqueſſes, Doctors,
till ſuch time as they grew aſham'd to be call'd by
thoſe Names, and that they ask'd themſelves not to
be diſtinguiſh'd. But when he ſaw, that they began
to reliſh the Maxims of the Goſpel, and that they
march'd in the way of Perfection, there were none
whom he mortifi'd more. He took pleaſure in
making a Man of Quality ſtoop to the meaneſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
in humbling a Doctor, and he gave it not
over, till he had quite made them forget what they
had been. This he did, firſt to let the World know
that among the Jeſuits, advantages of Birth and of
Knowledge, are of no reck'ning without Humility,
and that, to be great among them, they muſt be
little in their own Eyes; and in the ſecond place,
becauſe a Religious Society always receives from
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65023:115"/>
ſuch ſort of Perſons, either a great deal of Honor,
or a great deal of Confuſion.</p>
               <p>There was nothing which he would leave undone,
to ſtrengthen thoſe, who began to grow weary of
carrying the Yoke of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and were in
danger of falling from their Vocation. He went
one night to the Chamber of a Father, who had
reſolv'd to return into the World, and after many
remonſtrances, both of the Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the next Life, he made ſuch impreſſions
upon his Heart, that this Father fell at the feet of
the General, and offer'd to undergo what Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he would Impoſe upon him. <hi>One part of your
Pennance</hi> (ſaid Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> embracing him) <hi>ſhall
be, never to repent you more of having ſerv'd God;
for the other part, I will take it upon me, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it my ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A young <hi>German,</hi> who had great Natural parts,
was tempted to leave the Order. Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
who had taken him in, and judged him very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, did what he
could to keep him: But the <hi>German,</hi> ſo violent was
his temptation, would harken to nothing. The
Father ſeeming to yield to him, intreated the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to ſtay at leaſt ſome few days in the Houſe, and
to live as he pleas'd, without being ſubject to any
Rule. He accepted the offer, and liv'd at firſt with
all the liberty of a Man, who had ſhaken off the Yoke
of Diſcipline. But after a while, he grew aſham'd
of his way of living, when he conſider'd, how mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and regular the reſt were; and in concluſion
he effectually repented of his inconſtancy.</p>
               <p>If the General diſcover'd, that this ſort of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
came from any ſecret ſin, or from a vicious
habit, he endeavor'd to find out the root of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
and exhorted the Culpable to make an exact
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65023:116"/>
Confeſſion. To ingage them to do it, he often
made uſe of the ſame pious Artifice, which he had
formerly try'd with ſucceſs upon that Religious Man,
whom he reclaim'd from Libertiniſm, and would
recount to them at large the diſorders of his own
Worldly life. He would never permit them to be
left alone; and whereas the night is commonly the
time, in which the Devil, and Melancholly moſt
torment thoſe, who are ſo tempted, he order'd that
ſome prudent, and agreeable Companion ſhould
lie near them, to entertain them when they wak'd,
and with wholeſome Diſcourſes by little and little to
diſſipate thoſe black Vapors, which ſo diſtemper'd
them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If all this were unſuccesful, he call'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
all the Fathers, and deſir'd him, who had a
mind to depart, to tell them his reaſons, hoping,
that a publick Declaration from them all, would
make the poor wretch ſenſible of his deluſion, or
that God would inſpire the Fathers with ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as might convince him.</p>
               <p>The General in his Government was no leſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the Corporal Infirmities of his ſubjects,<note place="margin">His care for the Sick.</note> then
of their Spiritual. He Ordain'd in the beginning
of his Generalſhip, that as ſoon as any of them fell
ſick, they ſhould advertiſe him of it, and that twice
a day they ſhould come to tell him, whether the
Brother, that had care of the Proviſions, did his
part in furniſhing them with all neceſſaries. He
would have nothing ſpar'd in their behalf, and that
if Money were wanting for it, they ſhould ſell their
very Moveables, for the relief of the ſick.</p>
               <p>The Phyſician having one day preſcrib'd ſome
choice Meat for a Lay Brother, whoſe Stomack
was very weak, and the General being told, that
there was not two Shillings in the Houſe; <hi>let them
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65023:116"/>
be laid out,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for the Brother; we that are in
health, and have good Stomacks, will content our
ſelves to day only with bread.</hi> Two other Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who were diſign'd for Domeſtick ſervices,
the one a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the other a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> were
ſcarce enter'd into the Noviceſhip, but a Fever
took them. There were at that time many ſick in
the Houſe, and all the Chambers were full; beſides
Proviſions at that time were very ſcanty in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
Some advis'd Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> to ſend the two
Brothers to the Hoſpital: <hi>By no means,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it
would be a great ſhame, that we ſhould have no place
among us, for thoſe, who have left all for God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His buſineſs did never hinder him from often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
the ſick, and when the Diſeaſe was dangerous,
or very painful, he would many times riſe in the
night, to ſee the Patient, and to eaſe his pain with
conſolatory Diſcourſes. Nor could he reſt in his
Bed, when any under his charge, had any Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
extraordinary. A young Brother being upon
ſome urgent occaſion let Blood in the night, the
General not content only with viſiting him, and
with leaving People to tend him, ſent twice or thrice
to ſee him. Such as know not, how tender and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending
Charity is, will perhaps be ſurpriz'd,
that to divert and recreate a certain Father, whom
Melancholly had made inſupportable both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and others, Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſhould cauſe ſome
of the Novices, that had been train'd to Muſick,
to Sing and Play about his Bed.</p>
               <p>But as tender as he was of his Children, he would
have them in time of their ſickneſs, to be under a
perfect ſubmiſſion, and to look upon their Diſeaſe,
as the gift of God. If any words of Impatience
came from them, or if they were froward and peeviſh,
as ſoon as they were recover'd, he faild not to
puniſh them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:65023:117"/>
To ſpeak in general, when any had committed a
fault, which deſerv'd Puniſhment, the firſt thing,
which the Saint did, was to make the Offender ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of his Tranſgreſſion, and then he engag'd him
to ſet his own Penance, which if it were too rigorous,
the Saint would always moderate it. When thoſe,
who had Tranſgreſs'd, did amend, he treated them
afterwards in the ſame manner, as if they had never
offended; he did not only forget the fault, but by
his way of proceeding, he made the Offender him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a manner forget it too, and loſe part of that
ſhame, which ſticks after a fall, and which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
diſheartens Men in the way of Vertue.</p>
               <p>He often gave very great Penances for light
faults,<note place="margin">His Zeal for regular Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> if they were againſt Religious Diſcipline, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perſwaded, that if it were not rigorouſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in a new founded Order, it would after a
while be quite loſt. He ſaid, that what appear'd
nothing in it ſelf, might be the riſe of greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
and that ſmall faults publickly committed,
were at leaſt bad examples, which lead to a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of Government.</p>
               <p>Nor would he ſuffer any innovation in the Society,
but always vigorouſly oppos'd it, even to the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe, as Enemies, and Rebels, who offer'd to
change any thing in the Inſtitute, tho' under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of making it more perfect. He did not this,
becauſe he would have his ſubjects content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with a common degree of Sanctity; for he
continually excited them to get up to the perfection
of their State, propoſing to them, what God requir'd
from them, according to the Spirit of their Vocation;
and this his Sollicitude, was not confin'd only to
<hi>Rome,</hi> or to <hi>Italy,</hi> but extended it ſelf over the whole
body, which now did increaſe daily, and ſpread it
ſelf; and his principal care was, to baniſh out of it,
the prophane Spirit of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:65023:117"/>
Being inform'd, that <hi>Antonio Araos,</hi> whoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
labors were very ſucceſsful in the Court of
<hi>Spain,</hi> ſeem'd a little too much to look after the
converſation, and favor of great Perſons, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of gaining Credit to his Miniſtry, he ſent
him a ſharp reprimand, advertizing him, that the
neceſſary Authority for Miniſters of the word of God,
was much better gain'd by the Exerciſes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Humility, then by the Commerce of Great
ones.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems a little ſttrange, that perceiving <hi>Simon
Rodriguez</hi> to have a great intereſt in the King, and
the Court of <hi>Portugal,</hi> he ſhould have the thoughts
of calling that holy Man back into <hi>Italy,</hi> fearing
leaſt the World might inſenſibly change him. And
this he had done, if the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had not
himſelf oppos'd it, earneſtly requeſting Father <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
that he would leave him <hi>Rodriguez</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
and educate the Prince, his Son.</p>
               <p>A young <hi>Portuguez,</hi> called <hi>Antonio Monis,</hi> who
had been receiv'd into the Society about three or
four years, fled out of the Colledge of <hi>Conimbria,</hi>
upon the only motive of Libertiniſm. After having
lurk'd ſome time at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> without daring to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
he rambl'd about all <hi>Spain,</hi> and his curioſity
led him to <hi>Montſerrat.</hi> This holy Place put good
thoughts into him: He grew ſenſible of his Apoſtacy,
when he beheld the Sword of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which ſtill
hung up near the Altar of our Lady; and his Heart
being touch'd, he ſaid, with the Prodigal Child, <hi>I
will go to my Father.</hi> He did ſo, but being come
to <hi>Rome,</hi> he had not the confidence to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who was inform'd of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion;
but he writ to him from the Hoſpital of
St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> whither his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
had forc'd him to retire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:65023:118"/>
The Father immediately took him out of the
Hoſpital, and provided him with all neceſſaries;
but he would not receive him into his Houſe, he
made him lodge cloſe by, and ſo for twelve days kept
him at a diſtance. <hi>Monis</hi> ſpent that time in bewailing
his Crime, and the fervor of his Repentance went
ſo far, that he viſited the ſeven Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi>
diſciplining himſelf all the way. Father <hi>Ignatius</hi>
at laſt receiv'd him again among his Children, and
by divers marks of his kindneſs, gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that he no longer look'd upon him, as a
Deſertor: This Charitable Reception did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> wounded with remorſe of his
ſin, from falling into a lingering Feaver, which by
degrees brought him to his end. But he conceiv'd no
little comfort and joy, to die in the Arms of his
good Father, and he ceas'd not from praiſing the
Mercy of God, which had recall'd him into the
Society.</p>
               <p>In this while,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Le Jay, Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez,</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron,</hi> at the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </note> Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had news, that the
three Divines, who were come to <hi>Trent,</hi> to aſſiſt in
the Council which was now begun, did worthily
maintain the Honor of the Society, and the Intereſt
of the Church. <hi>Le Jay,</hi> who firſt arriv'd there, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
enter'd into the good opinion, and eſteem
of the Cardinal of <hi>Trent,</hi> who conſulted with him
upon the moſt difficult affairs. <hi>Salmeron</hi> pronounc'd
before the Fathers of the Council a very Eloquent
Oration in Latine, which gain'd the applauſe of the
whole Aſſembly. <hi>Laynez</hi> made himſelf admir'd
from the firſt time, that he ſpoke; and they all three
made their profound Learning ſo eminently appear,
that the Popes Legates gave them the Imployment,
of making a Collection of all the errors of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and Modern Hereticks, with all the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of Scripture, Fathers, Councils, and Doctors,
which directly oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:65023:118"/>
But that, which moſt pleas'd Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
was, that when they were not imploy'd upon the
buſineſs of the Council, they viſited Hoſpitals,
Catechiz'd Children, and begg'd Alms, not only for
poor Catholick Soldiers, who had ſerv'd in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
of whom the Town was full, but alſo for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The Popes Legates ſeeing their Caſſocks
all worn out, caus'd new ones to be made for them,
that they might appear more decently in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
but they, when the Seſſions were over, did ſtill
put on their old ones again.</p>
               <p>Of all the Tranſactions they duly gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to their General, and ask'd his Advice in
difficult matters. Having once made their Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to him, to know, how they were to carry
themſelves, upon the ſubject of certain new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
propos'd by ſome of the Prelates, which did
a little lean towards the Sentiments of <hi>Luther,</hi> tho'
they ſeem'd not to be very unreaſonable, he never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
expreſly Commanded them, not to leave them
unoppos'd, declaring to them, that in matter of
Religion, the moſt plauſible Novelties were often
the moſt dangerous; that ſpeculative Arguments
did not render a Doctrine more Catholick, and that,
till ſuch time as the Church ſhall decide, what we
are to believe of ſuch ſuſpected Opinions, we ſhould
have a care how we judge, or ſpeak favorably of
them. They took his Anſwers for Oracles; and
<hi>Laynez</hi> did uſually ſay, that if Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> were
at the Council, he would do great Service to the
Church.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Emperor not being able
to reſiſt the Prayers of the Catholicks, declar'd War
againſt the Proteſtants, who would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

<hi>William Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> were at the Head of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65023:119"/>
an Army of fourſcore thouſand Men, who were in
their March againſt the Emperor's Forces, ſo that,
whereas the troubles of <hi>Germany</hi> for ſome time had
interrupted the Council, Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who had
need of <hi>Laynez</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> would have call'd him
from <hi>Trent,</hi> during this Receſs. But the Cardinal
of <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> the Popes Legate, ſtopt him;
not by his abſolute Authority, nor without writing
to Father <hi>Ignatius:</hi> For after having repreſented
to him, that they could not ſpare <hi>Laynez</hi> at <hi>Trent,</hi>
becauſe he was appointed to make an exact Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Hereſies, which regard the Sacraments,
he intreated him not to take it amiſs, that he detain'd
the Father, at leaſt till ſuch time, as the Collection
was finiſht; adding withal, that if his reaſons did
not ſeem to him ſufficient, he would diſmiſs him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that the true intereſt of the Church requir'd, that
his Society ſhould be extempt from all Eccleſiaſtical

not of his ſentiment, and that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in his, he took a courſe, which ſeem'd to him
the moſt Natural, and it was, to write to <hi>Ferdinand</hi>

implor'd the aſſiſtance of Heaven, and caus'd the

               </p>
               <p>We are not ignorant of your Majeſties Zeal for the
good of your People, nor of the affection, you are
pleas'd to have for our Society. We praiſe God for
both, and we humbly pray his Divine Majeſty, to
furniſh you with means happily to accompliſh, what
your Piety undertakes.</p>
               <p>But in rendring you our moſt humble thanks, for
the Favors and Graces you vouchſafe to heap upon
us, we muſt be bold to ſay, you cannot oblige us more,
then by aſſiſting us to march in the ſtrait way of our
Inſtitute. Eccleſiaſtical Dignities are ſo contrary to
it, that according to the Idea, which we have of it,
nothing is more capable to alter and deſtroy it. For
thoſe, who form'd this Society, made it their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
end, to Preach the Goſpel in all parts of the
World; and its true Spirit, is to ſeek the Salvation
of Souls, and the Honor of God, without being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to imployments or places. Religius Societies
no longer can ſubſiſt, then they preſerve their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Spirit; and if ours be loſt, or taken from us,
how can our Body be kept alive? We are but nine
Profeſt, of which four or five have already refus'd
Prelatures: If one of us now ſhould accept a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
will not the reſt believe, they have right to do
the ſame? And when the Members are thus ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
what will become of the Community? This
little Order ſince its Birth has made no ſmall progreſs
by the way of Humility, and of Poverty: If the
People ſhould come to ſee us Cloth'd with Honors and
Dignity, will they not be ſcandaliz'd at the change
of our Maxims, and of our Conduct? And will they
not receive Impreſſions of us, which may render us
uſeleſs in the Miniſtery of the Goſpel? But what
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65023:120"/>
need we offer our reaſons to your Majeſty, we implore
your Goodneſs and your Wiſdom: We lay our ſelves
under your Royal Protection: We humbly ſupplicate
for the ſervice of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and for the good of
Souls, that you will vouchſafe to maintain, to the
Honor of his Divine Majeſty, this little new born
Society. May it pleaſe the ſame Infinite Goodneſs,
long to preſerve your Sacred Perſon, and to pour on
you all ſorts of Benedictions.</p>
               <p>The Letter of the General had all the effect that
could be deſir'd. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> laid down his thoughts
of Father <hi>le Jay,</hi> for the Biſhoprick of <hi>Trieſte;</hi>
and he charg'd his Embaſſador to inform the Pope
of it. The occaſion ſeem'd favorable to Father
<hi>Ignatius</hi> fully to inſtruct the Pope upon this Subject.
One day he repreſented to him,<note place="margin">He declares his reaſons to the Pope, of refuſing Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> that this ſmall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
which in the whole number, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
more then two hundred Perſons, would in a
little time grow weak, and be quite diſſipated, if
their ableſt Subjects, which are the ſupport of the
reſt, ſhould be drawn from them; That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of one might cauſe great diſorders, by ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up Ambition in the reſt; That when Religious
Perſons have once pretentions of Greatneſs, they
grow more Worldly then the very Men of the
World; That thoſe, who had embrac'd the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the Society, out of a Spirit of Charity, and
of Zeal, would eaſily fall off from their laborious
Imployments, through the hope of Eccleſiaſtical
Preferment, or at leaſt, the proſpect of it would
make their motives leſs pure, and their intentions
leſs direct; That Jealouſie would not fail to inſinuate
it ſelf among ſeveral Competitors, and that if all
did not aſpire to Honors, there would at leaſt be
but little union among thoſe, who acted not by the
ſame deſigns, and principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:65023:121"/>
He added, that the Profeſt, being devoted to the
Service of the Holy See, in regard of Miſſions, and
having more acceſs in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they
would be more in the occaſion of ſeeking, and
would have more opportunity of obtaining Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments;
That laboring in the Courts of Princes,
they would be leſs free, and courageous in diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the duty of their Miniſtery, if there were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for them to hope here below, and that the
Princes themſelves would perhaps make leſs uſe of
them, if their ſervices look'd for Recompence: Nor
did he pretend herein to diſapprove the accepting
Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, nor to condemn thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
who are thereunto rais'd, for the good of
Chriſtianity, and who poſſeſs them, with the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Faithful; That there is great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between this Society, and other Orders; That
theſe, by their Antiquity, and long continuance,
had acquir'd ſtrength ſufficient to bear the weightieſt
charges, but that the other, being newly enter'd
into the world, was yet too weak for them. <hi>Holy
Father</hi> (he ſaid) recalling his Antient Idea's of the
War) <hi>I conſider all other Orders, in the Army of
the Church Militant, as ſo many Squadrons of
Cuiraſſiers, who are to remain in the Poſt aſſign'd
them, who keep their Ranks, and face the Enemy,
always in the ſame Order, and with the ſame manner
of fighting. But for us</hi> (he continu'd) <hi>we are as ſo
many Light Horſemen, who muſt be always ready
upon occaſion of Alarms, and Surpizes, to Attack,
or make a Stand, according to different conjunctures;
to go every where, and to Skirmiſh on all ſides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He concluded, that Miſſioners, ſuch as they were
who muſt not only go from Town to Town, from
Province to Province, but muſt fly from one Pole
to the other, at the leaſt beck of the Vicar of <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> could not be fixt any where.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:65023:121"/>
With theſe reaſons the Pope did acquieſce, and
was perſwaded, that their refuſal of Eccleſiaſtical
Dignities would not be leſs beneficial to the Church,
then to the Society. Some have believ'd, that the
buſineſs of <hi>Trieſte</hi> gave the firſt occaſion to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
of obliging the Profeſt, by Vow, not to ſeek
after Prelatures, and to refuſe them, when offer'd.
But it is certain, that he had taken that Reſolution
before, and from the time, that he firſt came to <hi>Rome</hi>
with <hi>Faber</hi> and <hi>Laynez.</hi> For going one day with
them to ſee the Marqueſs <hi>d' Aquilar,</hi> then Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, with <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, and
their Diſcourſe falling upon the reports, which were
then ſpread againſt the new Society, the Marqueſs
told him, that he was ſuſpected to cover a great
Ambition under an exterior Humility, and that it
was publickly ſaid, a <hi>Cap</hi> or a <hi>Miter</hi> was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of his Journey. The Father was ſo ſurpriz'd
at this Diſcourſe, that at firſt he only anſwer'd it
by making the ſign of the Croſs. Afterwards,
as if he had been inſpir'd on the ſudden by God, he
made a Vow before the Marqueſs, never to accept
any Eccleſiaſtical Dignity, unleſs he were oblig'd
to it, under pain of Sin, by the Vicar of <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
and ſome time after he renew'd this Vow in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of a Cardinal.</p>
               <p>The affairs of the Society were in this Poſture,<note place="margin">The Society begins to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct youth in Learning.</note>
when Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> thought it ſeaſonable, that it
ſhould be imploy'd in the inſtruction of Youth.
The Zeal of <hi>Francis de Borgia,</hi> Duke of <hi>Gandia,</hi>
to whom the ſight of the dead Body of the Empreſs
had given a diſguſt of the things of this World, and
who after the death of his Dutcheſs, gave himſelf
wholly to God, was the firſt riſe and occaſion of
beginning ſo profitable a work. There being
within his Lordſhips a great number of Baptized
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65023:122"/>
                  <hi>Moors,</hi> of which the greateſt part had renounced
<hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> only in appearance, he judged that
to ſecure the Souls of the younger Brood, and wholly
to extirpate that pernicious Sect, he ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the Education of their youth: and in order
thereunto, to Found a Colledge of the Society in
his Town of <hi>Gandia,</hi> where the Children of all
his Vaſſals ſhould be Educated in Vertue and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>This deſign he communicated to Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
and asked his advice, and aſſiſtance for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it: Who immediately gave order to Father
<hi>Faber,</hi> then at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> to wait upon the Duke,
and to ſerve him in the Eſtabliſhment of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
before he came to <hi>Trent,</hi> whither <hi>Paul</hi> the
Third had call'd him, to be joyn'd with <hi>Salmeron</hi>
and <hi>Laynez.</hi> As ſoon as the Duke and Father <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
had regulated matters, according to the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the General, there were preſently ſent thither
Profeſſors out of five or ſix different Nations, all able
Men, and choſen by Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> himſelf, and each
of them open'd his School with a Latin Harangue
before the Duke, and all his Court.</p>
               <p>It was therefore in the year 1546, and ſix years
after the Confirmation of the Inſtitute, that the
Jeſuits firſt open'd their Schools in <hi>Europe,</hi> I ſay in
<hi>Europe,</hi> becauſe in the year preceding, thoſe of the
Society, whom Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had ſent out of <hi>Italy,</hi>
and out of <hi>Portugal</hi> to Father <hi>Xaverius,</hi> having
been put into poſſeſſion of the <hi>Seminary</hi> of <hi>Goa,</hi>
Founded ſome few years before by King <hi>John</hi> the
Third, for Educating the <hi>Indian</hi> youth, <hi>Nicholas
Lancillotti</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> had begun to teach the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
the Principles of the Latin Tongue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:65023:122"/>
But at <hi>Gandia</hi> they did not only teach theſe firſt
Elements of Sciences,<note place="margin">The General's Directions for good Order in the Colledges.</note> for beſides Grammar, there
were Schools of Poetry, Rhetorick, Philoſophy,
and Divinity; and to give the greater Credit to
the Colledge, the Duke obtain'd from the Pope,
and from the Emperor, to have it Erected into an
Univerſity, and that the Scholars who there took
Degrees, ſhould have all the Priviledges which are
injoy'd by the <hi>Graduats</hi> of <hi>Alcala,</hi> and of <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> Ordain'd, for the good order of
the Colledge, that the Profeſſors ſhould be very
careful in their Method of teaching, that in each
faculty they ſhould follow the moſt received Authors,
as in Philoſophy <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and in Divinity St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas:</hi>
He recommended, that they ſhould often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
the memories of thoſe young Scholars, who
were not yet come to ripeneſs of judgment, and
that in making them recite, what they had got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
book, they ſhould accuſtom them betimes to
pronounce well: That they ſhould ſtir up young
Wits by frequent Diſputations, quickening them
with emulation, and ſometimes ſetting the more
forward and capable, againſt thoſe, who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them, that ſo both one and the other, might
either be animated with Glory, or excited by Shame;
that the Slothful and the Libertines ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
but that the Maſters themſelves ſhould not
Chaſtize their Scholars; This laſt Order he made,
both to obſerve the Decency of a Religious ſtate,
and to prevent all paſſion in Corrections.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, inſomuch as it was his principal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to form the Manners of Youth, he expreſly
forbad the reading any Author, either <hi>Latin</hi> or
<hi>Greek,</hi> that might corrupt their Innocence; unleſs
ſuch Authors be firſt purg'd of all that is obſcene.
He order'd that the Scholars ſhould every Day hear
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65023:123"/>
Maſs; That every Month they ſhould go to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
That when they begin School, they ſhould
all together ſay ſome ſhort Prayer, to ask God's
aſſiſtance in their Studies; And that once a Week,
by Catechiſms and Exhortations, they ſhould be
Inſtructed in the Verities of Faith, and in the Rules
of good Life. He alſo preſcrib'd to the Maſters,
that upon every fit occaſion, both in School and
out of School, in their familiar Diſcourſes, they
ſhould ſpeak to them of Heavenly things. Theſe
Rules obſerv'd, made Doctrine and Piety flouriſh at
<hi>Gandia,</hi> under the Conduct of Father <hi>Andrew
Oviedo,</hi> Rector of the Colledge.</p>
               <p>About this time it was, that <hi>Iſabella Roſella</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſee Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> took a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of leaving the World, and of living accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Evangelical Counſels under the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Society. Two <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies of great
Vertue joyn'd with her in this Deſign, and they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
leave of the Pope to embrace this kind of
Life. Tho' F. <hi>Ignatius</hi> well ſaw, that this ſort of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
was not very agreeable to his Inſtitute, yet
his Gratitude towards his Benefactrix, and the ſmall
number of theſe new Religious prevail'd with him,
to take upon him the care of them. But he ſoon
repented of it, and was heard to ſay, <hi>That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of three Devotes was more troubleſom,
then that of the whole Society:</hi> For in fine, there
was no end with them; at all hours their Doubts
muſt be reſolv'd, their Scruples muſt be cur'd, their
Grievances muſt be heard, and even their Quarrels
muſt be reconcil'd.</p>
               <p>This oblig'd him to repreſent to the Pope,<note place="margin">He delivers the Society from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Women.</note> how
incongruous ſuch an Employment would be to the
Society, and how neceſſary it was that his Holineſs
ſhould deliver them from it; For he judg'd, that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65023:123"/>
this ſmall Community of <hi>Jeſuiteſſes,</hi> which yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
but of three Perſons, would in time become
numerous, and multiply in other Towns: but the
Conſideration which he had of the <hi>Catalonian</hi> Lady,
from whom he had receiv'd ſo many good Offices,
and who ſo earneſtly requeſted him not to abandon
her, made him manage the Matter with all poſſible
fairneſs and condeſcendency. Here is the Copy of
a Letter which he writ to her upon this Subject.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

am ſubject, and all my other Employments in the
Service of God, and of his Vicar upon Earth, will no
longer permit me ſo to do. On the other ſide, being
perſwaded, according to the light of my Conſcience,
that our little Society ought not to take upon them
the particular Conduct of any Women, who are not
engag'd in a Religious State by the Vows of Obedience,
as I have fully declar'd to our Holy Father the Pope;
it appears to the, that for the greater Glory of God,
I ought not any longer to look upon as my Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Child, but only as my very good Mother, as you
have been for many years, to the greater Glory of
God. So that, for the greater Service, and the

               <p>This Letter, which is ſo full of the Spirit of the
Saint, and where thoſe Words, which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in his Mouth, are ſo often repeated, diſpos'd
the Lady to receive with ſubmiſſion, what the Pope
determin'd upon the Matter. For <hi>Paul</hi> the Third
having well conſider'd, that Miſſioners deſign'd
over the whole World, ſhould not be ty'd by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Engagements, caus'd his Apoſtolical Letters
to be expedited, by which he exempted the Jeſuits
from the Government of Women, who either in
Community, or living ſingly, would put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
under the Obedience of the Society.</p>
               <p>The General reſted not ſatisfi'd with theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
The more to Confirm ſo Eſſential a Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he obtain'd the Year following from the Pope,
that the Society ſhould not be oblig'd to charge it
ſelf with the Direction of Religious Women, even
tho' they ſhould obtain Bulls, to put themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whoſe Conduct they pleas'd, unleſs ſuch Bulls
made expreſs mention of the Society. It is in virtue
of theſe Exemptions granted by the Pope, that <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
in his Conſtitutions forbids his Order to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
Religious, or other Perſons, with that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which Confeſſors in Ordinary, and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical

by giving leave to aſſiſt them in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Advancement, and ſometimes to hear their
Confeſſions, upon ſpecial Occaſions.</p>
               <p>But nothing more ſhews how his Judgment ſtood
in reference to this Government and Direction,<note place="margin">His Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules d' Eſte,</hi> Duke of <hi>Fera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi>
                  </note> of
which we laſt ſpoke, as did his Proceeding two or

<hi>Ferara,</hi> a declar'd Protector, and faithful Friend
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65023:124"/>
of the Society. This Prince, having built the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Ferara,</hi> deſir'd that the Jeſuits ſhould Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
a Monaſtery of Women, of which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
his Mother had been the Foundreſs. But Father
<hi>Ignatius</hi> could not conſent to it; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Intreaties of the Duke, he continu'd firm
in his Reſolution. According to the ſame Principle,
he ſent his Commands to the Fathers of <hi>Valladolid,</hi>
to give over the Conduct of a Monaſtery which
they had taken upon them, at the ſolicitation of
ſeveral conſiderable Perſons of the Town.</p>
               <p>This Proceeding of the General of the Jeſuits did
not hinder <hi>Hercules d' Eſte,</hi> who had taken up the
Reſolution of a Chriſtian Life, from having a Jeſuit
near his Perſon. <hi>Guidoni,</hi> the holy Archdeacon of
<hi>Modena,</hi> to whom he had imparted his thoughts,
very much approv'd the Deſign, and counſell'd him
to take Father <hi>Le Jay.</hi> The refuſal of the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
of <hi>Trieſte</hi> had render'd him famous; and he was
beſides known to the Prince, who had ſeen him ſome
Years before at <hi>Ferara,</hi> and had then Confidence
in him. On the other ſide, being a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> he
was leſs odious to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Ferara,</hi> who was
Daughter to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, and was unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
Engag'd in the new Hereſie, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſaid. The Duke made his Demand to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and to the Pope, for Father <hi>Le Jay.</hi> He was
granted to him without difficulty; becauſe the
Troubles of <hi>Italy</hi> rais'd by the Murder of <hi>Peter

which a contagious Sickneſs had made to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Bologna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Le Jay,</hi> before he parted for <hi>Ferara,</hi> conſulted
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> about the manner of his Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the Duke. The Father told him, That
being appointed by the Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65023:125"/>
the Service of one of the moſt eminent Benefactors
of the Society, he ought to Dedicate himſelf wholly
to it, and not to employ himſelf in any Charitable
Actions abroad, without the participation and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
of the Prince, who was to be in a manner to
him both Superior and General.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Ferara</hi> in the firſt place made the
Spiritual Exerciſes, under the Conduct of Father
<hi>Le Jay,</hi> as the Duke of <hi>Gandia</hi> had done before,
under that of Father <hi>Faber.</hi> It was the ordinary
Method every where us'd by the Jeſuits, for the

of the Flock of Jeſus Chriſt, and the

Advancement, we cannot chuſe but give ear to their
Intreaties, who ask any thing of us, which tends to

                     <p>Our deareſt Son, <hi>Francis de Borgia,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Gandia,</hi> has lately repreſented to us, that <hi>Ignatius
of</hi> Loyola, General of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by us
Eſtabliſh'd in our City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Confirm'd by
our Apoſtolical Authority, has Written certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
or Spiritual Exerciſes, Extracted out of
the holy Scriptures, and from the Experiences of a
Spiritual Life, in ſuch a Method and Form as is
very proper to touch the Heart. He hath moreover
declar'd, that he knows, not only by common Fame,
that theſe Exerciſes are very uſeful for the Profit and
Comfort of Souls, but more eſpecially by what he
himſelf has ſeen of the good done by them at <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona,</hi>
and at <hi>Gandia.</hi> Whereupon he has made his
Supplication to us, to have them Examin'd, and to
Approve them, if we ſhall find them worthy of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
and Commendation; to the end, that the
good Effects of them may be made more univerſal,
and that the Faithful with greater Encouragement
might make uſe of them.</p>
                     <p>We have accordingly caus'd them to be Examin'd,
and upon the Teſtimony which has been given us by
our dear Son <hi>John</hi> of the Title of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> Prieſt,
Cardinal, Biſhop of <hi>Burgos,</hi> and Inquiſitor of the
Faith; by our Venerable Brother <hi>Philip,</hi> Biſhop of

Exerciſes to be fill'd with the Spirit of God, and to
be very uſeful for the Edification, and the ſpiritual
Profit of the Faithful.</p>
                     <p>Having alſo regard, as we ought to have, to the
great good, which <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the Society by him

we of our own certain knowledge Approve by

Authority, all that is contain'd in that Book.
We moreover exhort all the Faithful of both Sexes,
in what Place of the World ſoever they be, devoutly
to practiſe ſuch Chriſtian Exerciſes; and we give
leave that the Book be Printed by any ſuch Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller

               <p>The Approbation, and the Printing of the Book
of the Exerciſes, which was Tranſlated out of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
into <hi>Latin,</hi> very much added to the Reputation
of the Founder of the Society.</p>
               <p>Since the Eſtabliſhment of his Order,<note place="margin">He goes out of <hi>Rome</hi> upon a work of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> he always
made his Abode in <hi>Rome,</hi> following therein his own
Inſtitution, that the General ought to have a fix'd
Habitation: nevertheleſs, he went forth for a ſhort
time upon a Charitable Account, and his Journey
had a happy Succeſs. The Inhabitants of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi>
and thoſe of <hi>Tivoli</hi> their Neighbors, having a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Feud one with the other, even to a kind of open
War, Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> at the Pope's Deſire, went
over to the Places themſelves. Having firſt Treated
with <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Wife to <hi>Octavius</hi> Duke
of <hi>Parma,</hi> who was Lord of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and next
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65023:126"/>
with the Magiſtrates of <hi>Tivoli,</hi> he brought thoſe
two Towns to this Agreement, That the Cardinal
<hi>De la Cueva</hi> ſhould be the Arbitrator of their Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
and that in the mean time they ſhould lay
down their Arms.</p>
               <p>It was upon this Occaſion that Signior <hi>Lewis
Mendoza,</hi> who Lodg'd the Father at <hi>Tivoli,</hi> made
the Offer to him of a commodious Houſe, with very
good Gardens, and a Chappel of our Lady's, which
had been built out of the Walls near the ſtately
Ruines of <hi>Moecenas's Villa.</hi> This new Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> compleated upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of our Lady, which nevertheleſs came far
ſhort of thoſe which about this time were made in
<hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don John de Vega,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who had
great Communication with the General of the
Society, when he was Ambaſſador from <hi>Charles</hi> the
Fifth at <hi>Rome,</hi> and who did nothing of Importance
without conſulting him, according to the Order
which he had receiv'd, was no ſooner at <hi>Meſſina,</hi>
but he took the Reſolution of Erecting there a
Colledge for the Society. <hi>Palermo</hi> immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Example of <hi>Meſſina:</hi> And theſe two Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
whither the General ſent Perſons of great
Vertue and Ability, were the firſt, after that of
<hi>Gandia,</hi> where Schools were open'd.</p>
               <p>At the departure of theſe excellent Workmen, of
which the principal were <hi>Peter Caniſius</hi> a <hi>German,
Andrew Fruſis</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and <hi>Jerome Nadal</hi> a
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> he told them what he uſually ſaid when
he ſent forth Miſſions: <hi>Go, Brethren, inflame, ſpread
about that Fire which</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>came to kindle on
the Earth.</hi> Before they went away, he would have
thoſe who were deſign'd to Teach Schools, make an
Eſſay before him of their Method, and their Ability.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65023:127"/>
He alſo would have them all take leave of the Pope,
to whom he himſelf conducted them. The Pope
receiv'd them with kindneſs, and exhorted them in
the firſt place to be very watchful againſt new
Hereſies.</p>
               <p>But Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He tries the Obedience of his Subjects.</note> before he cull'd out the
twelve which he ſent into <hi>Sicily,</hi> gave himſelf the
ſatisfaction of ſounding the bottom of their Souls,
and of trying the Temper, and the Obedience of his
Subjects in <hi>Rome,</hi> by ordering every one of them
to tell him in Writing, after three days of Prayer,
Firſt, Whether they were indifferent to go into
<hi>Sicily,</hi> and whether that which the General ſhould
determine (who to them is in the place of God)
would be moſt welcom to them? Secondly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in caſe they were ſent into <hi>Sicily,</hi> they ſhould
be ready either to Teach, and perform ſuch other
Functions as require Learning and Ability, or to be
employ'd in Domeſtical Offices? Thirdly, If it
ſhould ſo happen, that they were appointed for
Study, and Regency, whether they would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to Study what Science, and to Teach what
School it ſhould pleaſe the Superior? Laſtly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they did believe, that what ever Obedience
ſhould preſcribe to them, was moſt proper for them,
and moſt conducible to their eternal good?</p>
               <p>They every one brought in their Writing upon
the Day aſſign'd, and there was not one of them in
their whole number of Thirty ſix, who did not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
declare, That he was ready to go not only
into <hi>Sicily,</hi> but into the <hi>Indies;</hi> and that he would
willingly employ his whole Life in the meaneſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
whenever their good Father, and their honor'd
Maſter in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhould give them the least
intimation of his Will.</p>
               <p>It was not enough for a Man, who deſign'd to do
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65023:127"/>
good to the whole Earth,<note place="margin">The Society enters into <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
                  </note> to labor in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in
<hi>Aſia,</hi> for the gaining of Souls. <hi>John Nugnes,</hi> and
<hi>Lewis Gonzales,</hi> were ſent, almoſt at the ſame time,

of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who concern'd at
the Captivity of a great number of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
ſome Fathers of the Society, to Negotiate
the delivery of the Slaves, and to confirm them in
their Faith.</p>
               <p>A little time after, the Viceroy of <hi>Sicily</hi> having
Orders from <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, to paſs over into
<hi>Africa</hi> with a good Army, to make War upon <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gut,</hi>
a famous Pirate, who was poſſeſs'd of a ſtrong
Place on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> from whence he
made his Excurſions as far as <hi>Naples;</hi> Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
was deſirous that <hi>Laynez</hi> ſhould leave <hi>Sicily,</hi>
where he was Superior, and ſhould follow <hi>Don John
de Vega</hi> in his Expedition againſt the Moors, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Hoſpital of the Army.</p>
               <p>Four other Jeſuits before this time were gone into
the Weſtern Parts of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> to the Kingdom of
<hi>Congo,</hi> where the Goſpel was quite extinguiſh'd,
which <hi>Don Emanuel,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
there caus'd to be Preach'd and Planted: And
it was now, at the Inſtance of <hi>John</hi> the Third, Son
and Succeſſor of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> that Father <hi>Simon Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driguez</hi>
ſent thoſe Evangelical Laborers, in the
Name of their common Father <hi>Ignatius.</hi> Laſtly,
under the auſpicious Protection of that Prince, the
Society enter'd alſo into the Southern Parts of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
when <hi>Don Soza,</hi> Captain General of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>

               <p>God was not pleas'd to grant ſuch happy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs

                  </note> and at the ſame time that
the Society ſpread it ſelf over the whole World, it
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65023:128"/>
was his Divine Pleaſure to exerciſe it at home with
troubleſom Accidents. After the Battel which the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> loſt, and in which the Duke
of <hi>Saxony</hi> was made Priſoner, the Emperor, ſeeing
that the Aſſembly at <hi>Bologna</hi> was broken up, and
that according to all appearances it would not be
renew'd in a long time, undertook himſelf to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
the Faith of his People, till ſuch time as the
Council ſhould meet again to Decide about it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he caus'd to be publiſh'd in the Dyet
of <hi>Auſpurg</hi> a Formulary of Faith, which was call'd
<hi>The Interim,</hi> and contain'd Articles altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church;
as for Example, the Marriage of Prieſts, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
under both Kinds. Among all the Doctors,
who oppos'd this Imperial Libel, <hi>Nicholas Boba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilla,</hi>
whom Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had ſtill left in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
was the moſt zealous and fervent. He was
then at the Court of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, cheriſh'd by
the <hi>Catholick</hi> Lords, whoſe Conſciences he Directed,
and fear'd by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whom he always vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
oppos'd. His reſolute and untemporizing
Humour was the cauſe, that declaiming againſt the
<hi>Interim</hi> with great heat, he let fall ſome ſharp
words, which reflected upon the Perſon of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror:
He highly blam'd ſuch Condeſcendence and
Compliance with Hereticks, and warmly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
even in the Preſence of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth,
that nothing was more likely to keep Diviſions ſtill
on foot, then a falſe Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who thought his Honor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to juſtifie what he had done, and who look'd
upon all as Rebels that did not concur with him,
could not endure the liberty of <hi>Bobadilla:</hi> He not
only forbad him the Court, but baniſh'd him out of
all the Territories of the Empire. <hi>Bobadilla</hi> obey'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

ful of Glory for having ſuffer'd Reproch in the
Cauſe of God, and immediately came to <hi>Rome,</hi>
where the Agreement of <hi>Auſpurg</hi> had but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
approbation. But Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not think
it expedient to receive, at his firſt coming, into the
Houſe of the Society, a Man whoſe Zeal had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
him too far, and who in defending the Church,
had not ſhewn due Reſpect to his Imperial Majeſty.

in <hi>Spain</hi> to the Enemies of the Society to riſe

Doctor of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> being poſſeſs'd, I know not
how, with a Fancy that the end of the World drew
near, and that Antichriſt would quickly appear, to
make up his Viſion compleat, would needs have it,
that the Jeſuits were the <hi>Praecurſors</hi> of Antichriſt;
the People call'd them <hi>Inigiſts</hi> from the Name of
<hi>Inigo,</hi> which in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſignifies <hi>Ignatius.</hi> Some gave
them the Title of <hi>Theatines,</hi> for the Reaſon former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>
                  <hi>Cano</hi> grounded his Imaginations upon the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Inſtitute, which had no reſemblance with
the ancient Orders; Their having no peculiar
Habit ſeem'd to him a good cover for Libertiniſm:
Their reſort and Commerce with the People of the

               </p>
               <p>He utter'd all he thought, and his great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

in the firſt place gave God thanks that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety

another, to be his Legat Apoſtolical in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
He ſent at the ſame time into <hi>Spain</hi> a new Copy of
the Sentence, pronounc'd by the Governor of <hi>Rome,
Benedict Converſino,</hi> in favour of the Society againſt

from the Pope, which conſtituted the Biſhop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanca</hi>
Protector of the Reputation of an Order
Confirm'd by the Holy See. The General of the

after having magnifi'd the Advantages which the
Church receiv'd from the Regular Prieſts, Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd

               <p>
                  <hi>Cano</hi>'s Imaginations were ſo deeply rooted in
him, that he had no regard, either to the Pope's
Bull, or to the Letter of his General; for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
his Invectives with an Animoſity, which
border'd upon Fury. But ſuch was his Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy,
that it only ſerv'd to undeceive thoſe Men
whom his Authority had miſled. All the World
took the Society's part; there were none, even
among the Religious of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who did not
declare in their behalf, againſt one of their own Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
F. <hi>John Penna,</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and
no leſs eminent in Vertue then in Learning, was he
who ſignaliz'd himſelf moſt: for, not content to
refute the Viſions of <hi>Melchior Cano</hi> in the Pulpit,

that he asked leave of his General to give over the

by ſhewing him, that when God had once ſet out our
way to us, we ought faithfully to follow it, and not to
turn aſide into any other, under pretence that it ſeems
to us the ſtraiter and the ſurer; That a ſolitary
Life has its dangers no leſs then the Apoſtolical Life;
That indeed we ought not to commit the leaſt Fault
with a deliberate purpoſe for the whole World, but
we muſt not renounce the Employments of Charity
through the fear of ſmall Faults, which human frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is ſubject to; That on the other ſide, nothing is
more generous, nothing more divine, then to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
our Repoſe, and all our Concerns, to the good
of Souls.</p>
               <p>As much enamor'd as <hi>Oviedo</hi> was with his ſecond
Vocation, he quite loſt the thought of it, as ſoon as
he receiv'd the Anſwer of Father <hi>Ignatius. Don
Francis de Borgia,</hi> to whom <hi>Oviedo</hi> had imparted
his Deſigns of Retirement, profited no leſs then he
by the Advice of the Saint.</p>
               <p>This Duke had made a Vow at <hi>Granada</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

the Book of Exerciſes, that he made his choice
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65023:130"/>
of the Society, againſt his natural Inclination, which
inclin'd him to Solitude. He open'd his mind to
Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and he had no great difficulty to
make him believe that his Vocation was a true one;
for when <hi>Peter Faber</hi> dy'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> God did then
reveal to him, that a Grandee of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould ſupply
his Place, and that this Grandee was the Duke of
<hi>Gandia.</hi> Wherefore the Father approv'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign

                     <p>THE Reſolution, which you have taken, and
which God has been pleas'd to inſpire you with,
fills me with unſpeakable joy. May the Angels, and
all the Saints praiſe his holy Name, and render him
Eternal thanks in Heaven, for we on Earth are not
able to make any condign Acknowledgement of the
tranſcendent Bleſſing, which his Divine Goodneſs has
beſtow'd upon his ſmall Society, in calling you to it.</p>
                     <p>I hope his Providence deſigns hereby conſiderable
Advantages of Spiritual Advancement, not only to
your ſelf, but to an infinity of Perſons, who will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by ſo great an Example. For us, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> (we ſhall) excited by
your fervor, begin a freſh to ſerve the Divine Father
of the Family, who gives us ſuch a Brother, and
who has made choice of ſuch a Workman for his new
Vineyard, of which it has been his Pleaſure, that I
(tho' unworthy) ſhould have the Care.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, from this time forward, I receive you,
in the Name of our Lord, for our Brother; and in
this Quality, you ſhall always be moſt dear to me,
as ſuch a Perſon ought to be, who enters into the
Houſe of God with ſo much generoſity, as you do,
only, and perfectly to ſerve him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:65023:131"/>
For what you deſire to know of me, concerning the
time, and the manner of your publick Reception, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having ſeriouſly recommended the matter to God,
both in my own, and in the Prayers of many beſides, it
appears to me, that to the end you may the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
your ſelf of all your obligations, this change
ought to be made leiſurely, and with a great deal
of Circumſpection, to the greater Glory of our Lord.
Thus you may by little and little ſettle your affairs in
ſuch ſort that without diſcloſing your ſelf to any Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Perſon, you may in a ſhort time find your ſelf free,
and diſingag'd from all, that may retard the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of your holy Deſires.</p>
                     <p>And the better to explicate my ſelf, in coming to
particulars, I am of opinion, that ſince your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are at an Age of being Married, you ſhould in
the firſt place provide for them, according to their
Quality; and alſo diſpoſe of the Marqueſs your Son,
if a convenient Match be offer'd. For your other
Sons, it will not be ſufficient for them to have their
reliance upon their Elder Brother, to whom the
Dukedom will fall: You muſt leave them wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to go through their Studies in one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Univerſities, and to ſubſiſt honorably in the
World: And you may reaſonably expect, that if they
prove ſuch, as they ought to be, and ſuch as I hope
they will be, the Emperor will beſtow his favors upon
them in ſome proportion to your ſervices, and to that
good will, which he has always manifeſted towards
you.</p>
                     <p>I think it would be alſo convenient for you to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
thoſe Buildings which you have begun: For
I would have all the buſineſs of your Family fully
ended, before you publiſh to the World your change of
life. In the mean time, whereas you are already
well grounded in Learning, I ſhould deſire, that you
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65023:131"/>
would ſeriouſly apply your ſelf to the Study of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which Science will be moſt uſeful to you for
the ſervice of God; nor would it be amiſs, if it
might be done, that you took the Degree of Doctor
in your Univerſity of <hi>Gandia:</hi> but in regard that
the World is not yet prepar'd for news of this nature,
I would have it done without any noiſe, and that it
ſhould be kept ſecret, until time, and your occaſions
ſhall, with Gods permiſſion, give you an entire Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                     <p>Other matters we may ſettle, and determin from
time to time, according to the diverſity of occurrences;
wherefore, intending to keep a regular Correſpondency
with you, I ſhall ſay no more at preſent. Be pleas'd
to anſwer me at your firſt leiſure, and I ſhall always
continue my Prayers to the Sovereign Goodneſs, more
and more to ſtrengthen you with his Grace.</p>

               <p>Tho' Don <hi>Franciſco</hi> was very well inclin'd to
follow the Councils of Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> yet ſtill
he found a Byas in himſel, which made his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
lean towards Solitude; ſuch reſiſtance doth
Grace find, even in the moſt holy Souls, when it
doth not comply with the natural temper. But what
the Father had writ to <hi>Ovideo,</hi> to confirm and fix
him in his Vocation, did ſo ſtrike the Duke, that a
holy Impatience took him of entring into the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
before thoſe things were done which were
preſcribed to him. To this end he writ to <hi>Rome</hi>
ſo preſſingly, that Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> having obtain'd
leave for him from the Holy See, to make his
Vows of Profeſſion, without leaving the World,
conſented, that he ſhould make uſe of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Gandia</hi> therefore conſecrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to God, by the Solemn Vows of the Society,
in the Chappel of his Pallace, in the preſence of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65023:132"/>
few perſons, retaining ſtill his outward <hi>Grandeur,</hi>
and the power of Poſſeſſing his eſtate for three years,
as may be ſeen more at large in his Life, which has
been ſet forth by one of our beſt Writers in a very
moving and elegant Stile.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He moderates the fervor of <hi>Borgia</hi> and others.</note> who from that time, call'd Don
<hi>Franciſco de Borgia</hi> by the Name of Father <hi>Francis,</hi>
and who look'd upon him, as one of his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
began to direct him in the ways of God, and
to exerciſe the Authority of General upon him. The
Duke, who liv'd like a Religious man, before he
had made the Vows of Religion, thought himſelf
oblig'd after his Profeſſion to redouble his practices
of Piety and Pennance: But his fervor led him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
exceſſes, which were neither convenient for a
Man in the World, nor for a Member of the Society.
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> thought it not fit to leave him to
the tranſports of his Devotion: He gave him to
underſtand, that ſuch as are deſtin'd by Heaven to
inſtruct the Ignorant, and to oppoſe Hereſies, muſt
not always be at the Foot of Altars; and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they muſt leave Prayer for Study. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alſo declar'd to him, that a Perſon like him,
who had a weak Stomach, and a tender Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ought to moderate his Faſting, and in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
manner to nouriſh himſelf for the ſupport
of his health. <hi>You have receiv'd from God a Body,
as well as a Soul,</hi> (ſaid the Saint in expreſs terms,)
<hi>and you muſt equally give an Account to God, both
of the one, and the other.</hi> But becauſe the Duke did
every day diſcipline himſelf to Blood, in manner of
the flagellation of the Son of God, he forbad him
theſe extremities, which might render him uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of performing the Functions of the Society.</p>
               <p>It was one of the principal cares of Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
to moderate the fervor of his Children; and he was
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65023:132"/>
forc'd ſometimes to make uſe of all his Authority to
reſtrain them, as he did towards <hi>Simon Rodriguez,</hi>
whom the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had intruſted with the
Education of the Prince Don <hi>John. Rodriguez,</hi>
who paſſionately deſir'd to be imploy'd in Foreign
Miſſions, ſought all occaſions to remove himſelf
from Court. He would fain have accompani'd the
Miſſioners, who parted from <hi>Portugal</hi> into <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia:</hi>
Afterwards he deſir'd to go to <hi>Braſile;</hi> he was
many times upon the point of embarking for the
<hi>Indies;</hi> and he would certainly have ſatisfi'd his
Zeal, if the General, to whom he communicated
his deſigns, had not abſolutely forbad him to leave
his Poſt, telling him withal, that the Educating in
the fear of God the Children of Kings, was vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
the ſaving a great many People; and that
the Court was a place of greater merit to us, then
either <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> or <hi>Braſile,</hi> when we ſtaid there in
Vertue of holy Obedience.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caſa Profeſſa</hi> was at that time reduc'd to
great neceſſity,<note place="margin">His confidence in God recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced.</note> by the death of <hi>Paul</hi> the Third,
who conſtantly beſtow'd great Alms upon it, and
by that of Father <hi>Codacius,</hi> who had care of their
temporals. However, the General ceas'd not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thoſe Novices, who preſented themſelves;
and God ſeem'd to recompence his reliance on him,
with miraculous aſſiſtance. For, beſides that the
Cardinals in the <hi>Conclave</hi> were mindful of him, and
ſent him a good ſupply of Money, Brother <hi>John de
la Croce,</hi> who manag'd their houſhold Proviſions,
coming one Evening from St. <hi>John Laterans,</hi> and
paſſing by the <hi>Colizeum,</hi> met a Man, who without
ſaying a word to him, gave him an hundred
Crowns in Gold.</p>
               <p>Another time the ſame Brother, going out very
early in the Morning, receiv'd from an unknown
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65023:133"/>
Perſon a Purſe full of pieces of Gold, newly Coin'd. It
not being quite day, ſo as to diſtinguiſh the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Perſon, that put the Purſe into his hands,
he began to fear, that it was an Illuſion. The Fathers,
on their ſide, believ'd that the Pieces were Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,
and that ſome body had put a trick upon them;
but at laſt they found, that the Gold was very good.
Near the ſame time, and when they were in great
ſtraits, Father <hi>Polancus,</hi> Secretary of the Society,
looking for ſome Papers in an open Cheſt, found
there a quantity of Crowns of Gold, which ſeem'd
to him to have been newly ſtampt.</p>
               <p>All theſe Miraculous recruits, as they very much
confirm'd Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his reliance upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
ſo they did not at all diminiſh in him his
prudential care for the ſubſiſtance of his Body. The
houſhold Affairs he put into the hands of Father
<hi>Pontius Gogordan,</hi> a very able Man, but without
leaving the Conduct wholly to him: For he himſelf
would ſupervize, both to obſerve his demeanor in
that Office, and to aſſiſt him in ſo painful an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
In gratitude to the Memory of Father
<hi>Codacius,</hi> for procuring a ſubſiſtence to the Houſe
in difficult times, and for having ſpent himſelf in
the ſervice of his Brethren, he caus'd the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
to be done him after his death, which are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given to the Benefactors of the Society, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
a Marble ſtone to be laid over his Grave, with
an honorable Inſcription.</p>
               <p>The concern,<note place="margin">His applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make Learning flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</note> which Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had for the
livelihood of his ſubjects, did not diſtract him in his
care of promoting Study, and of making Sciences
to floriſh in his Order. He oblig'd the Profeſſors of
<hi>Meſſina,</hi> and <hi>Palermo,</hi> to ſend him an Account every
Week of their labors, and he caus'd to be ſent to
him from the farther end of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Theſis of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65023:133"/>
Philoſophy and Divinity, together with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
both in Proſe and Verſe of the young
Regents: And he expreſly Order'd, that they ſhould
be ſent him, juſt as they came out of their hands,
without being toucht over, or lookt upon by any
body elſe: Nor did the great Affairs of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hinder him from reading them, and having
them examin'd in his preſence, by the beſt judging
Perſons. Above all, he ſolicitouſly inform'd himſelf of
the progreſs, which the Scholars of the Society made,
who Studied at <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe he look'd upon that
Univerſity, as the principal Seminary of his Order.</p>
               <p>But if he underſtood, that any of the Profeſſors
of <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> did follow ſingular Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
in oppoſition to thoſe commonly receiv'd in
Schools, he preſently remov'd them, how great
Wits ſoever they were; and he ſaid, that if he liv'd
a thouſand years, he would never give over crying
down all Novelties in Divinity, in Philoſophy, and
even in Grammar. After the ſame faſhion he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoſe, whom their Learning had made ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited,
or leſs devout. And he was wont to
ſay, that Science is loſt upon him, who makes
ill uſe of it. By devotion he did not mean
Spiritual Guſts, and Interior Conſolations, but
a ſteady and faithful performance of Devout Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
and of Religious Vertues: For he well knew,
that the time of Studies, was not the proper ſeaſon
of thoſe Celeſtial Favors, which require a Spirit of
Recollection; and we read in one of his Letters,
that we are not to be ſtartled at it, if ſpeculative
Sciences, and human Learning, ſhould diminiſh in
us that kind of ſenſible Devotion; That provided
in Studying, we only ſeek God, our Studies are
good Devotions; and that if we allot to Prayer the
whole time, which the Rule preſcribes, we ought
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65023:134"/>
not to concern our ſelves, whether we find in it
ſweetneſs or drineſs. So that, there was nothing,
which he recommended more, both to the Profeſſors
and to the Scholars of his Order, then to Dedicate
all their Labours to the greater Glory of God, and to
perſwade themſelves, that Study, with ſo noble an
intention, was more agreeable to Heaven, then
continual Prayer.</p>
               <p>The Zeal of <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> furniſht Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ignatius</hi> with a fair occaſion of ſhewing the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of three Learned Perſons.<note place="margin">He ſends three Divines to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golstadt.</hi>
                  </note> This moſt Catholick
Prince, who was the ſupport of the Ancient Religion
in <hi>Germany,</hi> demanded of the General ſome able Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
that might raiſe up the Honor of Theology
in the Univerſity of <hi>Ingolſtadt,</hi> where the Hereticks
had render'd Divine Sciences very contemptible.
The Father choſe <hi>Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Caniſius,</hi> to whom
he joyn'd <hi>le Jay,</hi> whom the Duke by name requir'd,
and who was ſpar'd for a time by the Duke of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi>
at the inſtance of Cardinal <hi>Farneſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to the end, that theſe three Divines might
have a Character to Authorize their Doctrine, he
would have them, as they paſt through <hi>Bologna,</hi>
to receive the Degree of Doctor, after the uſual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amens;
And this was ſolemnly done by the order of
Cardinal <hi>John Maria de Monte,</hi> who was then <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius
Apoſtolicus,</hi> and was afterwards choſen Pope,
by the Name of <hi>Julius</hi> the Third. With this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Doctors, of which the <hi>Germans</hi> are very fond,
and which by the Proteſtants was ſo much magnifi'd
in the Perſon of <hi>Luther, Le Jay, Caniſius,</hi> and
<hi>Salmeron</hi> were well receiv'd at <hi>Ingolſtadt. Salmeron</hi>
undertook to explicate the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul; le Jay</hi>
the Pſalms of <hi>David;</hi> and <hi>Caniſius</hi> the Maſter of
the <hi>Sentences.</hi> Each of them perform'd their Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with ſo much Credit, and Fruit, that Duke
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65023:134"/>
                  <hi>William</hi> reſolv'd to Build for them a magnificent
Colledge. His death diſappointed the deſign, but
he recommended to his Son <hi>Albert</hi> the care of theſe
Children of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' the Saint extreamly deſir'd,<note place="margin">The Society makes ſmall progreſs in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> that the Society,

have Credit there, as it had in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in
many other places, yet in that Kingdom it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
obſcure, without making any progreſs. The
Jeſuits of <hi>Paris</hi> were ſhut up in the Colledge of the
<hi>Lombards</hi> where they lodg'd, applying themſelves
only to Study, and to good works. True it is,
that <hi>William de Prat,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Clermont,</hi> who had
known the new Society at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
very much favor'd them: But the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi>
who had receiv'd doubtful impreſſions of them, was
not their Friend; and a certain Doctor, who had
the Biſhops friendſhip, declar'd War openly againſt
them, every where ſaying, that this newly born
Society, had ſomething of the Monſter in it, and
that it could not be long liv'd; that he who had ſet
it on foot, was a little <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Viſionary; that it
was better to relieve Beggers, and Vagabonds, then
theſe Jeſuits; and that it would not be ill done, to
have them driven out of the Kingdom.</p>

Avila,</hi> that famous, and fervent Preacher, and that
enlightned Director, publiſht in <hi>Spain,</hi> that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the work of God; and that if his
Age would have permitted it, he ſhould have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
the Inſtitute of <hi>Ignatius:</hi> He added, that he
knew no man more interior, and fill'd with more
ſupernatural wiſdom: That he had conceiv'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
within himſelf the ſame deſign, which this
new Founder had executed; but that he was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65023:135"/>
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but as a Child compar'd to a
Giant, or to a Man of great Strength, who carries
a burden, without feeling it, which the Child can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lift up.</p>
               <p>This Doctor very much approv'd, what Father <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
had writ to him, concerning the invectives
of <hi>Melchior Cano;</hi> That according to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Doctors, and Fathers of the Church, we
ought not to ſuffer the Reputation of Evangelical
Miniſters to be run down; And that, when ill mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
prepoſſeſt Perſons would bring ſuſpicion, and
infamy upon them, it was neceſſary to implore the
Aſſiſtance of the Holy See, to ſtop the career of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,</hi>
or at leaſt to ſhew the injuſtice of it.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Lewis de Granada,</hi> ſo famous
for his Piety, and for his Writings, one of the Chiefeſt
Ornaments of the holy Order of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> highly
exalted the Society in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and Preaching one
day in the Town of <hi>Ebora</hi> before Cardinal <hi>Henry,</hi>
he ſaid, that the new Society was an Aſſembly of
Apoſtolical men, choſen by God to renew in theſe
latter times the ſanctity of the firſt Ages. He ſaid
upon another occaſion, that he had receiv'd ſo much
light from the Spiritual Exerciſes of Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
that his whole life would not ſuffice to write down
what God had communicated to him in the Practice
of thoſe Exerciſes.</p>
               <p>The affection which the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> teſtifi'd in
all places to the Society,<note place="margin">The Order of the <hi>Carthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> affectionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</note> did it no ſmall Honor. This
holy Order, which has always preſerv'd its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Spirit, and which reſpreſents on Earth the life,
which the Angels lead in Heaven, not content to
Favor the Jeſuits upon all occaſions, would farther
contract with them a ſtrait Alliance, in making them
participate of their Prayers, their Sacrifices, and
Abſtinences, requiring the like from them, to be made
partakers of their Works of Charity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:65023:135"/>
To this effect the whole Order writ to Father
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> in the time of their General Chapter;
and the Letter which was ſign'd by Don <hi>Peter de
Sardis,</hi> Prior of the <hi>Grande Chartreuſe,</hi> mentions,
that he and his Religious, being edifi'd with the
innocent Life, the holy Doctrine, and the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
labours of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> had given
thanks to God for having rais'd it in ſo corrupt an
Age; And that they deſir'd to aid and aſſiſt it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Power, to continue their Holy
Miniſtery, notwithſtanding all Contradictions, and
Perſecutions, which inſeperably attend the life of
perfect Chriſtians. Thus theſe two Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
which ſeem to have the leaſt of ſimilitude in
their Inſtitutes, were the moſt united by the Spirit
of Charity; And after this, we are not to wonder,
if the Jeſuits at this day have a particular friendſhip
and veneration for the <hi>Carthuſians:</hi> They have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited
theſe ſentiments from their firſt Fathers, and
they are glad of the Occaſion to manifeſt them.</p>
               <p>But that,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> grants many Favors to the General of the Society.</note> which gave the greateſt Credit to the
Society, was that Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Third, who had
taken particular notice of it at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
being now choſen in the room of <hi>Paul</hi> the Third,
gave to Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> publick marks of his good
Will. This was about the beginning of the Jubile
year 1550. The Father went to do his Homage
to the Pope, and to beg of his Holineſs, that the
Labourers of the Society, who were in <hi>Africa,</hi> in
<hi>Braſile,</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and in <hi>Japan,</hi> might toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their <hi>Neophits,</hi> gain the Jubile, without
coming to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope embrac'd him, and
after having declar'd to him, how much he lov'd
his Order; <hi>As to the Favor which you ask of me,</hi>
he ſaid ſmiling, <hi>I grant it with this reſtriction, that
you ſhall have all my Power in that particular, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65023:136"/>
that, for your Brethrens gaining the Indulgences of
the holy Year, you ſhall Preſcribe them to do what
you think fit.</hi> He granted him the ſame Favor, not
only for ſeveral perſons in <hi>Meſſina,</hi> in <hi>Venice,</hi> and
in <hi>Paris,</hi> but alſo for the Troops, which Don <hi>John
de Vega,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Sicily,</hi> had carry'd into <hi>Africk,</hi>
and for the whole Town of <hi>Gandia,</hi> which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of Don <hi>Francis de Borgia,</hi> had this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence
above all the Towns in the World.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, <hi>Julius</hi> the Third, gave permiſſion to
Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and to all the Prieſts of the Society,
to exerciſe in the Jubile year all thoſe Privileges,
which <hi>Paul</hi> the Third had granted them; Tho',
according to the uſage of the Church, Religious
Orders, who have Power from the Holy See to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
in reſerv'd Caſes, are not to uſe their Power
in the time of the grand Jubile. To crown all his
Favors, he again confirm'd the Inſtitute, and by
an expreſs Bull, in which all things are clear'd and
explain'd. His Liberalites were alſo very conſiderable
to the Jeſuites of <hi>Rome,</hi> and, what is worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
he commanded the General, in vertue of
holy Obedience, to come and tell him as often as the
profeſt Houſe ſhould be in any neceſſity.</p>
               <p>In the mean time,<note place="margin">He ſubmits the Conſtitutions to the Cenſure of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Fathers.</note> Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> having finiſh'd
his Conſtitutions, had it in his thoughts to Print them,
but he would firſt ſubmit them to the Judgment and
Cenſure of the chief among the Fathers, and the
opportunity of the Jubile year favor'd his deſign.
Wherefore he ſummon'd to <hi>Rome</hi> all that were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in Merit, and Authority, and they all came,
except <hi>Simon Rodriguez,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
detain'd at <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He put the Conſtitutions into their hands, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them ſtrictly to examin and weigh them; and
to tell him freely what they thought might need
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65023:136"/>
amendment, or alteration. Intending that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
and Spirit of the Society, ſhould be uniform in
all places, and that the Rules of Government ſhould
be ſuitable to different Nations, and Tempers; he
was very glad that the Fathers Aſſembled, who
were of ſeveral Countries, and of unlike Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
ſhould be themſelves Judges of theſe Rules.
He ſent a Copy of the Conſtitutions to <hi>Rodriguez,</hi>
upon whoſe Judgment he much reli'd; he alſo ſent
one for the ſame reaſon, to ſome of the Spiritual
Coadjutors, who tho' not ſo Learn'd, were Men
of great Prudence.</p>
               <p>After having heard the Opinions of thoſe who
were preſent, and receiv'd the Anſwers of the abſent,
he toucht over his work again, and joyning their
lights with his own, he finiſht the Piece. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
being perſwaded that only time and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
can demonſtrate the Perfection of Laws, he
would have no abſolute obligation laid upon the
Society, of obſerving the Conſtitutions, until the
whole Order aſſembl'd in a Body, ſhould approve
them; and this did not happen till after his death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Generalſhip of <hi>Laynez.</hi> They were not only
Review'd, and Authoriz'd by the firſt general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
but they were alſo confirm'd by the Holy
Apoſtolick See, after an exact diſcuſſion, which four
Cardinals made of them, without changing one word.</p>
               <p>As the year of the Jubile ſeem'd very proper to
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> for convening the Fathers in <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He endeavors to lay down the Generalſhip of his Order.</note>
ſo the Opportunity of their being there appear'd no
leſs favorable to him, to execute a deſign, which
he had long in his thoughts. He at firſt took the
charge of Government upon him with great repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
as we have already ſeen; and when it was
laid upon him againſt his will, he made account,
that he ſhould be one day freed from it, to enjoy
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65023:137"/>
the eaſe of Obeying, and the merit of Obedience.
He did believe that the happy day was now come,
and his continual Infirmities, in an Age far advanc'd,
ſeem'd to promiſe him that, which he ſo paſſionately
deſir'd. To this end, he call'd all the Fathers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
but remembring the oppoſition they had
made him, when he refus'd to receive the charge of
General, inſtead of being preſent at the Aſſembly,
he ſent them a Letter, writ with his own hand, and
couch't in theſe terms.</p>

                     <p>AFter divers Reflections, which I have made at

I will tell you ſincerly, as in the preſence of my

Eternity, what I believe to be moſt for the Glory of
his Divine Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>Conſidering my Sins, my Defects, and all my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
Corporal and Spiritual, I have often
thought, that I was very far from having thoſe
Qualities, which are requiſite to ſuſtain the Burden,
which you have laid upon me. I deſire therefore, in

                     <p>After due conſideration had upon it, in the Name

I depoſe my ſelf, and ſimply and abſolutely, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

               <p>The Reading of this Letter did very much Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
and Contriſtate the Aſſembly; ſome with
admiration extol'd the humility of their Father,
others more aſtoniſht and inwardly toucht, kept a
profound ſilence; but in concluſion, they all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
his laying down his Office, Father <hi>Ovidoe</hi>
only excepted, who was a man, that had the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and candor of the firſt Ages. When it came to
his turn, he ſaid, that to him it appear'd, that Father
<hi>Ignatius</hi> ought not to be reſiſted; and when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
asked him his reaſon, <hi>becauſe</hi> (he repli'd) <hi>he
who is a Saint, has lights, which we have not.</hi> But
opening his eyes, and finding that Saints are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
unjuſt to themſelves, he condemn'd his firſt
thoughts, and came in to the reſt. They ſent to
declare the Reſolution of the Aſſembly to the
General; which was, that as long as God ſhould
pleaſe to preſerve his life, they would have no other
Head nor Superior.</p>
               <p>So that, notwithſtanding all his endeavors to the
contrary, they would not hearken to him, and he
was forc'd to ſubmit. This Submiſſion lay heavy
at the bottom of his Heart, and was probably the
cauſe of a great Sickneſs, which ſoon after ſiez'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. He fell ill upon <hi>Chriſtmas-day,</hi> after he
had ſaid two of the Maſſes. His Diſeaſe growing
dangerous, he did believe, that God was pleas'd by
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65023:138"/>
taking his Life, to free him from that Load of which
Men would not diſcharge him. This thought fill'd
him with joy; and his hopes of being quickly looſed
from the Fetters of his Body, fill'd his Soul with the
moſt ſenſible Delights which Saints can taſte in this
World. He now deſir'd nothing but to ſee his God;
and the approaches of Eternity did ſo enflame his
Deſires, that he was in a continual Tranſport. The
Phyſicians order'd him to moderate thoſe ardent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
leaſt they ſhould haſten his Death. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were that he obey'd them, or that they were
deceiv'd in their Conjectures, he by degrees reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
and entred again upon the Exerciſe of his
Charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Franciſco de Borgia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He Treats at <hi>Rome</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi>
                  </note> who was a Member of
the Society, under the outward appearance of a
Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> and whom Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had
invited to <hi>Rome,</hi> was now arriv'd there, with the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> and the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Fathers, after having
Marry'd his eldeſt Son and his Daughters. He was
Lodg'd in an Apartment of the <hi>Caſa Profeſſa,</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the Community; and all his delight was
to entertain Father <hi>Ignatius.</hi> He gave him an exact
Account of his Interior, and he often conferr'd with
him about his manner of Prayer, his Pennances, and
the whole Conduct of his Life.</p>
               <p>During theſe Entertainments, it came into the
thoughts of the Duke of <hi>Gandia,</hi> to do ſomething
which might make the Society more flouriſhing in
<hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which was to Eſtabliſh a Colledge there.
He gave Six thouſand Crowns in Gold towards the
Foundation; whereupon Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> offering
him the Title of a Founder, he refus'd it, ſaying,
<hi>That Honor was to be reſerv'd for ſome other Perſon,
who ſhould give a Foundation worthy of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis
of the World:</hi> As if he had foreſeen that Pope
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65023:138"/>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth was one day magnificently
to Erect the <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge.</p>
               <p>The Society was not at <hi>Paris</hi> in the ſame Poſture
as at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Society ill treated at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> Many of the Univerſity, and of the
Parliament, ſeem'd to make it their Buſineſs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
the Order. They diſputed every thing with
them, even to their very Name. A certain <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi>
Preaching in the Church of St. <hi>Severin,</hi> took
an occaſion to inveigh againſt the new Society, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe words of St. <hi>Paul, Brethren in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
Hereupon he was much offended, that they ſhould
arrogate to themſelves the Name of <hi>The Society of
Jeſus,</hi> not conſidering, that the Sovereign Biſhops,
and the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> had nam'd
them ſo. At the ſame time a Man of the long Robe,
and of great Reputation and Credit, ſet upon them,
by calumniating their Manners and Doctrine. This
Enemy was ſo much the more to be fear'd, for that
under the appearances of a holy Life, he conceal'd
Heretical Sentiments, which afterwards he made
manifeſt, when retiring to <hi>Francfort,</hi> he publickly
profeſs'd Hereſie.</p>
               <p>Theſe new Perſecutions rais'd no ſmall hopes in
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> of a happy ſucceſs in the concluſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the word of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>God revives,
after having mortifi'd.</hi> As his hopes at length did
not fail him, ſo neither did theſe preſent difficulties
deject him. The Biſhop of <hi>Clermont</hi> ſtill continu'd
his good Offices to the Jeſuits of <hi>Paris,</hi> who yet
Lodg'd in the Colledge of the <hi>Lombards;</hi> His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
was to beſtow upon them <hi>Clermont</hi> Houſe for
their Habitation, with annual Rents for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.
But there was no profeſs'd Father among
them to take poſſeſſion of the Houſe, and to accept
of the Foundation in the Name of the General.
On the other ſide, there wanted the King's Letters
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65023:139"/>
for their being receiv'd in the Kingdom, as Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and their Enemies, who were powerful at
Court, hinder'd their obtaining them.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Obſtacles was eaſily remov'd by
Father <hi>Ignatius:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The General endeavors to Eſtabliſh the Society in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> He order'd <hi>John Baptiſta Viola</hi>
to make the Vows of Profeſſion according to the
Form, which he ſent him from <hi>Rome;</hi> and he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
requeſted the Biſhop of <hi>Clermont</hi> to receive
them. As to the King's Letters, which were look'd
upon as impoſſible to be obtain'd, the General found
an Expedient, which had effect.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who after the death of
his Uncle was call'd the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> being
come to <hi>Rome</hi> to Negotiate a League between the
Pope, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ferara,</hi> againſt
the Emperor, Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> went to ſee him, and
took occaſion to inform him particularly concerning
the Inſtitute of the Society, which had rais'd ſo
much Jealouſie in <hi>France.</hi> The Cardinal promis'd
his aſſiſtance and protection of them at Court, and
deſir'd the Father to look out no farther for any
other Interceſſor or Patron. He kept his Word; for
as ſoon as he was return'd to <hi>France,</hi> the firſt thing
he did, was to introduce <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Society
into the knowledge of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and to
obtain for them Letters of Reception, which had
been formerly refus'd;</p>
               <p>But ſince they could not procure theſe Letters to
be Regiſtred in Parliament, where the Jeſuits found
more Enemies then at Court, all the Protection of
the Cardinal came to no more, then to give them
Countenance for changing their Abode. <hi>John Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſta
Viola,</hi> who was choſen Proviſor of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and who had a Command
from the General to quit a Title, ſo little ſuitable to
a Perſon Profeſs'd of the Society, went to Lodge
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65023:139"/>
with all his Brethren in <hi>Clermont</hi> Houſe, of which
the Biſhop gave them the uſe, not being able to
give them the Propriety, becauſe their Letters were
not Regiſter'd. This Houſe we may call the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
and as it were, the Cradle of the Colledge of
<hi>Clermont,</hi> which came not to be open'd, till ſome
years after, and which was render'd famous even at
the beginning, by the Learned Men who came
thither from all Parts to Teach; and is more ſo at
this time then ever, by the great number of young
Nobility, who are there Educated with ſo much
care; and who have at the Head of them a young
Prince of the Blood, the moſt Ingenious, and the
moſt Amiable of the World.</p>
               <p>Tho' this Buſineſs of Regiſtring the Letters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to be deſperate, yet Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not
doubt but the day would come, when it ſhould take
effect; and for this reaſon, that all Enterprizes
which regard the good of Souls, commonly find Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
in the beginning; and that in great Affairs,
when the firſt difficulties are made ſmooth, time will
bring on the reſt.</p>
               <p>The News which he the ſame year receiv'd from
the <hi>Indies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He cauſes a Houſe of <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens</hi> to be Eſtabliſh'd in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </note> made ſome amends for what came out
of <hi>France:</hi> Father <hi>Xaverius,</hi> who gave him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Account of his Proceedings, as to his Superior,
inform'd him of the great progreſs which the Goſpel
had made in thoſe Parts, and how much Heaven had
bleſs'd the Labors of the Society. By other Letters at
the ſame time he underſtood, that with a a little too
much precipitation Baptiſm was conferr'd upon the
converted Pagans, and that it often happen'd, that
theſe new Converts return'd to <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> or did not
well obſerve the Rules of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> for want of
ſufficient Inſtruction. To remedy this Diſorder he
gave Directions, that they ſhould erect in the <hi>Indies</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:65023:140"/>
Houſes for <hi>Catechumens,</hi> where the Idolaters that
would embrace the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, might be well
Inſtructed and Try'd before they receiv'd Baptiſm.
According to this Advice, one of theſe Houſes was
ſettled at <hi>Goa,</hi> which prov'd highly beneficial to all
the <hi>Indies,</hi> and out of which came forth ſome young
<hi>Indians</hi> ſo fervent, that being taken by the <hi>Turks,</hi>
they animated and exhorted the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves to
Conſtancy.</p>
               <p>Theſe Nurſeries were altogether according to
the Spirit of Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as well as thoſe of
young Eccleſiaſticks, who are deſign'd for Holy
Orders. From the time that he ſent <hi>Claude le Jay</hi>
into <hi>Germany,</hi> he directed him to adviſe the Biſhops,
who deſir'd to have good Prieſts, and good Curates,
that they would Eſtabliſh Seminaries in their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
where young <hi>Catholicks,</hi> well choſen, might
be perfectly Inſtructed in the true Religion, and in
all the Duties of Men Conſecrated to the Altar.
Many Biſhops, and amongſt others, thoſe of <hi>Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
and of <hi>Salſpurg</hi> Erected Seminaries in their
Towns; and if Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> might have had his
Will, every Dioceſs ſhould have had one.</p>
               <p>While he thus labor'd to reform the World,<note place="margin">Artifices of the Hereticks to pervert the Jeſuits of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> the
Hereticks, whom the Jeſuits oppos'd in <hi>Germany</hi>
and in <hi>France,</hi> not knowing how to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
otherways, enterpriz'd even to pervent <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
himſelf, and his Company: And to compaſs
this, they found an Invention, which only the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Lies could ſuggeſt. <hi>Philip Melancton,</hi> who
after the death of <hi>Luther</hi> was Head of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
together with another Hereſiarch, ſent to
<hi>Rome</hi> one of their Diſciples call'd <hi>Michel,</hi> with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
to counterfeit himſelf a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and to
preſent himſelf to the General of the Jeſuits, to be
receiv'd among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:65023:140"/>
He was a Man in the flower of his Age, Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Modeſt, well ſhap'd, and had a promiſing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy.
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not ſtick at receiving
him, being led thereunto by ſuch fair appearances.
The counterfeit Novice did admirably well diſguiſe
himſelf. No body ſo regular, nor ſo fervent, as he
was: He was the firſt at every thing; He Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd,
and Communicated ſeveral days in the week;
He even chaſtis'd his Body with great Rigor; and
that which is moſt wonderful, there did not appear
in him any thing of Pride or of Self-love.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Michel</hi> thought himſelf well ſettled, he
began leiſurely to diſperſe his Venom, and he did it
with a great deal of ſubtilty. They gave him the care
of the Refectory, and <hi>Oliver Manar</hi> for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
in the Office. Having opportunity to ſpeak
to him alone, after having firſt inſinuated himſelf
into his Friendſhip by his Behaviour towards him,
which was very civil, and alſo edifying, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
by degrees to corrupt him. In ſeveral parts of
the Refectory there were many Pictures of Saints:
he asked <hi>Manar</hi> one day by way of Diſcourſe, as if
he meant no hurt, to what uſe thoſe Pictures were,
and whether it were well done to be uncover'd, or
to kneel before them.</p>
               <p>Manar, <hi>who had Learning, and had newly ended
his Divinity, anſwer'd him not only like a good</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
<hi>but like a good Divine.</hi> Look ye (<hi>reply'd
the Hypocrite</hi>) how different Mens Opinions are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the ſame Point. I knew a great many famous
Doctors in <hi>Germany,</hi> who made a ſcruple of honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe Images, and who cited for it the Paſſage in
St. John, <hi>Cuſtodite vos a ſimulacris.</hi> Thoſe Doctors
(<hi>ſaid</hi> Manar) were either inclining to Hereſie, or not
ſuch able Men, as you believe. The Paſſage of S. <hi>John</hi>
intends only the Images of falſe Gods; and you need
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65023:141"/>
but read the preceding words to be convinc'd of what
I ſay: for St. <hi>John</hi> in that place, ſhewing the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between the falſe Gods and the true God, ſays
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> It is he who is the true God, and
life everlaſting; Keep your ſelves from Idols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Michel</hi> made ſhew of being ſatisfi'd with ſo clear
an Explication, and drove the Matter no farther.
But another time he deſir'd his Companion to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
to him thoſe Words of St. <hi>Peter, The Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
which are in Babylon ſalute you. Manar</hi> ſaid,
That the Apoſtle ſpoke there of <hi>Rome,</hi> which well
deſerv'd at that time to be call'd <hi>Babylon,</hi> in regard
of that confuſion of Errors, of which it was full.
<hi>The Divines of</hi> Germany <hi>underſtood that Paſſage
after the ſame manner</hi> (reply'd <hi>Michel,</hi> and ſmil'd);
<hi>but they add, how truly I cannot tell, that St.</hi> Peter
<hi>did chiefly give that Name to</hi> Rome, <hi>becauſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
was to have there his Seat, which</hi> David <hi>calls
the Chair of Peſtilence. Manar</hi> was ſtartled at ſuch
a Diſcourſe, but he diſſembled his Surprize, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to diſcover what he began to fear, and what he
hardly dar'd to believe. He inform'd Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
of what had paſs'd, and he receiv'd Orders from
him to keep the Argument onfoot with <hi>Michel,</hi> and
by a faint reſiſtance to give him hopes of victory,
the better to make him ſpeak out, and to diſcover
the bottom of his Soul.</p>
               <p>In the very next Conference <hi>Manar</hi> clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
<hi>Michel</hi> to be an Heretick; and in few days
there came from him above twenty <hi>Lutheran</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
He enter'd into Argument with him upon
three of them, which were the leaſt impious, and
having prevail'd upon him to ſet them down in
Writing, he deſir'd him that they might chuſe an
Umpire of their Controverſie, and he nam'd to him
<hi>Everard Mercurian,</hi> who was a Friend to both.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65023:141"/>
                  <hi>Michel,</hi> who thought <hi>Manar</hi> half gain'd, and had
the vanity to believe that he might alſo pervert
<hi>Mercurian,</hi> agreed to it in the preſence of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
himſelf, whom <hi>Manar</hi> had preacquainted with
the Matter; and ſo <hi>Michel</hi> left a Paper of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
in their hands, that they might Examine
them at leiſure: But inſtead of Examining them,
they carry'd the Papers to Father <hi>Ignatius;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Father doubting no longer, neither of the
Doctrine, nor of the Intentions of <hi>Michel,</hi> inform'd
the Grand Inquiſitor, <hi>John Peter Caraffa,</hi> who was
afterwards Pope, of the whole Matter, and at the
ſame time Expell'd the Impoſtor. The Inquiſitor
caus'd him to be Arreſted, and after he had been kept
ſome Months in cloſe Priſon, which oblig'd him,
tho' unwillingly, to confeſs the truth, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to the Galleys.</p>
               <p>This Artifice not having ſucceeded with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
they had recourſe to another; which was
to ſend to the Fathers at <hi>Rome</hi> two great Cheſts of
Books, of which the greateſt part were very proper
to poiſon Youth. <hi>Oliver Manar,</hi> who open'd the
Cheſts, found that thoſe at the top were <hi>Catholick</hi>
Books, and all the reſt Heretical; he preſently
advertis'd Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> of it. The Father, at the
very firſt, divin'd whence ſuch an Alms ſhould
come, and order'd that all the Books ſhould be
burnt, and their Aſhes to be thrown into the Wind,
as if he were afraid they ſhould infect the Houſe;
nor could he, according to his own Maxims, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
do, being perſwaded, that all that comes from
Hereticks ought to be ſuſpected, and not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that any of their Books ſhould be read in the
Society, how good ſoever they might be: <hi>For</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>when we read a good Book, writ by a bad
Man, after having taken pleaſure in the Book, we
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65023:142"/>
grow inſenſibly affected to the Author, even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to believe, that all that ſuch an Author writes
is reaſonable.</hi> This he particularly apply'd to <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
and to ſuch like Authors, a great while before
their Works were condemn'd. And he grounded
his Opinion upon the Authority of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> who ſays
in expreſs terms, <hi>That a Religious Perſon ought not
only to have in horror the Doctrine of Hereticks, but
alſo not to read any Books but ſuch as come from an
Orthodox Pen, and are approv'd by the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Words of the Impious, according to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
of the Apoſtle, are like a Gangrene, which taints
and corrupts by degrees all that is ſound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had yet more troubleſom Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,<note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> oppoſite to the Society.</note>
even with <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and with a principal
Prelate of the Church. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi>
newly declar'd himſelf again againſt the Society,
notwithſtanding the Bulls which Approv'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
and Exerciſes. His pretence was, that the
Jeſuits, whom they call'd <hi>Theatines,</hi> did intrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Rights of Epiſcopacy, by the liberty which
they took of Adminiſtring the Sacraments in all
Places, under colour of their pretended Priviledges.
There was but one Colledge of the Fathers in his
Dioceſs, which was that of <hi>Alcala;</hi> He one day In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted
them all, and thunder'd out a Sentence of
Excommunication againſt all Perſons that ſhould
Confeſs to them. He commanded at the ſame time
all the Religious, and Curates within his Dioceſs,
not to ſuffer any of the Society either to Preach, or
to ſay Maſs in their Churches; and that, which
exceeds Imagination, he ſuſpended all the Prieſts in
<hi>Toledo</hi> from hearing Confeſſions, who had made
the Spiritual Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>The General, far from being afflicted at this
violent Perſecution, did in ſome manner rejoyce at
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65023:142"/>
it. <hi>This new Tempeſt</hi> (ſaid he to <hi>Ribadeneyra) is a
good Omen: If I am not miſtaken, it is an evident
ſign, that God will be ſerv'd by us in</hi> Toledo. <hi>For
Experience has taught us, that to our Society, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
and Perſecutions always prepare the way;
and that the more it is oppos'd in any Place, the more
fruit it there produceth.</hi> In the mean time he writ
into <hi>Spain,</hi> that all Endeavors ſhould be us'd to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the Archbiſhop. <hi>Villanova,</hi> who was Rector
of the Colledge of <hi>Alcala,</hi> a moderate and prudent
Man, made to him all manner of Submiſſion; but
the Archbiſhop grew more inflexible, by how much
the Rector was more ſubmiſs. All means were us'd
to mollifie and appeaſe him: The Friends of the
Society, and eſpecially Cardinal <hi>Franciſco Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

who deſign'd to Erect a Colledge in the
Town of <hi>Burgos,</hi> of which he was Biſhop, left no
means untry'd to procure their Peace.</p>
               <p>When Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> underſtood that nothing
could prevail with the Archbiſhop, he at laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<hi>Julius</hi> the Third with what had paſs'd at
Toledo; and alſo order'd the Fathers of <hi>Alcala</hi> to

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>sake their Complaints to the Privy-Council of
Spain. The Pope caus'd a Letter to be writ to the
Archbiſhop by Cardinal <hi>Matheo,</hi> Secretary of State,
which imported, That it was much wonder'd at in
Rome, that the Society of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould be ſo ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Toledo,</hi> ſince it was in ſo good Eſteem, and ſo
well receiv'd in all other Parts of the World.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the King's Council having
examin'd the Bulls, and the Priviledges of the
order, and judging that the Conduct of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
did directly oppoſe the Holy See, they
made a Declaration in favour of the Fathers. The

brought the Prelate to reaſon: He preſently
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65023:143"/>
annull'd his former Acts, and re-eſtabliſh'd the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
in all their Rights. As ſoon as Father <hi>Ignatius</hi>
had news of it, he ſent him his moſt humble thanks
in a Letter, full of Acknowledgment and submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and the more to gain him, he promis'd, that the
Fathers of <hi>Alcala</hi> ſhould make no uſe of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
nor receive any Perſon among them,
without his Approbation.</p>
               <p>At this time the Society had two great Loſſes:
<hi>Claude le Jay</hi> dy'd at <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Xaverius</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Sancian,</hi> near <hi>China.</hi>
They were alſo in danger the ſame year of loſing
Father <hi>Francis de Borgia,</hi> but after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and they would certainly have loſt him, if
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had not preſerv'd him by ſuch means
as I ſhall now relate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Borgia</hi> upon his return out of <hi>Italy,</hi> retir'd himſelf
into <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and made choice of the Colledge of
<hi>Ogniate,</hi> to conſummate his Sacrifice, by renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Dutchy of <hi>Gandia,</hi> and all the remainders
of his Greatneſs. He choſe that Place, in regard of
its Neighborhood to <hi>Loyola,</hi> whether his Devotion
led him before he came to <hi>Ogniate:</hi> And it is ſaid,
that entring into the Chamber where Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
was born, he fell down upon his Knees, and
kiſs'd the Ground with a Religious reſpect; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having given thanks to the Divine Goodneſs
for having brought ſuch a Man into the World, he
made it his Prayer, that ſince he had taken <hi>Ignatius</hi>
for his Guide and his Maſter, he might have the
Grace exactly to follow his Counſels and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>He departed from <hi>Loyola,</hi> animated with a new
Spirit; and he liv'd ſo holily, that all admir'd to
ſee in him, at his very entrance into Religion,
conſummated Sanctity. When the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:65023:143"/>
the Fifth underſtood that <hi>Don Franciſco de Borgia,</hi>
of a Grandee of <hi>Spain</hi> was thus transform'd into a
Jeſuit, he ſent to the Pope to beſtow upon him a
Cardinal's Cap; for which his Holineſs needed no
great Solicitation, for he had ſeen Father <hi>Francis</hi>
the Year before, and was ſo edified with his Vertue,
that even then he had it in his thoughts to make
him a Cardinal: So that now he reſolv'd to comply
with the Emperor, and the Matter was reſolv'd with
the general Approbation of the ſacred Colledge.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> being inform'd of the Pope's
Reſolution,<note place="margin">The General hinders the Promotion of <hi>Borgia.</hi>
                  </note> thought himſelf oblig'd to oppoſe it
for the Intereſt of the Society, and for the Honor
of Father <hi>Francis,</hi> whom the World would not
fail to reproach with having reſign'd his Dukedom
of <hi>Gandia</hi> to his Son, in proſpect of a Cardinal's
Cap. But the better to find out the Will of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in a Matter ſo nice, and ſo important, he ſhut
himſelf up three days together, and communicated
only with God in Prayer. The firſt day he found
himſelf altogether indifferent, without inclining
more on one ſide then on the other. The ſecond
day he felt a propenſion in himſelf rather to break
the Deſign, then to let it go on. But the third day
he was ſo convinc'd, that it was not the Will of
God to have Father <hi>Francis</hi> made a Cardinal, that
he ſaid to an intimate Friend, <hi>If all the World
ſhould throw themſelves at my Feet, to beg of me
not to oppoſe the Promotion of Father</hi> Francis, <hi>I
would not deſiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In effect, notwithſtanding all the Intreaties of
the Emperor's Miniſters, and of thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Zeal for the Honor of the Houſe of <hi>Borgia,</hi>
he would not relent. He began his Solicitation by
intereſſing thoſe Cardinals in the Matter, who were
beſt inſtructed in the Nature of his Inſtitute; but
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65023:144"/>
finding that they more conſider'd the Honor of the
Sacred Colledge, then the Advantage of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and the Reputation of Father <hi>Francis,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
himſelf immediately to the Pope, and ply'd
him with ſo many ſtrong Arguments, that his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
was forc'd to yield.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that he found an Expedient to
content the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and alſo to do Honor to Father <hi>Francis,</hi> without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wrong to the Society: which was, That the
Pope ſhould offer him the Cap, but that if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did refuſe it, his Holineſs ſhould not compel
him to take it. The thing was Executed as <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
had laid it: And the Cap, of which the Offer
was ſent to Father <hi>Francis</hi> in his Solitude at <hi>Ogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi>
no otherwiſe pleas'd him, then in giving him
an occaſion of Sacrificing to God the Dignities of
the Church, after his having made a Sacrifice to
him of the Grandeurs of the World.</p>
               <p>The Conduct of Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Don Antonio de Cordoua</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the Society.</note> and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Father <hi>Francis,</hi> caus'd a Reſolution in
<hi>Don Antonio de Cordoua</hi> to enter into the Society.
He was the Son of <hi>Laurence Suarez de Figueroa,
Conde de Feria,</hi> and of <hi>Catherine Fernandez de Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua:</hi>
Being young, and very well accompliſh'd,
he made himſelf a Churchman, only upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of Piety. <hi>Philip</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> who parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
lov'd him, deſir'd the Emperor to procure
for him a Cardinal's Cap. <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth did
what the Prince deſir'd; but <hi>Don Antonio</hi> reſolving
wholly to leave the World, by the Example of his
Couſin <hi>Borgia,</hi> thought the ſureſt way to avoid the
Honor which was prepar'd for him, would be to
ſhelter himſelf in the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as in a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.
He writ a long Letter to Father <hi>Ignatius</hi>
upon this Subject; in which, after having laid open
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65023:144"/>
the Motives of his Vocation: <hi>Father,</hi> (he ſaid to
him) <hi>ſince God has placed you in his Church to be
the Refuge of thoſe who are out of their way, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you to receive me into the number of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
The young Lord was receiv'd, and in time
became one of the greateſt Men of the Society.</p>

ſelf even to the remoteſt Parts of the World. But
his principal Conſideration was of the Northern
Countries, deſolated by Hereſie. The greateſt part
of <hi>Germany</hi> had in a manner quite loſt their ancient
Piety: the Books of Hereticks were every where ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
and every where read with Impunity. And
the younger ſort, out of thoſe poyſon'd Fountains,
drew their firſt Principles of Religion. The greateſt

<hi>Papiſt,</hi> given them by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and grew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

to whom they might confide the Care and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Souls.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> Diſcourſing one day upon this
Subject with Cardinal <hi>Moron,</hi> they were both of
Opinion, that the only way to remedy ſo many
Evils, was to place in all Churches Paſtors found in
their Doctrine, and unſtain'd in their Life, which
ſhould be of the <hi>German</hi> Nation; but that it was
neceſſary in the firſt place, to have them well Form'd
and Train'd, which could not be done without
Founding a Colledge, where the young Men of the
Country might be Educated in Learning and Piety:
That <hi>Germany</hi> being generally perverted, there
could be no Security there for the Eſtabliſhing ſuch
a Colledge; and that a properer Place could not be
choſen then <hi>Rome,</hi> where, not to ſpeak of the holineſs
of the Place, which would inſpire <hi>Catholick</hi> Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Preſence, and the Liberality of Popes,
would much conduce to the riſe and ſupport of ſo
good a Work.</p>
               <p>The Pope, to whom Cardinal <hi>Moron,</hi> and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Santa Croce</hi> firſt open'd this Matter, very much
approv'd this Deſign, which he himſelf had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
conceiv'd in his thoughts, and gave a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to it, by aſſigning a Fund for the Maintenance
of the Colledge: After which he order'd Father <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
not only to ſeek out and chuſe young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
out of <hi>Germany,</hi> but alſo to Govern and to
Inſtruct them. The Father immediately gather'd
together Four and twenty out of ſeveral Provinces
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65023:146"/>
of <hi>Germany,</hi> all of good Capacity and Education.
He afterwards by the Pope's Order, drew up Rules
and Statutes for their Government. He appointed
Fathers out of the <hi>Caſa Profeſſa,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi>
Colledge, to be their Directors and Maſters, but
with the management of their Revenue he would
have nothing to do: He ſaid that ſuch Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
beſides the fatigue and trouble of them, often
give occaſion of ſuſpicions and murmurings.</p>

failing,<note place="margin">He ſupports the <hi>German</hi> Colledge in troubleſom Times.</note> upon the death of <hi>Julius</hi> the Third, Father

upon his own Security. Thus he made them
ſubſiſt till the bad Years were over, and the noiſe of

The Duke <hi>Aſcanio Colonna,</hi> and <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi>
his Wife, were at variance upon ſome frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Matter, according to the Cuſtom of Great-ones;
and their Differences growing wider and wider, they
at laſt ſeparated with noiſe and ſcandal. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who knew them both particularly well, could
not endure that this Breach ſhould continue, and
undertook to make it up. <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
retir'd to the Frontier of the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples:</hi> He follow'd her thither, as infirm as he
was, and in a very rigorous Seaſon: for he thought
it convenient to begin with the Dutcheſs, not
doubting but that if ſhe were gain'd, the Peace
would be ſoon made. In concluſion he prevail'd
with her, and he had no great difficulty afterwards
to bring the Duke to reaſon; ſo that being brought
again together, they liv'd more peaceably then
ever.</p>
               <p>During this little Voyage, which took up but Ten
days, Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> with his Companion <hi>John
Polancus,</hi> did many other good Works under the
Authority of Cardinal <hi>Burgos,</hi> who was in thoſe
Parts. They Confeſs'd the poor Country People, as
they paſs'd through the Villages; and they intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65023:147"/>
into two or three Towns of the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples,</hi> the Cuſtom of Confeſſing and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
every Month: And that ſo Chriſtian a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
might not be diſcontinu'd, they engag'd the
Paſtors frequently to excite their Pariſhioners to
the performance of it, and the principal Men of each
Place to lead the reſt by their Example.<note place="margin">He hinders the Incorporating the <hi>Barnabites,</hi> the <hi>Somaſques,</hi> and the <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> with the Society.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Upon his return to <hi>Rome</hi> he receiv'd Letters from
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who earneſtly deſir'd that
the Congregation of the <hi>Barnabites</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> might
be Incorporated into the Society of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> This
Prelate, who had a very good meaning, but was ill
inſtructed in the Inſtitute of the Jeſuits, repreſented
to Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that theſe two Congregations of
Regular Clerics making up but one Body, would
be more beneficial to the Church; wherefore he
very much exhorted him to this Union. The Father
very greatly eſteem'd the Vertue of the <hi>Barnabites,</hi>
and moreover he had been oblig'd to them for their
Charity ſhew'd to Father <hi>Emanuel Miona,</hi> when he
fell ſick at <hi>Milan,</hi> in his Journey from <hi>Paris</hi> to
<hi>Rome.</hi> Nevertheleſs he could not conſent to the
Propoſition of the Archbiſhop, and he anſwer'd
him, <hi>That in his Judgment, the greateſt Glory of
God requir'd, that each Order ſhould continue in their
primitive Inſtitution; That for their being all of them
Regular Clerics, and their wearing almoſt the ſame
Habit, they had never the more the ſame Rule, nor
the ſame Deſign; and that nothing would be more
ſerviceable to the Church, then for each Order to hold
conſtantly to the Spirit of their firſt Vocation.</hi> He
had made the ſame Anſwer ſome years before, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the <hi>Somaſques,</hi> and the <hi>Theatines,</hi> upon a
like Motion of having them Incorporated with the
Society; but his Judgment was fix'd, and never to
be alter'd in this Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:65023:147"/>
About the ſame time he diſapprov'd the Conduct
of two very eminent Fathers of his Order:<note place="margin">He condemns the Conduct of <hi>Miron</hi> and <hi>Gonzales.</hi>
                  </note> One of
them was Father <hi>James Miron</hi> of <hi>Valentia,</hi> who
was the firſt Rector of the Colledge of <hi>Conimbria,</hi>
and made ſo even before he was a Prieſt; The
other was Father <hi>Lewis Gonzales,</hi> Son to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of the Iſland of <hi>Madera,</hi> who was come out
of <hi>Africk</hi> into <hi>Portugal,</hi> to Treat with the King for
the Redemption of Slaves, and about the Means
of advancing Religion among the <hi>Moors.</hi> They
both Reſided at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and led there a very holy
Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> the Third of <hi>Portugal,</hi> of whom we have
ſo often ſpoken, having twice or thrice made uſe of
Father <hi>Gonzales</hi> in Confeſſion, reſolv'd to chuſe
him for his Confeſſor in Ordinary, being at that
time unprovided. But obſerving in him an extream
averſion to the Court, and a great deſire of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back into <hi>Africk,</hi> he would not force his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
He therefore caſt his Eyes upon Father
<hi>Miron,</hi> and ſending for him upon the <hi>Octave</hi> of
the Bleſſed Sacrament, he declar'd to him, that he
had choſen him for his Confeſſor. The Father was
ſo ſurpris'd, and ſo troubled at ſuch a Declaration,
that at firſt he remain'd ſpeechleſs; but recovering
himſelf again, he kneel'd down to the King; and
after having humbly thank'd his Majeſty for the
advantagious Opinion which he was pleas'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
of the Jeſuits, he Proteſted, that as to his
own Perſon, his Majeſty, if duly inform'd, could not
make choice of him. <hi>I have neither</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the
Talents, nor the Age, which ſuch an Office requires,
and beſides this, I am a Stranger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None of your Body are Strangers to me (<hi>reply'd
the King),</hi> and on the other ſide, I ſee no neceſſity of
ſuch extraordinary Talents, to be my Confeſſor: for
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:65023:148"/>
by the Grace of God you ſhall always find me diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to follow your good Advice; but I am a little
ſurpris'd, that you who are Confeſſors to all the
World, ſhould make ſuch a difficulty of being mine.</p>
               <p>It is not, Sir, that we have the leaſt unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to Serve you in this manner (<hi>reply'd the Father),</hi>
but only in regard that ſuch Honorable Employments
agree not with our Vocation; which is to Viſit Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals,
to Inſtruct the Poor, and to Exerciſe the moſt
abject Functions for the ſaving of Souls. We ought
to fear nothing more then Worldly Eſteem; and it is
already laid to our charge, that we hunt after the
Favour of Princes. Wherefore I humbly beſeech your
Majeſty, upon this occaſion, to moderate the Affection
with which you are pleas'd to honor us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King made Anſwer,</hi> That he would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
contrary to their Inſtitute; and that his Deſign
was not to divert them from their Evangelical
Functions; that they ſhould take a Days time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate,
and that on the Morrow they ſhould bring
him their preciſe Anſwer. <hi>They fail'd not to do it,
and deputed Father</hi> Gonzales, <hi>with all Reſpect to
tell the King,</hi> That the Humility of which the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
made profeſſion, was not conſiſtent with the
Honor which he intended them; wherefore they
humbly pray'd his Majeſty to excuſe Father <hi>Miron</hi>
from being his Confeſſor.</p>
               <p>The King had been ſo preſſing upon them for
their Anſwer, that he gave them no time of firſt
Writing to <hi>Rome</hi> about it; but they afterwards
certifi'd Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> what Anſwer they had
made. He abſolutely condemn'd it, tho' it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from a good Principle; and gave them both to
underſtand, that the Humility of Apoſtolical Men
was not ſo ſtraitly confin'd as they thought; That
theſe Honorable Functions were not incompatible
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65023:148"/>
with a Vocation which obligeth to Preach the
Goſpel both to the Little and the Great, and to
Kings as well as to Subjects; That the Society
muſt not refuſe the meaneſt Functions, nor be afraid
of the higheſt, when Providence, without their
ſeeking, preſented them; That they were not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticks,
inclos'd within a Monaſtery; That as they
ought to ſeek in Hoſpitals, in Cottages, in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
and in Priſons, whereupon to exerciſe their
Zeal; ſo on the other ſide, they were not to avoid
the Palaces of Princes: and that being engag'd by
their Inſtitute to ſanctifie all Conditions of Men, it
would be a fault in them to abandon thoſe who were
at fartheſt diſtance from the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>Thus St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> inſtructed his Children upon
Occaſions; and he ſharply reproved them, even thoſe
of the greateſt Merit, when he thought the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
was neceſſary. We have a memorable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this in the Perſon of Father <hi>Laynez.</hi> This
Father aſſiſted the ſecond time at the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> which <hi>Julius</hi> the Third immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſembled
after his Promotion, according to one of
the Articles Stipulated in the <hi>Conclave;</hi> and he
there gain'd ſo great an Eſteem, that having a
Quartan Ague, the Congregations of the Divines
and of the Cardinals, was never held upon the Days
of his Fits.</p>
               <p>Whereas the War of <hi>Germany,</hi> which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the <hi>Landgrave of Heſſe</hi> had rais'd againſt
the Emperor, and had put the whole Empire into
diſorder, did alſo ſuſpend the ſitting of the Council
for two years; Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> recall'd <hi>Laynez</hi> to
<hi>Padua,</hi> and named him Provincial of <hi>Italy</hi> in the
room of <hi>Paſquir Brovet,</hi> whom he had ſent into
<hi>France,</hi> where the Affairs of the Society were in a
reaſonable good plight. <hi>Laynez</hi> refus'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincialſhip,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:65023:149"/>
and the reaſon alledg'd for his refuſal
was, that he was not yet perfect enough at Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and therefore unfit to Command: But he was
told that it was the Will of his Superior, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
of God, that he ſhould accept it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was forc'd to yield. When he was in his
Government of the Province of <hi>Italy,</hi> he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
that all the beſt workmen were ſent for to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and he complain'd by Letters, that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of <hi>Italy</hi> were left unfurniſh'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Father</hi> Ignatius <hi>Anſwer'd him in ſhort,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He reprehends <hi>Laynez,</hi> and how <hi>Laynez</hi> receives the Reprimand.</note> 
                  <hi>that the
Capital City of the World ought to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd,
then other Towns; and whereas</hi> Laynez <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd
upon it, without taking due notice, as it ſeems,
of what had been Anſwer'd him, Father</hi> Ignatius
<hi>wrote to him in theſe words,</hi> I am diſpleas'd, that you
continue to write to me upon the ſame Subject, after
what I have already Anſwer'd, that a common good
muſt be prefer'd to a particular one, and a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
concern to a leſs. Reflect a little upon your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
and then ſend me word, whether you find
that you have tranſgres'd, and in caſe that you think
your ſelf Culpable, let me know what Penalty you
are ready to undergo for your fault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laynez</hi> writ back from <hi>Florence</hi> to Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
that he had read over his Letters ſeveral times;
that he found matter in it to make him admire on
one ſide his Paternal Charity, and to praiſe the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God; and on the other, to humble himſelf,
and to acknowledge his fault. He beſeech'd him
never to be ſparing towards him of ſuch wholeſom
Reprehenſions, and he acknowledg'd, that upon
this occaſion he had been guilty of ſeveral conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Faults. 1. For having been ſo undiſcreet, and
ſo vain, as to oppoſe with his weak Reaſons the
Sence of a Perſon ſo prudent and clear-ſighted.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65023:149"/>
2. For having caus'd Diſpleaſure in his General.
3. For contradicting the Order of Providence, by
endeavoring to proceed in a different way from that
preſcrib'd him by his Superior.</p>
               <p>As to the Chaſtiſement which I deſerve (<hi>he ſaid),</hi>
conſidering with my ſelf of late, that I have been
now Twenty years under an Obligation of Serving
God according to the Evangelical Counſels, that for
the doing it I have had ſo much help and aſſiſtance,
of which I have made ſo little uſe, and that the end
of my Life may poſſibly be near at hand, I found an
ardent deſire within me of dying wholly to my ſelf,
and of living only to God; and it appear'd to me,
that to be treated according to my Merits, I ought
to be eſteem'd a miſerable Wretch, and as a meer
Nothing.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, my Reverend Father, upon the Receipt
of your Letter, I fell down upon my Knees, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made my Prayer with many Tears, a thing not
uſual with me, this was the reſult of my Deſires,
which I now ſend to your Reverence, with Tears in
my Eyes, for your Approbation. I humbly requeſt
you, into whoſe hands I wholly reſign my ſelf, I ſay,
I humbly requeſt, and ask it of you by the Bowels of
our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that to puniſh my Sins,
and to tame my ill govern'd Paſſions, you would be
pleas'd to withdraw me from Government, from
Preaching, from Study, ſo as to leave me no other
Book but my Breviary; to command me that I come
to <hi>Rome</hi> upon Alms, and there to be employ'd in the
meaneſt of Offices in the Houſe; or if I am not fit
for them, to ſpend the reſt of my days in teaching
Children the firſt Rudiments of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue,
and that I may be laid aſide as the outcaſt of the
Body. This is that which I chuſe in the firſt place for
my Pennance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:65023:150"/>
                  <hi>Laynez</hi> fearing that Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> would not
admit of all theſe Propoſitions, he qualifi'd them in
a ſecond Addreſs, and ſubmitted to the ſame Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
with a limitation of Time; that is, for two or
three years, or ſo long as it ſhould pleaſe the General.
And leſt this ſecond Offer ſhould not be receiv'd, he
at laſt propos'd ſeveral Diſciplines; A four-weeks
Faſt, and that as often as he writ to the General, he
ſhould firſt make his Prayer, and then meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Letter; and after he had writ it, he ſhould
read it with attention, taking great heed, not to ſay
any thing which might cauſe in his good Father
the leaſt Diſpleaſure, and even endeavoring to make
uſe of no Expreſſions but what may give him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>This only Example ſheweth the Authority which
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had in his Body, and after what
manner he would have Superiors ſubject to their
General. But hence we may alſo learn, how great
the Humility was of a Man who had been admir'd
in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and how tractable the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Wits are, when they have the true Spirit of
Religion.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> was highly edifi'd at the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Laynez;</hi> and ſo Religious a Submiſſion made
him better amends then any penal Satisfaction. Far
from Interdicting <hi>Laynez</hi> his Study, or from hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
him to Teach a Grammar School, he gave
him Orders to write a Sum of Divinity, to ſerve as
an Antidote againſt the Books of Heretical Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſts.
And to the end that his Office of Provincial
ſhould afford him leiſure to attend this Work, he
nam'd two Fathers to eaſe him in his Viſitation of
the Colledges of <hi>Italy:</hi> One of them was Doctor
<hi>Olavius,</hi> who before he was a Jeſuit, was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Laynez</hi> at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and whom
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65023:150"/>
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> Conſtituted Rector of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Colledge preſently after his Profeſſion. The other
was <hi>John Baptiſta Viola,</hi> a prudent and zealous
Man, who had been Regent of the young Jeſuits at
<hi>Paris</hi> in the Colledge of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and in <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
Houſe.</p>
               <p>This laſt, whom Zeal ſo tranſported, that to ſave
the Provincial's trouble, he took too much of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himſelf, even to be diſquieted at any Proceedings
that were contrary to his Idea's, was once admoniſh'd
by the General, that after he had done his Duty, he
ſhould keep himſelf in repoſe, and imitate our Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-Angels,
who continually watch over the Souls
which God has given them in charge, but who loſe
nothing of their tranquility or happineſs, when their
care is unſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oviedo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He keeps up regular Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in the Colledge of <hi>Naples.</hi>
                  </note> whom Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had recall'd from
<hi>Gandia,</hi> Govern'd at that time the Colledge of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
in Quality of Rector, and <hi>Bobadilla</hi> had the
Charge there of Superviſor, according to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Society in the beginning. Theſe two
Men, as holy as they were, each in his way, did not
very well agree together concerning the Conduct
of the Colledge: For the laſt, being eaſie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending,
was apt to let looſe, what the other
(more rigorous) held faſt in point of Diſcipline. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badilla</hi>
thought it leſs generous to regulate Sanctity
by little outward Obſervances; and provided there
were a ſerious Application to ſolid Vertue, he did not
much concern himſelf for the reſt. <hi>Oviedo</hi> on the
contrary believ'd there was nothing to be reckon'd
little, that tended to the Service of God; and that
the beſt grounded Vertue could not long ſubſiſt,
with the neglect of thoſe leſſer Duties, which in
themſelves appear not very conſiderable.</p>
               <p>When Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> underſtood what paſt at
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65023:151"/>
                  <hi>Naples,</hi> he took from <hi>Bobadilla</hi> the Office of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent,
and forbad him from giving any diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
to the Government of <hi>Oviedo,</hi> to whom he
gave the whole Authority; that ſo Domeſtical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline
might be maintain'd, which began inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to relax, which is a matter of dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to all Communities: For it was the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
Opinion, that theſe was leſs danger in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the greater Rules, then in the neglect of
the leſſer; becauſe the evil which the infraction of
the firſt brings with it, is evident and palpable;
whereas that which proceeds from the contempt of
the ſecond, is not for the moſt part ſeen nor felt, till
it becomes incurable.</p>
               <p>The Affairs of <hi>Portugal</hi> prov'd much more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom
and difficult to him,<note place="margin">Troubles in the Province of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the General's Conduct in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting them.</note> then thoſe of <hi>Naples.</hi>
The Colledge of <hi>Conimbria</hi> was in a flouriſhing
Condition, both for the number of the Jeſuits, and
for the Reputation of Learning. More then a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
young Men of good Parts, and moſt of them
of Quality, which Father <hi>Simon Rodriguez</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
into the Body, follow'd the Study of Human
Learning, and of higher Sciences, with incredible
vigor and emulation. Some among them, too much
intent upon their Study, and not enough dead to the
World, began to neglect their Exerciſes of Piety,
and by degrees degenerated into a Behaviour alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
worldly. The mildneſs of <hi>Rodriguez</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was the principal cauſe of this Miſchief.
This holy Man, who had formerly cur'd a Leprous
Perſon by lying in Bed with him, and who lately
had reſtor'd Health to many ſick People, with only
embracing them, edifi'd all his Inferiors by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
regularity of his Life. But his natural Goodneſs
permitted them to live according to their Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and if ſometimes he reprehended them, he did
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:65023:151"/>
it in ſo ſoft a manner, that it ſignifi'd little, and ſerv'd
rather to confirm them in their bad Cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>Before theſe Diſorders brake out, Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
had thoughts to remove <hi>Rodriguez</hi> out of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
where he had been twelve years Governor;
and this he deſign'd upon the account of putting in
practice what is ſet down in the Conſtitutions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the time to be limited in the Government
of ſubaltern Superiors, and of letting Provincials
underſtand that they were not perpetual, tho' the
General might continue them for as long time as he
pleas'd.</p>
               <p>The bad Effects which the Indulgence of <hi>Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi>
produced, abſolutely determin'd Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
to this Removal; and that which oblig'd him
to do it with ſpeed, was, that the Jeſuits of <hi>Portugal</hi>
were ſo link'd to their Provincial, that they ſeem'd
to know no other Superior. His Facility was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to the Tepid, and his eminent Vertue charm'd
the Fervent. Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> judg'd that this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
adheſion and fondneſs was againſt the perfection
of Religious Obedience, which ought not ſo much
to regard the Perſon of the Superior, as that of <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> in the Superior.</p>
               <p>He reſolv'd therefore to take from him the Charge
of Provincial, and moreover to make him leave
<hi>Portugal;</hi> both to the end that his Succeſſor might
have intire liberty in the Goverment of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and alſo that the Malecontents might not
have recourſe to their ancient Superior, and that
they being all depriv'd of his Preſence, their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
might be more pure and free.</p>
               <p>But to ſave the Reputation of <hi>Rodriguez,</hi> he
thought it expedient to put him in Office elſewhere;
for he believ'd, that when he ſhould not have <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez</hi>
to Govern, his Conduct would not be ſo ſoft
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:65023:152"/>
and eaſie. And whereas the General well knew, that
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fathers had not much inclination to
thoſe of <hi>Portugal,</hi> by reaſon of the natural Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
between the two Nations, and deſiring nothing
more then to unite them all in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
<hi>Rodriguez</hi> for the Province of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and
<hi>Miron</hi> for that of <hi>Portugal.</hi> But he found great
Obſtacles in the Execution of this Project.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The General o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes great Oppoſitions.</note> who did not permit that
<hi>Rodriguez</hi> ſhould go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be preſent at the
Aſſembly in the Jubile Year, and the Prince <hi>Don
John,</hi> who ſtill honor'd him as his Maſter, could not
reſolve to let him go from them. Of the ſame mind
were <hi>Don Antonio d' Alencaſire,</hi> Duke <hi>d' Aviro,</hi>
Nephew to King <hi>John</hi> the Second, and <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio
d' Ataide, Conde de Caſtenheira,</hi> his particular
Friends; beſides a great many other <hi>Portuguez</hi>
Lords, who had great confidence in him. Upon the
firſt rumor of the Alteration which the General of
the Society intended to make, the whole Court was
in diſorder. Some ſaid, that the King ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Father <hi>Rodriguez</hi> not to depart the Kingdom.
Others offer'd themſelves to make the General
change his Reſolution. There wanted not thoſe,
who would have a Brief ſent for from <hi>Rome</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him; and ſome advis'd the King to make the
Father accept of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Conimbria,</hi> which
had formerly been ſeveral times offer'd him, and was
yet vacant.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the young Jeſuits ſpoke it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they could obey none but Father <hi>Simon;</hi>
and began to talk of leaving all, if he were taken
from them. But Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> having foreſeen
theſe Stirs, writ to the King, to the Queen, and to
the Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to make them ſenſible of his
Reaſons; He did the ſame to Father <hi>Leon Henriquez,</hi>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:65023:152"/>
and to Father <hi>Lewis Gonzales,</hi> who had great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
in that Court: He conjur'd them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to uſe all their Induſtry to facilitate
the Buſineſs. And at the ſame time he writ to Father
<hi>Rodriguez</hi> a Letter, in which his Expreſſions were
very kind, but his Orders very poſitive.</p>
               <p>All theſe Leters had their effect; and it is hardly
conceivable, with what Reverence and Submiſſion
<hi>Rodriguez</hi> receiv'd the Order of his General: he
ſeveral times kiſs'd the Letter; and it is ſaid, that he
was in ſuch a Tranſport of Joy, that ſometimes he
laid it to his Head, and ſometimes to his Heart, as if
he had been out of himſelf. He alſo earneſtly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
for his Departure with the Princes, whom
the Reaſons of Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had convinc'd, but
whom their Affection for <hi>Rodriguez</hi> made unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he had obtain'd what he deſir'd, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to the fartheſt end of <hi>Portugal</hi> towards <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi>
into a Country Houſe, which belonged to the
Colledge of <hi>Conimbria,</hi> call'd <hi>St. Felix,</hi> and is ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
near <hi>Valenca de Mino,</hi> among the Rocks and
Mountains: He retir'd, I ſay, after having reſign'd
the Government of the Province to Father <hi>Miron,</hi>
and after having excus'd himſelf by Letters from the
Provincialſhip of <hi>Arragon;</hi> ſo much was it his deſire
to live only to God, and to himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miron,</hi> who was a clear-ſighted Man, exact, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
and ſevere, would alſo have been very proper to
re-ſettle Diſcipline in a ſhort time, if he had a little
more conſider'd Human weakneſs. Whereas he had
high Idea's concerning Religious Perfection, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
concerning that of his Society, he was not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd,
unleſs thoſe under his Government were all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
not conſidering, that things in Practice will not
riſe ſo high as our Speculation, and that ſometimes we
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:65023:153"/>
muſt content our ſelves with what is beſt to be had,
tho' not beſt in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>A Conduct ſo ſevere, and ſo oppoſite to that of
<hi>Rodriguez,</hi> which was freſh in their memory, gave
a general diſguſt. And whereas <hi>Miron</hi> naturally
active and reſtleſs, would ſee every thing done with
his own Eyes, and in a manner do all himſelf, the
domeſtick Officers, and the ſubordinate Superiors,
were unſatisfi'd that he put no truſt in them, and
conſequently grew negligent in their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

their Complaints of the Provincial, was upon the

<hi>Michael de Torrez,</hi> Rector of the Colledge of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi>
and Doctor of Divinity in the Univerſity of
<hi>Alcala,</hi> a Man of Authority and of good Sence, in
whom was joyn'd the Mildneſs of <hi>Rodriguez</hi> with
the Reſolution of <hi>Miron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Viſitor, according to his Inſtructions, in the
firſt place paid his Duty to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
gratefully acknowledging him to be the principal
Benefactor and Protector of the Society. After which
he humbly beſought him to give leave, that Father
<hi>Rodriguez,</hi> who was appointed for the Government
of the Province of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and whoſe abſence from
<hi>Portugal</hi> ſeem'd neceſſary for the quiet of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Conimbria,</hi> might not remain uſeleſs in a
Deſert, but might ſpeedily repair to his Charge.</p>
               <p>The King found great difficulty to conſent to it;
but at laſt he did conſent, and thereupon writ to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ignatius</hi> by Father <hi>Gonzales,</hi> who was call'd to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65023:153"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> when Father <hi>Rodriguez</hi> (who blindly obey'd
his Orders) had left his Solitude to proceed towards
<hi>Arragon.</hi> This is the Copy of the King's Letter.</p>
               <p>FAther, Maſter <hi>Ignatius,</hi> I have receiv'd your
Letters, and with them a great deal of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
I am perſwaded that the Service of God
requires of me to grant what you ask concerning the
change of Father Maſter <hi>Simon,</hi> and that it ſhould
be done in the manner which Father <hi>Lewis Gonza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
will tell you. You may reſt aſſur'd, that I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be well pleas'd to favour your Society, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the great good which God is pleas'd to
do by it in all my States. And becauſe I have told
Father <hi>Lewis Gonzales,</hi> what in particular regards
the Affection which I have for you, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of your Order in my Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> I
refer my ſelf to him, and you may give entire Credit
to what he ſhall ſay to you on my part. At <hi>Lisbon</hi> the
30th of <hi>January</hi> 1553.</p>
               <p>The departure of <hi>Rodriguez</hi> did not a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the Viſitor, to quiet the Minds of thoſe
whom the preſence of their ancient Superior had
render'd leſs tractable. But that which much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to reſtore Order and Tranquility in the
Province, was, that the new Provincial, according
to the Directions which he receiv'd from <hi>Rome,</hi>
chang'd the Method of his Conduct.</p>
               <p>The General advertis'd him,<note place="margin">He gives Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the new Provincial.</note> that a new Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
doth never ſucceed well in the beginning,
by uſing rigor; that at firſt ſome Faults muſt be
diſſembled, or pardon'd; that young Men cannot
be perfect all on the ſudden, and that there is no
arriving to the heighth of Vertue, or of Vice, but
by degrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:65023:154"/>
But in regard that <hi>Miron</hi> was too much inclin'd
to Motion, and would do all things himſelf, he told
him, to allay his Activity, That it did not belong to
Superiors in Chief to pry into every little matter
themſelves; That Men were made truſty by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them ſo; That it was better ſometimes to be
deceiv'd, then always to be in diſtruſt; Laſtly, that
the firſt in Office ſhould reſemble the <hi>Primum Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi>
which by its own ſteddy Motion regulates the
Courſes of other Celeſtial Bodies. <hi>Know all, order
all</hi> (he ſaid), <hi>but take heed of doing all your ſelf. Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this manner, you will do nothing unbecoming
your Place; and you will have this advantage, that
if your Orders be ill Executed, you may afterwards
rectifie what you find amiſs; whereas, if you make
your ſelf the Actor, and things ſhould not at firſt
ſucceed, it would not be very Honorable for you, that
your Inferiors ſhould mend your Faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All things being ſettled in this manner,<note place="margin">He moderates the Fervor of the <hi>Portuguez.</hi>
                  </note> it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
by a ſtrange Revolution, that the <hi>Portuguez</hi>
paſs'd from one Extremity to the other, according to
the nature of human things, which ſeldom reſt in
an even poize, and in their juſt ſituation. The Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
introduc'd into the Colledge of <hi>Conimbria,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
ſo faſt, that at laſt it exceeded all meaſure.
Every one took upon him to be his own Director
in Matters of Piety and Mortification, only conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Spirit, and following the heat of his
Devotion. Some conſum'd themſelves with Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
to a degree of waſting their Bodies and their
Health; others, charm'd with the Delights of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
ſpent whole Days and Nights in Prayer,
hardly minding their Study.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to remedy this ſecond Diſorder,
which was the more dangerous, in regard that it
proceeded from an exceſs of Vertue, endeavor'd by
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:65023:154"/>
his Inſtructions to diſcover to them their Illuſion:
but finding that the Advice given them, had not
its effect, and that an indiſcreet Fervor reign'd not
only in <hi>Portugal,</hi> but ſpread it ſelf into <hi>Spain,</hi> he
writ a long Diſcourſe in form of an Epiſtle, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
thoſe into a right way, whom a miſtaken De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
had miſled.</p>
               <p>This Epiſtle,<note place="margin">The Epiſtle of Obedience.</note> Entituled, <hi>Concerning the Vertue
of Obedience,</hi> and Addreſs'd to the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
with making it appear, That Obedience is the
only Vertue, which bringeth forth and nouriſheth
all other Vertues; That this, in a peculiar manner,
is the Vertue of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
Mark and Character of it: ſo that we
may ſuffer our ſelves to be ſurpaſs'd by other Orders,
in Faſting, in Watching, and in many other Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of Auſterity, which each of them holily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
according to the Spirit of their Vocation;
but that in matter of Obedience we ought not to
yield to any, as being oblig'd by our Vocation to
be perfect in it.</p>
               <p>The Saint in the next place, upon Reaſons drawn
out of Scripture and the Fathers, lays down theſe
Degrees of Obedience. The Firſt and loweſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in doing what we are commanded. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is, not only to execute the Orders of a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
but to conform our Will to his. The Third,
to judge, that what he Orders is beſt and moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
and upon this ground alone, becauſe the
Superior doth judge it ſo. To arrive at this high
degree, which is call'd the Obedience of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
he ſays, that we are not to take notice,
whether he who Governs us be Wiſe or Imprudent,
Holy or Imperfect; but only to conſider in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the Authority of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Delegated to him
for our Conduct, and that his infinite Wiſdom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
permit his Delegate to deceive us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:65023:155"/>
The whole Letter, which may be call'd a Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
in its kind, turns upon theſe grand Principles,
which the Father ſupports by ſolid Reaſons, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrates
by divers Examples. He particularly proves,
in order to his preſent Deſign, That it is a ſtrange
Illuſion to believe, that one may go againſt the Will
of a Superior, in doing things which are good in
themſelves, as in Praying, and Faſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
he declares, That according to the Doctrine of the
ancient Maſters of a Spiritual Life, it is not a leſs
Fault to break the Laws of Obedience in Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then in Sleeping, in Laboring then in doing
nothing.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> was not content to ſend this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Obedience only into <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> he
tranſmitted it into all Parts, even to the <hi>Indies</hi> and
<hi>Japony.</hi> The Society had enter'd the Year before
into the Iſland of <hi>Corſica,</hi> and the two Workmen
he ſent thither by the Pope's Order, at the Requeſt of
the Commonwealth of <hi>Genoua,</hi> found work enough
to do in their new Miſſion. One of them was call'd
<hi>Silveſter-Landino,</hi> and the other <hi>Emanuel de Monte-Mayor.</hi>
The whole Iſland had much of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a Heathen Country, and tho' Religion for
many Ages paſt had been planted there; yet in their
manner of living there was little of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to
be ſeen. The Prieſts had not ſo much as a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Habit, and for the moſt part led not only
a Secular, but a Libertine Life: There were among
them, who neither knew how to ſay Maſs, nor to
Adminiſter the Sacrament of Pennance. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
on their ſide liv'd in profound Ignorance, and
many up and down the Country, even old Men,
could not make the Sign of the Croſs. This Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was accompanied with all ſorts of Vices; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
Sorcery, Inceſt, and Pligamy, did every
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:65023:155"/>
where reign with Impunity, and without Scruple.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had the two Miſſioners made their
Circuit about the Iſland,<note place="margin">Two Miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety Accus'd, and Juſtifi'd.</note> but the face of it was
wholly chang'd, ſo great was the Bleſſing which it
pleas'd God to beſtow upon their Labours: But
this change drew upon them a terrible Perſecution.
An Eccleſiaſtick, conſiderable for his Office of
Grand Vicar, and more famous for the Debauchery
of his Life, could not endure the Zeal, and the good
Succeſs of <hi>Landino</hi> and <hi>Monte-Mayor.</hi> Beſides his
own Animoſity againſt theſe Foreign Prieſts, whoſe
Apoſtolical Converſation ſeem'd to reproch the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity
of his Life, and whoſe Character of the
Pope's Viſitors appear'd to leſſen his Authority: He
was alſo inſtigated againſt them by ſome Apoſtates,
who had taken Refuge in that Iſland; ſo that he
ſent an Accuſation to <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the two Fathers.
He likewiſe Diſpatch'd and Deputed one of his
Friends to maintain the Charge againſt them; <hi>viz.
That</hi> Landino <hi>and</hi> Monte-Mayor <hi>were inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Perſons, extreamly Arrogant, and outragiouſly
ſevere; that they treated the Religious of St.</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
<hi>with the loweſt degree of Contempt, and that they
viſibly abus'd the Authority of the Holy See.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Deputy, who neither wanted Cunning, nor
boldneſs, prevail'd upon many Cardinals to believe
his falſe Suggeſtions againſt the Apoſtolical Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
Inſomuch that Cardinal <hi>Sancte Croce</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of them to Father <hi>Ignatius.</hi> The Father,
who perfectly well knew both <hi>Landino</hi> and <hi>Monte-Mayor,</hi>
had difficulty to believe what was ſaid of
them, and imagin'd it was a Calumny. But to know
the bottom of the Buſineſs, he ſent into the Iſland of
<hi>Corſica</hi> one of his own People, in whom he could
confide, call'd <hi>Sebaſtian Romé,</hi> who was not yet a
Prieſt; and he order'd him to diſguiſe himſelf in
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65023:156"/>
the Habit of a Cavalier, and narrowly to obſerve the
Demeanor of the two Fathers, without making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
known to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Romé</hi> remain'd in the Iſland as long as was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
well to execute his Commiſſion. When he had
throughly obſerv'd the Conduct of <hi>Landino</hi> and
<hi>Monte-Mayor,</hi> and had taken exact Informations of
their manner of Life, he came back to <hi>Rome</hi> with
Letters from the Governor of the Iſland, from the
Magiſtrates and People, and from the Provincial
himſelf of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> ſo Advantagious and
Honorable for the two Perſons accus'd, that the
Cardinals, who had been ſurpris'd, made their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
to Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> for having too eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
falſe Reports.</p>
               <p>He himſelf was newly again accus'd in <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A new Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note>
for teaching Heretical Doctrine in his Book of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Exerciſes; and his Accuſer was an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,
inſtigated by <hi>Melchior Cano,</hi> who ſtill had
rancor in his Heart againſt the Society, but hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
behind the Curtain, fearing the Diſpleaſure of
the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> where the Jeſuits had Credit.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Book of Exerciſes, which was Printed
with the Bull of <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, ought to have been
protected from Calumny by the Bull it ſelf, yet
there were thoſe who put it into the hands of the
Inquiſitors, and labour'd to get it Cenſur'd. Good
Men thought this Proceeding neither Equitable,
nor Catholick. The Doctors of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> who
were conſulted upon it, unanimouſly took upon
them the Defence of the Holy See, and of Father
<hi>Ignatius;</hi> and among the reſt, <hi>Bartholomew Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi>
ſo famous for his Learning and Vertue. He it
was, who writ a very Learned Book upon the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of the Trinity, and who was made Biſhop of
<hi>Canary</hi> after his Return out of <hi>England,</hi> whither
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:65023:156"/>
                  <hi>Philip,</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> going to Eſpouſe Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> carry'd him, with other Divines, ſolidly to
Eſtabliſh among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Torrez</hi> writ ſeveral Papers upon this Subject of
the Exerciſes, the principal of which you have here
Tranſlated.</p>
               <p>God is my Witneſs,<note place="margin">A Teſtimony in favour of the Exerciſes of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
                  </note> that nothing could be asked of
me more to my ſatisfaction, then to tell my Opinion
concerning the Spiritual Exerciſes of the Society of
<hi>Jeſus:</hi> For I deſire that all the World ſhould know
what I think of them, in the ſincerity of my Heart,
and in the Preſence of God. And in the firſt place,
leſt any body ſhould imagine that Intereſt makes me
ſpeak, I declare that I am no Jeſuit, tho' I ought to
have been of this Society, or of ſome other Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if I had a true zeal for the good of my Soul.
Next I declare, that altho' I may be perhaps the
leaſt capable of all the Doctors, yet I have knowledge
enough to anſwer the Queſtion propos'd to me: For
beſides that I have formerly Entertain'd <hi>Ignatius</hi> in
<hi>Salamanca,</hi> I have ſince familiarly been acquainted
with his Diſciples: Moreover, I have attentively
Examin'd the Tendency, and the Spirit of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
continually obſerving their manner of Life, and
judging of their Inſtitute by their Actions, which
cannot long deceive.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, that from the time I firſt knew the
Society of <hi>Jeſus</hi> to this day, I never have perceiv'd
any Error or Crime (truly ſuch) in any one Perſon
among them. I farther ſay, that for the Spiritual
Exerciſes, no body can make a true Eſtimate of them,
who has not himſelf made them. For whereas their
Deſign is to eſtabliſh Vertue in the Soul, and to purge
it of Vices, they are not to be ſenſibly underſtood, but by
the Practice and Experience of them. I have my ſelf
ſeen Learned Men, who could not comprehend them,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:65023:157"/>
tho' the Matter contain'd in them be clear and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
and Extracted out of the Scriptures and holy
Fathers: and yet all thoſe who have try'd them,
underſtand them without difficulty. So that there is
great difference between the Sciences learnt in Schools,
and the Science of the Saints, which beſides acquir'd
Knowledge, requires the Exerciſe of Prayer, and of
interior Vertues.</p>
               <p>I declare, that I have made theſe Exerciſes at
<hi>Alcala,</hi> and I ſpeak it in the Preſence of God, that
in the ſpace of thirty years, all which time I have
ſpent in the Study of Divine Sciences, and a good
part of it in teaching Divinity, I never profited ſo
much in true Knowledge, as I did in the few days of
that Retirement. If this ſhall ſeem ſtrange to any
Learned perſon, who is not of my Opinion, I only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
him to make Experience of it himſelf: Let him
but do, what I have done, and he will think what
I think. The Reaſon is clear for what I ſay of my
ſelf: I Studyed Divinity, that I might be able to
teach others, but I made the Exerciſes, that I might
live well my ſelf. Now, there is a great deal of
difference between knowing, how to explicate a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and how to practice a Vertue.</p>
               <p>Moreover I have known many perſons, that have
made theſe Exerciſes, and I have ingag'd many of my
Scholars both Religious and Secular, to make them,
and I never knew one, that did not reap great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
advantages from them; and who did not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare, that they infinitely valu'd that little Book.
Might it pleaſe God, that ſuch a Treaſure were
eſteem'd by men as it deſerves! for in fine, whereas
Prayer and Meditation are of ſo high a price, we
may in a ſhort time advance more in them by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
which theſe Exerciſes preſcribe, then we can
in many years, and with great Labour, by any other
way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:65023:157"/>
Now if any one deſires to know preciſely, what
theſe Exerciſes are, they conſiſt in Attentively and
Sedately conſidering the verities of Faith, the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and Commandments of God; the Life and Death
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and alſo in making an exact review
of our Life paſt, and in well regulating our Conſcience
for the future. It is not to be wonder'd after all
this, if the Enemy of Mankind doth his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to aboliſh ſo holy a practice; and we may
judge by all theſe Contradictions, that the work it
ſelf is Divine.</p>
               <p>I alſo declare, that the Holy See having approv'd
the Exerciſes, and his Holineſs having by his Bull
Exhorted the Faithful to make them, no wiſe Man,
no good Chriſtian, can averr, that they contain Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors:
And I doubt not, but that if the Society, which
ſuffers contumely with Joy for the love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
ſhould bring their Enemies before the Tribunal of the
Inquiſition, that Court would ſeverely puniſh them.
For my own part I declare, that it is not lawful for
any perſon to charge a Book with Hereſie, which is
Printed with Approbation and Authority from the
Holy See, nor to proſecute the Cenſure or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of it. Such as ſhall find in it any thing,
that is difficult and obſcure to them, ought to content
themſelves with asking to have it explain'd and made
clear to them. But for the Doctrine contain'd in it,
I averr it to be Sound and Orthodox, and that ſuch
Propoſitions as are contrary to thoſe laid down in
the Book, are ſo many Errors.</p>
               <p>The Teſtimony of <hi>Torrez,</hi> was of great weight
and gave a check to the Proſecution; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
proceeding of <hi>Cano</hi> finally concluded it. This
Enemy, once ſo declar'd and now conceal'd, ſeeing
that the Doctors of <hi>Salamanca</hi> oppos'd his deſigns,
endeavor'd to ingage <hi>Mancio</hi> on his ſide, one of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:65023:158"/>
the moſt famous Perſons of his Order, who taught
Divinity in the Univerſity of <hi>Alcala.</hi> That he
might ſecurely gain the ſuffrage of this Divine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Exerciſes of the Society, he put a Copy
of them in Manuſcript into his hands, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was thruſt in, which was not in the Printed
Books. The Divine perus'd the written Copy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
exactly, and declar'd, that he found nothing in
it, but what was Orthodox, one paſſage only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
which could not be excus'd from Hereſie.
This paſſage was further examin'd, and upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the Printed Books with this Manuſcript,
there was a plain diſcovery made of <hi>Cano</hi>'s foul deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Thus Truth carry'd the cauſe againſt Forgery,
and the Inquiſitors, of Judges to Condemn, became
Compurgators of the Spiritual Exerciſes.</p>
               <p>While an Eccleſiaſtick,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ignatius</hi> a Patriarch and Biſhop for <hi>Aethiopia.</hi>
                  </note> and a Religious Man, vainly
endeavor to ſtain the Reputation of Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
and to overthrow his Order; the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>
Solicited the Pope to chuſe for <hi>Aethiopia</hi> a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,
and Biſhop out of the Society of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> The
choice which was made, and the occaſion of making
it, cannot well be underſtood, unleſs we look a
little back into the Affairs of that Country.</p>
               <p>The People of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which are at this day
call'd <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> are the moſt Ancient Chriſtians in
the World; they receiv'd the Faith, in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
from the Apoſtle St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and from
the Euenuch of Queen <hi>Candace,</hi> who was Baptiz'd
by <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon, as it is related in the Acts of
the Apoſtles. But in proceſs of time they left the
law of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for that of <hi>Moſes;</hi> or rather
they confounded theſe two Laws together, uſing both
Circumciſion and Baptiſm; ſo that, intending to
be at once Chriſtians and Jews, they were truly
neither the one, nor the other. They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:65023:158"/>
the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> for their Head
in matters of Religion, from whoſe hands they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
their Abuna, or High Prieſt. They embrac'd
with the <hi>Cophtes</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> the Hereſies of <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi>
and of <hi>Eutyches.</hi> On the other ſide, being mixt
with <hi>Mahometans</hi> and Idolaters, they every day
contracted ſomething of <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> and <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm:</hi>
In this manner their Religion was a mixture
of all Sects. But they had no Communication with
<hi>Rome,</hi> both in regard of their great diſtance, and
that the <hi>Greeks</hi> infus'd Hatred into them againſt the
<hi>Latin Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Portuguez</hi> in their Navigation to the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> diſcover'd that part of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which
is under the Obedience of <hi>Preſter John,</hi> or to
ſpeak properly, the Kingdom of the <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> whoſe
King we call <hi>Preſter John,</hi> by a popular Error,
which has prevail'd in <hi>Europe,</hi> of attributing to this
<hi>African</hi> Potentate a Title Anciently us'd by the
Monarchs of the <hi>Aſian Tartars,</hi> he that then Reign'd
among the <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> was a young Prince, call'd <hi>David,</hi>
naturally Wiſe, and Vertuous. He was inſtructed
by the <hi>Portuguez</hi> in the Myſteries of Faith, and he
ſo open'd his Eyes to Truth, that relinquiſhing the
Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he writ to the Sovereign
Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Clement</hi> the Seventh, and by a
ſolemn Embaſſy yeilded him Obedience in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and in the Preſence of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Fifth, who was newly there Crown'd Emperor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> being dead, his Son and Succeſſor, nam'd
<hi>Claude,</hi> who had been bread up in the <hi>Roman</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and was a Man of good ſence, judg'd that
the true Faith could not well be Propagated and
Eſtabliſh'd in his Kingdom, unleſs the Pope ſent
thither a Patriarch and Biſhops. Whereas he had
contracted an Amity with <hi>John</hi> the Third, King
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65023:159"/>
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who had aſſiſted him with Money and
Forces, againſt the King of <hi>Zeilan Gradamete;</hi> he
requeſted him likewiſe to procure theſe Spiritual
Succors for him from <hi>Rome. John</hi> the Third under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the buſineſs with a great deal of Zeal. But
the troubles of the Church in thoſe times retarded
the effecting it; nor was it diſpatch'd till under the
Pontificate of <hi>Julius</hi> the Third, when it was brought
to paſs in this manner.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> writ to Father <hi>Ignatius</hi>
to ſend him the Names of ſome of his Order, whom
he might propoſe to the Pope for Patriarch, and
Biſhops of <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> Theſe Titles of Dignity for
any of his Subjects did at firſt very much ſtartle the
Father: But upon reflection, that a Patriarcate, and
Biſhopricks of this nature, were rather Croſſes then
Dignities, and that it was a ſingle Caſe, not likely
to be drawn into Example, he took courage, and
conſented to all, that the Prince requir'd of him.
He nam'd to him three Fathers, of profound Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and of eminent Vertue, <hi>John Nugnez, Andrew
Oviedo,</hi> and <hi>Melchior Carnero,</hi> without determining
which of them he would have choſen for Patriarch,
tho 'his deſire was, that <hi>Nugnez</hi> ſhould be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which he only ſhew'd by recommending him
with a little more advantage then the reſt: He
only declar'd himſelf upon this point, that thoſe
who were the Biſhops might ſucceed the Patriarch,
when the caſe ſhould require it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nugnez,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Fathers propos'd by the General, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</note> who had been imploy'd many years in
<hi>Africa</hi> about the Redemption of Slaves, and the
Converſion of Renegades, was then come to <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
to procure Money to redeem thoſe Chriſtians,
whom the King of <hi>Algiers</hi> had taken from the King
of <hi>Feſs,</hi> when he drove him out of his Kingdom.
Upon the firſt rumor of his new employment, he
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65023:159"/>
writ with all earneſtneſs to <hi>Rome</hi> to break the deſign.
He repreſented to Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that he did not
refuſe the Miſſion of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> but that he could
not yeild to go thither with a Miter, and that he had
a great deal rather ſpend the reſt of his days in a
Chain, among the Slaves of <hi>Barbary.</hi> He conjur'd
him by the precious wounds of our Crucifi'd Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
to have conſideration of his weakneſs, and
not to charge him with a Load, which might poſſibly
be the cauſe of his Damnation. He added, that
if his good Father would not relent, he ſhould at
leaſt ſend him his Will in writing; to the end, that
an Order under his hand might be a comfort, and
ſupport to him in his difficulties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carnero,</hi> who was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Oviedo,</hi>
who was call'd thither from <hi>Naples,</hi> made no leſs
Reſiſtance. They would themſelves plead their
cauſe before the Pope. As painful as their deſign'd
Dignities ſeem'd to be, they ſtill thought them more
illuſtrious then painful, and the Luſter gave them
a Horror of them. Tho' Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had other
thoughts, yet he prais'd their modeſty, and was
well pleas'd, that all three upon this occaſion had
need of an abſolute Command from the Vicar of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he made them underſtand,<note place="margin">The General engageth the three Fathers to ſubmit.</note> that all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and all the Revenue of theſe Prelatures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in great Labors, in continual Dangers by
Land and by Sea, in Poverty, and poſſibly in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.
<hi>Julius</hi> the Third was ſo well ſatisfi'd with
the Conduct of the Father, and of his Sons, in this
matter, that he ſaid publickly before all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
that now it might be ſeen, what the Jeſuits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to in this World, ſince they refus'd Miters,
that were more ſplendid then burdenſome, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
thoſe, that had nothing belonging to them
but Labors and Sufferings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:65023:160"/>
Tho' Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not fear, that any one
of the three Fathers, was capable of abuſing the
Patriarchal Authority, yet he judg'd, that the more
ſecurely to oblige him, who ſhould be Patriarch,
to do his Duty, it was convenient that an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Commiſſioner ſhould reſide at <hi>Goa,</hi> to make
his Viſitation from time to time, and to obſerve the
Conduct of the Patriarch.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Alphonſo d'Alencaſtre,</hi> Grand Commander
of the Order <hi>de Chriſto,</hi> the <hi>Portugal</hi> Embaſſador,
had receiv'd a Letter from the King his Maſter, in
which he was Commanded to uſe his Intereſt with
the Pope upon all occaſions, in behalf of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Jeſuits; which Letter was brought by
Father <hi>Lewis Gonzales,</hi> when he came to <hi>Rome;</hi>
and in the ſame Letter the King declar'd to Don <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi>
how great his Confidence was in that Father.
Whereas the General perceiv'd, that the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
was a little ſlow in the buſineſs of the <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi>
Miſſion, he order'd Father <hi>Gonzales</hi> to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
him in it, and for that end, to Viſit him every
third day; which the good Father ſo regularly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
for three Months together, that it was ſaid
in <hi>Rome,</hi> by the way of Raillery, that <hi>Gonzales</hi>
viſited the <hi>Portugal</hi> Embaſſador like a <hi>Tertian</hi>
Ague.</p>
               <p>Theſe Solicitations of the Fathers were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
for Don <hi>Alphonſo</hi> vigorouſly took the
buſineſs in hand, and ended it in a ſhort time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the delays of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
The Pope nam'd <hi>Nugnez</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi>
according to the demand of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
who had diſcover'd the inclination of Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
therein. He ſent him a little after the <hi>Pall,</hi> with
the Rights and Powers thereunto belonging, to be
exercis'd not only in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> but in all the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65023:160"/>
Neighbouring Provinces. He made <hi>Oviedo</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Nice, Carnero</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> and declar'd
both the one, and the other Succeſſors to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch.
Laſtly he gave the Title and Authority of
Apoſtolical Commiſſary to Father <hi>Gaſper Barzee,</hi>
whom Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> nam'd to the Embaſſador,
and who was then Rector of the Colledge of <hi>Goa.</hi>
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> choſe for the Patriarch, and the
Biſhops, ten Companions; and when they all parted
for <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> he writ to the King of the <hi>Abyſſins</hi>
this following Letter.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                        </note> all Grace, Happineſs, and

King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> nsov'd by his Zeal for the Glory
of the holy Name of God, and for the Salvation of
Souls, which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has Redeem'd with his
precious Blood, has more then once ſignifi'd to me
his Pleaſure, that I ſhould name twelve Perſons of
our ſmall Society, which is Entituled of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for the
Service of the States of your Highneſs; and that
among them there ſhould be a Patriarch and two
Biſhops. I have executed the Orders of that Prince,
being oblig'd thereunto by the innumerable Favors,
which our Society has receiv'd from his Highneſs,
and by the due Veneration, which we all owe to the
Commands of ſo great a King.</p>
                     <p>I have deſignedly imitated the Number of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Saviour and his Apoſtles, in chuſing beſides the
Patriarch, twelve Prieſts of our Body, to Sacrifice
their lives for the Salvation of your Subjects; and I
have done it the more willingly, in regard that we
cannot better imploy our ſelves, then in the ſervice
of a Prince, like your Highneſs, who in the mid'ſt
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65023:161"/>
of ſo many Nations, that are Enemies to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Name, endeavor, by the Example of your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
to maintain and augment within your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
the Religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Good intentions and Honorable endeavours
of your Highneſs, did truly ſtand in need of ſuch
Spiritual Paſtors, by whoſe Miniſtry the Church of
<hi>Aethiopia</hi> might receive both Legitimate Power,
deriv'd from the holy Apoſtolick See, and alſo the
pure Doctrine of the Chriſtian Faith: For thoſe are
the two Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, which our
Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> firſt promis'd to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
intruſted him with.</p>
                     <p>He did but promiſe them, when he ſaid to him, as
we read in the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew, I ſay unto
you that you are</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock I will
build my Church, and I will give you the Keys of
the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatſoever you ſhall
bind upon Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven, and
whatſoever you ſhall looſen upon Earth ſhall be
looſen'd in Heaven.</hi> He Actually gave them to him,
when after his Reſurrection, and before his Aſcention,
he ſaid to him, as St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>Feed my ſheep.</hi>
By theſe words the Son of God committed to his charge
not a part only, but the whole Flock, with a Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Power, much more ample, then what he
communicated to the reſt of the Apoſtles. This is
that which our Lord ſeems to have figuratively ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifi'd
by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> when ſpeaking of the
High Prieſt <hi>Eliacim,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>I will give you the
Key of the Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>that ſhall open, and
no man ſhall ſhut, that ſhall ſhut, and no man ſhall
open.</hi> This Symbole is the Figure of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and
of his Succeſſors; and the Keys, which have the
ſignification of a full and abſolute Dominion, denote
the Power of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:65023:161"/>
This being ſo, your Highneſs has great reaſon to
give thanks to Heaven, for having vouchſafed,
under your Reign, to ſend true Paſtors, who have
receiv'd their Power and Authority from the Vicar of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to your People, who have ſtray'd from
the Fold of the true Church. And it is not without
great reaſon, that your Father and Grand-Father
had difficulty to receive a National Patriarch from
the hands of the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> A Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſeparated from the Body, receives from it neither
life nor motion; in like manner the Patriarch of
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> whether he reſides at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or at
<hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> being a Schiſmatick, ſeparated from
the Holy Apoſtolick See and from the Supream Biſhop,
Head of the Univerſal Church, can neither receive
for himſelf, nor communicate to others, the life of
Grace, or Paſtoral Authority.</p>
                     <p>For in fine, as there is but one Catholick Church,
ſo there cannot be one true Church depending upon the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and another upon him of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi>
As the Bridegroom is one, ſo is the Bride, and
'tis of her that <hi>Solomon,</hi> repreſenting the Perſon of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſays in the <hi>Canticles, My Dove is one.</hi>
The Prophet <hi>Oſee</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe: <hi>The
Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and of</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be aſſembled,
and ſhall have but one Head.</hi> In the ſame Spirit
St. <hi>John</hi> along time after ſaid, there is but <hi>one Fold
and one Shepherd.</hi> And as we read in <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
there was but one Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> out of which none
were ſav'd from the Deluge; ſo there was but one
Tabernacle built by <hi>Moſes;</hi> but one Temple of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> where they Sacrifiz'd and
Ador'd; but one Synagogue, whoſe Judgments were
legal.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things were Figures of the Unity of the
Church, out of which nothing can avail: For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:65023:162"/>
ever is not United to this Myſtical Body, ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the Head, who is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Divine
Grace, which gives life to the Soul, and diſpoſeth it to
Eternal happineſs. To declare this Unity againſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Hereticks, it is Sung in the Creed, <hi>I Believe in the
one Holy Catholick, and Apoſtolick Church;</hi> and the
holy Councils have Condemn'd of Error the Opinion
of thoſe, who maintain'd, that the particular Churches
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> were true
Churches, without being United to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> the common Head of the Catholick Church;
out of which have deſcended in a continual Succeſſion,
all the Popes from St. <hi>Peter</hi> to this day, who, by the
relation of St. <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Martyr, fix'd his Chair
at <hi>Rome</hi> by order from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and cemented it
with his own Blood.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Popes have been held, without Controverſie
to be the Vicars of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by innumerable holy
Doctors, <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and of all Nations; they
have been acknowledg'd by Anchortes, Biſhops, and
other Confeſſors, Illuſtrious for Sanctity: Laſtly they
have been Authenticated by an infinity of Miracles,
and by innumerable Martyrs, who have dy'd in the
Union, and for the Faith of the holy <hi>Roman</hi>
Church.</p>
                     <p>It was therefore with good reaſon, that in the
Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> all the Biſhops cry'd with one
Voice, in Saluting the holy Pope St. <hi>Leo, Moſt Holy,
Apoſtolick, Univerſal;</hi> and that in the Council of
<hi>Conſtance</hi> thoſe were Anathematiz'd, who deny'd
the Primacy and Authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
over all the Churches of the World. Theſe Decrees
ſo Expreſs, and ſo Authentick, are farther confirm'd
by the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> which was held under
<hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth, and in which were preſent the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and other
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:65023:162"/>
Nations, <hi>We Define,</hi> ſay the Fathers of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<hi>that the holy See Apoſtolick, and the Biſhop of</hi>
Rome <hi>hath the Primacy over all the Churches in the
World; that he is Succeſſor of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>the Vicar
of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the Head of the whole Church,
the Father, and Doctor of all the Faithful, that our
Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>hath given him, in the perſon
of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>a full power to inſtruct, to direct, and
to govern the Univerſal Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore the moſt Serene King <hi>David,</hi> Father to
your Highneſs, with great right did formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
by a ſollemn Embaſſy, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
for the Mother, and Miſtreſs of all Churches. And
amongſt the many illuſtrious Actions, by which both
he and you have recommended your Names to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
two there are which will outſhine all the reſt,
and for which your People ought to render immortal
thanks to God. Your Father is the firſt King of the
<hi>Abyſſins,</hi> who put himſelf under the Obedience of
him, who holds the place of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> upon Earth;
and you are the firſt who hath brought into your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
a true Patriarch, a Legitimate Son of the
holy See, and deputed by the Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For if it ought to be reckon'd the higheſt Bleſſing, as
in effect it is, to be United to the Myſtical Body of
the Catholick Church, which is enliven'd, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>teaching her all Truths,</hi>
according to the Teſtimony of the Evangeliſt; If it
be a great happineſs to be enlightned with ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
to be ſettl'd, and to reſt upon the Foundations
of the Church, which the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> calls <hi>the Houſe of God, the Pillar and
Baſis of Truth,</hi> to which our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath
promis'd an Everlaſting Aſſiſtance, when he ſaid to
his Apoſtles, <hi>Behold I am always with you to the
end of the World,</hi> as we read in the Goſpel of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:65023:163"/>
St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> Theſe Nations have certainly great
reaſon to thank their Saviour and Creator, whoſe
merciful Providence has made uſe of your Father,
and of your ſelf, to beſtow ſuch benefits upon them;
and their acknowledgment ſhould the more ſhew it
ſelf, in regard alſo of the Temporal Advantages,
which are likely to follow theſe Spiritual Bleſſings.
For we may juſtly hope, that by the means of this
Reunion with the Church, your Enemies will ſoon be
vanquiſh'd, and your Empire enlarg'd.</p>
                     <p>The Prieſts, which are ſent you, are indeed all, but
principally the Patriarch and the two Biſhops, of try'd
Vertue, and ſelected out of our Society for ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
a Function, in regard of their eminent Learning,
and of their perfect Charity. They want neither Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
nor Zeal well to acquit themſelves of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
hoping that they ſhall Labour uſefully for the
Glory of God, for the Converſion of Souls, and for
the Service of your Highneſs. Their only deſire is,
to imitate in ſome ſort the Son of God, who willingly
ſuffer'd death, to redeem Mankind from Eternal
Damnation, and who ſaith, by the Mouth of the
Evangeliſt, <hi>I am the good Shepherd, the good
Shepherd gives his Life for his Sheep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Patriarch, and the reſt, animated by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of our Saviour, come diſpos'd, to relieve and
gain Souls, by their Counſels, by their Labours, and
even by their Death, if need ſhall require. The more
freely your Highneſs ſhall be pleas'd to open your mind,
and to communicate your thoughts to them, the greater
(I hope) your inward Conſolation will be. And for
what regards the Credit to be given to what they
ſhall ſay, either in private or in publick, your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is not Ignorant, that the words of theſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
ſent by the Holy See, and chiefly thoſe of the
Patriarch, have Apoſtolical Authority, and in ſome
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65023:163"/>
ſort are no leſs to be credited, then the voice of the
Church, whoſe Interpreters they are.</p>
                     <p>And in regard, that all the Faithful ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the Sentiments of the Church, obey her Decrees
and conſult her in doubtful Caſes: I am perſwaded
that your Piety will lead you to make an Edict, which
may oblige all your Subjects to follow, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
the Orders and Conſtitutions, both of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
and of thoſe whom he ſhall ſubſtitute in his
place. The <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> teaches us, that it was
the Cuſtom among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Controverſies and
Difficulties which occur'd, to have recourſe to the
Synagogue, which was the Figure and Forerunner
of the Chriſtian Church. For this reaſon it was
that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſaid in the Goſpel, the Scribes and
Phariſees are ſeated on the Chair of <hi>Moſes;</hi> the wiſe
Man teaches the ſame thing in the <hi>Proverbs, Do
not neglect the Precepts of your Mother;</hi> This
Mother is the Church: And in another place, <hi>paſs
not the bounds which your Fathers have ſet;</hi> theſe
Fathers are the Prelates of the Church. In conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> requires of us to have ſo great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to his Church, that he plainly tells us by the
Evangeliſt St. <hi>Luke, He who hears you, hears me,
and he who contemns you contemns me.</hi> And by
St. <hi>Matthew, If he hears not the Church, let him
be to you as a Heathen and a Publican.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence it follows, that we muſt not hearken to thoſe
who hold forth any thing, that is not conformable
to the Senſe, and the Interpretation of the Catholick
Church; of which we are admoniſh'd by thoſe words
of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Galatians, <hi>But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
we, or any Angel from Heaven ſhould Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelize
to you, otherwiſe then we have Evangeliz'd
to you, be he Anathema.</hi> In fine the Teſtimony of
the Holy Doctors, the Canons of Councils, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65023:164"/>
and Practice of all the Faithful, evidently prove
this Truth.</p>
                     <p>The Patriarch, and his Companions are prepar'd
to render to your Highneſs all due Honor and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and in their Function to uſe all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
which Piety and Religion will permit. For
our parts who remain in theſe Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi>
your Highneſs may be aſſur'd, that as many as we
are in our Society, we ſhall ever be ready to ſerve
you in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We ſhall continue our
Prayers and our Sacrifices, that Heaven may Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
your Royal Perſon, and your whole Empire,
in the ſervice of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and beſtow upon you
all Temporal and Eternal Bleſſings. May it pleaſe
his Divine Goodneſs to give us all, light clearly to
know his Holy Will, and ſtrength duly to Execute it.</p>

                  <hi>Simon Rodriguez,</hi> who upon
the Order of his General, concerning his Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialſhip
of <hi>Arragon,</hi> had made new inſtances to be
diſcharg'd from it, and whoſe Excuſes were finally
receiv'd, came to <hi>Rome</hi> whither he was call'd. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
good Men ſometimes forget themſelves, which
God permits for their greater humiliation, <hi>Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi>
had ſome reſentment, that he was not ſent into
<hi>Portugal.</hi> He alſo complain'd, that they had laid
at his dore, the troubles and diſorders of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
which he had Govern'd twelve Years; and
his diſcontent led him ſo far, as to demand juſtice
of the General; Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to content <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driguez,</hi>
appointed ſome of the Profeſt Fathers, that
were of the greateſt Prudence and Candor, to judge
the matter, and according to the Forms of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Tribunal, reſerving to himſelf the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65023:164"/>
of the Mulct, as the Caſe ſhould deſerve. The
Judges nam'd, whoſe Choice <hi>Rodriguez</hi> approv'd,
after having maturely Examin'd the Matter, upon
the Informations receiv'd, and upon his Anſwers
thereunto made, unanimouſly declar'd upon their
Oaths, that they found him culpable upon two
Points; Firſt, for having been negligent in cauſing
to be obſerv'd that Form and Manner of Living in
<hi>Portugal</hi> which their common Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had
preſcrib'd to the whole Society. Secondly, for having
us'd too much Mildneſs and Indulgence in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<hi>Rodriguez,</hi> whom they caus'd to come
before them, to ſignifie their Judgment to him, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to it with a profound Humility; and caſting
himſelf at their Feet, deſir'd them to impoſe upon
him a Pennance proportionable to the Scandal
which he had given.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> ſatisfi'd with the Submiſſion of
<hi>Rodriguez,</hi> whom he tenderly lov'd, as his Brother
and Son in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> would inflict no Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon him. He only forbad him to return into
<hi>Portugal,</hi> leſt his preſence ſhould renew thoſe Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which his Abſence had quieted; and he rather
choſe to let him go into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> whither his
Inclination had led him ever ſince his entrance into
the Order, and where there was ſome Deſign of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up a Colledge of the Society. Thus <hi>Rodriguez</hi>
left <hi>Rome,</hi> and took the Way of <hi>Venice:</hi> but his
want of Health hinder'd him from putting to Sea,
and ſo long ſtopt him in <hi>Italy,</hi> till at laſt he was
permitted to retire into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he led a very
holy Life.</p>
               <p>The care which Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had to preſerve
the Vertue and the Reputation of his Children,<note place="margin">He makes a Regulation for the Viſits of Women.</note> in the
midſt of ſo many different Employments, in which
they were engag'd for the good of Souls, caus'd him
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65023:165"/>
to make a Regulation, which was publiſh'd over his
whole Body, importing, That none ſhould go to
viſit Women alone, not even thoſe of the higheſt
Quality, or thoſe who were ſick; That when they
Diſcours'd with them, or heard their Confeſſions, it
ſhould be ſo order'd, that the Companion ſhould ſee
all that paſs'd, without hearing what ought to be
ſecret. And to the end that all the World might
know how ſtrictly he would have this Rule obſerv'd,
being inform'd that a certain ancient Father, and of
known Vertue, had upon ſome Occaſion deviated
from it, he caus'd eight Prieſts to be aſſembled, and
order'd the Culpable to take a Diſcipline before
them, during the ſpace that each of them recited
one of the Penitential Pſalms.</p>
               <p>Whereas the General left nothing unthought of,<note place="margin">He caus'd Rules of Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be publiſh'd.</note>
and well knew, that the modeſt Comportment of
Religious Men did not only ſerve to edifie and gain
Secular Perſons, but alſo to contain the Religious
themſelves in their Duty, he had formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
Rules in particular concerning exterior
Behaviour. Theſe Rules, which are Entituled <hi>Of
Modeſty,</hi> and which contain thirteen Articles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
into a great many Particulars, even to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
how they ought to carry their Head, and to
hold their Eyes. At this time he order'd Father
<hi>Lewis Gonzales</hi> to publiſh them in the <hi>Caſa Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſa,</hi>
and earneſtly to Recommend the obſervance of
them all the World over. This Father, who had
the care of Domeſtick Diſcipline, not having been
ſo ſpeedy in publiſhing them as he was order'd, the
General reprehended him openly for his negligence,
in theſe Terms; <hi>We take great pains in making
Laws, and our Miniſters are negligent in having
them obſerv'd, as if they had coſt us nothing; and
yet theſe, of which I now treat, have coſt me very
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65023:165"/>
dear. I have conſulted God many times in writing
them, and my Prayers have been accompanied with
great ſtore of Tears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſo much valu'd theſe Rules of Modeſty, that
to the end the practice of them might throughly be
Eſtabliſh'd, he one day commanded <hi>Laynez</hi> at the
end of Dinner, to make an Explication of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the Fathers of the Houſe, and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
to them their Importance. While <hi>Laynez</hi>
ſpake, and all attentively liſtned, a terrible noiſe was
heard, which ſhook the Room: It mightily frighted
both the Speaker and the Hearers, but did not break
off the Conference. As ſoon as their Buſineſs was
ended, they all had the curioſity to know the cauſe
of it, which their own Eyes quickly manifeſted to
them, upon their paſſing out of the Room where
they were aſſembled. A Gallery, which look'd into
the Garden, and in which the ancient Fathers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
us'd to walk after Meals, was entirely fall'n
down: So that if the General had not oblig'd all
the Fathers to be preſent at the Conference, ſome
of them had certainly periſh'd under the Ruines of
the Gallery. Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> ador'd the Providence
of God over his Servants, and making uſe of the
Occaſion, he told them, <hi>It well appears, Brethren,
that the Rules which have been Explicated to you,
are not unpleaſing to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Rules were not ineffectual: Every one
obſerv'd them ſo exactly, that thoſe of the Society
were known by their compos'd Behaviour; And
the General being told that ſome of the World
look'd upon the Jeſuits as Hypocrites, by reaſon of
this extream Modeſty which was ſeen in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance:
<hi>I pray God</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that ſuch an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie
may always increaſe among us. For my part,</hi>
(he added ſmiling) <hi>I know but two Hypocrites in all
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:65023:166"/>
our Company;</hi> pointing at the ſame time to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badilla</hi>
and <hi>Salmenon:</hi> and he explain'd himſelf
to the reſt that were about him, That altho' they
both ſeem'd very vertuous, yet their inward Vertue
was greater then it ſeem'd.</p>
               <p>Not long after, Diſcourſing familiarly with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Lewis Gonzales,</hi> and upon the occaſion of
News lately come from the <hi>Indies,</hi> their Diſcourſe
falling upon the happy progreſs which the Society
made in all Places, he ſaid, That theſe Proſperities
caus'd in him more fear then joy; That when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
ceaſed, he ſhould be in apprehenſion, leſt
the Society ſhould ſomewhere relax in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of their Duty; That good Fortune was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be truſted, and that we are then moſt to fear,
when all things go according to our Deſires. But
this Calm which he ſo much fear'd, did not laſt long:
A Storm aroſe, which was the more terrible, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it proceeded from Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Third,
who had been ſo kind to Father <hi>Ignatius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth made an Order in <hi>Spain,</hi>

to a Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> That
Prieſts, and ſuch as were Benefic'd, ſhould not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
themſelves from their Dioceſs, nor from their
Churches. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Eccleſiaſticks, who were at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and whom this Edict particularly regarded,
made their Complaint to the Pope of the Emperor's
Proceeding, as being derogatory to the Rights of the
Holy See; and they ſtickled ſo much in it, that at
laſt the Pope complain'd of it to the Emperor;
Who briskly reply'd, <hi>That the Order came not from
him, but from the National Council, which would
have the Decrees of the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>obſerv'd;
and that his Holineſs, who aſſiſted at the Council in
Quality of Legat, ought rather to maintain Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces
of this nature, then to oppoſe them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:65023:166"/>
The Pope more irritated at the Anſwer of <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fifth, then at the Thing it ſelf in queſtion,
ſhew'd great Indignation at it. And becauſe it was
reported, that the Jeſuits at the Court of <hi>Caſtile</hi> were
the Authors of the Edict, or at leaſt had a good ſhare
in it, his Holineſs ſo chang'd his Countenance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, that the Fathers at <hi>Rome</hi> were deny'd
all acceſs to the Pope's Palace; and no body dar'd
ſpeak a word in their behalf, not Cardinal <hi>de Carpi</hi>
himſelf, who had great Credit with the Pope, and
who was Protector of the Society.</p>
               <p>What much agravated this Misfortune was, that
Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who poſſibly might have found the
Secret to appeaſe his Holineſs, lay dangerouſly ſick
in this unhappy Conjuncture. But when the Matter
ſeem'd deſperate, all was unexpectedly heal'd again.
<hi>Ferninand,</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> writing to the Pope
about ſome very important Affairs, deſir'd him to
give Credit to what the General of the Jeſuits, who
had his Secret, ſhould ſay to him, and whom he had
order'd to impart it to none but to his Holineſs. The
Pope, who had no leſs Concern in the Buſineſs then
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> himſelf, ſent for Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> the ſame
Moment that he had receiv'd his Letters out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
But the Father was ſtill ſick, and in ſo bad a
Condition, as would not permit him to hear any
Buſineſs ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he began to recover,<note place="margin">The General appeaſes the Pope.</note> and was able to
go abroad, he went ſtraight to the <hi>Vatican,</hi> every
body wondring what ſhould carry him thither:
All the Fathers were ſtartled at it, that he ſhould ſo
little regard the Pope's Indignation, and no body
could divine upon what account he expos'd himſelf
to it. He had Audience immediately, and the Pope
ſeeing him very weak, would not permit him to
ſpeak upon his Knees, nor Bare-headed. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:65023:167"/>
imparted to the Pope what he had Order to ſay
to him from the King of the <hi>Romans:</hi> After which,
taking occaſion to ſpeak to him about the Edict of
<hi>Spain;</hi> he ſo well juſtifi'd the Society from thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
that had been rais'd againſt them, that his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
wholly changing his Sentiments, or rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to his former Affection for the Jeſuits, told
Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that he would never more believe
what was ſaid againſt them; and at the ſame time
made him a promiſe of Two thouſand Crowns a
year; or of the firſt vacant Abby, for the ſupport of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Pope in the next place asked the Father, if
the</hi> Caſa Profeſſa <hi>were in no want of Neceſſaries.
The Father anſwer'd,</hi> That it wanted nothing, tho'
all its Subſiſtence was upon Alms; and that they had
nothing to deſire, but the good Favour of his Holineſs.
<hi>Before the Father had ended his Audience, the Pope
call'd for his</hi> Maiſtro di Camera, <hi>and in the preſence
of</hi> Ignatius, I Order you (<hi>he ſaid),</hi> that as often as
the Father ſhall demand Audience, you immediately
admit him, and that you give me notice of it, tho'
Cardinals, or any other Perſons of Quality ſhould be
with me. <hi>The day following he ſent to the</hi> Caſa
Profeſſa <hi>an Alms of Five hundred Crowns in Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This return, or rather this increaſe of the Pope's
Kindneſs towards the Jeſuits, enabled Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
to come off in a Buſineſs, which otherwiſe might
have been of pernicious Conſequence: A young
<hi>Neapolitan,</hi> call'd <hi>Octavius Caeſar,</hi> who was Son to
the Duke of <hi>Mont-Leon,</hi> had been receiv'd into the
Society with the Conſent of his Father; and after
his Noviceſhip, he had been ſent to the Colledge of
<hi>Meſſina;</hi> and about this time the General call'd
him to <hi>Rome:</hi> His Father being alſo come thither
about a Buſineſs of Importance, took a Reſolution
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:65023:167"/>
of requiring his Son from the General, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that he had been taken from him againſt his
Will; and he ſo well ſolicited the Matter with the
Pope, by the Mediation of Cardinal <hi>Caraffa,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Naples,</hi> who was his Friend, and no lover
of the Jeſuits, that the Pope referr'd the Buſineſs to
the Cardinal himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Mother alſo came on purpoſe from <hi>Naples,</hi>
to act her part in this Matter: And whereas <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
had been a great Darling, ſhe made uſe of all
thoſe little Arts which Paſſion uſually inſtructs Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
withal. She went up and down the Town like a
diſtracted Perſon, weeping, and calling for Juſtice
from God and Men, againſt thoſe who had Spirited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
her Son. The Cardinal, whether ill inform'd of
the Buſineſs, or touch'd with the Lamentations of the
Mother, gave Judgment, That the General ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
<hi>Octavius;</hi> and ſhould be liable to Eccleſiaſtical
Cenſure, if he did not immediately obey the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who well knew what S. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
preſcribes concerning Children call'd by God,
and that ſuch Orders are not to be ſubmitted to, as
contradict the Maxims of the Goſpel, went himſelf
to the Pope, to inform him of it. His Holineſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null'd
the Sentence of Cardinal <hi>Caraffa,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
the Pretenſions of the Father and Mother to
be unjuſt: But in regard the ſame Caſe might often
recur, to ſettle the Vocation of young Jeſuits, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Aſſaults of Fleſh and Blood, he appointed
a Congregation of Cardinals, to Judge all Cauſes of
this nature.</p>

extraordinary Vertue and Prudence, who ſucceeded
<hi>Julius,</hi> and took the Name of <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Second,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65023:168"/>
had no leſs good-will for it, nor leſs eſteem for the
Founder. So that when Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> went the
firſt time to do his Homage to the new Pope, his
Holineſs embracing him with great kindneſs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
a long time with him about the Means of Re-eſtabliſhing
the ancient Diſcipline of Manners, and
to extinguiſh the new ſprung Hereſies. He more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
charg'd him in his Name, to give the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Benediction to all the Fathers of <hi>Rome;</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
to him, that when the Croud of the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
was over, he would ſee them all in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
But that which was moſt remarkable, was, that
the Pope exhorting him to increaſe his Body with
more Labourers, to cultivate the Vineyard of the
Church, <hi>Chuſe us but Workmen of your Trainining</hi> (he
ſaid to him), <hi>and we will find them Employment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this, he demanded of him two Divines,
whom he might ſafely Conſult in difficult Matters,
and who might aſſiſt him in ſome manner to bear
the heavy Charge which lay upon him; but he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
out of great Humility, <hi>I ask this Succour of
you upon condition, That you your ſelf ſhall judge it
neceſſary for me.</hi> Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> charm'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with this Goodneſs of the Pope, choſe for
him two Men of the Society, whom he knew to be
moſt agreeable to his Holineſs, and moſt capable of
filling that Poſt. The firſt was Father <hi>James Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez,</hi>
with whom <hi>Marcellus</hi> had contracted a great
Friendſhip at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and often made
uſe of him for his Confeſſor. The ſecond was Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Martin Olavius,</hi> whom the Pope, when he was
Cardinal, took with him to his Biſhoprick of <hi>Eugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bio</hi>
the year before, and whom he ordinarily call'd
his Maſter.</p>
               <p>Theſe good Intentions, and <hi>Marcellus</hi> himſelf,
ſuddenly vaniſh'd. He dy'd in few days after his
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65023:168"/>
Promotion; and Cardinal <hi>John Peter Caraffa,</hi> who
was choſen in his Place, gave no hopes of ſo happy a
Reign, at leaſt for the Society. He was Dean of
the Sacred Colledge, and wanted little of being
Fourſcore years old. He was thought an Enemy to
the Jeſuits, both in regard that <hi>Ignatius</hi> had refus'd
to unite his Order to that of the <hi>Theatines,</hi> of which
<hi>Caraffa</hi> was the Founder, and that <hi>Julius</hi> the Third
had made void the Sentence given by <hi>Caraffa,</hi> in
favour of the Mother of the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Jeſuit. The
Fathers of <hi>Rome</hi> were all, except the General, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
at his Election; but he, having made his
Prayer, was ſufficiently ſatisfi'd, that <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth
would be very favourable to the Society.</p>
               <p>In effect, the Pope did not only the firſt time of
his waiting upon him, treat Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> with
great kindneſs, but in many other particular Audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
concerning the Affairs of his Order, and thoſe of
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he would not permit him to ſpeak upon
his Knees, or Bare-headed. The only thing which
diſpleas'd the Father, was, that his Holineſs declar'd
to him his Reſolution, as he did alſo in the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
to make <hi>Laynez</hi> a Cardinal. Whereupon
when he came home, he was heard to ſay, <hi>If God
doth not prevent it, we ſhall ſee</hi> Laynez <hi>in few
Months made a Cardinal. But that which comforts
me</hi> (he added) <hi>is, that if his Holineſs doth not
change his Reſolution, the World will ſee by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of</hi> Laynez<hi>'s receiving his Hat, whether the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
be covetous of Eccleſiaſtical Dignities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> was not deceiv'd:<note place="margin">He <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> made a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> He offer'd on
his part many Vows to God, and ſhed great ſtore of
Tears at the foot of the Altars, to allay the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt.
<hi>Laynez</hi> no ſooner knew the Deſign of the
Pope, but, not content to implore night and day
the Aid of Heaven againſt his Promotion, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:65023:169"/>
himſelf with all earneſtneſs to his Friends in the
Sacred Colledge, to ſave him from it; and he did it
with ſuch an Ayre of Sincerity, as caus'd in them
both Belief and Admiration. The Pope underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Reluctancy of <hi>Laynez,</hi> in order to qualifie,
and a little to prepare him before he nam'd him Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
caus'd him to Lodge in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> under
pretence of Employing him to Reform the <hi>Datary,</hi>
into which of late years had crept many Abuſes.
<hi>Laynez</hi> had ſcarce been one day in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> but
he came back to the <hi>Caſa Profeſſa,</hi> pretending to
look upon ſome Books, and to conſult able Perſons
about the Affairs of the <hi>Datary;</hi> but his real De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was to withdraw himſelf from the Eyes of the
Court, and to flie into the Arms of his Father, to ſave
himſelf from the danger: And it was according to
the Principles, and by the Counſel of the General,
that he made a ſolemn Proteſtation, Written and
Sign'd by his own Hand, to make known to all the
Society, and to the whole World, how much his
Heart was averſe from a Cardinalſhip.</p>
               <p>All theſe Endeavors had their effect: for, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were that God heard the Prayers of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and ſo chang'd the Reſolution of the Pope,
or that, perſwaded by the Reaſons of <hi>Laynez,</hi> the
Pope himſelf laid the Matter down, there was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
no more talk of this Fathers Promotion. We
cannot expreſs the Joy which Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
to ſee the Society deliver'd from a Cardinal's
Hat: He and his whole Family gave thanks to
Heaven, and to his Holineſs, acknowledging it to
be the greateſt Favor which could be done them.
<hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth upon this Occaſion came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Spirit of the Founder of the Jeſuits; and
the Eſteem which he had for him did hereupon ſo
much increaſe, that in all great Affairs he follow'd
his Counſels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:65023:169"/>
The Credit of <hi>Ignatius</hi> grew ſo great at Court,
that the Cardinal of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> then at <hi>Rome,</hi> was
heard to ſay, <hi>That if he had any thing to ask of the
Pope, he ſhould uſe the Mediation of</hi> Ignatius;
And the occaſion of his ſo ſpeaking was, that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>John Michael Sarazin,</hi> who was chief Miniſter
at the beginning of the <hi>Pontificate,</hi> having one day
Preſented a Memorial to <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
ſome Graces, his Holineſs referr'd the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the General of the Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth was not content with theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Marks of Honor and Kindneſs, but to give
<hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Body more ſolid proofs of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
he reſolv'd to compleat the Foundation of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Colledge, to the Maintenance whereof, and
for the Subſiſtence of Two hundred perſons, which
it contain'd, the Liberality of <hi>Borgia,</hi> and the Two
thouſand Crowns of <hi>Julius</hi> the Third, were not
ſufficient. But the War which broke out between
the Pope and the <hi>Catholick</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second,
to whom <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had newly Reſign'd his
Kingdoms, poſtpon'd, and afterwards quite defeated
the Execution of this Deſign: for it put the Holy
See to a vaſt Expence, to Reſiſt the Power of <hi>Spain;</hi>
and the Times grew ſo hard during the Wars of
<hi>Italy,</hi> that the moſt Wealthy were put to it how to
live.</p>
               <p>In this while the Charity of the Faithful did not
cool towards the Jeſuits of <hi>Rome;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> in the Providence of God.</note> they wanted
nothing during the publick Calamities: And when
a certain Father told the General, that this could not
be done without a Miracle; <hi>What Miracle</hi> (reply'd
the General, with a ſerious Countenance, and with a
ſevere Tone)? <hi>It would be very ſtrange, if things
ſhould go otherwiſe: for God has engag'd his Word
upon it; let us Serve him, he will Conduct us, and
we ſhall want nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:65023:170"/>
Whereas the War did every day augment the
ſcarcity of Proviſions, they advis'd him to ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
part of his Company into other Provinces. Far
from following this Counſel, he ſent for an excellent
Architect to come to him to <hi>Rome,</hi> call'd <hi>Antonio
Labaco,</hi> who had a Son in the Society, and caus'd him
to draw Models for the <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge, and for
the <hi>German</hi> Colledge, and to caſt up the Charges of
thoſe two Buildings. So much he rely'd upon the
Fund of Providence.</p>
               <p>It was according to this Principle, that in the ſame
Year he caus'd to be built out of Town, near S. <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bina</hi>'s
Church, a pleaſant and commodious Houſe,
where <hi>Convaleſcents</hi> might ſometimes take freſh Air,
and the young Scholars might once a Week Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
themſelves after their Studies. Some there were
who told him, it had been better to have laid up a
Sum of Money; and that it was no time to Build,
when there was ſo much difficulty to Live. <hi>I prefer</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>the Health of the leaſt in all the Houſe,
above all the Treaſures in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It pleas'd God to manifeſt, as formerly, by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
ways, how much his perfect Dependance,
and his ſincere Charity, were agreeable to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majeſty. For Father <hi>Polancus,</hi> who at that
time manag'd the Temporals of the <hi>Roman</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and had charge of the Building, not having
Money one day to pay the Workmen, and not
knowing where to get it, went to the General, and
told him in what Straits he was. The General lock'd
himſelf up to make his Prayer, which being
ended, he call'd for Father <hi>James Laynez,</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Chriſtopher de Madrid,</hi> together with Father
<hi>Polancus,</hi> and told them ſmiling, <hi>Tho' I am no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
nor the Son of a Prophet, yet I am aſſur'd, that
our Lord will not abandon us.</hi> Then turning to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:65023:170"/>
                  <hi>Polancus,</hi> he ſaid to him with a gay Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<hi>Make but the Colledge ſubſiſt for Six months,
and afterwards I'le take care for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prediction of the General was verifi'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
at the ſame inſtant, for it being then Night,
yet as late as it was, two Perſons of Quality ſent
him a conſiderable Sum, tho' unacquainted with
his Neceſſities; and before the Six months were
over, ſuch plenty of Alms came in, as ſerv'd to pay
off all the Debts of the Colledge.</p>
               <p>Theſe unexpected, and ſeaſonable Supplies, did
ſo affect Father <hi>Martin Olavius,</hi> that Writing to
Father <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> who was gone into <hi>Flanders,</hi>
he told him, That to be convinc'd of the Sanctity
of their common Father, he needed not to ſee the
Sick cur'd, or the Dead rais'd; for what paſs'd in
<hi>Rome,</hi> in ſight of all the World, ſufficiently prov'd,
that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was a Saint, without the help of any
other Miracles.</p>
               <p>The News receiv'd out of <hi>France</hi> did ſomewhat
ſurprize Father <hi>Ignatius;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Society Perſecuted in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> but as bad as they were,
they did not afflict him. When all things ſeem'd
diſpos'd for Regiſtring the Letters which the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its
had obtain'd from the King, there was ſuddenly
rais'd againſt them in <hi>Paris</hi> a furious Storm, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, into whoſe Mind the Cardinal
of <hi>Lorain</hi> had infus'd a good Opinion of the new
Society, was inform'd by the Commiſſioners whom
he appointed to inſpect the Matter, that the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the Jeſuits was neither prejudicial to the
Church, nor to the State; and being advertis'd
that the Parliament ſtill refus'd to Regiſter his firſt
Letters, he ſent them new ones, with Order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in Regiſtring them, without having regard to
the Remonſtrances of his Attorney-General, who
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65023:171"/>
pretended, that the new Jeſuits deſtroy'd the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
Royal, and the Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchy.</p>
               <p>The Parliament, not well pleas'd that the Jeſuits
ſhould have ſo much Credit with the King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
the Buſineſs as long as they could. But not
being able to avoid any longer, at leaſt ſeemingly to
obey ſo preciſe an Order, they paſt a Decree, That
whereas the Buſineſs of the Jeſuits did principally
concern Religion, their Bulls ſhould beſhew'd to the
Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to the Dean of the Faculty of
Divinity, and that both the one and the other ſhould
give their Judgment of the Matter to the Court.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop, who was <hi>Euſtace du Bellay,</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
Enemy of the Jeſuits, made his Report, that
their Inſtitute was repugnant to the Rights of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and to the Concordates made between the
Popes and the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> But the Dean of
the Faculty, devoted to the Biſhop, and animated
by a Doctor, whoſe near Kinſman had, againſt his
will, enter'd into the Society, drove the Matter a
great deal farther: For not contenting himſelf to
deliver his Opinion in a full Audience, with a great
deal of paſſion and bitterneſs, he of his own head
call'd together the Faculty of Divinity; and in this
Aſſembly it was that a bloody Decree was Paſs'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Society, much like to that which the ſame
Faculty in former days made againſt the Order of
St. <hi>Dominick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' many Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> refus'd to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
this Decree, yet they fail'd not to publiſh it, and
every where to diſperſe it; <hi>Paſquier Brouet,</hi> who
was Superior of the Jeſuits in <hi>Paris,</hi> ſent a Copy of
it to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Decree Imports,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Decree of the Faculty of Divinity at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> againſt the Jeſuits.</note> That the new Society,
which attributes to its ſelf the Name of JESUS,
receives into their Body, without diſtinction, all ſorts
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65023:171"/>
of People, how Criminal and infamous ſoever they
are; That they of it differ in nothing from Secular
Prieſts, having neither Habit nor Quire, nor Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
nor Faſtings, nor any of thoſe other Obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which diſtinguiſh and conſtitute a Religious
State; That it ſeems to violate the Modeſty of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick
Profeſſion, by ſo many Immunities and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
which they take in their Functions, chiefly in
the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments of Pennance,
and of the Holy Euchariſt, without any diſtinction of
Places or Perſons, and in Diſpenſing the Word of God,
and in the Inſtruction of Youth, to the prejudice of the
Hierarchy, of other Religious Orders, and even of
Princes and Temporal Lords, againſt the Priviledges
of the Univerſities, and to the great Charge of the
People; That it enervates the holy practice of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
of Pennances, and of the Ceremonies of the
Church; That it gives occaſion of Apoſtatizing from
other Religious Societies; That it refuſeth due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Ordinaries; That it unjuſtly deprives
of their Rights, Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal Lords;
That it brings every where Law-Suits, Diviſions,
Jealouſies, Quarrels, and Schiſms; Laſtly, That for
all theſe Reaſons this Society ſeems Dangerous as to
Faith, an Enemy to the Peace of the Church, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to Monaſtical Profeſſion, and born more for
the Ruine, then for the Edification of the Faithful.</p>
               <p>The Fathers of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The General will have no Anſwer made to the Decree.</note> to whom the General
communicated this Decree, were all of Opinion, that
it ſhould be Anſwer'd in Form, to Diſabuſe the
People of <hi>France,</hi> and to Inſtruct the Doctors of
<hi>Paris,</hi> who ſeem'd to have little knowledge of the
Inſtitute of the Jeſuits; but the General was of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Opinion, as tender as he was of the Reputation
of his Order. Beſides his Veneration for the <hi>Sorbon,</hi>
which he look'd upon as one of the ſtrongeſt Pillars
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65023:172"/>
of the Church, he believ'd that the Cenſure had too
much Heat and Paſſion in it to do much hurt, and
that an Anſwer, as modeſt as it could be drawn,
would rather irritate then heal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being of this Mind, he ſaid to them,</hi> Pray remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the Words which the Son of God ſpoke to his
Apoſtles, when he was returning to his Father,
<hi>Peace I leave to you, my Peace I give to you,</hi> and
imagine with your ſelves, that our Saviour doth at
this preſent addreſs theſe Words to you. My good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
we muſt neither Print, nor Write any thing,
which may either ſhew in us, or produce in others,
the leaſt bitterneſs. In many Occaſions it is better to
be ſilent then to ſpeak; and there is no need to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
and defend our ſelves by Writing, ſince Truth
is ſtrong enough alone to vindicate and defend her
ſelf. The Divines of <hi>Paris</hi> are undoubtedly very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Perſons, and for whom we ought to have
much Reſpect: But as great as their Authority is
in the World, we ought not much to fear it; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can long prevail againſt Truth, which may be
ſet upon, but will never be overcome. God is our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
let us put our Cauſe into his hands, and we
ſhall triumph over Calumny.</p>
               <p>After this general Diſcourſe, he aſſur'd them in
particular, that notwithſtanding all theſe Obſtacles,
which ſeem'd to make their Reception in <hi>France</hi>
deſperate, the Society would be there Eſtabliſh'd;
and that the Colledge of <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould be one of the
moſt celebrated Colledges of <hi>Europe.</hi> However,
he neglected not to write to all the Society in the
ſeveral Parts of the World, where they had Houſes,
Ordering them to ſend him authentick Atteſtations
of their Doctrines, of their Manners, and of their
Courſe of Life, from Princes, Univerſities, Biſhops,
Magiſtrates, and Governors. His Deſign was, in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:65023:172"/>
caſe of need, to ſet this Teſtimony of the whole
Univerſe againſt the Judgment of a particular, and
not well inſtructed Body.</p>
               <p>In the mean time ſome Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to <hi>Rome</hi> with the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He Confers with ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the <hi>Sorbon.</hi>

<hi>Ignatius,</hi> who never had open'd his Mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Decrees of <hi>Paris,</hi> neither in the Town nor
in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> thought it now convenient to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
himſelf upon it with theſe Doctors before the
Cardinal. The Day being ſet, he took with him
<hi>Laynez, Polancus,</hi> and <hi>Olavius;</hi> four Doctors were
likewiſe preſent at the Conference: One of them,
call'd <hi>Benet,</hi> who had been a principal Actor in
the Cenſure, undertook to maintain it, Article by
Article; But the Fathers ſo fully Anſwer'd all the
Contents, that the Cardinal, being himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd,
oblig'd the Doctors to acknowledge, that
they had condemn'd the Jeſuits, without being well
inform'd of their Inſtitute. After this, he prais'd
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> for having made no Complaints,
neither to the Pope, nor to the Cardinals; and
Doctor <hi>Benet</hi> himſelf could do no leſs then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him for it.</p>
               <p>The publication of the Decree ſtirr'd up all <hi>Paris</hi>
againſt the Jeſuits: The Profeſſors, the Preachers,
and the Curats, loudly declaim'd againſt their Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and made horrible Repreſentations of it: In
every corner of the Town were fix'd contumelious
Papers, to decry their Doctrine and their Manners;
And the incens'd Multitude treated them as Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
hated and deſpis'd.</p>
               <p>But the Storm was too violent to laſt: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of the Faculty of Divinity, according to the
Deſtiny of falſe things, fell of it ſelf. And tho' the
Society was not receiv'd in <hi>France</hi> by publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
till five or ſix years after, yet they liv'd
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:65023:173"/>
quietly, and had free Exerciſe of their Functions.
It began to Teach even at that time, in the Town of
<hi>Billon,</hi> where the Biſhop of <hi>Clermont, William du
Prat.</hi> Founded a Colledge, till that of <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould
be open'd.</p>
               <p>About this time it was, that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>
deſir'd to have Penſioners in the Colledge of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimbria,</hi>
and that the Jeſuits ſhould have the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their Manners, and of their Studies. The
General conſented to it, upon Condition that the
Quarter of theſe Penſioners might be ſeparated
from that of the ancient Fathers: And this is the
Original of Penſioners, which are now receiv'd by
the Society in the principal Colledges of moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
               <p>Whereas Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> intended that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Colledge ſhould be the Pattern of all other
Colledges,<note place="margin">His Care for the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Colledge.</note> he ſpar'd no Induſtry to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.
Beſides <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
were alſo Taught, even to the <hi>Mathematicks;</hi>
and great Care he had to get the beſt Maſters. He
continually inform'd himſelf how their Studies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd;
and to animate the Scholars and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
he appointed frequent Diſputations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
of Wit in each School, where he would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
preſent himſelf, and bring with him Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
and other Perſons of Quality. The moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
of theſe Diſputations was that which laſted
eight days together, in which were maintain'd <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
of all the Sciences Taught by the Society; which
<hi>Theſes</hi> he caus'd to be Printed, and to be every
where diſpers'd.</p>
               <p>And farther to give Reputation to the Colledge,
he Order'd, That at the opening of the Schools, the
Profeſſors ſhould every year make publick Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues;
and at the end of the year that Comedies
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:65023:173"/>
or Tragedies ſhould be perform'd by the Scholars,
to draw the Ingenious by the Beauty of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and the People by the Ornaments of the
Theatre. And to give more Encouragement to
Induſtry and Study, he obtain'd of the Pope, that
the Scholars of the <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
to the Degrees of Maſters of Art, and of
Doctors, after ſufficient proofs had of their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <p>Moreover, tho' his greateſt Concern was for the
Learned Languages, yet he would not have the
vulgar Tongue neglected; inſomuch that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the beginning of his Generalſhip, made it
his Buſineſs to ſpeak <hi>Italian</hi> correctly; and to that
end he order'd young <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the Tongue, to note all the Faults he ſhould
commit in ſpeaking: and he was ſo exact herein,
that with his own Hand he would write down the
improper Words or Expreſſions which were obſerv'd
to come from him: So much it was his Judgment,
that Religious Men, who by their Inſtitute are to
have Commerce with the World, ought to have an
exact knowledge of the Language of the Country.</p>
               <p>Upon this account it was that he then renew'd a
Rule which he had formerly made, to maintain at
Home an union of Hearts, and to make them abroad
more capable and fit to Serve their Neighbor. The
Rule Imports,<note place="margin">Orland. Hiſt. Soc. l. 16. 11. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>That every one ſhould Study the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Country where he lives.</hi> For the ſame
Reaſon he order'd, that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge
there ſhould be every day Leſſons in the <hi>Italian</hi>
Tongue. But nothing ſhews more how incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Functions of his Order he eſteem'd a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
of Language, then that Paſſage of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,<note place="margin">Conſtitut. part 4. c. 8.</note>
where he ſaith, <hi>That they ſhould be
Train'd to Preach, and to make Chriſtian Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:65023:174"/>
in ſuch a Way and Stile as may edifie the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which Way is very different from the Stile and
Terms of the School; And that, profitably to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
theſe Functions, they ſhould endeavor to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the vulgar Tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that the Jeſuit who neglects to
ſpeak correctly, neglects his Rule; and that thoſe
who pretend that it agrees not with the Character
of their Profeſſion, to ſtudy the purity of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Language, do not well conſider what they ſay.
They ſhould remember, that ſince Hereticks in all
Ages have endeavor'd to excel in politeneſs of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
thereby to gain the People, and to inſinuate
their Poyſon, the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who are call'd
and deſign'd by Heaven to oppoſe them, ought to
employ their own Weapons againſt them in behalf
of Truth, and not to permit that the Enemies of the
Church ſhould have the advantage of Speaking and
Writing more elegantly then the Defenders of it.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had all theſe Cares upon him,<note place="margin">His Infirmities oblige him to give over Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</note>
and Govern'd his whole Order with ſuch bad
Health, that he was often forc'd to keep his Bed.
And whereas his Strength every day decay'd, and
with the increaſe of the Society, his Buſineſs ſtill
increas'd upon him, he thought it neceſſary to aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
ſome Perſon, to eaſe him of part of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
or rather to Execute his Charge under him;
but he did not judge it expedient to make the
Choice himſelf. He aſſembled all the Fathers who
were in <hi>Rome,</hi> except one or two, who had not yet
ended their Noviceſhip, and declaring to them his
weak Condition, he enjoyn'd them to nominate and
aſſign him ſome Perſon capable to eaſe him of the
weight of the Government.</p>
               <p>After three days of continual Prayers, they all
with one Voice nam'd Father <hi>Jerome Nadal,</hi> who
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:65023:174"/>
was lately come out of <hi>Spain,</hi> whither the General
had ſent him, and who had all the Qualities requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
for ſo important a Charge. Some of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
were of Opinion, that he ſhould have the Title
of Vicar, or Commiſſary-General; but it was his
own Sentiment, to have no Title at all, leſt it ſhould
ſeem to leſſen the Authority of the General; and
his Advice was follow'd.</p>
               <p>The General approv'd the Choice which was
made,<note place="margin">He reſerves to himſelf the care of the Sick.</note> and left the whole Care of Buſineſs to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal;</hi>
he reſerv'd only to himſelf that of the Sick,
out of a charitable tenderneſs, which made him
judge that a Superior was oblig'd in Perſon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the Neceſſities of thoſe who acknowledg'd
him for their Father. So that he made this his whole
Buſineſs, nor is it to be imagin'd how ſenſible he
was of the leaſt Indiſpoſition of his Children. He
ſaid it was by a particular Order of Providence,
that he himſelf had ſo little Health; and that the
ſeveral Diſeaſes to which he was ſubject, gave him a
truer feeling of others Sufferings, and a due Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for all ſick Perſons. Notwithſtanding his
extraordinary Care in providing for them, he never
thought he did enough; and he has been heard to
ſay, That the Charge of the Sick made him trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when he conſider'd what the Obligations are of
a good Superior.</p>
               <p>This tenderneſs extended it ſelf to all that were in
Affliction, or in any ſort of Miſery. A certain
<hi>French</hi> Father having been taken on the Coaſts of
<hi>Sicily</hi> by the Pirates of <hi>Algiers,</hi> upon his return out
of <hi>Spain,</hi> we can hardly expreſs the Concern and
Solicitude of Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his behalf. He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
all his Credit with the Viceroy of <hi>Sicily;</hi>
he writ in his own Hand to the Fathers of <hi>Meſſina</hi>
and of <hi>Palermo,</hi> and charg'd them to ſpare, and to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:65023:175"/>
omit nothing for the deliverance of the Captive;
he charg'd them every Week to give him an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
what Courſe they took, and what Progreſs
they had made in it.</p>
               <p>Tho' his Infirmities,<note place="margin">He Inſtitutes the Prayers of Forty hours, during the three laſt days of <hi>Carnivall.</hi>
                  </note> which together with his
Age increas'd daily upon him, ſuffer'd him not to
manage the Buſineſs of his Order, yet he would have
an Account given him of all remarkable Actions
perform'd in the Service of God, either in <hi>Italy</hi> or
elſewhere. One day he was inform'd, that ſome
young Men of <hi>Macerata</hi> having prepar'd a Comedy,
not very modeſt, for the Diverſion of the <hi>Carnivall,</hi>
the Fathers who were ſent in Miſſion from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Loretto,</hi> had expos'd the Bleſſed Sacrament
in a Chappel magnificently Adorn'd, where Prayers
of forty Hours were made during the three laſt Days
of <hi>Shrovetide;</hi> and that the People, drawn by the
newneſs of the Ceremony, had left the Theatre to
Adore <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> upon the Altar.</p>
               <p>This Devotion ſo pleas'd Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that
he order'd the practice of it to be every year ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in the Houſes of the Society. And to him we
owe the Eſtabliſhment of that ſolemn and ſeaſonable
Devotion, now univerſally practis'd, to withdraw
the Faithful from the Follies and Debaucheries of
the <hi>Carnivall</hi> Days.</p>
               <p>Finding himſelf grown weaker then ordinary,
and it being much in his thoughts, that Obedience
was the Soul and Character of his Order, he caus'd
the Secretary of his Companion to come to him;
and after having told him, that he could not long
hold out, <hi>Write</hi> (ſaid he); <hi>I deſire that the Society
ſhould know my laſt thoughts concerning the Vertue
of Obedience:</hi> And he Dictated to him what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:65023:175"/>
I. WHen I enter into Religion, my firſt Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
muſt be to give my ſelf up entirely
to the Conduct of my Superior.</p>
               <p>II. It were to be wiſh'd, that I might light into
the Hands of a Superior, reſolute and induſtrious in
ſubduing my Judgment.</p>
               <p>III. In all things, where no Sin lies, I muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Judgment of my Superior, and not my
own.</p>
               <p>IV. There are three manners of Obeying. The
Firſt, When we do that which is Commanded us
in vertue of Obedience; and this manner is good.
The Second, which is better, When we obey ſuch
Orders as oblige not under mortal Sin. The Third,
and moſt perfect of all, When, not waiting for the
Superiors Order, yet knowing his Will, we prevent
it by an antecedent Conformity.</p>
               <p>V. I muſt indifferently obey Superiors of every
Degree, without making any diſtinction between
the higheſt and the loweſt; but I muſt equally in all
of them conſider God, whoſe Place they hold, and
remember, that the Authority is deriv'd to the laſt
by gradation from the firſt.</p>
               <p>VI. If the Superior judgeth, that the thing which
he Commandeth me, is good, and I am of a different
Opinion, without Evidence to the contrary, I ought
to obey; but if I find difficulty upon a ſcruple of
Conſcience, I am to conſult two or three intelligent
Perſons about it, and to reſt upon their Judgments:
but if they concur with my Superior, and I ſhould
adhere to my own Opinion, I am very remote from
the Perfection and Excellency required in a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
State.</p>
               <p>VII. In ſhort, I ought not to be at my own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
but at my Creator's and at his under whoſe
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65023:176"/>
Conduct he hath plac'd me. I ought to be in the
Hands of my Superior, as ſoft Wax, which takes
any Form, and to do what he ſhall pleaſe; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
to write Letters, or not to write them; to
ſpeak to a Perſon, or not to ſpeak to him, and the
like.</p>
               <p>VIII. I muſt look upon my ſelf as a dead Body,
which has no motion of it ſelf, or like the Staff in
a Man's Hand, which he takes or leaves as he finds
convenient; ſo that the Order may make uſe of me
in what manner, they ſhall judge me Serviceable.</p>
               <p>IX. I muſt not deſire or my Superior to put me
into ſuch a Place, or to give me ſuch an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
I may notwithſtanding declare to him my
Thought, and my Inclination, provided that I refer
my ſelf wholly to him, and think that to be beſt
which he ſhall Ordain.</p>
               <p>X. This hinders not, but that we may ask things
which are not of Conſequence, as to viſit Churches,
or to do any Devotions for obtaining ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God; but ſtill provided we be equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
whether our Superior grants or refuſes what
we ask.</p>
               <p>XI. Above all, I muſt depend upon my Superior
in what concerns Poverty, having nothing in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
and in the uſe of things, to be as a Statue,
which you may cover or uncover without oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or complaint.</p>
               <p>This is the Will and Teſtament of Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
and the laſt Action he did for the common
good of his Order. His corporal Infirmities did not
hinder him from his continual Mediation upon
Divine Matters; and his Deſire grew every day
more ardent to be looſen'd from the Fetters of his
Body, and more cloſely to be united with God.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:65023:176"/>
Whereas in his Life-time he had deſir'd three things,
That his Society ſhould be Confirm'd by the Popes,
That the Book of Spiritual Exerciſes might be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
by the Holy See, and That his Conſtitutions
might be publiſh'd among his Children in all Parts
of the World: He ſaid, all this being done, he had
nothing more to do, or to deſire in this World; that
he now was unprofitable, and ought to think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Heaven. In ſuch Meditations as theſe he
ſpent his Days and his Nights, longing and ſighing
for the ſight of God; and in his Prayers ſo violent
were his Affections, that they did not a little increaſe
the Weakneſs of his Body.</p>
               <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">He diſpoſes himſelf to die.</note> his Grief to ſee a War kindled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Catholick</hi> King and the Pope, did not a
little contribute to ſhorten his Life. To lament in
quiet this new Calamity of the Church, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to diſpoſe himſelf for Death now coming on, he
had a mind to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> where nothing was to be
heard but the noiſe of Arms, and to retire himſelf to
the <hi>Villa</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge, which he had built
the year before. But the ancient Fathers repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, that a new Building might be unwholſom
for him, and that removing in the great Heats of the
the Month of <hi>July,</hi> would be dangerous; he caus'd
the Phyſicians to be conſulted about the Matter, that
he might not ſeem to neglect the Counſel given
him, and a due care of his Health: for as great, as
his deſire was to die, and as certain, as he was of his
approaching Death, he always obſerv'd his ordinary
Train and Way of Living, being a great Enemy of
Singularity, and a lover of Conformity even to his
laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander Petronius,</hi> the moſt famous Phyſician
of <hi>Rome,</hi> gave him leave to go to the Country
Houſe, after having firſt been himſelf upon the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65023:177"/>
Place, to view the Situation and Condition of it.
But the Father had not been there many days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
finding a ſenſible change to the worſe; ſo that
he was brought back again to the Town: and yet
the Phyſician was not of Opinion that his Sickneſs
was mortal, but that it was only a weakneſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
without any bad Symptom, and almoſt without
any Fever. Inſomuch that no body was much
alarm'd at it; and among the many that were ſick
in the <hi>Caſa Profeſſa,</hi> the General was thought to be
the leaſt in danger of Death.</p>
               <p>Some there were, who hearing him ſpeak of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ventur'd to tell him that his Fears were ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
He went not about to undeceive them, but
following his own inſight, and ſilently leaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the diſpoſal of Heaven, he went to Confeſſion,
and receiv'd the Bleſſed Sacrament, as having Death
before his Eyes. Two days after in the Evening he
call'd for his Secretary Father <hi>Polancus,</hi> and cauſing
the reſt to void the Chamber, <hi>My Hour is come</hi>
(ſaid he), <hi>go and beg of the Pope his Benediction for
me, and an Indulgence for my Sins, that my Soul
may have more aſſurance in the dreadful Paſſage.
And tell his Holineſs, if I go into a Place where my
Prayers may avail him, as through Gods Mercy I
hope I ſhall, I will not fail to pray for him, as I have
always done, even when I had moſt need to pray for
my ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how, my dear Father! (<hi>reply'd</hi> Polancus)
are we in any danger of loſing you ſo ſoon? the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
do not judge that you are in danger, and I
hope God will yet preſerve you for his Service. Go,
(<hi>reply'd the ſick Man),</hi> and ask the Pope's Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
alſo for another Father. Polancus <hi>believ'd that
this Father was</hi> Laynez, <hi>who had receiv'd the laſt
Sacraments; but the Event ſhew'd it to be F.</hi> Olavius</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:65023:177"/>
                  <hi>Polancus</hi> was in great trouble what to do. He
could not take Advice, not daring to publiſh what
Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> had told him in ſecret, nor could he
believe him in ſo much danger; for his Strength
ſeem'd to be increas'd, and every body thought the
worſt was paſt. On the other ſide, his Order to go to
the Pope was poſitive, and reiterated. In this Anxiety
he reſolv'd to go back to Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and to ask
him whether he might not defer going to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
till the Morrow. <hi>Do what you will,</hi> reply'd the
Father, fearing, perhaps, leſt he ſhould have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a third Order to a certain Revelation. <hi>Polancus,</hi>
who had Letters to write into <hi>Spain</hi> that Night, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Father's Anſwer, put off the performing his
Commiſſion to the Day following, and the rather,
becauſe the Phyſicians who Viſited him that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſaid as formerly, that there was no danger.</p>
               <p>Two or three of the principal Fathers ſtay'd with
him till it was very late before they parted; they
Diſcours'd with him about a Buſineſs relating to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Colledge, and he told them his Judgment in
it with his uſual preſence of Mind.</p>
               <p>He paſs'd that Night alone, his Communication
being only with God; and when they came in the
Morning to ſee in what Condition he was, they found
him in his Agony. The Fathers came all about him
full of Grief and Surpriſe. <hi>Polancus</hi> went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to the Pope, condemning himſelf for having
not gone ſooner. His Holineſs granted all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
with great Demonſtrations of Good-will, and
of Grief. In the mean time they preſs'd Father <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
to take ſomething, in hope that it might be
only ſome faint Fit upon him; but he told them in
a dying Voice, that there was no more occaſion for
it: and with his Hands joyn'd, and his Eyes lifted
up to Heaven, pronouncing the Name of <hi>JESUS,</hi>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:65023:178"/>
he quietly Expir'd an hour after Sun-riſing. It was
upon a <hi>Friday</hi> the laſt of <hi>July,</hi> in the Year 1556.</p>
               <p>He was Sixty five years old. He dy'd Thirty
five years after his Converſion, and Sixteen after
the Society was Founded. He ſaw it before his
Death, ſpread over the whole World, and divided
into twelve Provinces, which altogether contain'd
above a hundred Colledges. He had the happineſs
to ſee it Crown'd with Martyrdom in the Perſons of
Father <hi>Antonio Criminale,</hi> and of the Lay-Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>Peter Correa,</hi> and <hi>John de Soſa,</hi> who were all
three put to death for Religion by the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was of a middle Stature, rather low then tall;
of a brown Complexion, Bald-headed, his Eyes deep
ſet and full of Fire, his Forehead large, and his
Noſe aquiline; all Signs of Wiſdom, according to
the Phyſiognomiſts. He halted a little, by reaſon of
the Wound he receiv'd at the Siege of <hi>Pampelona,</hi>
but he ſo manag'd himſelf in walking, that it was
hardly perceiv'd. His natural Temper was ardent
and ſpritely in the higheſt degree; and yet the
Phyſicians judg'd him to be of a Phlegmatick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
for he had labor'd ſo long to overcome
himſelf, that he had quite ſuppreſs'd all the Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Motions of his Nature. In concluſion,
in his Perſon there was an Ayre ſo grave and ſo
winning, ſo noble and ſo modeſt, all together, that
who only look'd upon him, muſt judge him to be a
great Man, and a Saint.</p>

               <p>Inſtead of obtaining what he ask'd, he recover'd

ſo increaſe in the World, in the mid'ſt of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions,
and every where to bring forth ſuch good
Fruits; he us'd to ſay, that Chriſt was ſo in love
with the Soul of his Servant <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that he could
deny him nothing. He was alſo wont to ſay, that
Father <hi>Faber,</hi> a Man of great Spirit and Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was but a Novice, and a mear Child in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of <hi>Ignatius. Faber</hi> himſelf was much more of

to him the ſtate of his Soul, as to his Spiritual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
he had recourſe to him to be reſolv'd in all
his doubts, and he propos'd him to all the World,
as a Model of Chriſtian perfection.</p>
               <p>His other firſt Companions had no leſs veneration

the admirors of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſeems to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the firſt place. His common way of writing
to him was upon his Knees, he call'd him the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Soul, and one of his Letters he thus ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcib'd;
<hi>To my Father in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>St.</hi> Ignatius.

All his diſcourſe of him was in the ſame ſtyle; and
with his Companions of the Miſſion in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
the ſanctity of <hi>Ignatius</hi> was the uſual Theme of his
Converſation: So that, whenever he did ingage
them in any enterprize of difficulty, he excited them
to it by the love, and reverence, which they ow'd
to their Father <hi>Ignatius.</hi> In all his dangers by Sea
and by Land, he implor'd the ſuccor of Heaven by
the Merits of the holy Man <hi>Ignatius;</hi> and in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquary,
which he always carry'd about him, he
put the Signature of one of his Letters, together
with a Relique of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Apoſtle of the

My very Reverend, and Religious Brethren in <hi>Jeſus

Holy Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> has caus'd in me more joy or
ſadneſs. For on one ſide, if I conſider, that God
hath releaſt him out of this miſerable World, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
his Labours, it would be a kind of Impiety,
for our own intereſt, to grieve at his happineſs: On
the other ſide, we have great cauſe to be afflicted,
ſeeing our ſelves become Orphans, by the loſs of ſuch
a Father, who was a Refuge to us, and a ſafe Harbuor
in all our Diſtreſſes. But in regard, that tranſitory
things muſt not enter into Competition with Eternal,
we comfort our ſelves by your Example, upon our aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that this happy Soul is at this time our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

Don John de Vega, <hi>Viceroy of</hi> Sicily, <hi>expres'd
his Sentiments in the Language of a Soldier.</hi> The
Servant of God (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) has left behind him Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
of his Vertue, which time will never deſtroy,
as it has deſtroy'd the proudeſt Monuments of Human
Vanity. Me thinks, I have before my Eyes the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
with which a great and holy Captain is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
into Heaven, loaded with the ſpoils of Hell,
who has gain'd ſo many ſignal Victories upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Mankind, in reducing to the Chriſtian Faith,
by his Conduct, and the Valor of his Soldiers, ſo many
Barbarous Nations, who before knew not the Name
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It alſo appears to me, that upon a
juſt account, his Standard may be rais'd in Heaven,
with thoſe of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and of
the other Saints, to whom God has given the ſtrength
to overcome the World, and to ſave a great number
of Souls.</p>
               <p>I muſt not omit the Letter, which the Regular
Clericks of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Barnabites,</hi>
writ from <hi>Milan</hi> to Father <hi>Laynez,</hi> Vicar of the
Society; And I think it worth the while to ſet it
down, as it lies, faithfully Tranſlated out of the

               <p>The news of the Deceaſe of Venerable Father <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
of happy memory, has caus'd great ſorrow in
us, both upon your account, and of all the holy Society
of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who have loſt ſuch a Maſter, and ſuch a
Father, and upon our own, who alſo have always
look'd upon him as our Father.</p>
               <p>There is certainly great reaſon for us to be afflicted,
to have him taken from us in a time, when good Men
are ſo ſcarce; but his happineſs ought to out ballance
with us our own loſs. For <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the life of

brings them to their happineſs, of being with <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65023:181"/>
Chriſt,</hi> when they are looſn'd from the Fetters of the
Body: Thus did this holy Soul, going out of Priſon,
together with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> upon the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
take its place in Heaven. We only ought to fear,
leaſt our Sins may have been the cauſe of our loſing
him; and leaſt his death, in our regard, may have
been a puniſhment from God, like that of King <hi>Joſias,</hi>
who was taken out of the World, before the wrath
of Heaven broke out upon the Jewiſh people.</p>
               <p>However it were, ſuch was the Will of God, and
may his holy Name be prais'd: At leaſt he is not
wholly loſt to us. This bleſſed Man, who has done ſo
great ſervice to Chriſtendom, will always live in the
memory of the Faithful, and his Name will be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in all the parts of the Earth, where the Name
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is known. It was under the Conduct
of this Governor, that the Chriſtian Faith was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
even to the <hi>Antipodes;</hi> and that in thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Climates are at this time to be ſeen thouſands
of Souls Converted, and a new Church, every way
reſembling the Antient, Erected of new Apoſtles, and
of new Martyrs.</p>
               <p>He has ſent his Children before him; and after
having himſelf taken great pains in the Service of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he follows them, worn out and conſum'd
like them, with Labour and Fatigue, oppreſt with
the care of ſo many Churches, and to conclude a
Martyr in Peace. He has been for ſeveral Years the
ſupport of your Family, and of many others; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a common Father of all good People. What ſad
Hearts has he not reliev'd by his Diſcourſes, full of
Sweetneſs and Charity? To whom has he not given
profitable Counſel in difficult matters, and Relief in
greateſt neceſſities? He has been the Foot of the Lame,
the Eye of the Blind, the Refuge of the Poor, and the
Comfort of the ſorrowful.</p>
               <p>

May Heaven reward him for all his good Works!
On our parts, we ceaſe not to offer to God the holy
Sacrifice of the Altar for ſo holy a Soul, which as
we verily believe, at this preſent enjoys the Beatifick
ſight of God. Let others ſtrew Flowers upon his Tomb,

At leaſt, in paying him theſe laſt duties, now
that he is deliver'd from the miſeries of corrupt

               <p>They were not only ſome particular Perſons, or
ſome Societies who beheld Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> after his
Death,<note place="margin">He is reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd by the People as a Saint.</note> as a Saint; In many Nations the People
had ſo great an opinion of his Sanctity, that they
implor'd his ſuccour for obtaining Favours from
Heaven. This was principally done in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
the Honor given to his memory, was ſpred into
the places Inhabited by him in his Life. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of <hi>Loyola</hi> grew venerable to the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and the Chamber where in his Sickneſs he was
Converted, was reverenc'd by all <hi>Spain,</hi> as a kind of
Sanctuary: Thoſe who Lodg'd in it, felt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a horror of Sin, and their Hearts turn'd to
Vertue. Nevertheleſs, it once happen'd, that a certain
Gentleman, was came to viſit the Lord of <hi>Loyola,</hi>
and was Lodg'd in the Chamber of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
unchaſt thoughts in his mind: But at the
ſame inſtant, the whole Houſe was ſhaken with a
terrible Earthquake. as if Heaven could not endure
Impurity in a place, where <hi>Ignatius</hi> had receiv'd
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:65023:182"/>
Viſits from the Holy Virgin, and had for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
the pleaſures of the ſenſes.</p>
               <p>The Hoſpital of <hi>Manreza,</hi> where he began his
penitent Life, and the Cave where he us'd his Body
with ſo much rigor, became alſo places of publick
Veneration. The People were led thither by their
Devotion, and uſually kiſs'd the Ground, which
had been water'd with the Tears, and ſprinkl'd with
the Blood of ſo Holy a Man. Before the Hoſpital
was erected a <hi>Pyramid</hi> in his Honor, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
which contain'd a Summary of his Life.
The little Chamber, where he had the Extaſie of
eight Days, was turn'd into a Chappel. The Cave
was adorn'd, as much as the horror of the place
would permit, and the chiefeſt Ornament of the
place, was a great Picture, in which was repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Saints manner of living in that Grotte. He
was drawn in his Sackcloth, girt with an Iron Chain,
his Countenance pale and lean, his Feet bare, and
upon his Knees, before the bleſſed Virgin, holding
in her Arms her Child <hi>Jeſus.</hi> He had his Eyes fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, and his Arm was ſet in a poſture of writing,
as if <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were dictating to him the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Exerciſes. In the bottom of the Piece were
theſe words: <hi>In the Year</hi> 1522, Ignatius <hi>in this

towards the Servant of God: But the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Prediction to <hi>Paſcal</hi>
himſelf, was very wonderful.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Ignatius</hi> left <hi>Barcelona,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The prediction, and apparition of St. <hi>Ignatius.</hi>

the Saint told him that God would have him remain

you likewiſe ſhall have many afflictions, and
ſhall die very poor; but comfort your ſelf, for your
afflictions ſhall be the means of ſaving your Soul.</hi> The
event verifi'd the Prediction: For <hi>Paſcal</hi> did Marry
a Perſon of great Vertue, and had three Sons and
four Daughters. But his eldeſt Son was born deaf
and dumb, his ſecond Son became diſtracted, and
the third, who was a great Libertine, dy'd ſuddenly.
Of his four Daughthers, he was able to Marry
but one, and at laſt he was reduc'd to beg Alms.
Theſe great misfortunes however did not diſhearten
him. <hi>This is</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>what the holy Man</hi> Ignatius
<hi>foretold me:</hi> And when his Friends would have
made him hope for better Fortune; <hi>the Prophecy of

                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who before his Death, often comforted
<hi>Paſcal</hi> with his Letters, did not forget him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
He once appear'd to him at four a Clock in
the Morning after this manner. <hi>Paſcal</hi> had a cuſtom
for many Years of hearing Matines every Day in the
great Church, near the Tomb of St. <hi>Eulalia,</hi> which
joyns to the Altar. Being come one Morning too
ſoon, he Pray'd by himſelf, in expectation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines;
and his extream neceſſity put him upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
the ſuccour of Heaven, by his mediation,
who had foretold it to him, and of whoſe Death he
had been lately inform'd. <hi>Father</hi> (he cry'd, ſighing
and weeping) <hi>your Predictions are but too true; and
now you behold from Heaven, what was beforehand

               <p>He had ſcarce ended theſe words, when he heard a
Melodious noiſe, and ſaw a beautiful train of young
Clergy men, who rang'd themſelves on each ſide
of the Altar, to make place for a Venerable Perſon,
who follow'd them in his Prieſtly Attire, all ſhining
in Glory. This Prieſt of Figure more then Human,
ſtopt at the Tomb of St. <hi>Eulalia,</hi> and bowing to
the ground before the bleſſed Sacrament, took a
Cenſor from the hand of one of the Aſſiſtants, and
ſeveral times Incens'd the Altar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paſcal</hi> aſtoniſh'd at the ſight, and doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Eyes might not deceive him, remain'd
ſometime without motion: But looking attentively
upon the Prieſt, he found him to be <hi>Ignatius. Ah
Father,</hi> he cry'd, <hi>Ah my Father</hi> Ignatius! The
Saint comforted <hi>Paſcal,</hi> by giving him freſh hopes
of his Salvation, and then diſappear'd, with the
bleſſed Spirits that attended him.</p>
               <p>The Canons, when they came into the Church
to Sing Matines, found <hi>Paſcal</hi> out of himſelf, ſeiz'd
with admiration, fear and joy all at once: He then
told them, what he had ſeen, and he ever after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
ſo lively an Idea of it, that in all his diſtreſſes,
it never fail'd to give him preſent comfort.</p>

He every where made Publick the favour from
Heaven, which he had receiv'd by the interceſſion
of his Father <hi>Ignatius;</hi> and this Teſtimony was the
more conſiderable, becauſe he was a Man not at

               <p>Tho' in the following Years, the Opinion of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>

Saint. In the Year 1589, Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who
was the ſecond of the Society, whom <hi>Clement</hi> the
Eighth oblig'd by ſpecial Command to receive the
Hat, deſir'd to make this Speech. Tho' the Ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
was only for the Jeſuits, Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi>
would needs make one of the company, to Honor
the memory of a Man whom his Father <hi>Philips Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
had eſteem'd a Saint. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> prov'd in his
<hi>Harangue</hi> that the Illuſtrious Perſon Deceas'd, had
all requiſites for being Canoniz'd among the Saints.
<hi>Baronius</hi> toucht, and convinc't with <hi>Bellarmins</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
made a long Prayer upon the Tomb of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
and many times kiſs'd the Ground, which
cover'd his Body: then ſuddenly riſing up, and
turning towards the Fathers, <hi>I came with a reſolution,</hi>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:65023:184"/>
ſaid he, <hi>to hearken and not to ſpeak, but the words of
Cardinal</hi> Bellarmin <hi>have been to me, as the ſtream
of a River to the wheel of a Mill: Tho' cumberſom
and heavy of my ſelf they have put me into motion.</hi>
He went on like a Man inſpir'd, and enlarg'd upon
all that Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> had ſaid before. After
which, he reprov'd the Fathers, for not having yet
ſet up the Picture of their holy Founder over his
Tomb; and cauſing it to be immediately brought
to him, he ſet it up with his own hands, and kneel'd
before it with great Devotion, all the Company
following his Example with Tears of joy, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was it known in <hi>Rome,</hi> what Cardinal
<hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> had done, but the People
no longer doubted to give a Religious Veneration
to Holy <hi>Ignatius;</hi> which was Authoriz'd, not only
by the Example of two the moſt Exemplary, and
Learned Cardinals of the Sacred Colledge, but alſo
by a great number of Miraculous Cures in all
parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth,<note place="margin">The Pope or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be taken of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his life.</note> mov'd by the reports of Father
<hi>Ignatius</hi> his Holineſs, found within himſelf a ſtrong
impulſe to have him honor'd as a Saint among all the
Faithful. To proceed in it according to the Rules
of the Church, he began the buſineſs by cauſing
juridical Informations to be taken of the Life, and
Actions of the Servant of God. Wherefore in the
Year 1605, which was the firſt of that Popes Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate,
an exact enquiry was made of the Vertues,
that were moſt eminent in the Perſon of <hi>Ignatius;</hi>
and the account given by witneſſes of known credit
was as follows.</p>
               <p>He was ſo recollected in his Prayers,<note place="margin">His gift of Prayer.</note> as if God
were viſibly preſent before him, and that he ſpoke
to his Divine Majeſty, like <hi>Moſes,</hi> face to face. At
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65023:185"/>
the beginning of his Prayer his Countenance was
inflam'd, and commonly in the heat of his Devotion
he had very violent Palpitations of the Heart, and
not unfrequent Raptures. For his manner of Prayer
it much reſembl'd that of the Divine <hi>Hierotheus</hi>
Maſter of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> which by the Relation of St. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
himſelf, conſiſted in paſſively receiving the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of the Divine Spirit. And one day he
told Father <hi>Laynez</hi> who askt him about it, that
God Acted in him much more then he Acted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>All Objects ſpoke to him of his Creator: He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
his beauty, his wiſdom, his power, in the leaſt
things; a Worm, a Flower, a blade of Graſs, were any
of them ſufficient to put him into Contemplation. But
nothing rais'd him more to God then looking up to
Heaven, which he ſo frequently did, that ſome
who did not know his name, us'd to call him the
Man that ſtill lifts up his Eyes to Heaven, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſpeaks of God.</p>
               <p>Being General of the Society, it was his Cuſtom
to go up into the Leads of the Houſe where he had
a free proſpect of Heaven. There he remain'd
ſome while ſtanding with his Eyes ſixt on Heaven;
then he fell upon his Knees and ador'd God with
all poſſible reverence, next he ſat down upon a
little ſeat, becauſe his weakneſs did not ſuffer him
long to remain otherwiſe, and there he ſpent whole
hours in great repoſe, his Head bare, his Face all
in Tears, and his Soul abſorpt in God.</p>
               <p>Not content to paſs the Day in this Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
he divided the Night into three parts, one
was for Sleep, another for Buſineſs, and the chiefeſt
for Prayer. When he was firſt made Prieſt, Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and Tears came ſo thick upon him in reciting
the Divine Office, that he was forc't to make a pauſe
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65023:185"/>
at every Verſe: but when he ſaid Maſs, he had ſuch
Lights and Affections as made him ſigh and weep
at every Word.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> ſaying Maſs in the Church of
St. <hi>John Lateran,</hi> he was ſeis'd with ſuch tender
Devotion, that he fell into a holy Paſſion of Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the middle of the Sacred Myſteries; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that a Stander by who did not know him, told
<hi>Francis Strada,</hi> who ſerv'd Maſs, <hi>Certainly you
have a very wicked Prieſt there, ſadly tormented in
his Conſcience; for all Maſs-time he did nothing but
weep for his Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe continual Tears did in time ſo exhauſt
him and diſſipate his Spirits, that he grew very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
and was in danger of loſing his Sight. Being
admoniſh'd by the Phyſicians of the bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of them to his Health, he pray'd to God
that their courſe might be ſtopt, or at leaſt that he
might be maſter of them. He obtain'd what he
ask'd, and got ſo abſolute a command over his Tears,
that he could keep them back, or let them flow at
his pleaſure; but with this advantage, that when
they were kept in, he felt in his Soul an Inundation
of ſpiritual Delights.</p>
               <p>The better to know what his Communications
were with God, it will not be amiſs to hear him
ſpeak himſelf in a Paper which contains his interior
Diſpoſitions of four Months, where he ſets down
day by day, what paſs'd in his Soul; which Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
had the fortune to ſcape the Fire, when he
caus'd all other Papers of that nature to be burnt.</p>
               <p>The Tears which I that day did ſhed, ſeem'd very
different from thoſe which formerly came from me:
They dropt ſoftly, without noiſe or agitation; they
iſſu'd out of ſo deep a Source, as I know not how to
expreſs. Every thing excited me to the love of God,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65023:186"/>
as well the interior Voice, as what I heard abroad:
but theſe divine Words had an unexpreſſible harmony,
which penetrated the bottom of my Heart. The next
Morning in time of Maſs, and alſo after Maſs, great
ſtore of Tears, as the day before. I then taſted a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
joy, produc'd by the interior Voice; and this
Voice was ſo melodious, that it ſeem'd to me the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
of Heaven. In proportion to my Tears, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of Devotion increas'd in me, and I ſeem'd to know
and to underſtand in a manner altogether incorporeal.</p>
               <p>Invocating the holy Virgin to Mediate for me to
her Son and to the Eternal Father, and then addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
my ſelf to the Son of God to joyn with his holy
Mother their Interceſſions for me to God the Father,
I ſaw my ſelf elevated in the Preſence of the Firſt
Perſon of the Trinity, and all my Hair ſtood an end.
I began my Prayer with a large profuſion of Tears,
a vehement Devotion, and many Illuminations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the moſt bleſſed Trinity. So frequent and
ſweet were theſe Illuſtrations, that I want Memory
and Underſtanding to relate them.</p>
               <p>I was ſo overflow'd with divine Lights, with ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
Viſits, with ſpiritual Delectations, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with continual Tears, that as often as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
the Name of God, or of Saviour, I found my
ſelf ſtruck with ſo profound a Submiſſion as cannot be
expreſs'd.</p>
               <p>After Prayer, my interior Motions were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
producing outwardly innumerable Sighs and
Tears: My Heart was inflam'd with the love of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and with the deſire of dying with Him,
rather then to live with all the World beſides.</p>
               <p>When the Altar was prepar'd for the holy Sacrifice
of Maſs, having <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> before my Eyes, I
found my ſelf ardently inclin'd to follow him, and
looking upon him under the notion of Head of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65023:186"/>
I was by that Motive more powerfully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
then by all other Reaſons, inviolably to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
Evangelical Poverty. Calling then to mind the
time when the Eternal Father gave me to his Son,
and when the Name of JESUS was printed ſo
deeply in me, I fell into a new Fit of Sighing and
Weeping.</p>
               <p>Speaking to the Divine Majeſty, a torrent of Tears
flow'd from my Eyes, and the flames of my Love
ſeem'd to have no bounds or limits, and even to be
joyn'd and united with the Divine Love it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Being at the Altar, I had more tender Sentiments
of Devotion, and I wept ſo much, that I was in fear
of loſing one of my Eyes, if that courſe of Tears had
continu'd. At thoſe Words of the Maſs, <hi>Placeat tibi
ſancta Trinitas,</hi> there came upon me a deluge of
Tears, with an extraordinary ardency of Love. All
theſe Aſpirations terminated in the moſt Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which led me, and drew me to the love of it.</p>
               <p>Addreſſing my ſelf to the Holy Ghoſt, that I might
be rightly diſpos'd to ſay the Maſs, Inſtituted by the
Church in his Honor, it ſeem'd to me that I heard
him, and ſaw him in a viſible Light, under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and colour of a bright Flame.</p>
               <p>I clearly knew, that the holy Virgin did Mediate
for me to the Eternal Father. I likewiſe ſaw at the
time of Conſecration, that the Grace which I had,
came by her Interceſſion, and that her Fleſh was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically
contain'd in that of her Son.</p>
               <p>I had in time of Prayer, from the beginning to the
end, great Sentiments of God. In the Church, out of
the Houſe, it ſeem'd to me that I beheld our Country
above, and the Lord of Heaven, by the intelligence I
had of the three Perſons of the Trinity.</p>
               <p>Entring into the Chappel to pray, I receiv'd a light
and a power from above, which enabl'd me to know,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65023:187"/>
or rather in a manner to ſee the moſt bleſſed Trinity.
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was ſhewn to me at the ſame inſtant,
to have obtain'd for me from the Trinity this intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Viſion.</p>
               <p>I had great Devotion in preparing my ſelf for the
Sacrifice of the Maſs, upon the conſideration, that to
approach the holy Altar I ought to be as an Angel;
and this Sentiment brought Tears into my Eyes,
which were not of Grief, but of Joy. During Maſs,
I made many Pauſes, and upon the ſudden I was ſo
enlightned concerning the Myſtery of the Trinity,
that I thought I could not have acquir'd ſo much
Knowledge by a long Study.</p>
               <p>Another time in Prayer I felt ſo lively and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Devotion with ſuch ſpiritual Delectation, as
rais'd me beyond, and above my Senſes. After this,
at Maſs more Tears then before came upon me, even
to the loſs of my Speech. In this while I had Lights
in ſo great number, and of ſuch a nature, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
there was nothing more for me to learn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the moſt holy Trinity.</p>
               <p>Celebrating the Divine Myſteries with a great
deal of Fervor, it ſeem'd to me, that when I Pray'd
to the Eternal Father, <hi>Jeſus</hi> Preſented to him my
Prayers, and accompany'd them with his own: I
had then a Feeling, and a View which cannot be
expreſt.</p>
               <p>By the Fire-ſide I had again a Viſion of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and
once more without-doors in the Streets, as I went to
Cardinal <hi>de Carpi,</hi> and alſo as I came back from him,
and in divers other Places. During theſe Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I had many interior Motions, and the ſight of
<hi>Jeſus</hi> did ſo inflame me, that I thought nothing could
ſeparate me from him.</p>
               <p>This is part of what was contain'd in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Memoire, writ by the Hand of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> Whence
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65023:187"/>
may be ſeen how far that holy Man was advanc'd
in all the Ways of an interior Life, and to what
pitch he was arriv'd of Union with God.</p>
               <p>Accordingly he lov'd him ſo ardently,<note place="margin">His Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</note> and with
ſo filial an Affection, that he propos'd to himſelf in
all his Actions no other Motive whatſoever, but the
Honor of his Divine Majeſty. He took for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
<hi>To the greater Glory of God;</hi> not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
only to glorifie our Lord, but to do it in the
moſt excellent and perfect manner that Man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of, with the aſſiſtance of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Entertaining himſelf one day with Father</hi> Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez,
<hi>in the Company of</hi> Andrew Oviedo <hi>and</hi> Peter
Ribadeneira, What would you you do (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) if
God ſhould tell you, in caſe you would be content to
die inſtantly, I will give you eternal Glory? but if
you will ſtill live, I give you no aſſurance of your
Salvation; but I will judge you according to the
ſtate you ſhall be in at the hour of your death. If (<hi>I
ſay</hi>) our Lord ſhould make this Promiſe to you, and
at the ſame time you ſhould believe, that remaining
longer in the World, you might do ſome Service to his
Divine Majeſty, what would you chuſe? I confeſs,
Father, (<hi>reply'd</hi> Laynez) that I ſhould chuſe, without
demurring, to be ſecure of my Salvation. I ſhould not
do ſo (<hi>reply'd the Saint);</hi> and if I thought that I
could in any thing advance the Glory of God, I ſhould
intreat him to let me live; becauſe it appears to me,
that I ſhould not hazard much in ſo doing. If a
King ſhould offer a great Recompence to one of his
Subjects, and this Subject ſhould not take it, upon
the account only of being more at liberty to ſerve his
Prince; would not the Prince hold himſelf oblig'd to
keep in ſtore for him, and even to increaſe the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
which for the ſake of his Service only was not
accepted? But if the Great-ones of the Earth, who
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65023:188"/>
are not over-inclin'd to be Grateful, would proceed
in that manner, what may we not hope from the
King of Kings, who always prevents us with his
Grace, and of whom we hold what we have, and
what we are. How can we fear being unhappy and
reprobate, for having ſacrific'd our Intereſts to the
Glory of our Maſter? Let others think what they
pleaſe, no ſuch thing will enter into my thoughts of a
God ſo good, ſo faithful, and ſo magnificent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he writ the Conſtitutions of his Order, it
came into his mind what his Sentiments would be,
if God ſhould put him into Hell for his Sins; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he writ theſe following Words.</hi> On one ſide,
I ſet before my Eyes the Torments I ſhould endure;
On the other, the Blaſphemies of the Damned: and
it ſeem'd to me that the Pains I ſhould endure, would
not be ſo grievous to me, by many degrees, as the
Blaſphemies I ſhould hear againſt the holy Name of
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was his uſual Saying,</hi> What ſhall I deſire, or
what can I deſire, beſides you my God? <hi>He always
ended his Catechiſms with theſe Words,</hi> Love God
with all your heart, with all your ſoul, and with all
your might. <hi>He many times in the day repeated the
fervent Prayer which he compos'd when he wrote
the Book of the Spiritual Exerciſes.</hi> Receive, O
Lord, all my Liberty, my Memory, my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and my whole Will. You have given me all that
I have, all that I poſſeſs; and I give back, and I ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
all to your Divine Will, that you may abſolutely
diſpoſe of all. Give me only your Love, and your
Grace, and I am rich enough: I have nothing more
to ask.</p>
               <p>He ſighed, and long'd Night and Day, for the
ſight of his Saviour; and for this end was deſirous
to be looſned from the Bands of Fleſh: So that as
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65023:188"/>
often as he thought of Death, he wept for joy,
eſteeming it better for him, according to the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to live with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but his
principal End was not his own Happineſs, it was to
ſee the Sacred Humanity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in Glory,
in the ſame manner as we deſire to ſee that Perſon
promoted in Dignity, whom we tenderly love.</p>
               <p>He ſo much eſteem'd Contumely ſuffer'd for
Gods ſake, that the Chains with which in <hi>Spain</hi> he
was loaded, he ſaid, were dearer to him then all the
Crowns of the Earth would be; and that nothing
could give him greater joy, then what he felt in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been a Priſoner for the ſake of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas he had continually before his Eyes
what the Son of God ſuffer'd for the love of Man,
he imagin'd he did not love him, unleſs he alſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
ſomething for his ſake; and it was his deſire
to give Life for Life, and to requite him with a
painful and opprobrious Death.</p>
               <p>He once pray'd to our Lord not to give him any
inward Conſolations, to the end that his Love might
be more pure and diſintereſſed. Another time he
earneſtly begg'd of God to beſtow upon him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Reverence for the holy Myſteries, but that
this Reverence might be of Love, and not of Fear.
<hi>Give me, Lord,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>a tender Veneration, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and Humility, ſpringing from Love.</hi> And
when he pronounc'd theſe Words, his Soul was fill'd
with Delight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meeting a Lay-Brother, who did his Office neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,</hi>
Brother, (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) that which you do, for
whom do you it? <hi>The Brother anſwer'd, That he
did it for the Love of God.</hi> Certainly (<hi>reply'd the
Saint</hi>) if you do it for the Love of God, you are highly
to blame, and deſerve an extraordinary Pennance.
The Sin is not great, to be a little ſlack in Serving
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:65023:189"/>
Men; but to Serve God negligently, is intolerable.</p>
               <p>Whereas he lov'd and ſought nothing but God,
he had no care but to pleaſe him, and no fear but
to offend him. Wherefore he was in a continual
watchfulneſs over himſelf; he every hour of the
day Examin'd all the motions of his Heart, and kept
his Senſes ſo recollected, that from his Converſion
to his Death he never look'd a Woman in the Face,
tho' by the Duty of his Function he was often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to ſpeak and treat with them.</p>
               <p>For from the firſt years of his Renovation of Life,<note place="margin">His Charity towards his Neighbour.</note>
he employ'd himſelf wholly in the Service of his
Neighbour; all his Actions and Deſigns had no other
tendency. To relieve the Poor, to ſerve the Sick,
to inſtruct the Ignorant, to comfort the Afflicted,
to do good to all the World, was properly the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He had always care, not only not to return Evil
for Evil, but, according to the Counſel of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi>
To overcome evil with good. <hi>In the Year 1546,
a</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Religious Man, who was at</hi> Rome, <hi>and
had formerly ſhewn much Kindneſs to Father</hi> Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius
<hi>and his Children, alter'd all on the ſudden,
and declar'd highly againſt him, ſo far as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
That all the Jeſuits in</hi> Spain, <hi>from</hi> Perpignan
<hi>to</hi> Sevil, <hi>deſerv'd the Fagot, and that he would
procure them to have their Deſerts. The General
of the Society, to whom this Religious Man had
ſent an Expreſs with the Meſſage, receiv'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
in a moſt Chriſtian manner, and afterwards
writ to the Bringer of the Meſſage in theſe Terms.</hi>
Pray tell the good Father, that whereas he has a
deſire to have all the Jeſuits burnt, from <hi>Perpignan</hi>
to <hi>Sevil,</hi> it is my deſire, that he and all his Friends,
not only between <hi>Perpignan</hi> and <hi>Sevil,</hi> but all the
World over, may burn with the Flames of Divine
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65023:189"/>
You may alſo tell him, if you pleaſe, that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope's Vicar, have our Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
before them, and that if he hath any thing to
ſay againſt me, he ſhould make his Depoſitions before
thoſe Judges, to the end that if I be guilty, I alone
may ſuffer the Puniſhment of my Crimes, and that
the Innocent may not be involv'd in my Guilt.</p>
               <p>A certain Father of the Society, unſatisfi'd with
Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> did one day expreſs his Reſentment,
and tranſgreſs'd the bounds not of Obedience only,
but of Reaſon. The Saint fell to Prayer for the
poor Man, and with Tears in his Eyes, ſpoke thus
to God. <hi>Pardon him, O Lord! my Creator, pardon
him! for he knows not what he does.</hi> God at the
ſame time anſwer'd the Saint, as once he did <hi>Moſes,
Leave it to me, I will revenge.</hi> And it after hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
that this Father going to ſee ſome Reliques in
a Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> did behold, or ſo thought, the
Figure of a terrible Man, who had a Scourge in his
Hand, and threatned to Chaſtiſe him, if he did not
obey <hi>Ignatius.</hi> This Viſion brought him back to his
Duty: But tho' he became thereupon very tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he ceas'd not, during his whole Life, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
tormented.</p>
               <p>To maintain Peace with his Neighbor, <hi>Ignatius</hi>
did always yield up his Right, as far as Conſcience
would give him leave; and he ſaid, that ſuch a
Proceeding was not only fair, but advantagious:
for God never fail'd to requite thoſe whom Charity
induc'd to depart from their Right. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
the Refectory of the <hi>Caſa Profeſſa</hi> being very
dark, by reaſon that a troubleſom Neighbor would
not ſuffer any Windows to be made in a middle
Wall, tho' by Law it might be done, the Father
would not permit to have a Suit Commenc'd upon
it, but rather choſe to Eat in the dark Eight years
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65023:190"/>
together, till ſuch time as he was in a Condition to
purchaſe the Man's Houſe, who of his own accor'd
offer'd it to Sale.</p>
               <p>He equally pray'd to God for the Friends, and
the Enemies of the Society. The ſame Duty he
every day perform'd for the Pope, and for all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
Princes, on whom depends the publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility.
In the Year 1555, he ſaid upon the occaſion
of <hi>Julius</hi> the Third being Sick, that when the Pope
was in Health, he conſtantly pray'd for him once a
day with Tears; but that when his Holineſs was
Sick, he never fail'd to do it twice in the day. And
in the Year 1556, after that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had
Reſign'd his Kingdoms into the Hands of <hi>Philip</hi> the
Second, <hi>Eleonor Maſcaregnas,</hi> who had been Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to <hi>Philip,</hi> by her Letters intreated Father <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
to recommend the new Monarch in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God, whoſe good Conduct was of ſo great
Concern to the Church. He Anſwer'd her, <hi>That it
was his Cuſtom once a day to Pray for the Prince
before the Abdication of</hi> Charles <hi>the Fifth, and that
after it he had Pray'd twice every day for him with
a particular Affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He commonly excus'd the Sins of others, upon
the account of human Frailty, or of ſuddenneſs of
Paſſion. A blamable Action he would qualifie, by
ſuppoſing a good Intention, and ſay, <hi>That what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
Criminal before Men, was not always ſo in
the ſight of God:</hi> But if the Action was ſo enormous,
and ſo evident, that it could in no manner be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
he then ſaid, with the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Judge
not before the time, God only ſees the bottom of
Hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But his love to his Neighbor did moſt of all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in his concern for the good of Souls. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
no Labor that might be profitable to them;
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65023:190"/>
And he uſually ſaid, That if for ſaving one, it were
neceſſary for him to endure the uttermoſt Miſery,
he ſhould ſuffer it with a good will.</p>
               <p>Being now old, and broken with Sickneſs, he was
call'd upon to Confeſs a dying Man: Tho' he was
that day Sick himſelf, and tho' there wanted not
Fathers in the Houſe, very fit for that Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet would he go himſelf, and ſpend the whole
Night in aſſiſting the dying Perſon to make a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
End.</p>
               <p>To conclude, all his Paſſion was for the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Sinners, and his Zeal embrac'd no leſs then
the whole Earth. He had even for Sinners a certain
tenderneſs, more then for other Men; and this was
ſo notorious, that the Brother of Father <hi>Francis de
Borgia,</hi> in a Letter to deſire his Friendſhip, wrote
thus to him, <hi>I have nothing in me to deſerve your
love, unleſs it be that I am the Brother of Father</hi>
Francis, <hi>or that I am a great Sinner, and of theſe
two Motives I know not which will be the ſtrongeſt,
to make you grant the Favor which I ask.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From his beginning to Serve God,<note place="margin">His Humility.</note> he had ſo deep
an apprehenſion of his own nothingneſs, and ſo low
an Idea of himſelf, that he has been often heard to
ſay, that vain Glory was the Vice which he leaſt
fear'd. He was not of ſo affected an humility, as
not to own the gifts which God had beſtow'd upon
him; and comparing one day with another, the
preſent ſtate of his Soul with the paſt, he ſaid, that
<hi>Manreza,</hi> which he call'd his Primitive Church,
was only his Noviceſhip, and that our Lord went on
every day perfecting the work, of which he then
made only a rough draft. But all thoſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
favors, of Interior diſpoſitions, of Divine Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
of frequent Apparitions, of continual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
flowing from a ſenſible Devotion, only
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65023:191"/>
ſerv'd to increaſe the bad Opinion, he had of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<hi>It muſt neceſſarily be, that I am very weak,</hi>
he ſaid, <hi>ſince I have need of ſo many extraordinary
props to ſupport me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He alſo ſaid, that the more faults he committed,
the more Favors he receiv'd from Heaven; as if his
negligences and infidelities were the meaſure of the
Liberalities and Favors of the Father of Mercies:
And this was it which made him ſay, that perhaps he
was the only Man in the World, in whoſe Perſon
were united ſuch diſtant Extreams, ſo much Sin,
and ſo much Grace.</p>
               <p>Being once rapt in Spirit, and rais'd from the
ground, inviron'd with Celeſtial light, he was heard
to cry, O <hi>God! thou art infinitely Good, ſince thou
doſt ſupport ſo miſerable a ſinner as I am.</hi> So that
the ſight of his Miſeries, even in his Extaſies, never
left him.</p>
               <p>After this, one would think, that he might have
ſpoken of his Raptures and Extaſies, without any
fear of Vanity: And yet he was ſo reſerv'd in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, that unleſs it were to fortifie his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
upon ſome very extraordinary occaſion, and
only at the firſt planting of the Society, he ſuppreſt all
mention of them: For when his Order was once
throughly Founded, he us'd incredible induſtry to
conceal all ſupernatural Favors of that kind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
on him by God.</p>
               <p>He never ſpoke of what paſt within his Soul, but
in modeſt and humble terms; and becauſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of his days, he had the moſt tender
Sentiments of Piety, he ſaid, that the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
beſtow'd on him Devotion, for that being Old
and Infirm he was only fit for the Exerciſes of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
life. Sometimes he ſign'd his Letters in this
manner, <hi>Deſtitute of all Good,</hi> Ignatius. He ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:65023:191"/>
call'd his Order the little Society of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
When mention was made before him of the good
fruits it produc'd in the World, and of its being
ſpread in ſo little time over the whole Earth, or when
any Diſcourſe was held, which turn'd to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
he preſently gave a check to it, and
commonly it rais'd in him Bluſhes and Tears.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Laynez</hi> ask'd him one day in confidence,
whether it were true, what was ſaid of him,
that he had an Archangel for his Angel Guardian.
The Saint made him no Anſwer, but bluſh'd, and to
uſe Father <hi>Laynez</hi>'s Expreſſion, ſhew'd ſuch trouble
as a chaſt Virgin would do, if ſurpriz'd by a Viſit
of ſome unknown Perſon, at an undue hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being inform'd, that a lay Brother told his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
that their Father</hi> Ignatius <hi>was a great Saint,
he ſeverely reprehended him for it.</hi> You vilifie, <hi>he
ſaid to him,</hi> and diſhonor Sanctity by ſuppoſing it to
be in ſuch a ſinner as I am: <hi>He added,</hi> that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of this nature was little leſs then Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>A ſaying like this, did perhaps coſt Father <hi>James
d'Eguia</hi> his life; he was Confeſſor to Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
Tho' the Saint who diſcover'd to him his
interior (that he might not march in the ways of
God without a guide) had recommended to him a
profound ſilence, and had likewiſe Penanc'd this
good Father, for having been to free in talking, yet
<hi>Eguia</hi> could not ſo well contain himſelf, but that
ſome words ſlipt from him, importing ſomething
which he durſt not ſpeak out. It was much his
deſire to outlive the Saint, at leaſt ſome few hours,
that he might without ſcruple reveal what he knew,
and he ſaid, he had things to tell, which could not
be heard without Aſtoniſhment. This wiſh of the
Confeſſor came to the Ears of Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and
it was the Opinion of the Fathers then alive,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:65023:192"/>
that the Saint beg'd of God, that <hi>Eguia</hi>'s wiſh
might not be accompliſh'd. However it were, the
Good Confeſſor dy'd ſome few Days before Father
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> and it was never known what it was, that
the Saint ſo much fear'd, leaſt <hi>Eguia</hi> ſhould reveal
it. He deſir'd to be thrown upon a Dunghill after
his Death, being as he ſaid, nothing but Dirt and
Corruption. He one day ſaid, that all thoſe of the
Houſe, gave him an Example of Vertue, and matter
of Confuſion; and that he was Scandaliz'd by no
body, but by himſelf. He once writ to a Perſon of
intimacy, that he never treated of the things of God,
even with the greateſt ſinners, that he did not
learn and gain ſomething.</p>
               <p>Never was Man leſs adhearing to his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and when the matter deliberated upon did
not appear evident to him, he eaſily follow'd the
Opinion of others. Laſtly, tho' he had in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
degree all the qualities neceſſary to govern well,
by the common conſent of all wiſe Men that knew
him, yet he ſtill thought himſelf not capable to be
Superior, and proteſted in the Preſence of God, that
he was only fit to Obey.</p>
               <p>His Children did ſeveral times intreat him, and
with great earneſtneſs, to leave them Memoires of
his life for their Inſtruction, at firſt he would not
hear of it, but at laſt he condeſcended to them,
fearing leaſt they ſhould believe, that his modeſty
hinder'd him from telling them great matters. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
towards the end of his days, he dictated to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Lewis Gonzales</hi> a plain and ſhort Relation of
what had happen'd to him from the time of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to the year 1543: For what follow'd, he
refer'd them not to Father <hi>James d'Eguia</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
but to Father <hi>Hierome Nadal,</hi> to whom from
time to time he had given ſome account of himſelf</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:65023:192"/>
He would have it believ'd that he conceal'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and that what he himſelf had ſaid, and what
<hi>Nadal</hi> could ſay, was the ſum total. This is that
which is call'd, covering humility with humility,
in flying the reputation of being humble.</p>
               <p>From the time when he firſt left the World,<note place="margin">His diſingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the World.</note> he
had in great abhorrency all that, which Worldly
Men moſt greedily court, and he ardently ſought
what they moſt abhor'd. If he had only regarded
himſelf, he would by his good will have paſs'd for
a Fool or a Madman, in the apprehenſion of the wiſe
Men of the World; &amp; if his Charity to his Neighbor,
or common decency would have permitted him, he
would have made no difficulty to expoſe himſelf to
the Eyes of the People in an extravagant dreſs.</p>
               <p>The contempt in general, which <hi>Ignatius</hi> had of
the World, did particularly extend to the Pomp,
and Magnificences of Courts, to the Enterpriſes and
Conqueſts of Princes: all this appear'd very little
in his Eyes; and this it was which caus'd in him
that frequent Ejaculation, when he conſider'd the
Stars in the ſilence of a clear Night, <hi>How vile is
the Earth, when I look upon Heaven!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly, he had no Commerce with great
Ones, any farther then the Glory of God, and the
Intereſt of Religion requir'd. Whereas he was
much look'd upon, for the very reaſon, becauſe he
would not be ſo, many Perſons made their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to him, by his Mediation to make their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
but he plainly declar'd to them, that he had
no intereſt, but in the Court of Heaven, and that,
if there they deſir'd Acceſs, he would endeavour to
aſſiſt them with his Counſels and Prayers. He ſaid,
that the duty of a Religious Man was not to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
People into Court, but thence to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
them into Solitude; and when a ſecular
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65023:193"/>
Perſon at any time did preſs him to recommend him
to ſome Prince or Cardinal, <hi>Brother</hi> (he Anſwer'd)
<hi>I know no Maſter greater, or better, then him whom
I ſerve; if you have a mind to be one of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks,
I will aſſiſt you with a very good will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He exactly practis'd, what is ſaid by the Apoſtle
St. <hi>Paul, No man liſted in the Service of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth
himſelf in ſecular affairs.</hi> He would not
have any thing to do, even in the concerns of his
neareſt Relations; and once upon a Winter day,
when he was at Prayer in his Chamber, the Porter
bringing him Letters from <hi>Loyola,</hi> which were ſaid
to be of Conſequence, he took the Pacquet, and
threw it into the Fire without opening it.</p>
               <p>His Niece, who was Daughter to his Eldeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Don Martin Garcias,</hi> and who became the ſole
Heir of the Houſe of <hi>Loyola,</hi> was ſought in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
by ſeveral Lords. The Duke <hi>de Najare,</hi> and
the Duke <hi>d'Albuquerque</hi> writ to Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> in
Favor of one of the Pretenders, and deſir'd him to
uſe his Intereſt for the Perſon recommended, becauſe
he was a Man of great Quality and Eſtate. The
Father Anſwer'd them, that he had no concern in the
Marriage of his Niece; that ſuch ſecular Affairs
had no congruity with his Profeſſion; that for many
years he had renounc'd the World, and that ſuch
as renounce it for the Love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ought
to forget Earthly things, that they may be only
imploy'd in thoſe of Heaven.</p>
               <p>By long combating his natural Inclinations,<note place="margin">His Command over his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> he
had got ſuch a Maſtery over them, that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in him no irregular motion. His Countenance
was always equal, as was his mind; and his own
People us'd to ſay, that he had an Heavenly Air,
becauſe there was always ſerenity in his Forehead,
and in his Eyes: So that, to treat with him upon
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65023:193"/>
any Matter, or to obtain any thing of him, there was
no need of ſtudying his Humor, or of obſerving
Times, or favourable Conjunctures.</p>
               <p>His Moderation however was not languid; for
tho' he had quite ſuppreſt the riſings of his Bilious
and Iraſcible Nature, he had not loſt the Fire which
was neceſſary for Action. He has been often ſeen,
whilſt he Entertain'd ſome of the Fathers with all
mildneſs and tranquility, to ſend for ſome one whom
he had a mind to rebuke before them, and ſuddenly
changing his Countenance, to ſpeak in a Tone
which made them all tremble: and then, as ſoon
as the Culpable had turn'd his back, to reaſſume his
Ayre of mildneſs, and to hold on the Conference with
the ſame tranquility, as before.</p>
               <p>The moſt ſurpriſing and ſtrange Accidents made
no viſible Impreſſion upon him; and whether they
were happy, or otherwiſe, it ſeem'd all one with him,
he was never the more ſad, nor more chearful. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one day upon a Viſit in a Houſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt
he was, according to his cuſtom, ſpeaking of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
matters, a Meſſenger ſent from the Fathers,
ſhewing great haſte and concern, came to tell him
ſomething in his Ear; having heard his Tale, he
ſent him back without any Anſwer, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in his Diſcourſe with the Company for the
ſpace of an hour. Upon taking his leave, ſome that
were preſent had the curioſity to ask him, whether
the Man that came in ſuch haſte, had not brought
ſome bad News. <hi>'Tis nothing</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>but that the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs
are in our Hourſe, and carry away all our Goods.
But this doth not much trouble me;</hi> (he added, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)
<hi>If they take away our Beds, we will lie upon
the Ground, as it becomes poor Men, ſuch as we are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once being fick, the Phyſicians order'd him to
keep himſelf quiet, and to baniſh all thoughts that
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:65023:194"/>
might cauſe the leaſt ſadneſs. This made him think
what there was that could afflict him in this World,
or give any diſquiet to his Soul. One thing only oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
to him capable of doing it; which was, if he
ſhould live to ſee the Society come to an end. He
went on farther, and conſider'd with himſelf, how
long that trouble would laſt upon him, in caſe that
Diſaſter ſhould happen; and he concluded, that if
without any fault of his it ſhould come to fail, he
ſhould recover his Tranquility in a quarter of an
hours Recollection.</p>
               <p>A Man who is Maſter of his Paſſions,<note place="margin">His Reſerv'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and how weighty his Words.</note> is eaſily ſo of
his Words. <hi>Ignatius</hi> obſerv'd in Speaking, all the
Meaſures which Reaſon and Charity preſcribe. He
related things plainly, without exaggeration, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to the Hearers the liberty of weighing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
drawing Conſequences, and of making
Reflections. Were the Conduct of Great Men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo irregular, or their Vices never ſo publick,
he would not ſuffer any mention of it. He cover'd
with a profound ſilence the Faults of his Subjects;
and once made it a matter of his Confeſſion, that he
had declar'd to three Perſons what might have been
declar'd only two, for the amendment of the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.
Some years before his Death he promis'd a
certain Perſon to aſſiſt him in a Buſineſs; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterwards that it was a Matter not very proper
for a Religious Man to ſolicite, he repented him of
his Engagement, and ſaid upon this Occaſion, <hi>I do
not remember in twelve years time that I have made
ſuch a ſlip, or that I have promis'd any thing, which
I afterwards repented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who knew him, us'd to ſay of him, that he
was a Man of few words, but the little which he ſaid
had great weight, and ſuch force, that no body could
reſiſt it; ſo that he turn'd the Judgment of his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:65023:194"/>
as he pleas'd. <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> being young, was not
very regular, nor very diſcreet; his unrulineſs went
ſo far as to ſhake off the yoke of Obedience, and not
to endure the ſight of Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> againſt whom
he conceiv'd a ſecret Averſion. The Father one day
calling him, did not ſpeak to him above two or
three words: <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> immediately threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at his Feet, and with Tears in his Eyes, <hi>I will
do Father,</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>I will do what you will have
me.</hi> The Buſineſs was about the Spiritual Exerciſes,
which the young Man had no mind to make: he
made them, and put himſelf under the Direction of
the Saint, with an entire Confidence and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Before there was in <hi>Rome</hi> a Houſe of <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi>
the <hi>Jews</hi> who asked Baptiſm, were Inſtructed
in the <hi>Caſa Profeſſa.</hi> One of theſe <hi>Catechumens,</hi>
call'd <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who had ſhewn great fervor, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of Converſion, and came every day with great
diligence to the Catechiſms, I know not by what
Impulſe, chang'd his Mind on the ſudden, and
breaking out into impious Expreſſions, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Exhortation, went out of the Church in a
fury. Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> overtook him, <hi>Remain with
us, Iſaac</hi> (he ſaid to him). Theſe words alone ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd
the <hi>Jew;</hi> he immediately return'd to the
Company, and to his former Intentions, with a new
fervor, and at laſt receiv'd Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>When the Saint had taken in hand any thing for
the Honor of God,<note place="margin">His Conſtancy in what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook for God, and his Greatneſs of Soul.</note> the Obſtacles and Difficulties
which he met with in the Execution of it, did rather
animate then diſcourage him. He waited one day
fourteen hours together, to ſpeak with a Cardinal
about a Work of Charity. Another day, when he
was to go out of <hi>Rome</hi> towards <hi>Naples,</hi> the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was ſo bad, that his Companion Father <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancus</hi>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:65023:195"/>
advis'd him to put off his Journey. <hi>Theſe
thirty years</hi> (he ſaid to <hi>Polancus) no Accident of this
nature has made me put any thing off till to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being broken with Sickneſs, and having all the
Buſineſs of the Society upon him, he had great need
of help in many Occaſions. Nevertheleſs, he left
himſelf deſtitute of it, when the greater Glory of
God did require it; and he has been ſometimes left
alone in <hi>Rome,</hi> to bear the whole weight of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
there, having ſent into divers Parts all thoſe
Fathers who were capable to eaſe him. <hi>As infirm
as I appear to be,</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>with this Staff I would
go a foot even into</hi> Spain, <hi>if there were need.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Sickneſs oblig'd him to keep his Bed, and that
any difficult Affair occur'd, he ſeem'd to forget his
Diſeaſe, and to recover Health in a moment: ſo
that when he fell ſick, his Children uſed to ſay, <hi>Let
us pray to God that ſome Buſineſs of Conſequence may
happen to our Father</hi> Ignatius, <hi>and we ſhall have
him preſently recover'd.</hi> He bore Adverſities with
invincible courage; and being ask'd which was the
ſureſt way to come to Perfection in a ſhort time, he
anſwer'd, <hi>Generouſly to ſuffer great Croſſes for the
Intereſt of God.</hi> The Grace of Perſecutions (as he
call'd it) of all Divine Favours, was that which he
moſt eſteem'd; and it look'd, as if by his Prayers he
had obtain'd it: for it has been often obſerv'd, that
the other Fathers, when they were from him, liv'd
in a Calm; and that aſſoon as the Saint came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, Tempeſts did ariſe on all ſides.</p>
               <p>In all the Storms of his Life,<note place="margin">His Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God.</note> the Confidence which
he had in God ſo kept him up, that he fear'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
when every thing was to be fear'd. In dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
Matters which he undertook for the Service
of the Faithful, he ſometimes to that degree aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65023:195"/>
himſelf to Providence, that ſuch as in theſe
Occaſions look'd upon his Conduct with carnal
Eyes, thought him Raſh and Imprudent. He made
it one of his chief Maxims, That whoever would do
great things in God's Cauſe, muſt have a care of
being too wiſe; and he ſaid, That if the Apoſtles
had conſulted the Dictates of Human Prudence,
they never had undertaken the Converſion of the
World.</p>
               <p>According to this Principle he once ſaid, That if
God ſhould call him beyond the Seas, and the Vicar
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> commanded him ſpeedily to depart,
he would put himſelf into the firſt Ship, tho' never
ſo badly Equipp'd, and even without Sails or Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<hi>What Prudence, Father, would be in this</hi> (ſaid
one that ſtood by). <hi>Prudence</hi> (reply'd <hi>Ignatius) is
the Vertue of him that Commands, not of him who
Obeys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a very hard Time, and when there was no
appearance of Relief by way of Charity, he ceas'd
not to receive many into the Society; and he told a
Father who wonder'd at it, That the more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
things did appear, the more hope we ought to
place in God. <hi>What merit is there to hope</hi> (ſaid he),
<hi>when we have a ſecure Fund, and certain Recruits?
If we ſee what we hope for, it is no longer hope; for
no body hopes for what he ſees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nicholas Bobadilla, <hi>not being able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
whence Father</hi> Ignatius <hi>got wherewithal to
maintain ſo many People, and asking him one day
about it, the Father made him a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital
of all the Alms conſtantly receiv'd.</hi> All this
(<hi>ſaid</hi> Bobadilla) is not enough for half our Company.
What then (<hi>reply'd the Saint),</hi> ſhall we depend in
nothing upon Providence? And muſt we relie upon
the Care of our Heavenly Father no farther, then
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:65023:196"/>
the Charity of the Faithful ſhall give us leave? For
my part, what comes ſhort from the Hands of Men,
I always find in the Hands of God; and ſhould they
give me nothing, in him I ſhould find all things.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Sarria,</hi> Embaſſador with the
Pope from the <hi>Catholick</hi> King, once receiv'd Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ignatius</hi> with more coldneſs then uſually, which
was occaſion'd by the Father's making little uſe of
the Marqueſs in the Buſineſs and Concerns of the
Society. Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who ſmelt out the Cauſe
of the Embaſſador's reſervedneſs, told <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi>
who was his Companion, That for above thirty
years God had taught him ſo to make uſe of human
Succors, as not wholly to relie on them; and that
he would let the Embaſſador underſtand, That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Men ought not to build upon the Credit of
Great Men, to the prejudice of their Confidence in
God.</p>
               <p>He had a particular Grace in the Direction of
Souls,<note place="margin">His Prudence in Spiritual Matters.</note> and this Gift of God he had in ſo eminent a
degree, that many Perſons conſulting him about
their inward Troubles, and not being able well to
explicate them to him, he ſo clearly Explain'd and
laid them forth before their Eyes, as if with his own
he had ſeen the bottom of their Conſciences.</p>
               <p>It was his Maxim, <hi>That we ſhould not accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
Buſineſs to our ſelves, but our ſelves to the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
and he apply'd this prudential Rule to Matters
of Piety. Wherefore he condemn'd thoſe Directors,
who would reduce all the World to their manner of
Prayer, and to their way of Living. He ſaid that
this ſort of Conduct is very dangerous, and that
ſuch Directors have little underſtanding in a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Life, as not knowing that the Gifts of Heaven
are of different kinds, and that all the Faithful come
not to God by the ſame way. He alſo ſaid, That
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:65023:196"/>
altho' in Vertues and their Acts there were ſeveral
degrees of Excellence, the moſt ſublime and perfect
was not always the beſt for every Perſon in ſome
Circumſtances; and that if God in time of Prayer
excites a Soul to Compunction, ſhe ought not to
turn away from it, nor, for Example, apply her ſelf
to rejoyce in the Infinite Perfections of his Divine
Majeſty.</p>
               <p>He us'd to ſay, That ſuch as made long Prayers,
ought to be very much upon their guard, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
that Commerce which they have with God;
That there are a ſort of People of a wilful Nature,
who by much Praying without obſerving the Rules
of Diſcretion, and wanting a true deſire to overcome
their own Judgment, dry up their Brain, and are ſo
poſſeſt with their own Imaginations, that there is no
getting them out of their Head; That others there
are, who perſwaded that all comes from God which
enters into their thoughts in time of Prayer, take
their own Fancies for their Conduct, and in this
manner only follow the Impulſe of Nature, miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it for that of Grace. He added, That Perſons
thus ſeduc'd, often fell into groſs Errors, and that
their Miſcarriage diſcredited Prayer amongſt the
People of the World, who wrongfully attribute the
Diſorder to Prayer it ſelf, and not to the bad uſe
made of ſo holy an Exerciſe. Finally, that how
much ſoever illuminated we may think our ſelves to
be, we are not to judge of divine Matters by human
Meaſures; but we ought always to ſubmit our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Principles of Faith, and the Authority
of the Church; it being unreaſonable, that things
certain ſhould be regulated by thoſe which are
doubtful; whereas on the contrary, the certain
ought to overrule the uncertain.</p>
               <p>He valu'd more the Spirit of Mortification then
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:65023:197"/>
the Spirit of Prayer; or rather, he judg'd that theſe
two Spirits, if true, were inſeparable, and that the
one could not ſubſiſt without the other. Some body
in his preſence praiſing a Religious Perſon, by ſaying
he was a Man of great Prayer, <hi>Add</hi> (ſaid he), <hi>that
he is a Man of great Mortification;</hi> by which word
he meant the Mortification of the Will, more then
that of the Body: for tho' he judg'd Auſterities to
be neceſſary for curbing the rebellion of Fleſh
and Blood, or for expiating Sins, yet he made no
great reck'ning of them, unleſs they were joyn'd
with an inward Abnegation. And for this Reaſon,
in his Conſtitutions he Orders, That the principal
care of thoſe of the Society, ſhould be to ſerve God
with the greateſt Self-denial, and as much as may be,
with a continual Mortification of their Will.</p>
               <p>When any body deſir'd him to tell them the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
way to Perfection, he ſaid, The ſhorteſt and the
ſureſt, was to overcome themſelves. He once told
a young Brother, who was of a violent Temper;
<hi>Tame and maſter your ſelf, (Brother;) for if you do it,
your Reward will be much greater in Heaven then
theirs, whoſe Vertue coſts them little.</hi> Another time,
Father <hi>Lewis Gonzales,</hi> who had the care of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
Diſcipline, complaining of the ſame Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>Have patience</hi> (ſaid the ſame Saint to him), <hi>he
with whom you are ſo unſatisfi'd, is more come on in
a Month, then ſuch, and ſuch a one in a Year;</hi> and
he nam'd to him two other Brothers of a mild Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
who went for Patterns of Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Being inform'd, that a Father naturally chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
and haſty, withdrew himſelf from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
after Meals, to avoid Occaſions of tranſgreſſing:
<hi>You deceive your ſelf</hi> (he ſaid to him); <hi>'tis by Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and not by running away, Vices are overcome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He preferr'd the leaſt Act of Charity, Humility,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:65023:197"/>
or of Patience, before the higheſt Knowledges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
or infus'd. Accordingly, he more eſteem'd
a plain ſimple Man, full of Spirit, and the Love of
God, then a great Scholar, leſs Fervent and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout:
tho' generally ſpeaking, he took more care
of the Learned Man, becauſe he was more uſeful
for the Service of our Neighbour.</p>
               <p>He principally regarded, that his Children ſhould
be apply'd to the Exerciſes of true Devotion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
looking after ſpiritual Guſts, Raptures, or Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Tho' God continually regal'd him with thoſe
extraordinary Favours, yet he ſaid, that we never
ought to deſire them, but rather to flie them, and
to have them in ſuſpicion; that when God did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
them, they were to be receiv'd with fear,
and not to be ſpoken of without being oblig'd to it
by Obedience, or by Charity. To conclude, he
judg'd of the Perfection of a Soul, only by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of ſolid Vertues, even to ſay, that it was better
to know our own Nothing, then to have Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Extaſies; and that to raiſe the Dead was not
ſo much, as to mortifie our Paſſions.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1553, a Religious Man of the Order
of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> call'd Father <hi>Reginald,</hi> Venerable
for his Age and his Piety, came one day to ſee the
General of the Society, and told him in the preſence
of <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> that there was at <hi>Bologna</hi> a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Woman of their Order, endow'd with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gift of Prayer; that ſhe had frequent
Raptures, and that during her Extaſies ſhe had no
feeling, not ſo much as of Fire, when apply'd to her;
but that ſhe always came to her ſelf when her Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
commanded her any thing. He moreover ſaid, that
this Nun had ſometimes the <hi>Stigmata</hi> in her Feet,
her Hands, and her Side, and that the Blood trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
down from her Head, as if ſhe had been Crown'd
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:65023:198"/>
with Thorns. He added, That not believing the
common report of all theſe things, he went himſelf
to be aſcertain'd of the truth with his own Eyes,
and that after what he had ſeen he could no longer
doubt of it. Then he ask'd Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> what
he thought of ſo wonderful a thing. <hi>Of all that you
tell me</hi> (ſaid the Saint) <hi>nothing ſeems to me leſs
ſuſpicious, then that ready Obedience;</hi> and farther
he would not Explicate himſelf.</p>
               <p>When the Religious Man was departed, <hi>Ribade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neira</hi>
deſir'd Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> to tell him what he
thought of that Saint of <hi>Bologna.</hi> The Father told
him, That God Almighty did operate in the Soul,
and infuſe into it the Unction of his Spirit, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in ſo great abundance, that in a manner it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow'd,
and wrought outward Effects upon the
Body; but that this happen'd very ſeldom, and only
to Perſons much in the favour of God. He added,
That the Devil, who could act nothing within the
Soul, had a cuſtom to counterfeit outwardly Divine
Operations, and by ſuch Appearances to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Credulous. <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> underſtood by this
Diſcourſe, that the Nun might be deceiv'd with her
Raptures, and <hi>Stigmata;</hi> and in concluſion it was
found out, that all her pretended Holineſs was but
an Illuſion of the bad Spirit.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1541, <hi>Martin de Sancta Cruce,</hi>
who was then a Novice of the Society, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Rector of the Colledge of <hi>Conimbria,</hi> and
dy'd in great Sanctity in the Year 1557, being in
Converſation with Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> happen'd to
ſpeak of the famous <hi>Magdalen de la Croce.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the marvellous things he had heard of her in
<hi>Spain:</hi> he ſaid that he had ſeen her at <hi>Cordoua,</hi> and
that ſhe ſeem'd to him to be one of the wiſeſt and
moſt holy Women of the World. The Father gave
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65023:198"/>
a great Reprehenſion to the Novice, for ſo highly
crying up this Woman, and told him, That thoſe
of the Society ſhould not eſteem and meaſure San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
by outſide, and oſtentation.</p>
               <p>Another time he ſeverely checkt a Father, who
in Diſcourſing with a Novice, propos'd to him the
Example of ſome Men, who had the repute of having
extraordinary Gifts, and Extaſies in their Prayer:
for he judg'd, that beginners ought not to hear
ſuch things ſpoken of, eſpecially the Novices of the
Society, leaſt inſtead of being well grounded in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Vertues, they ſhould run after the ſpecious part
of an interior Life.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſame account he treated with utmoſt
rigour a Prieſt of the Society, who was a great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
call'd <hi>Soldevilla,</hi> a <hi>Catalonian,</hi> for teaching
ſome of the Students in the <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge new
ways of Prayer, very different from the common
Method. He was a Man of very holy Life, but a
little Viſionarily given, and in whom the vivacity
of his Imagination had got the better of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This contemplative Father aſſembled by
Night his Diſciples, to Explicate to them his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Doctrine, and to make them practice it in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
as if Contemplation were an Art, and had any
other Teacher then the Holy Ghoſt. Aſſoon as <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
underſtood theſe Proceedings, he fail'd not
vigorouſly to ſuppreſs them: for after having caus'd
<hi>Soldevilla</hi> publickly to Diſcipline himſelf in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectories
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge, and of the <hi>Caſa
Profeſſa,</hi> he turn'd him out of the Society; and he
had no more regard to his profound Learning, then
he had to the Illuſtrious Birth of a Kinſman to the
Viceroy of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and of a Son of the Duke of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza,</hi>
both whom he had Diſmiſs'd ſome days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for being proud and unquiet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:65023:199"/>
In his Converſation he drew People to God, by
gently inſinuating into them the things of Heaven;
and he ſaid that this way of gaining Souls was the
proper way of his Inſtitute. It was not his Cuſtom,
at firſt daſh, to force upon Men of the World Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of Piety: he commonly began his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
with Matters agreeable to their Profeſſion
and Capacity. He ſpoke of Trade with Merchants,
of War with Soldiers, of Policy with Stateſmen;
and after a while, turning the Diſcourſe to his main
purpoſe, he exhorted them to gain Heaven, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their Vices, to govern their Paſſions: This is
that which he call'd, <hi>To go in at their Door, and to
come out at his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when certain idle People, whoſe Buſineſs was
only to paſs away their time, came to Viſit him, he
without Ceremony immediately fell upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Death, Judgment, and Hell: and he was
wont to ſay, That if they lik'd his Diſcourſe, they
would be the better for it; if they lik'd it not, he
ſhould be rid of them for the future.</p>
               <p>It was his Maxim, That Familiarity with all
Women ought to be avoided, even with the moſt
Devout; that the moſt innocent Commerce with
them, if it wounds not our Conſcience, it leaves ſome
ſtain upon our Reputation; and the Smoke black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,
tho' the Fire do's not burn us.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, That few People underſtood what God
would do with them, if they left themſelves to him;
That Apoſtolical Men ought to do for the ſaving of
Souls, what the Devil do's to deſtroy them; that is,
they ſhould ſtudy the natural Motions in general of
Man's Heart:, and the particular Inclination of each
Perſon; That natural Qualities ought to be ſet to
work by the interior Spirit, and that the Means which
make the Inſtrument pliable, and handy for God to
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65023:199"/>
work with it, ſuch as are Humility, Contempt of
the World, Purity of Intention, and the like, are
much better then the Means which render the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
capable to work of it ſelf, ſuch as are Wit,
Learning, and Eloquence; That Evangelical La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
better attain their End by yielding, then by
reſiſting; and that a little obſcure Good, done with
Edification, do's more glorifie God, then a thouſand
good Works which make a Blaze in the World, and
raiſe Murmuring and Envy; That we muſt not
ſuffer our ſelves to be ſeduc'd by a certain Zeal,
which makes us unquiet for the Diſorders of the
World; That we muſt begin by reforming our
ſelves, and afterwards look, as to other People, what
it is that God will ask us an account of at the Day
of Judgment; Laſtly, That Reaſon, which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth
us from Beaſts, muſt ſerve not only as a
Bridle to our Paſſions, but as a Rule to our Vertues,
in ſuch ſort, that in the Good which we do, we may
act by Meaſure and Compaſs, and that our Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
may not carry us beyond the Bounds of our
State.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the Vertues, and principal Maxims of
the Saint, gather'd from unqueſtionable Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
an Extract of which was Preſented to the Pope.
At the ſame time a Collection was made of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Cures obtain'd by the Interceſſion of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi>
and amongſt them was inſerted the Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a poſſeſs'd Perſon, out of whom the Saint
had chaſed the Devil, at the time when he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
General of the Society.</p>
               <p>This poor Wretch was a Servant of the Houſe, a
<hi>Baſque,</hi> call'd <hi>Matthew.</hi> The evil Spirit enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him in the abſence of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> when he went to
conſult Father <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> about his
Election, as we have formerly mention'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:65023:200"/>
in the Convent three Days together in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement.
The Devil, who had taken poſſeſſion of
this poor Man, tormented him in a dreadful manner:
Sometimes he threw him againſt the Ground, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he lifted him up into the Air; then again he
made him ſo lumpiſh and heavy, that ten Men could
ſcarce move him. Some that were preſent, threatned
the Devil, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> would quickly return, and
diſlodge him. At theſe words the Malignant Spirit
growing more furious, horribly cry'd out, that he
deteſted the Name of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that he was his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Enemy. The Saint being return'd, made a ſhort
Prayer over the perſon poſſeſt, and he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
deliver'd from the Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since that time, the Name of</hi> Ignatius <hi>grew terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the powers of Hell, and the Poſſeſt have been
ſometimes heard to cry out in the middle of the
Exorciſms, before a Picture of the Servant of God,</hi>
Where is thy power, O Lucifer, ſince a bit of Paper
with the figure of a Prieſt makes us flie without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance?
Ah God, why doſt thou deprive us of glory
to beſtow it upon a little lame Prieſt?</p>
               <p>One of his Letters had the ſame effect upon ſome
of theſe Evil Spirits, which haunted the Colledge of
<hi>Loretto,</hi> and which the ordinary Exorciſms could
not drive away: for as ſoon as the Letter was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
read in the Houſe, the noiſe ceaſed, and the
Spectres diſappear'd.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Perſons,<note place="margin">His Beatifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> who made their report of all
theſe things, which I have now related, were of
known ſufficiency and probity, yet all was ſtrictly
examin'd, according to the ordinary forms. After
theſe proceedings, in the Year 1609, <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth
at the requeſt of the greateſt Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atifi'd
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> and gave leave to have him Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in the Maſs, and in the Office. In the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:65023:200"/>
Years the Proceſs of his Canonization was
ſet on foot, and a new enquiry was made into his
Vertues and Miracles. Six hundred and ſixty wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
Juridically interrogated, made their depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
upon the Holineſs of his life. Above two
hunder'd Miracles well atteſted, were produc'd at
the ſame time, which were related in the Acts of
the Canonization, the Principal of which have been
Collected by divers Authors.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Towns and People, who had moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to bleſſed <hi>Ignatius,</hi> writ to <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth,
to haſten the Canonization of their Holy Benefactor,
and theſe their requeſts were ſeconded by many
Princes and Princeſſes, particularly by <hi>Philip</hi> the
Second, and <hi>Philip</hi> the Third, Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> by
<hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the Great,
King of <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Margaret</hi> Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
by <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> Empereſs, and Wife of <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imilian</hi>
the Second.</p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Maximilian</hi>
Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperor did
write to the ſame purpoſe with great inſtance to <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
the Fifteenth. The firſt askt no other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
from the Holy See for all the Service he had
done in the War of <hi>Bohemia</hi> againſt Heretical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,
but the Canonization of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> And the
other ſaid, that it was for the Honor and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Empire, to have Inroll'd in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of Saints, the Founder of an Order, which
ſeem'd to be choſen by God for the defence of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the King of <hi>France, Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth,
of all Chriſtian Princes was he, who moſt warmly
ſolicited this matter. He declar'd to the Pope in
his Letter of the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> of the year 1621,
that having receiv'd the firſt rudiments of Faith,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:65023:201"/>
and of good manners from the Children of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
and being very well ſatisfi'd with them, in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
his Conſcience, which he had put into their
hands, it was his deſire, that they might upon
this occaſion feel the effects of his good will towards
them; that all the moſt ſignal Favors, which he
could poſſibly receive from his Holineſs, could not
more affect him, then this which he now asked;
that ſuch a requeſt he reckon'd to be worthy of the
Eldeſt Son of the Church; that this Glorious Title
which he Inherited from his Predeceſſors, and which
inſpir'd him with Zeal for the Advancement of
Catholick Religion, oblig'd him to purſue the
Canonization of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as hoping that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
of that Saint would be a powerful ſuccour
to him for the baniſhing Hereſies, and Vices out of
his Kingdom; Laſtly, that <hi>France</hi> having had the
Honor to have this Servant of God not only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his Learning, and chuſe his Companions in
the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> but alſo to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of his Society in the Church of <hi>Montmartyr,</hi>
he had reaſon to hope for new Benedictions by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
to the ſpeedy Canonization of the Saint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fifteenth could not reſiſt theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,<note place="margin">His Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation.</note>
ſo preſſing, and ſo reaſonable. He Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniz'd
bleſſed <hi>Ignatius</hi> with all the uſual Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
upon the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> in the Year 1622,
which is the day on which the Church honors the
Memory of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great. <hi>Urban</hi> the Eighth,
who ſucceeded <hi>Gregory,</hi> did afterwards put the Saint
into the <hi>Roman</hi> Matyrology, and amongſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Forms preſented to him, he choſe the following,
which he partly compos'd himſelf, <hi>The one and
thirtieth day of</hi> July, <hi>at</hi> Rome, <hi>Saint</hi> Ignatius <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
Founder of the Society of</hi> Jeſus, <hi>Illuſtrious
for his Saintity, his Miracles, and for his Zeal, to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65023:201"/>
extend the Catholick Faith over the whole World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Without departing from the Character of an
Hiſtorian, I may add to the words of <hi>Urban</hi> the
Eighth, thoſe of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fifteenth, ſpoken by
him, when he Canoniz'd St. <hi>Ignatius:</hi> They are
taken out of Eccleſiaſticus, and the Holy Ghoſt ſpoke
then of <hi>Joſue, He was great in his Name, moſt great
in ſaving the Elect of God, in ſubduing their Enemies,
that he might obtain an Inheritance for</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p>But in ending the Life of this glorious Patriarch,
if I were worthy to offer any thing in his Praiſe, I
ſhould apply to him, what St. <hi>Jerome</hi> writes of
St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>

            <p>SInce there is no better beginning
then by an Action tending to the
Glory of God, it muſt needs be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to your Holineſs, that my firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
upon your entring into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church, ſhould be for
a thing, which will no leſs ſhew your
Paternal Piety, then increaſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
ſentiments, which God has been
pleas'd to beſtow upon me. The firſt
Inſtructions, which I receiv'd in Faith
and Manners, were from the Fathers
of the Society. They have had to
this preſent day the direction of my
<pb facs="tcp:65023:202"/>
Conſcience, very much to my ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which makes me deſirous, that
their whole Order may experience the
effects of my goodwill. Hereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inform'd, that the proceſs of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization
of Bleſſed <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the ſaid Order, was ſo far fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
that there wanted nothing, but
the good pleaſure of your Holineſs to
perfect ſo good a Work: I have thought
good to entreat you, as I do with great
affection, that you will be pleas'd to
declare, and place him in the number
of the Saints, Reverenc'd and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor'd
by our Holy Mother the Church.
The Favors (how great ſoever) which
I may for the future receive from your
Holineſs, all of them put together,
cannot give me greater ſatisfaction,
then this alone, which beſides the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions
I hope to reap for my ſelf,
will alſo heap Proſperities upon your
Government. The Divine Providence
which inſpires Hearts and governs
their motions, has not permitted that
<pb facs="tcp:65023:203"/>
this Devotion, for many Years impreſt
in my Heart ſhould be ſooner mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted;
Reſerving thereby to your
Holineſs the performance of an Action
ſo praiſe worthy, and to me the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of making a requeſt ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Eldeſt Son of the Church.
This Title, no leſs engrav'd in my
Soul, then deſervedly enjoy'd by my
Predeceſſors, gives me a ſtrong emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the advancement of our Holy
Religion; and makes me more Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for the ſaid Canonization, upon
the hopes I have, that the Interceſſion
of this bleſſed Man will powerfully aid
me to do that, for which God ſent him
into the World, and wherein this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is ſo profitably imploy'd. My
Kingdom has been formerly bleſt with
the preſence of this Servant of God;
He ſtudied at <hi>Paris,</hi> he there Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
his firſt Companions, and Founded
his Society in the Church of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martyr:</hi>
I now expect new Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if your Holineſs, at my requeſt,
<pb facs="tcp:65023:203"/>
ſhall conſent to his Canonization. As
it is my firſt Prayer, ſo I deſire it may
have a place amongſt thoſe Holy and
Good Actions, which are expected
from your Pontificat, which I beſeech
our Creator, that it may ſucceed to
his Honor and Glory, to the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of his Church, and to the good
of all Chriſtendom. From <hi>Paris</hi> the
