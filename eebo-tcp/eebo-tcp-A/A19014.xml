            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that the Army by Sea had ſet ſaile, and <hi>Amadis</hi> quite loſt the ſight of them; hee and <hi>Bruneo</hi> returned into the <hi>Encloſed Iſland,</hi> and becauſe hee had no leiſure to enquire of <hi>Gandales,</hi> newes from the Court of King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> by reaſon of his friends ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine departing: the very ſame day, walking alone in the garden, hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gandales</hi> vnto him, and entreated him to tell him, if he ſaw the Queene and his Couſine <hi>Mabila.</hi> Beleeue me Sir (anſwered <hi>Gandales)</hi> I ſpake with them both, &amp; for ought I could perceiue, they beare you very kinde affection: eſpecially the Queene, who deſires you (by all poſſible meanes) to make your peace with the King. Then preſenting him the Letter which <hi>Mabila</hi> had written, he further ſaid. Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> and your Couſine <hi>Mabila</hi> commend them-ſelues very louingly to you, and are much grieued, at the hard opinion the King holds of you, and Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> praies yee, to remember what kindneſſe and reſpect you ſome times found in the Court of the King her father, and the Letter ſent yee by your Couſine, will acquaint yee more at large with other tidings.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Amadis</hi> turning his backe on <hi>Gandales,</hi> doubting the alteration of his countenance, opened the Letter, and ſaw that his linage encreaſed, <hi>Oriana</hi> being ſo neere the time of child-birth, then which, nothing could more content him. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, his enforced abſence from her, bred in him ſuch extremity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as his ſpirits forſooke their ordinary functions, and cauſed him to ſend foorth ſighes in ſtead of words. Hereupon, hee purpoſed to goe viſite his father King <hi>Perion,</hi> and paſſe into <hi>Gaule:</hi> commanding <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> to prouide ſhipping for him, for on the morrow he would away in the company of <hi>Brunco.

And becauſe they were much wearied with long being at ſea, <hi>Bruneo</hi> ſaid to <hi>Amadis:</hi> Behold Sir, here is a pleaſant reſting place, after our tedious trauaile, if

you like thereof ſo well as I do, and perhaps wee may meete with ſome aduentures.</p>
                  <p>I am well content, anſwered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and commanded the Patrone to make to the land. Marie God defend ye (quoth he) from ſo great an euill. And why? quoth <hi>Amadis.</hi> Becauſe ye are but dead men, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Patrone, if you take landing heere, for this is the Sad Iſle, where the cruell Gyant <hi>Madraque</hi> liueth, who is the bloodieſt Tyrant in all the Iſles about this Sea: and let me tellyce, that for the ſpace of fifteene yeares, neither knight or damoſell, hath entred heere, but either they ſuffered a piteous death, or elſe were detayned in ſhamefull impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment. When <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> heard this, it was no meane mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to enflame courage in them, their maine deſire ayming at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſuch damnable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes: and therefore they ſaid to the Patrone, that he ſhould take no care for landing them there, which if hee would not willingly yeeld to, they meant to enforce it. So ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming themſelues, and mounting on horſeback, without any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany then their Squires <hi>Gandalin</hi> and <hi>Salinde,</hi> they rode on into the Iſle, giuing them charge, that if they chanced to be aſſayled by any other then knights, they ſhould aſſiſt them to their power.</p>
                  <p>So long they iourneyed, til com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vpon a plain, they diſcouered a Caſtell, which appeared to them very faire and goodly, and directing their courſe thither, they heard a horne ſo ſtrongly winded, that the whole Iſle made report thereof. I remember, quoth <hi>Bruneo,</hi> that the Patrone of the Ship told vs, when ſuch a horne ſounded, the Gyant went abroad from his fortreſſe, to fight with ſuch as his people could not conquer, and his fury is often times ſo extreame, that euery man dieth he can meete with all, yea, and his owne followers may not eſcape him.</p>
                  <p>Let vs on then, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> to finde out this deuill; and they had not gone any great way of ground, but they heard a great noiſe of men, and blowes betweene them, which cauſed their greater haſte, to defend any that were iniuriouſly aſſayled. At laſt they eſpyed two knights ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry violently purſued by a great number of horſemen, but on foote were they thus cruelly oppreſſed, very neere breathleſſe: for their horſes had beene ſlaine vnder them, and yet they defended themſelues couragiouſly. Now, as they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched neerer to them, <hi>Ardan</hi> the dwarfe, knew <hi>Amadis</hi> by his Shield, whereupon he cryed out aloud: Ah my Lord, helpe your brother <hi>Galaor</hi> and the King <hi>Cildadan</hi> his intimate friend. <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Bruneo</hi> aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at theſe newes, without retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any anſwer to <hi>Ardan,</hi> put ſpurs to their horſes in their reſcue. But inſtantly they eſpied <hi>Madraque</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards them, mounted on a, great blacke horſe, very thick coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ouer with plates of yron. In his hand hee held a Speare of ſuch weight, as hardly could any knight lift it vp from the ground. Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his owne men, he ſaid: Ye vile dogges, are ye ſo many, and can yee not foyle two poore tyred knights? Giue place ye Catiues, and let mee delight my ſelfe with ſluicing the blood out of their bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> ſeeing him make towards his brother and the King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> with more then an ordinary kind of furie, and doubting their ability of reſiſtance, ſaid to <hi>Bruneo.</hi> Louing companion, ſuccour you my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and let me alone to encounter <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

And ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently did ſhe labour in ſending more Darts to them, that her feete ſlipping, ſhee fell downe from the Rocke into the ſea, making ſuch a dreadfull noiſe in her fall, as if ſome huge Tower had beene battered in pieces, they in the ſhippe verily ſuppoſing hee had beene drowned.

Brother, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> you may well think I doe it vpon vrgent occaſion, and I would to God I could no more remember it, ſeeing the thought thereof is death to me, and therefore (I pray yee) ſpare any further ſpeech in this caſe. Where-to <hi>Galaor</hi> gladly yeelded, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding diſcourſe on contrary matters, they arriued at <hi>Monſtrel,</hi> where they went on ſhoare, becauſe they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that King <hi>Perion</hi> ſoiourned there, for it was the neereſt Towne that he had in Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and there he made expreſſely his aboad, to heare tidings of his Sonnes <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and <hi>Galaor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No ſooner did hee behold the Ship put into the Port, but hee ſent to know who were in it, and the Meſſenger deliuering his errand to <hi>Amadis,</hi> was anſwered, that King <hi>Cildadan</hi> and <hi>Bruneo</hi> were come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, onely to doe their duty to the King, who was not a little ioyfull of the newes, hoping that they would informe him, in what he further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. So mounting on horſeback, they rode on to the Court: but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> and <hi>Galaor</hi> went another way, for they deſired firſt to ſee their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to trye if ſhee would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them, or no. So, as the King came forth of the Towne, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Caſtell, where they met an Eſquire, to whom they ſaid. Friend, we would intreate (if you were ſo pleaſed) to acquaint the Queene, that two knights of her kinred, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to doe her reuerence, and to ſee her. The Squire was quick in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the meſſage, and brought them anſwere, that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Heere you muſt obſerue, that the had not ſeene <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſince ſuch time as hee was carried away by the Gyant, being then but two yeares old. Neuertheleſſe, ſo ſoone as they came before her, beholding <hi>Amadis;</hi> inſtantly ſhe preſumed the other to be <hi>Galaor,</hi> and was ſo rapt with extremity of ioy, that as ſhee was about to embrace them, ſhe fell forward on them, as entraunced, being vnable (a long while) to ſpeak vnto them, at laſt ſhe ſaid. Ah bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> what do I behold? deare ioyes, hath Heauen ſo fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee, as to let mee ſee you both together. So ſhe ſwouned againe betweene their armes, but ſhee was quickly recouered by her Ladies, and then came to <hi>Melicia,</hi> who had no meane part in this nouell ioy.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Queene had now her three children with her, and called to mind her paſſed misfortunes, not onely in reſpect of <hi>Amadis,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Galaor,</hi> the one eſcaping the dreadfull ſhipwrack on the Sea, the other from the hands of the Gyant <hi>Albadan:</hi> and now, what with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſt, and ioy in preſence, ſo ſtrong a warre fought with her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that her chearefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance became quite changed.

                  <p>Madame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> King <hi>Cildadan</hi> came with vs in the Ship, and <hi>Bruneo</hi> alſo in company who (by great misfortune) chaunced to bee wounded ſome few dayes ſince.

                  <p>When <hi>Melicia</hi> heard theſe words of her brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> in behalfe of him, whom ſhe loued as dearely as her owne life; ſhe could not auoid bluſhing: neuertheleſſe, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly wiſe, ſhe modeſtly excuſed this alteration, and ſaid to her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Galaor.</hi> Sir, ſince it ſtands ſo well with the lyking of you and my Mother; heere I promiſe yee, that I will vſe my very beſt endeauour in his ſeruice.

concluded his firſt dreſſing, ſayd my Lord <hi>Brunco,</hi> for my ſake (I pray yee) receiue a little ſuſtenance, and afterward take ſome reſt if you can. Then calling for ſuch foode as ſhee knew meereſt for him, and with a hand (more white then Alablaſter) making it ready for his eating: ſhe quickened ſuch delicate apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in his ſoule, that his eye went farre beyond his appetite. So, commanding euery one to depart the Chamber, that the leaſt noyſe might nor offend him, ſhe ſaid. You haue promiſed mee, that you will eſſay ſome repoſe, let me ſee how o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient you will be herein, till ſuch time as I come to viſite you againe: Then her ſelfe departing, ſhe called <hi>Laſinde, Bruncos</hi> Eſquire, and ſaid vnto him. Friend, you know (better then any other) your Maiſters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, make demaund therefore of ſuch things as you thinke fitteſt for him.</p>
                  <p>The Squire was not now to learne, what entercourſe of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had paſſed betweene them, and therefore, preſuming more boldly in his owne wit, then one leſſe skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, hee returned her this anſwere. Madame, I wiſh no worſe to my worthy Maiſter, then that good fortune would conduct him to ſome ſuch place, where he might make acknowledgement of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours you affoord him. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to me, that ſuch as are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to recouer a wounded body, firſt of all, they ſhould apply helpe to the place principally offended. Which kinde of Phyſick inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, to entreate your pittie to my poore Maiſter, who endureth, not ſo much paine by the hurt ſo lately receiued; as by a diſeaſe of greater antiquity, and you that are the onely cauſe, can beſt miniſter the mittigation. Friend (quoth ſhee) I can tell how to helpe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity wherewith I am acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but ſecret ſoares are quite out of my curing. Truſt me Madame, replied the Squire, if the one ſeeme plaine to you, the other is no leſſe apparrant, for you are not ignorant, that the extremitie of his affection to you, was the maine motiue, why he went to behold the Images of <hi>Apolidon</hi> and <hi>Grimaneſe</hi> in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Iſland. Laſinde</hi> (quoth ſhee) they that become ſicke by ſuch a ſtrange meanes, had neede haue much time to compaſſe their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; without vrging any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy, then that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhall repute moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie.</p>
                  <p>And ſo ſhe left the Squire, who went forthwith, and acquainted his Lord with all the conference, that had paſt betweene him and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta Melicia:</hi> wherewith hee was not any way diſpleaſed, perſwading himſelfe, that ſhe had thus diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered, repoſing (as yet) but ſlender confidence in the Squire. And like as true louers often vſe to doe, he conuerted all to his owne beſt aduantage; being much better contented then euer heretofore, and thanking God, that <hi>Andadones</hi> hurting him, had fauoured him with ſuch an extraordinary felicity. For, vnder the happie fortune of this wound, he oftentimes enioyed her gracious companie, without whom, life was moſt tedious to him.</p>
                  <p>Some few dayes after, <hi>Amadis, Galaor</hi> and King <hi>Cildadan</hi> walking together, <hi>Galaor</hi> perceiuing the nere approch of King <hi>Perion,</hi> hee went vnto him with theſe words.

quoth hee to his Brother <hi>Amadis,</hi> that you gaue me to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> commanding me to ſerue him, and that I ſhould be wholy his, whereof I made him faithfull promiſe, and you likewiſe. Now, beholding how great a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you two, during the time of my abſence: I finde my ſelfe very ſtrangely perplexed, conſidering, what errour I may commit, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king part with him againſt you, as alſo, how iuſtly I may be blamed by him, forſaking him in a time of ſuch vrgent neceſſity. Wherefore moſt Royall father, I humbly craue your opinion in this caſe, to preuent my diſhonour on either ſide, and that reaſon may bee preferred before mine owne will.</p>
                  <p>Sonne, anſwered King <hi>Perion,</hi> you may not fayle to follow your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againſt a King ſo head-ſtrong and vngratefull, for if you gaue your ſelfe to his ſeruice againſt all men: yet your brothers cauſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Galaor,</hi> it appeares to me (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der correction) that I ſhall greatly forget my ſelfe, and runne into no meane blamefull imputation, by withdrawing my ſeruice from him, before his owne permiſſion to that purpoſe: for, ſeeing (in the times of peace) hee gaue mee honour and good entertainment; what will be noyſed abroade of mee, to forſake him when affaires of importance be fall him?</p>
                  <p>Well knew <hi>Amadis,</hi> whereto the ſpeeches of <hi>Galaor</hi> aimed, and that hee had no will to keepe him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: wherefore, formalizing him-ſelfe anſwerable to his Brothers fantaſie, hee thus anſwered him. Brother, although we both ſtand highly obliged, to obey the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and commaund of the King our father: yet I will humbly deſire his pardon, in telling my minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your intention. Seeing you are ſo earneſtly addicted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into Great <hi>Brittan,</hi> and to continue in the ſeruice of King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart;</hi> it likes mee well that you ſhould doe ſo. For, in the caſe that concerneth our difference, I doubt not, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may it ſo pleaſe our Kingly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; hee may licence your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for I am contented with it. Why then (quoth the King) God be your guide, and I will reſt in this hope, that you may (one day) be the meanes, of compounding peace in ſo vnhappy a warre.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Galaor</hi> obtayned his deſire for departure, and becauſe King <hi>Cildadan</hi> would ſhape ſome honeſt excuſe to goe along with him; hee began in this manner. My Lords, it is ſufficiently knowen to you all, to what iſſue the battaile came, which I had againſt King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (by your meanes) got the glorie of the day, to my no little diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tange: for ſuch honor as (in Iuſtice) appertained to mee, conuerted to my great confuſion, in regard, that by the couenants on either ſide concluded before, I was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (for a limitted time) to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him as my Commander, and to ſerue him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But valuing mine honor much dearer then life, I yeelded to controule and checke mine owne will, and (according to my promiſe) to bring him a number of my ſubiects in his aſſiſtance, whereof already he hath giuen mee ſummons, and no later then this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning; for at the ending of Maſſe, I receiued Letters from him to that effect.

                  <p>At the ending of theſe ſpeeches, they withdrew to their Chambers, where they continued till ſuch time as they went to reſt, and in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning came to take their leaue of King <hi>Perion</hi> and <hi>Amadis,</hi> embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelues in a good Ship, that wayted there for them, and the windes ſitting proſperouſly for their departing.

were ſomwhat amazed, becauſe they ſaw no knights to whom they apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Notwithſtanding, as they kneeled at their prayers, a Squire entred, of whom <hi>Galaor</hi> demanded, who had placed thoſe ſhields there? Sir (quoth the Squire) your requeſt may not now bee anſwered: but if you goe to the Court of King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> there you will quickly know ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>uelties.</p>
                  <p>Now as they were iſſuing foorth, there entred twelue knights; each of them guiding a Damoſell by the hand, the faireſt and beſt formed that poſſibly could be ſeene, all of them holding conference with a Gentle-woman more auncient in yeares, that ſeemed as a conductres to the reſt. Well perceiued <hi>Galaor</hi> and King <hi>Cildadan</hi> (by her habit) that ſhe was a ſtranger, and maruailed the more what ſhe ſhould be: but they deferred any further enquiry for that time, becauſe they beheld the Hermite readily habited to ſay Maſſe. Which was no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but the elder Damoſell addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſelfe towards King <hi>Cildadan</hi> and <hi>Galaor,</hi> demaunding of them, whether they were of King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, or no. Why aske ye? anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King. Becauſe (quoth the Damoſell) we earneſtly deſire your conduct thither, ſo pleaſe it you to affoord vs ſuch fauour. For wee are aduertiſed that he is in this Forreſt, accompanied with his Queene, and a goodly troupe of Ladies, where he runneth the Hart. Beleeue mee Damoſell, replyed <hi>Galaor,</hi> ſo pleaſe it you, we will keepe you company. Sir, quoth ſhe, a thouſand thankes, and ſeeing wee finde you ſo gently diſpoſed, and are (as wee imagine) ſome of his followers: our ſuite to you is, that you would entreat him, to beſtow knighthood on this yong Squire heere preſent with vs, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring yee, that he is deriued of ſo high birth, as he well deſerueth to haue that honour, and much greater, if poſſible it might be.</p>
                  <p>Truely Damoſell, anſwered <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> I ſhall very gladly doe it, and am perſwaded, that a King ſo good and gracious, will not deny me a requeſt ſo reaſonable. Let vs preſently then, replyed the Damoſell, ſet forward to him, while our Gentleman (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to commendable cuſtome) ſhall performe his deuotions heere in this Chappell. So mounting on horſebacke, ſhe rode on alone in the company of <hi>Galaor</hi> and King <hi>Cilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and as they deſcended downe an hill, they eſpied the King croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Valley, who perceiuing two knights armed in that manner, imagined that they made their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode there, to Iouſte with any other that ſhould firſt paſſe by. And albeit he had thirty knights in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as his guard, and each man ready for any ſuch encounter: yet (at that time) he was not willing to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch tryall of the Launce; but ſent <hi>Grumedan</hi> towards <hi>Galaor</hi> and his company, to requeſt their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant repaire to the King, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly hee did: and ſo ſoone as <hi>Galaor</hi> perceiued his neerer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, he preſently knew him, and ſhewing him to King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> ſaid. This is old <hi>Grumedan</hi> (quoth he) who bare King <hi>Liſuartes</hi> Enſigne in the battell againſt you. By my faith (anſwered King <hi>Cildadan)</hi> he is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worthy man; for on that day, I contended more againſt him, then any other in the whole band. And I well remember, that wee grew (at laſt) to hand-gripes, when I ſtroue to wreſt his weapon from him: but it was a matter beyond my power, and yet I brake it in the handle, as himſelfe faſt held it.</p>
                  <p>Their helmets were off, in regard
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7181:233"/>
of the heates extremitie, by which meanes <hi>Grumedan</hi> quickly knew <hi>Galaor;</hi> and giuing his horſe the ſpurre, he rode to embrace him, ſaying. My Noble Lord, you are welcome, behold the King, who hath ſent me to yee, imagining you to bee otherwiſe then you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and therefore deſireth you to come ſpeake with him. Lord <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan,</hi> anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> king <hi>Cilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> is here with me, and wee both will goe to ſalute his Maieſty. In good faith (quoth <hi>Grumedan)</hi> hee will be very ioyfull for your returne, and if you pleaſe, I will ride before to acquaint him therewith. Doe ſo, replied <hi>Galaor,</hi> and wee will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low yee. <hi>Grumedan</hi> returning, and the king hauing obſerued his long conference with the two knights, demanded (at his arriuall) who they were. Sir, anſwered <hi>Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> the one is my Lord <hi>Galaor,</hi> who hath brought yee king <hi>Cilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> in his company. How? quoth the king, is it poſſible? Yes verily, replied <hi>Grumedan.</hi> It is, ſaid the king, the higheſt good happe that could now befall me, let vs therfore goe and kindely welcome them. As he made towards them, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held <hi>Galaor</hi> and king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted from their horſes to doe him reuerence, whereupon, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them with ſo cheerefull a countenance, that it might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be noted by the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, how pleaſing their arriuall was to him.</p>

The King neuer vſed to affoord ſuch an honour, but where he knew it to bee eſpecially deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, wherefore, hearing this requeſt made by <hi>Galaor</hi> (leaning vpon King <hi>Cildadans</hi> ſhoulder) he ſtood pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely a long while, without any an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwere: becauſe, that by denying them, he imagined they would take it offenſiuely, and in yeelding to their motion, it appeared vncouth vnto him, and irregulare to his wonted cuſtome. Neuertheleſſe, hee demaunded of the Damoſell, whoſe ſonne hee was? Sir, quoth ſhe, you may not know that as yet: but I dare ſweare vpon my ſoule, that he is extracted of Royall ſeede by both ſides.</p>
                  <p>What thinke you then my deare friend, quoth the King to <hi>Galaor,</hi> may wee make him Knight? You may very well doe it Sir (anſwered he) without ſtanding longer on any excuſe, for I preſume he wil prooue of no meane merit. On Gods name then be it ſo, replied the King: yet I would haue the Queene and her Ladies witneſſes thereof, and therefore goe you before to them, and cauſe them to meete vs at the place where hee remaineth, for bee well aſſured, they all will be right ioyfull to ſee yee. So the King tooke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſelues, that neuer did men meete with more gracious welcome, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the Princeſſes <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Mabila,</hi> for their hope was (by them) to heare ſome newes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and that they would worke his meanes, for recouering the Kings fauour againe. Hauing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their beſt ſalutations on all ſides, <hi>Galaor</hi> told them, that the King had ſent for them, and vpon what occaſion, to their no little ioy and contentment: for euery one was deſirous to ſee the yong gallant, of whom <hi>Galaor</hi> had giuen ſuch high commendations.</p>
                  <p>The Queene and her Ladies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all mounted, made ſuch ſpeed to the Hermitage, that they aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there, euen as the King was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Chappell, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the twelue Shields, placed about that which was altogether white, and the young Gentleman very deuoutly at his prayers: he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo pleaſing in their eyes, that the former report came far ſhort of their preſent opinion of him, for, in their beſt of iudgement, they had neuer beheld a more comely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor of a more ſetled and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red countenance. He ſeeing ſuch a goodly company of Ladies and Knights, aroſe, and gaue them moſt humble reuerence. Then the King tooke him by the hand, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if he would bee a Knight. Sir, quoth he, for nothing elſe haue I iourneyed from ſo farre a Country, but to craue it at your hand, ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it you ſo much to honour mee. Truſt me ſaid the King, you ſhall not be denied, and he falling on his knees, the King gaue him the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colade, according to the ceremonie then vſed in Knight-hood, ſaying vnto him; Be a Knight in the name of God, and ſo tooke him vp. Now, quoth he, for receiuing your Sword; you may make choiſe of any in this company, that ſtands fayreſt in your owne liking. Sir, replied our new made knight, I deſire then, that Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> may doe it, for if ſhe performe it, I haue the thing that my ſoule moſt longeth after. Is it euen ſo? ſaid the King, I will ſolicite her on your behalfe, and ſtepping to the Princes, thus proceeded. You heare how deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous the knight is, that you would beſtow ſuch an honour on him; let mee entreate yee, not to denie him.</p>
                  <p>Now, the faire young Princeſſe, to whom (neuer till then) any ſuch requeſt had beene made, neither knew what might be his reaſon that made the motion: had ſo little power ouer her preſent condition, that a moſt amiable bluſh mounted vp in to her cheekes. Yet taking the Sword preſented to her, ſhee guided it to the knight, after the vſuall maner. Then ſpake the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Damoſell to the King, ſo low as none but himſelfe could heare her. Sir (quoth ſhee) ſeeing you haue done ſuch honour to our knight, he ſhall remaine (if you be ſo pleaſed) in your ſeruice, with theſe twelue other knigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,

hee determined to make no account at all of <hi>Norandell</hi> (though he knew him to be his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Sonne) vntill hee perceiued how he would beare himſelfe, and deſerued by his deedes, to prooue ſuch a one as he deſired.

In regard whereof the King was willing to giue ouer further ſporting, and commaunded the Huntſmen to beare the Hart to the Queenes Tent.</p>
                  <p>Afterward, being ſet at the Table. <hi>Galaor</hi> and King <hi>Cildadan</hi> keeping him company; all dinner while hee had but little conference with them, for thinking ſtill on <hi>Celinda,</hi> and her Letter ſent him. Dinner being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he tooke <hi>Galaor</hi> aſide, and as they walked, thus diſcourſed with him.

So, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him the Letter which <hi>Celinda</hi> had ſent, hee willed him to peruſe what it contained. <hi>Galaor</hi> reading it ouer aduiſedly, perceiued therby, that <hi>Norandell</hi> was Sonne to the King, whereat conceiuing no little ioy, he returned this anſwere. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly Sir, if you tooke ſuch paines for your faire friend, in mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe is no way behinde ye in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable recompence, hauing broght ye ſuch a goodly Son, as will proue a worthy man, and a valiant knight in Armes. Nor let the concealment heereof be irkeſome to ye, becauſe when you ſhall pleaſe to make it knowen, it will redound to your great ioy and honour. And if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with your good liking, to let me enioy him as my companion, what ſeruices heereaſter I ſhall doe for you, I will account to bee moſt worthily imployed.</p>
                  <p>What? quoth the King, would you trouble your ſelfe with a Boy, affoording him (at the firſt) ſo great an honour, not knowing his temper, or how he will carry himſelfe?

On my faith (quoth the King) if you honor him ſo much, you ſhal high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly oblige him to you, and doe me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an eſpeciall fauour.

                     <hi>Norandell,</hi> to graunt what I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him, to wit, that (for one whole yeare) he and I may be fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and companions, not any way to be ſundered or deuided, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept death or impriſonment ſhall enforce it. When <hi>Norandell</hi> heard this, hee was no leſſe amazed then well pleaſed: for he very well knew, that <hi>Galaor</hi> was eſteemed one of the beſt knights in that Court, and that the king affoorded much more honour to him, then any other that, kept him company, and thereupon he thus replied. My Lord <hi>Galaor</hi> it may eaſily bee diſcerned by your demaund, in how many obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of dutie you would haue mee bound vnto you, in wiſhing that grace to mee, which I much rather ought to haue begged of you. And this I dare aſſure yee, that not onely doe I graunt what you haue deſired, namely, my company: but alſo I giue my ſelfe wholly yours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that in that nature you would receiue and accept me. Beleeue me, quoth king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> you haue both reaſon in theſe ſeuerall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts: you Lord <hi>Galaor,</hi> in vrging ſuch a fauour, and you likewiſe yong <hi>Norandell,</hi> in granting it: for if heauen bee pleaſed therewith, as we need not vſe any doubt, it will redound to the honour and benefit of either.</p>
                  <p>At this very inſtant, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued intelligence, that his Army was to depart very ſpeedily, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next morning hee rode to the City, and riding alone by him-ſelfe he called <hi>Galaor</hi> to him, telling him. He was well contented, that his daughter <hi>Oriana</hi> ſhould know <hi>Norandell</hi> to be his ſonne, and her Brother, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Sir, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> I am perſwaded, that it will not a little pleaſe her, and therefore (if poſſibly I may) I will acquaint her therewith before wee come to Court. Doe ſo, quoth the king; <hi>Galaor</hi> riding backward, came to the Princeſſe, and to him (after ſome other conference had together) ſhe ſpake in this manner. Sir <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> I am perſwaded, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who was yeſterday made knight, hath beene a long while knowne to you, in regarde you made choiſe of him as your aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate and companion: for I know not any knight in this Court, but would thinke himſelfe highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, to be ſo graced by you, yea, though it were your brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madame, replied <hi>Galaor,</hi> your compariſon of mee with my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is ſo vnequall, as the like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may be ſpoken of heauen and earth: conſidering, that (in reſpect of me) he may bee tearmed heauen, and I (compared to him) farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the lower element. And therefore, I repute it great preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any knight whatſoeuer, to thinke himſelfe his ſecond: for it plainly appeareth, that fortune fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured his election, to hold the primarie place in valour, feature, and all other gracious gifts requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Gentleman. Full gladly did <hi>Oriana</hi> liſten to theſe praiſes of her <hi>Amadis,</hi> while inwardly ſhee thus ſpake to her ſelfe. Alas poore Lady, thy misfortune were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable, if in being thus ſeuered from the preſence of thy friend, thou ſhouldſt bee as farre diſtant from his intire affection: in good ſadneſſe, death would be a thouſand times more welcome to mee, then ſuch a deepe diſcomfort.

Let it be no matter of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in you, faire Princeſſe, that I accepted <hi>Norandell</hi> into my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; for you may bee well aſſured, that I did it not but vpon great and good occaſion, and perhaps, it will no more diſlike you, then it doth me, when the cauſe is more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to yee? I pray yee Sir, quoth ſhe, if it bee a matter that your honour may diſpence withall, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it from me.</p>
                  <p>Madame, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> the ſecret were very important, that I would not impart to you, and vpon faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promiſe of your priuacie, I will diſcouer it. Reſt boldly aſſured thereof, replied the Princeſſe. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand then Madame, quoth <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> that <hi>Norandell</hi> is ſonne to the King your father and your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

For, in being with you, hee cannot faile of proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to bee a good man, and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous knight: whereas, ſhould hee be otherwiſe addicted, yet ſuch a bad nature would be quite altered, only by keeping your company, as hee hath faithfully promiſed.

                  <p>So breaking off this enterpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, they rode to the Queenes lodging, where <hi>Galaor</hi> diſmounting the Princeſſe, and hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her to her Chamber: hee departed thence with his new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, vntill the next morning their going to the king, who told them, that hee purpoſed that night to ſleepe aboord his Ships, and the day following to ſet ſaile away, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing order for euery mans being in readineſſe. The Drummes and Trumpets ſummoning all ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to their collours, they weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ankors on the morrow, and had the winde ſo auſpicious for them, as quickly they loue the ſight of Great <hi>Brittan:</hi> but ſoone after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe a ſhrewde Tempeſt, which made them very doubtfull of periſhing.

                  <p>There did <hi>Floreſtan</hi> make good acknowledgement of his man-hood, for, meeting with <hi>Gaſquilan,</hi> king of <hi>Swetia,</hi> hee wounded him ſo daungerouſly, as euery one reputed him for dead. Neuertheleſſe, <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ande Moniaſte</hi> (aduenturing ouer forwardly into the throng, with full intent to charge King <hi>Arban)</hi> was taken priſoner, being no way able to helpe himſelfe, ſo that on other ſide, many good knights were wounded, and layde along on the ground. All which king <hi>Liſuart</hi> heard at his arriuall, whereat hee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7181:236"/>
was ſo diſpleaſed, as no man could be more, concluding to bee reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on them. Which the better to performe, hee gaue commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thorow his Campe, that no one ſhould preſume into the field, without licence thereto firſt obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hoping that the enemie would come againe to aſſaile King <hi>Arban,</hi> as formerly he was wont to doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his comming thither. But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide had intelligence of this freſh ſuccour, in regard whereof they had retired themſelues, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding further fortune.</p>
                  <p>By this time, the houre drewe neere, when the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> ſhould bee deliuered of her childe, and her Fathers departure fitted it very well: for, within a day or two after his ſhipping thence, the paines and throwes of child-birth grew ſo extreamely on her, that (about mid-night) ſhee expected death euery minute. Therefore ſhe cauſed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila</hi> to riſe, as alſo the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> who had (long before) prouided all things in readineſſe, to bee required in ſuch a neceſſitie. They being come to her, found her ſo ouercome with paine and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh (not daring to crye or vſe any complaint) that ſhee was vnable to hold out any longer. But Heauen pittying her oppreſſions, before the breake of day, requited her ſorrowes with the birth of a goodly Boy, which the Damoſel of <hi>Denmarke</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, while <hi>Mabila</hi> gaue further attendance on the Mother. As ſhee was making it ready in the ſwadling clothes, ſhe diſcerned ſeauen Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters vnder either little teate, ſome as red as blood, and the other as white as ſnow: whereat being not a little abaſhed, ſhee called <hi>Mabila,</hi> and ſhewed them to her. But neither of them had the skill to reade them; for they were all Greeke Letters, compoſed in Latin words, in which report, they forbare (as then) to acquaint the Mother therewith, wrapping it vp in the clothes, and laying it by the Mother, till ſhee gaue order for conueighing it thence, according as formerly hath beene determined, which being done, the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> departed to call her brother <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the meane while the Princeſſe holding the Infant in her armes, and beſtowing many ſweete kiſſes vpon it, ſpake in this manner. Alas little Creature, Heauen enlarge ſuch bleſſings on thee, that thou mayſt proue to be as good and vertuous a knight as thy Father, and make the beginning of thy fortunes more proſperous then his hath beene. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, I am enforced to forgoe thee, and ſhewe my ſelfe towards thee more cruell, then any Tiger or Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard to their young ones. For I know not whether thou goeſt, nor when I ſhall ſee thee againe, which filleth my ſoule with ſuch affliction, as Fortune cannot affoord thee the very leaſt danger, but I ſhall finde it preſented before mine owne eyes. Oh that I could but know the Nurſe that ſhall giue thee ſucke; I would entreate her to bee very carefull of thee. For it may ſo come to paſſe, that ſhe will be ſo negligent of thee, that before thou canſt be able to helpe thy ſelfe: ſhe may many times leaue thee in the danger of wilde beaſts, while ſhe attendeth on ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affairs, or elſe ſit goſſipping with her neighbours, telling vaine tales and fruitleſſe fables. Neither can I therein much condemne her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both ſhe (and many more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide) may iudge thee to be the ſonne of ſome ſilly woman; and perhaps the beſt fauour they will beſtow on thee, ſhall be to make thee a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,

or ſome other flock-keeper on the field, who cannot alwayes be prouident in their paines, but (euen in deſpight of their vtmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence) the Wolfe or Lyon paſſing by, may make ſpoyle and bloody ruine.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words were accompanied with inundations of teares, and yet ſhe purpoſed their longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, till the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke</hi> entring the Chamber, ſaid. Madam, it will ſoone be day, therefore expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is more fitting for vs, then vnthrifty delay Alas (quoth the Princeſſe) what intend yee to doe? What? ſaid the Damoſell, marie to ſaue your honour, and the life of your childe: doe not you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, what we haue (long ſince) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded together? And let me tell ye, my Brother <hi>Durin</hi> waiteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath vnder the window, to receiue the Infant as we ſhall let it downe. I feare, (quoth the Princeſſe) that you will kill it in the deſcent. Let our care be your warrant, anſwered the Damoſell. So taking it out of the Mothers Armes, ſhee was ready to ſwoune with griefe; and but that <hi>Mabila</hi> ſpake ſomewhat angerly to her, ſhe would haue riſen to follow it; but ſhe ſaid vnto her. Madame, if you grow ſo forgetfull of your ſelfe, we will forſake ye to: therefore ſuffer what muſt of neceſſity bee done, and (by the grace of God) all will goe well. So putting the child into a wicker Basket, and faſtening a ſtrong corde thereto, they let it downe at the window, to the place where <hi>Durin</hi> attended to receiue it. Afterward the Damoſel deſcended, and finding the horſes there, which <hi>Durin</hi> had brought thither: they mounted on them, taking their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney through the Forreſt, becauſe they would not meete with any body.</p>
                  <p>So long they rode, till about day breake they arriued to a goodly Fountaine or Spring, which iſſued forth of an high Rocke, and vnder it was a Valley ſo obſcure, as well in regard of the depth thereof, as alſo the plentie of huge great Buſhes and Trees, that it was almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to diſcerne bright day, as men paſſed along thorow it, and continually it was haunted with Wolues, Lyons and ſuch like cruell beaſts. From time of all antiquity, in a remote corner of this Valey, ſtood a ſmall Hermitage, wherein liued a holy man, named <hi>Naſcian,</hi> of whom it was euery where reported, that his life was ſo acceptable in Gods ſight, as he was oftentimes fed with heauenly food, when earthly ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance grew ſcant and fayled. All the company he had, was a young Lad his Nephew, who went abroad to get their daylie ſuſtentation, and himſelfe (in perſon) would diuerſe times driue his Aſſe before him, and yet no ſauage beaſts offer once to touch him, albeit they met him vſualy on the way; but rather would humble themſelues to the good old man, making him what mirthfull ſport their rude natures affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>This place was ſo ſolitary and vnfrequented, that a Lyonneſſe did there yearely bring foorth her yong ones, and they would vſualy and priuily viſite <hi>Naſcian,</hi> euen as if they had beene his houſhold little dogges, and as duely would hee walke to ſee them in their denne. Whereinto, ſo ſoone as the Lyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſaw him enter, ſhee would wander abroade to ſeeke her prey, as ſeeming to leaue her whelpes in his ſafe protection: becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually hee haunted thither twiſe or thrice each day, ſuch was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſeeing them play with one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7181:237"/>
another. Now, by ſuch time as the Damoſell drew neere to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the prime of the mornings clearneſſe beganne to appeare, and ſhe found her ſelfe ſo ſpent with trauaile, which all the night time ſhe had endured, that ſhee ſaid to <hi>Durin.</hi> I pray yee Brother, let vs refreſh our ſelues a while in this place.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, they alighted from their horſes, hee taking the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant from his Siſter, to lay it at the roote of a tree neere the fountaine, while he receiued her downe in his armes. The Lyonneſſe then wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the depth of the valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſend foorth ſuch dreadfull roarings, that the horſe whereon the Damoſell roade (being fearefull at his noiſe) ranne ſwiftly away with her, before <hi>Durin</hi> had ſcarcely layde downe the child, and doe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhee could to the contrarie, carried her ouer-thwart the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, ſhee not hauing any power to deſcend. <hi>Durins</hi> horſe alſo ranne away in the like manner, whereat he ſtood as confounded with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for hee ſaw his Siſter in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, heard her crie and call to him for helpe, and yet hee could not lend her any, becauſe hee was on foote, laying downe the childe that ſlept full ſweetly. At length, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing no preſent ſigne of perill to the Infant, hee concluded to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Damoſell, and therefore ran that way which the horſe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: finding him in a thicket of young trees, and ſhe falne downe, almoſt depriued of her ſences.</p>
                  <p>Hauing holpen her vp, he prayed her to ſit there a while, vntill he had recouered their horſes, and caſting his eye aſide, eſpied hers ſo farre entred into a quickſet, that he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily tooke him, and brought him to her. As he intended to purſue his owne, ſhee ſaid vnto him; Good Brother, goe firſt to the childe, and bring it hither to mee, for if the bloudy beaſt finde it, farewell all hope of life. I will goe fetch it, quoth <hi>Durin,</hi> therefore ſtay you my returne in this place; And as hee offred to mount vp on her horſe, ſhe perſwaded him to the contrary, leaſt meeting with the Lyonneſſe, or hearing her cry againe, worſe might befall him. <hi>Durin</hi> followed her aduiſe, and departing thence without any longer delay, went directly towards the fountaine. But ſome ſmall while before hee could get thither, the Lyonneſſe had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by, and taken vp the Infant with his teeth, not doing it any harme at all. By this time the morning was ſo farre growen on, that <hi>Naſcian</hi> (hauing ſung his Maſſe) walked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade (according to his wonted cuſtome) before the denne of the young Lyons, and beholding the Lyonneſſe to bring them ſuch an vnuſuall kinde of prey: ſtepped iuſt in her way of paſſage, not a little wondring where and how ſhee had found it. Approching neerer to her, in threatning manner, hee thus ſpake to her. Cruell beaſt, who made thee ſo bold, to offer iniurie to a creature, ſent by God into the world, to doe him ſeruice and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? It is no food for thee, or thy whelpes.</p>
                  <p>The Lyonneſſe ſeemed to bee fearefull, and (euen as if ſhe had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the commaund of <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian)</hi> couched downe preſently on the ground, and moouing her eares and taile in louing manner, layde downe the infant, and beganne to lick it. Then the good olde man tooke it vp in his armes, and in bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, ſaid, Alas little Babe, thy mother that hath thus vnmercifully left thee, is well worthy to be curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7181:238"/>
of God. The childe beganne to cry, and make much moane, which mooued the aged man to ſuch compaſſion, that the teares ſtreamed aboundantly downe his reuerend beard. And not knowing how to quiet it with any preſent ſuſtenance, concluded in the end, to driue the Lyonneſſe into her denne, and there to ſuckle it among her whelpes; which as hee did, hee ſaid. I commande thee by the power of God, to whom all things liuing doe owe obedience; that thou giue nouriſhment to his creature, and to bee as carefull of it as to any of thine owne. The Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onneſſe made no refuſall, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred the child to ſuck ſo long as it liſted: and then the Hermit taking it from her, carried it a long with him louingly to his Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>Preſently hee ſent for his Siſter to come to him, to aduiſe what ſhould be done with the child, and his young Nephew was dilligent in the buſineſſe: but fortune was ſo contrarie, that hee found not his mother at home, becauſe the day before, ſhee and her husband was gon to a village ſomewhat farre off, ſo as they could not be returned in the ſpace of eight whole dayes. During which time, <hi>Naſcian</hi> found himſelfe much encombred, for hee was but badly acquainted with the office of a Nurſſe, and therefore, finding no other remedie: till they were returned, he made his beſt meanes by the Lyonneſſe, as alſo a faire Ewe, that had newly eaned, and theſe holpe to foſter our poore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken infant.</p>
                  <p>But returning now to <hi>Durin,</hi> thinking to finde the child at the fountaine, where he had left it: he was greatly aſtoniſhed, when he perceiued his purpoſe defeated. Neuertheleſſe, he ſo earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured, to know what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it; that at laſt, he found the tracke of the Lyonneſſe which had carried it thence, and preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that ſhe had deuoured it, in mournfull teares he returned to his Siſter. She vnderſtanding this hapleſſe fortune, fell downe as one entranced, and breathing forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pittifull lamentations. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

O deare God, wouldſt thou permit ſo yong a creature to periſh, that neuer in it ſelfe offended thee? It is I that am iuſtly worthy of the ſeueareſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and I would that this miſhap had falne vpon my ſelfe, for life is now but loathſome to mee. Sweet Babe, thy Father (euen as yong as thou) beganne to proue the dangers of this world: and yet our Lord (in his great goodneſſe) plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to preſerue him. But thy miſ-fortune is much more ſtrange then his, becauſe when he was left to the mercie of the waues, <hi>Gandales</hi> (in a happy houre) met with him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward did foſter him, as euery one well knoweth. But alas, little dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, thou didſt fall into the mercy of a brute beaſt, that had no more pitty then his owne nature gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo didſt thou finiſh thy dayes, before they were (wel neere) begunne.</p>
                  <p>Theſe lamentations were ſleeped in many floods of teares, <hi>Durin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no way able to comfort her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (for a long while) death more appeared in her, then life.

                  <p>About tenne dayes after hee had ſent for his Siſter, ſhee came vnto him, accompanied onely with her huſband.

Then the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite brought her where the Infant lay ſleeping vpon a bedde of leaues and moſſe, and ſhee no ſooner ſaw him, but his very appearance plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her beyond meaſure, and ſhe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of him, what was his name.

Now you are to vnderſtand, that after they were thus met together, the King gaue command to raiſe his Campe, and paſſe thence to the plaine Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ground: for hee had aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the knights of the Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iſland were departed from the Burning Lake, as purpoſing to bid him battaile. So marched on theſe two Armies each againſt other, and had giuen charge the very ſame day, but that night preuented them; and therefore they were conſtrained to deferre it till the next morning. Then arming themſelues, King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> ordayned his forces into three bat tallions; the firſt led by <hi>Galaor</hi> and fiue hundred knights, among whom were <hi>Norandell, Guillan</hi> the Penſiue, <hi>Ladaſin</hi> and <hi>Cendtle.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was guided by King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> with ſeuen hundred other knights, hauing in their company <hi>Ganides, Brandoynas</hi> and <hi>Philippinell.</hi> The third, King <hi>Arban</hi> of <hi>Northwales</hi> had charge of, with <hi>Don Grumedan,</hi> and many other knights beſide, both bold and valiant, appointed as guard for the perſon of King <hi>Liſuart:</hi> who before he meant to enterfight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his enemies approach ſo neere him, gaue theſe ſpeeches to al his followers.</p>
                  <p>My worthie friends, you haue heere preſent before your eyes, the reaſon that mooued vs to croſſe the Seas, to defend the honor of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and this Country which is ours; as is moſt notoriouſly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, by our agreements made with <hi>Ardan Canile,</hi> auouched by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſima,</hi> &amp; the aged Giantes her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And yet notwithſtanding, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what couller or pretence I know not, they haue dared to make their entrance, and (by treaſon) haue ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized both the Towne and Caſtell of the Burning Lake, where wee planted the Count Latin as our Vicegerent, whom they yet detaine as priſoner, and many more with him. This hath raiſed their courage to ſuch a height of arrogancie, that they hold Fortune to be onely their Goddeſſe, and that ſhe (with them) will beate vs hence, euen home to our owne houſes, whereto it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth they will likewiſe lay claime, to order them and vs by their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But you ſhall ſee it fall out quite contrary; for, the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein wee haue ſo long time liued, and the hand of Heauen (I am aſſuredly perſwaded) will not ſuffer vs to be diſgraced by them. For I dare engadge mine honour, that there is no one man among ye, but will rather dye with credit and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous repute, then liue in obloquie and deteſted ſhame.

                  <p>While the King was thus buſied in theſe remouſtrances, <hi>Galuanes</hi> ſate not idlely downe on the other ſide but being in the midſt of his battalions, went from ranke to rank, perſuading his knightsto fight man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, &amp; vſing theſe or the like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to them.</p>
                  <p>Vnderſtand, my deare friends and companions in Armes, that the chiefe and moſt ſoueraigne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that can be in any Army what-ſoeuer, is, to haue one ſole Head or Commaunder, whoſe wiſedome in ordinances, and counſell in things requiſite to bee done, may compaſſe obedience for the execution of his command. Now, it is apparent that yee haue not heere one Captaine onely, and ſuch a man as I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to yee: but two or three, yea, more then twentie, who are all ſo ſweetly linked together, as if it were but one will, one heart, and one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Seeing then, that this prime fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity is not wanting to vs; let vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate our ſelues to the ſecond, and helpe forward my fortune, in ayding vs againſt a King, the moſt ingratefull man of the world: who maketh full account to ruinate our goods and liues with a great and powerfull Army brought hither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, onely to impoueriſh, and exterminate the right of a ſilly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman. But he may come ſhort in his account; for we will aide and maintaine her cauſe, ſo long as life remaineth in our bodies; according to our oath and promiſe, whereto we obliged our ſelues when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the order of knighthood. But if we dye with this attempt, it ſhall be to vs immortall glory, that wee had ſo iuſt occaſion to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, who ought to deſend the right of all Ladies.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7181:240"/>
with ſuch height of ſpirit, a matter almoſt incredible to men.</p>
                  <p>Such were the words of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knight <hi>Galuanes</hi> to his followers; which animated them ſo ſprightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they imagined the time ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardied, till they were at fight. But <hi>Quedragant</hi> required a little longer reſpit; And in the mean while (quoth he) I hold it very expedient, that we ſhould ſend to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe him, that if hee expect any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in fighting with vs: that hee would withdraw his Archers, as we will doe ours, by which meanes, it will be the faireſt forme of battell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong knights, that euer was ſeene. This aduice was well liked by the whole company, and <hi>Elian</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate had the charge of this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Whereupon he went to the Campe of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> giuing his ſigne afarre off, that he came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre. <hi>Galaor,</hi> who ledde the auant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, ſent a Gentleman to meete him, and conduct him ſurely. Being brought to the King, he made kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen what the knights of the Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iſland had commaunded him. In good ſooth, anſwered the King, I am very well pleaſed with their motion, and bidde them not faile in doing their vttermoſt. So <hi>Elian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and informed <hi>Galuanes,</hi> who had likewiſe diuided his Army into two parts.</p>
                  <p>But they were ouer few, in reſpect of the Kings power, which conſiſted of ſix times as many men more, and yet they were not daunted or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed. Only they grieued for the want of <hi>Brian de Moniaſte,</hi> who was taken priſoner on the day that they aſſayled King <hi>Arban;</hi> and for <hi>Agray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> alſo, who was gone to leuie men, and make prouiſion of victuals from little <hi>Brittaine.</hi> Theſe two bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes being ranged, and ready for fight, they marched each againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this manner. For them of the Encloſed Iſland, the auantguard was led by <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> accompanied with two hundred and fifty knights, beſide <hi>Quearagant, Angriote</hi> and <hi>Sarquiles;</hi> among whom alſo was <hi>Gaſinan,</hi> bearing a goodly great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, wherein were figured twelue Ladies. Next marched <hi>Galuanes, Palomir, Dragonts, Liſtoran,</hi> and foure hundred other knights, all worthy men, and reſolued to fight.</p>
                  <p>Then Drummes, Trumpets and Clarions ſounded on either ſide ſo chearefully, that the ayre returned backe as gallant an eccho: &amp; as they were vpon ioyning, <hi>Galaor,</hi> who led the vauward for King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Norandell, Floreſtan, Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; Angriote,</hi> and <hi>Garnate,</hi> ſaide. My friendly companion, marke well theſe foure firſt that marche hither-ward ſo brauely, aſſure your ſelfe, that they are reputed among the beſt knights in the world. Hee that beares his Shielde Gules, with three Lyons Argent, is my Brother <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> The other that beares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure, ſeamed with Floures and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Ore, is <hi>Quedragant.</hi> The third that beares Azure, with ſo many floures Argent, is <hi>Angriote.</hi> And the fourth who beareth all Sinople, is <hi>Garnate</hi> of the Dreadfull Dale: hee ſlew a mighty Serpent, and therfore was that name impoſed on him. Let vs therefore charge them boldly, without any thought of difference. So placing their Launces in their reſts, and giuing ſpur to their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they entred pell mell. The firſt that <hi>Norandell</hi> encountred, was <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> of the Dreadful Dale, to whom he gaue ſuch a ſalutation with his Launce, that his Saddle girts break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he fell downe backward with the Saddle. This was the firſt bold aduenture that euer <hi>Norandel</hi> made which cauſed his eſtimation after-ward
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7181:240"/>
to be the more glorious. <hi>Galaor</hi> was the next to him, againſt whom ran <hi>Quedragant,</hi> and met each other with ſuch maine violence, that they lay both ouerthrown on the ground, and their horſes vpon them.</p>
                  <p>Then began the fight to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; cruell, and ſuch was the noiſe of ſtrokes deliuered on either ſide, the ſound of Trumpets, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crys of men; that it was a mater moſt ſtrange &amp; fearefull to heare. Knights lay ouerthrowen &amp; wounded on the earth, in heapes together; and they that had beheld the fight betweene <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Quedragant,</hi> after they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ce recouered footing, might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily haue iudged, how little fauour they meant to each other. And as they declared themſelues worthy renowne for deedes of Armes, euen ſo did <hi>Norandel, Guillan</hi> and the reſt make good the like: But <hi>Angriote</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> reſiſted each other in ſuch ſort, as neither of them could gaine the leaſt iote of aduantage, &amp;, which was more; meanes was made to remount <hi>Quedragant,</hi> while the other withdrew <hi>Galaor</hi> out of the throng. Then came in king <hi>Cilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> with his troups, who did ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all to ſuch ſerious imployment, as if <hi>Galuanes</hi> had not bin ſuddenly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured, there had bin no means for further reſiſtance. And yet <hi>Floreſtan</hi> was in the midſt of the croud, laying on all ſides ſo valiantly about him; that he wel deſerued, to be ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the beſt knights of the world; for heperformd ſuch deeds of arms, as all were glad to giue him way.</p>
                  <p>Now as he continued his trauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing among the rankes, he chanced to meete with King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> who made much hauocke among his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers: in regard wherof, he caught him faſt about the body, purpoſing to lay him along on the ground, but the other held firme footing, and they ſtroue together ſo extreamely, that the fall hapned equall to them both. Notwithſtanding, they were vp againe quickly, with their ſwords faſtened in their hands, and as they hacked and hewed each other; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griote d'Eſtrauaux,</hi> and <hi>Enill</hi> came in to them, and gaue aſſiſtance to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan,</hi> that in deſpight of <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Norandel,</hi> (who ſeemed to come to the reſcue of king <hi>Cildadan)</hi> they ſet him on his horſe againe. In which time <hi>Cildadan</hi> retired, for he was ſore wounded on the head, with a ſtroke that <hi>Dragonis</hi> gaue him with a ſword.</p>
                  <p>At this time King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> men beganne to haue the worſt, ſo that the moſt part of them turned their backs, and took themſelues to flight: but they met the king and his guard, that came to aſſiſt them, and he made meanes to ſtay them. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, beholding this diſorder, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo amazed, that hee ſaid to <hi>Grumedan;</hi> Shall all the honour of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> be now ſhaken and weakned, by a poor handful of ſpent &amp; tired men? So claſping down the beuer of his Helmet, and couering himſelf with his Shield, he gaue the ſpur to his horſe, crying aloud to his men. Is this a time for flight? follow me, follow me men of courage, &amp; let vs ratheer dy together, then fly to our own ſhame. So entred he among the thickeſt of his enemies, &amp; the firſt he met withall was <hi>Galuanes,</hi> to whom hee gaue ſuch a ſhocke with a ſhort Lance, that he made him bend in the back, &amp; drawing forth his ſword like an angry Lyon, he entred the preaſe, performing ſuch deeds of armes, as no knight could do more. But <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant, Floreſtan, Angriote</hi> &amp; <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> came, who ouerthrew him, and beat back his people couragiouſly.</p>
                  <p>Now beganne King <hi>Liſuart</hi> to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that Fortune turned her backe vpon him, and meeting with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7181:241"/>
                     <hi>Arban, Grumedan</hi> and <hi>Gaſquilan,</hi> hee ſaid vnto them. I feare that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen intendeth puniſhment vpon vs: but I had rather be tearmed a dead King with honour, then (being foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) to liue with ſhame. And ſo he entred into the wood, where ſeeing what ſpoyle was made by <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> and his men, hee charged him with all his might, and gaue him ſuch a wound on the head, that the blood ran downe all about his face. And ſurely, hee had beene in very great danger of life, but for <hi>Angri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> who thruſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them; and as they laboured in his defence, king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Sword entred the flanke of <hi>Floreſtans</hi> horſe, ſo that hee fell downe dead vnder him. But <hi>Floreſtan</hi> quickly reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this iniury, for in recouering himſelfe, he ſo hought king <hi>Liſuarts</hi> horſe, that he was glad to forgo his Stirrops, and in diſmounting, gaue ſuch a ſtroake to <hi>Floreſtan</hi> on the head, that both aſtouned, &amp; ſhreud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded him. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Floreſtan</hi> was not thus to bee diſcouraged, but beholding the king ready againe to charge him with his Sword, he vnder-ranne the blow; and catching him about the midle, ſeazed his Sword, by which meanes he might eaſily haue ſlaine him if he would: but he refuſed that aduantage ſo freely offered him, which afterward prooued to his owne harme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galaor</hi> beholding the king in ſo great danger, ruſhed ſuddenly in, and without reſpect to brother, or any other kinſman, behaued him-ſelfe ſo boldly, that in deſpight of <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> he recouered the king out of his hands, and remounted him on horſebacke againe, by the helpe of <hi>Norandell, Grumedan,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which gaue freſh encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the knights of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> ſo that they which before fled away with feare, ſtood to it now more reſoluedly then euer. So tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning head vpon their enemies, who (hauing loſt <hi>Floreſtan</hi> and <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,</hi> that were among the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) became ſo weakened in their ſtrength, as they were conſtrayned to retire: for euen <hi>Galuanes</hi> himſelf was ſo grieuouſly wounded, as hee was no longer able to ſit on horſe-backe. Neuertheleſſe, like a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete and hardie knight, vntill his people had gained the hill, he ſtood vpon his beſt guard, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Palomir, Elian, Branfill, Enill,</hi> and <hi>Sarquiles,</hi> who were all (in the end) taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners: And had it not beene for <hi>Dragonis,</hi> who forcibly recouered <hi>Galuanes,</hi> he had remained among the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus the king obtayned the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, by vertue of his courage, and the fauour of <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> who hauing him in his power, became enemy to his owne good fortune. For ſhe is ſuch an inconſtant Miſtreſſe, as will haue no man to let ſlip aduantage againſt his contrarie, leſt ſhee turne her backe, and frowne at his folly, as ſhe did to <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> For if hee had ſlaine king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> when in heate of blood (with tollerable excuſe) hee might haue done it; the honor of the day had falne to him and his friends aſſuredly, which therefore thus hee loſt, to their ſhame and confuſion, as formerly hath beene related.</p>

But as <hi>Galaor</hi> returned from purſuit of his enemy, hee eſpyed his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Floreſtan</hi> and <hi>Quedragant</hi> lying among the ſlaughtered bodies:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7181:241"/>
whereat he conceiued ſuch inward griefe, that he was ready to fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his horſe. Being alighted, and perceiuing in them no motion of life at all; his complaints were ſo pitifull and extreame, that euery eye did much compaſſionate him, and the King was made acquainted with his heauy caſe. Whereupon, immediatly hee mounted on horſe-back, not for any good-will to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan</hi> or <hi>Quedragant,</hi> but onely to comfort <hi>Galaor,</hi> whom hee loued moſt intirely. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his malice, he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as he rode along, what daunger <hi>Floreſtan</hi> did thruſt himſelfe into, on the day of battaile againſt King <hi>Cil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadan,</hi> and that (but for him) he had beene wounded to death by <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiel,</hi> as already hath beene at large declared. In remembrance whereof, he deſired to ſaue his life, if poſſible it might be; and therefore, ſo ſoone as he came to them, he commanded their bodies to be carried into one of his Tents, and that his own Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Chirurgions, ſhould look diligently to their wounds.</p>
                  <p>Vpon ſight and ſearch made, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their skill and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they found their hurts to bee very dangerous, but not deadly: for at their firſt dreſsing, they found ſuch hopefull ſignes of recouery, that they vndertook (within certain dayes) to warrant their cure. <hi>Galaor</hi> on this comfortable pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rſwaſion, left them to their reſt and quiet, and went to the King, who was ſet in Councell, demaunding the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his knights, what further was to be done againſt his enemies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what daunger might enſue, by admitting them to gather freſh ſupply and ſtrength, and that it would be both honour and profit, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To this aduice all the knights condiſcended without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any one; and hereupon it was reſolued, that each man ſhould bee in readines the next morning, ſo ſoone as the Trumpet gaue forth ſummons, which was performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, But they met with ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſiſtance then they expected; for <hi>Dragonis,</hi> with ſo ſmall a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men as he had with him, had ſo fortified the paſſage, and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it ſo manfully, that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them were ſore wounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could get the leaſt meanes of entrance. Notwithſtanding, in the end, he was faine to leaue it, and ſeeke for ſafety in the Fortreſſe of the Burning Lake: but thither he was purſued, and there beſieged both by Sea and land, to keep them off the Towne from iſſuing forth, and to cut off all hope of ſuccour, which they continually awayted from little <hi>Brittaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe it would be a matter too prolixe and tedious, to report all the skirmiſhes and attempts which they had againſt each other during the ſiege, and it being a thing very litle appertaining to out hiſtory, which tendeth onely to the actions of <hi>Amadis,</hi> who remained now in <hi>Gaule</hi> with his Father King <hi>Perion:</hi> Let it ſuffiſe yee, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſiege had continued 3, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths and more, two things were the cauſe of bringing them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde. The one becauſe they of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7181:242"/>
Towne had receiued Letters from <hi>Agrayes,</hi> that hee lay ſicke in little <hi>Brittaine,</hi> by which meanes he could not leuy competent forces to their expectation. The other, becauſe King <hi>Liſuart</hi> reciued aduertiſement from his Vncle Count <hi>Argamont,</hi> that ſeuen of his neighbour Kings, had made great prouiſion for the inuading of his kingdome, which required ſuch care, as needfully ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonged. This aduice likewiſe gaue further intelligence, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalaus</hi> the Enchanter, was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes heereof: becauſe he had perſwaded them to this attempt, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the aduantage of King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> abſence at the Burning Lake, and the ſmall ſtore of knights remaining then in Great <hi>Brittaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When King <hi>Liſuart</hi> heard theſe newes, hee conſulted with his thoughts, what was beſt to be done; and after much diſcourſe with his owne minde, he concluded, to take compoſition with <hi>Galuanes,</hi> if hee would but propound it. And it fell out ſo fortunatly, that the very ſame day, deſire of conference was vrged by the other ſide, with offer of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the place. Prouided, that the king would permit him and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple freely to depart, and ſuch priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as hee deteyned, with an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of truce for two whole yeares, if he liked to allow thereof. Vpon many entercourſes paſſing on either ſide; the offer was accepted, and truce concluded, ſo that the King (the very ſame day) entred the Towne.</p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Madaſima</hi> preſented him the keyes, humblie caſting her ſelfe at his feete, teares ſtreaming abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly from her eyes, ſhe ſaid. Alas Sir, if euer pitty found place in your Princely breſt, let it now appeare, and take compaſſion on a poore diſ-inherited Lady.</p>
                  <p>This humiliation of hers, wonne ſuch power in all the knights there preſent, as there was no one of them but gladly made tender of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in her behalfe. Eſpecially <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> who vndertook the mater for her ſpeaking thus to the King. Vpon my faith Sir, reſpect in this caſe is very needfully required, and if euer in my life I did yee any acceptable ſeruice, let me now humbly entreate and to my vttermoſt poſſibility, that (for my ſake) you would be gracious to her. Truſt me <hi>Galaor,</hi> anſwered the King, if I ſhould recompence your high deſeruings, the Exchequer of all my vttermoſt, were not able to doe it. So calling <hi>Galuanes,</hi> hee thus proceeded. <hi>Galuanes,</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>Galaor;</hi> and hoping, withall, that heereafter you wil acknowledge the fauour I afford ye: I giue this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to you and <hi>Madaſima,</hi> which (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my liking) you haue vſurped, and now (againſt your will) is to me rendred. See therfore, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after you declare your ſelues to bee better aduiſed, &amp; both you &amp; yours to vſe homage &amp; fidelity to me, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you ought to do in duty.</p>
                  <p>Moſt humbly did <hi>Galuanes</hi> giue thankes to the King, ſwearing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the oath of alleageance; and the, Army hauing taken refreſhing for the ſpace of ſeuen or eight daies, the King commanded preparation to depart thence. So on the Sunday following, earely in the morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Maſſe, they went aboord their Shippes, accompanied with <hi>Galua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and many more to take their farewell. Ankers being weighed, &amp; their ſayles hoyſed, they ſet forth to the maine Sea; the windes ſeruing them ſo proſperouſly, that in fewe dayes (without any diſaſter) they arriued in the Porte and hauen of <hi>Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </argument>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that King <hi>Cilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and <hi>Galaor</hi> had left <hi>Amadis</hi> in <hi>Gaule,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came much more ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary then euer hee had beene: for the company of <hi>Bruneo</hi> was now grown inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>patible to him, being ſo diuerſly intreated in their affections. Becauſe <hi>Bruneo</hi> enioyed (almoſt) whatſoeuer his ſoule deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, beholding daylie the Princeſſe <hi>Melicia,</hi> whom he ſo dearely affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that all things elſe ſlipt beſide his remembrance. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Amadis</hi> being ſo far diſtant from his <hi>Oriana,</hi> all pleaſures whatſoeuer were to him irkeſome and tedious: which cauſed him to refraine all company, the better to conforme himſelfe to ſolitude. It chanced on a day, being walking alone, (his Squire onely excepted) in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and neare to the Sea ſide: hee caſt his eye towards Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> and eſpyed a Ship making in to the Port, which Ship hee ſuppoſed to come from <hi>London;</hi> whereupon hee preſently commanded <hi>Gandalin,</hi> to goe know of whence it was, and hee ſeated himſelf (in the meane while) vnder a ſpreading Tree, to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his wonted lamentations. Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his head vpon his left arme, and ſending a pittious looke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Country, where formerly he had found ſuch ſweete entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: breathing foorth a vehement ſigh, thus he began.</p>
                  <p>Poore vnfortunate <hi>Amadis,</hi> is it poſſible for thee to continue long in this torment? Alas, if Loue heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore was fauourable to thee, he now makes thee pay too deare vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for it. What ſaid I? Loue? O no, it is not Loue, not is Loue the cauſe thereof: but mine owne miſ-fortune, that being enuious of thy ſweete eaſe and felicity, forged and enforced the Kings diſcontentment, therby to be thy vtter ruine, by loſſe of her ſight, on whom depended thy life and onely happines, which is a burden more vnſupportable for thee to beare, then if a thouſand deathes were impoſed on thee toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But no beatitude is deſtinied to me, and I may well bee aſhamed to wiſhe it, conſidering, <hi>Oriana</hi> would be too much offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Why then ſhall I couet any ſuch euill, ſhe neuer affoording mee but grace and fauour? For the very leaſt ſadneſſe that I can ſuffer, ſhee feeles it euen as ſenſibly as mine owne ſoule. Theſe complaints were accompanied with ſuch floods of teares, that maine riuolets ranne downe his cheekes, leauing him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (along while) to vtter foorth one word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:7181:243"/>
As hee continued in theſe paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a dart flewe hard by his eare, whereof hee tooke no care, ſo much was his minde addicted elſewhere. But <hi>Gandalin</hi> returning then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, eſpied (in a buſhie thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket) a Gianteſſe of immeaſurable ſtature, preparing to let flye another dart at his Maſter: whereupon hee cryed out aloud to him; and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> ſuddenly ſtarting, demanded the reaſon of his clamour. Why Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, quoth he, doe yee not ſee yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deuil, that endeauors to wound yee. And ſo ſhewed him the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anteſſe, towards whom <hi>Amadis</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his ſteppes; but ſhe fled away thwart the Forreſt, running as ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Hart, and (in her flight) reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered <hi>Amadis</hi> his horſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mounting her ſelfe, ſhe thus cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out. Know <hi>Amadis,</hi> that I am thine ancient enemy <hi>Andadone,</hi> the Gianteſſe of the Sad Iſle: who tels thee plainely, that if I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe mine intent, yet time ſhall let thee know how much I loue thee.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Amadis</hi> perceiued, that it was a woman whom hee had purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he would follow her no further: but commaunded <hi>Gandalin</hi> to doe it, and to kill her if he could. <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> obeyed his Lords command, and laboured earneſtly till he ouer-tooke her. In which time, as <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> was ſitting downe againe vnder the tree, with intent to recommence his former complaints: hee eſpyed <hi>Enill,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Durin,</hi> whom <hi>Gandalin</hi> had found abord the Ship, that his Maſter had ſent before to enquire of. Whereupon <hi>Amadis</hi> ranne and embraced him, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what good newes hee had brought from Great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> My Lord, (quoth he,) Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> moſt kindly commends her ſelfe to ye, and ſends ye this Letter; which inſtantly he deliuered to him. <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> perceiuing that ſhe repoſed truſt in <hi>Enill,</hi> bade him diſcouer what ſhe had further commaunded him. My Lord (anſwered <hi>Enill)</hi> ſhe intirely entreateth you, that you would grieue ſo little as poſſible may be in this Country, and not to depart hence, vntill you ſhall heare further tydings from her. And ſhe alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies you by me, that your linage is encreaſed, by the birth of a gallant ſweet Sonne, which my Siſter and I haue conueyed to ſafe nurſing: but he w<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as wary enough in diſcouering the maner of his loſſe. Great was the ioy and comfort of <hi>Amadis,</hi> to vnderſtand ſuch pleaſing newes from <hi>Oriana,</hi> howbeit, her command that he ſhould not part thence, was ſomewhat irkſome to him: becauſe it might bee preſumed by ſiniſter iudgments, that either neglect, or lack of courage, had driuen him to this retired kinde of life. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, happen whatſoeuer might to him, hee concluded, not to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe a iote of her charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Enill</hi> had ended his diſcourſe, <hi>Gandalin</hi> returned, who had ſlaine the Gianteſſe, and brought her head hanging at his ſaddle bow. <hi>Amadis</hi> was very glad to behold it, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know in what manner he had done it. My Lord, quoth <hi>Gandalin,</hi> I purſuing her very cloſely, and ſhee gallopping on the horſe which ſhe had ſtollen from you, as hoping to ſhippe her ſelfe before I ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake her: the poore horſe was ſo weake in the backe, being ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the loade of ſo huge a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; as I imagined, hee had broken his neck with falling downe vnder her. At which apt opportunity, I inſtantly arriued, and before ſhe had power to recouer her ſelfe, I was her deaths-man, as this teſtimony there-of may well witneſſe to ye. By my
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7181:243"/>
troth, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> this will bee a goodly preſent for <hi>Bruneo;</hi> therfore wee will returne to the Court, and there ſhalt thou haue the honour of deliuering it. As for thee, my deare friend <hi>Enill,</hi> without being ſeene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where elſe, I would haue thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to my gracious Princeſſe, and giue her to know, that I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thanke her for her Letter, as alſo for thy further meſſage from her. But yet I entreate, her to take ſome pitty and reſpect on mine honor, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling me to leade an idle life here: Neuertheleſſe, I will be obedient to her in any thing, and all my dayes are dedicated ſolely to her ſeruice. And yet I very well know, that no man can (by vertue) winne himſelfe ſuch renowne and reputation; but time and mens malice, will diſgrace him on the very leaſt occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Goe then in Gods Name, to whoſe ſafe protection I commend thee, and doe my humble duty to my ſacred Goddeſſe.</p>
                  <p>So returned <hi>Enill</hi> to his Shippe, and <hi>Amadis</hi> to the Court to his friend <hi>Bruneo,</hi> who was much better healed of his late receiued hurt, then of his old loue-ſicke languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the fire whereof ſtill more and more encreaſed the flame of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which he well perceiuing, and that he could not (as yet) reach the height of his intent, without much loſſe of time and hard endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, as a purgation to ſuch ſlothful negligence, and the better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his knighthoods reputation, he reſolued to viſite ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in ſearch of aduentures, and to accompliſh ſuch actions of Armes, that his fame might ſpeake it ſelfe in all places. Hereupon, ſo ſoone as the Gianteſſe head had bin ſhewen him, <hi>Amadis</hi> and he walking aſide together, he thus ſpake. Truſt me my Lord, the youth of my yeares, and the ſlender eſteem whereinto I haue hitherto liued, eſpecially among knights of fame and merit, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly incite me, to forſake this loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring life of eaſe and pleaſure, and vndergoe another more painful, yet profitable, to ranke my ſelfe with men of ſo high eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly beſech you, that if you haue any diſpoſition to ſeeke after aduentures, you would be pleaſed to accept of my company, or elſe to licence my departure alone, for I muſt bee gone to morrow morning very earely.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard theſe words, and remembred the iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo ſtrictly impoſed on him by the Letter from <hi>Oriana,</hi> which <hi>Enill</hi> formerly had brought him; he grew extreamely offended: yet both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling his diſtemper, and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe to <hi>Bruneo,</hi> he thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Beleeue me (deare Friend) I haue (all my life-time) beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of ſuch company as yours; being well aſſured, that nothing but honour and happines could then happen to me. But the conference I haue had ſo lately with the King, and his ſtrict impoſition, for my not leauing his Country as yet, abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me of your aſſociation, then which nothing can be more diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me. Wherefore I deſire you to hold me excuſed, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but that the hand of Heauen will euery where defend ye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bruneo</hi> ſeeing himſelfe thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by <hi>Amadis,</hi> went to viſite <hi>Melicia,</hi> whom he acquainted with the reaſon of his ſudden departing: entreating her to continue graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vnto him, becauſe hee preferred her fauour before all things elſe whatſoeuer. <hi>Melicia</hi> diſcreetly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that ſhee muſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encline her will, according as pleaſed the King and Queene, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7181:244"/>
diſpoſe of her: aſſuring him neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, that he was the Gentleman, whom (before all other) ſhee could willingly accept as her husband, if ſo be it ſtood as well with their liking. As he and ſhee continued this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, taking gracious and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble farewells of each other: the king entred, to whom <hi>Bruneo</hi> addreſſing himſelfe, he declared the occaſion of his departure. Which the King allowed to bee both good and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; and becauſe it grew ſome-what late, and a ſeaſonable houre for reſt and repoſe: all was referred till the next morning, for more ample parting diſcourſe. Bright day no ſooner beganne to appeare, but <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> armed himſelfe at all points, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, going to heare Maſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutely. And as hee was ready to mounte on horſebacke, the King and <hi>Amadis</hi> came to him, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting him forth of the Citie, where they committed him to God and all good fortune: wherein it ſeemed he prooued ſo proſperous, that (in ſhort time) hee finiſhed ſo many rare aduentures, as would require larger ſcope then heere is limited; beſide it is not materiall to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe which wee labour to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</p>
                  <p>Returne we therefore to <hi>Amadis,</hi> who hauing already ſoiourned in <hi>Gaule</hi> three moneths and an halfe, while King <hi>Liſuart</hi> made his warre in the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza,</hi> and his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation being much diminiſhed, by his diſcontinuance from Armes, ſo that euery tongue babled to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage: eſpecially Ladies and Damoſels, who came from all parts in queſt of him, and not finding him, returned ſo highly diſcontented, that they laide on him many blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imputations, which came con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to his eare. Neuertheleſſe, for any reſpect in the world whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, he would not diſobey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana:</hi> but rather choſe to vndergo thoſe taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of diſgrace, till King <hi>Liſuart</hi> returned into Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> again. Who receiued tydings at his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall, that his enemies were already paſſed into the Iſle of <hi>Lionine,</hi> and euen vpon entrance into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Now, albeit he appeared to make ſmall reckoning thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own people, as being feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to diſtaſte them; yet afterward, his minde was farre otherwiſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But eſpecially the Queene was much moued, greatly bemoaning the abſence of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and thoſe that went away with him, ſpeaking it publikely; that if the King had them now in his ſeruice, and as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at his command, as they were wont to be; he might aſſure himſelfe of the victory.</p>
                  <p>And if the Queene were ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, what ſhall wee thinke of <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Mabila?</hi> who as they ſate deuiſing together, ſpake of the knights then abſent from the Kings ſeruice, onely through his wrongs done to <hi>Amadis</hi> and his followers, ſo that <hi>Mabila</hi> ſaid to the Princeſſe. Madame, although the King hath runne into an errour, it followes not, that you ſhould doe the like, eſpecially in matters ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting you. Me thinks you ſhould rather ſend to my Couſin, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent all occaſions that may offend him, earneſtly entreating him, that if he will not ſtand for the King; yet (at leaſt) he will not be againſt him, in the hope you haue one day to be his heire and Ladie of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which then may ſucceede to him by your coniunction in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Send therefore ſome meſſage that may content him, and if hee be diſpleaſed at his ſo long abiding in <hi>Gaule,</hi> let him elſewhere recreate his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7181:244"/>
ſpirits, till time and fortune ſend a ſeaſon more fit for your deſires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oriana</hi> liked well this friendly aduice, and wrote immediatly to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> (by a Damoſell)) that newly had brought her diuers preſents from the Queene <hi>Eliſena)</hi> all that ſhe and <hi>Mabila</hi> had concluded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and by her Letter fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him therewith. Whereat he was not a little ioyfull, being now at liberty to go where himſelfe liſted. And yet he was in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie, not knowing readily what to determine. For it was the wil of <hi>Oriana,</hi> that hee ſhould not ſerue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and to lend him any aſſiſtance, was as much againſt his own minde. To reconcile theſe two extreames, hee reſolued to vſe the aduice of King <hi>Perion,</hi> &amp; finding him one day at conuenient leiſure, walking along by the Sea ſide; as they were entring into the purpoſed diſcourſe: they eſpyed (afarre off) a knight ryding towards them, mounted vpon a bay Courſer, but ſo ſpent and wearie, that hee was ſcarce able to endure any trauaile. The knights Armour, Shield and Coate of Armes, were bruiſed and battered, that it was (almoſt) impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to take knowledge of him: and yet King <hi>Perion</hi> gathered by his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, that he was ſome knight errant, wherefore he ſtepped forward to welcome him, and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> looking aduiſedly on him, knew him to bee his brother <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> whereupon he ſaid to the King (who had neuer ſeene him.) Sir, know you not this knight? hee is one of the beſt in all the world, and your Son. My Son? anſwered the King. Yes truely (quoth <hi>Amadis)</hi> it is <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> of whom I haue remembred you many times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Floreſtan</hi> beholding <hi>Amadis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to coniecture, that the other was King <hi>Perion:</hi> wherefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting ſuddenly from his horſe, the King came to embrace him, and he kneeled downe to kiſſe his feete, but King <hi>Perion</hi> would not permit it, taking him vp louingly in his armes, ſaying, he was moſt heartily welcome. Then taking him by the hand, they walked on towards the Caſtell to the Queene: who gaue him moſt gracious entertainment, as well for the Kings ſake, as for his renowned fame thorow all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. And as they conferred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the fortunes of King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> king <hi>Perion</hi> ſaid vnto him, Son, haue ye heard of his enemies enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe againſt him? I haue Sir (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Floreſtan)</hi> and for ought I can collect to the contrary, their power is ſo ſtrong, as, if heauen be not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable, impoſſible is the vtter-moſt of his reſiſtance, whereat wee haue little reaſon to be ſorry, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how matters haue been paſt. Sonne, quoth the king, I can eaſily beleeue, that king <hi>Liſuart</hi> hath fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſome occaſions; neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, I haue often heard him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for diuers good vertues: which perſwadeth me, that this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines may fall out as ſucceſſefull for him, as many others heeretofore haue done. Moreouer, it ill becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth any king, to wiſh or deſire the ruine of another, except he make warre againſt him, vpon ſome vniuſt occaſion.</p>
                  <p>It began now to waxe ſomewhat late, and the Tables were couered for Supper, wherefore the king ſaid to <hi>Amadis:</hi> Sonne, conduct your Brother, and ſee him diſarmed, then bring him to ſupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7181:245"/>
of the wrong which you doe not onely to your ſelfe, but likewiſe to all your race and kinred, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long a time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>full, and careleſſe of Armes, whereby many tongues are liberall in your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and iudge (that being become faint-hearted) you are growen alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether negligent. In good faith, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> they may iudge as they pleaſe: but I hope heereafter, to cauſe them alter their bad opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of me. As they held on this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the King came, and had them with him into the Haule, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing themſelues with variety of viandes, the Tables were at length with-drawen, and a due houre came to goe to reſt; <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> taking their leaue of the King for that night.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Amadis</hi> being vnable to ſleep, his thoughts laboured continually, how he might recouer the credit he had loſt: concluding with himſelfe to runne a contrary bias, to the raſh ſpeeches rumorde out againſt him. And that he might the better attain thereto, one while hee determined to goe againſt king <hi>Liſuart:</hi> but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly (remembring the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Lady <hi>Oriana)</hi> hee became quite changed, not knowing (on either ſide) how to make his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Till after a long combate with his priuate cogitations, hee thought it beſt to forget the iniuries done him in Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and to take part with the King, as well in regard that his ſide was the weaker, as alſo, if he ſhould ſuſtain the foile, <hi>Oriana</hi> might loſe all hope of euer being his, or he hers. Heereupon, hee roſe very earely the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and being accompanied with <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> entred the Kings Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where finding him awake, they gaue him the good morrow, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> ſpake thus.</p>
                  <p>Sir, all this night my minde hath endured much trauaile, about your conference with my Brother <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> the laſt euening, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the daunger whereinto King <hi>Liſuart</hi> may fall, thorow the want of ſuccour. In theſe meditations I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred alſo that duty, which (as you then ſaid euery vertuous Prince ſtands obliged vnto, to maintaine the rightfull liberties of another Prince, being wrongfully, and (vpon no iuſt occaſion) inuaded. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof, I am determined, if you thinke it conuenient, and will thereto licence me; goe into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and without any regard of the wrongs I haue ſuſtayned, not onely to aſſiſt King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> but his ſubiects alſo, who ſtand no way guilty in his offence. And truſt me Sir, I vſe not theſe ſpeeches to yee, but vpon vrgent occaſion; for heere is my brother, who knowes what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches are ſpred abroad of me; for hauing a while abſented my ſelfe from Armes: whereby it appeareth to many, that I am growne cold in the purſuite of aduentures, for the dangers elſewhere hapning, where-of I neuer dreamed. Therefore, that euery one may take true notice of me; if heauen be ſo pleaſed, I will in ſuch affaires make ſuch reall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of my duty, that my renown (which ſeemeth to lye buried) ſhall reuiue it ſelfe againe, and with much more glory then euer it yet gained.</p>
                  <p>Sonne (quoth the king) you well know, that I haue euer beene a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of good men and goodneſſe, and perceiuing king <hi>Liſuart</hi> to bee one of that number. I haue iuſt cauſe to affoord him any ayde and fauour, whereſoeuer I am able to compaſſe the meanes. And if I ſhould deferre it this inſtant; the cauſe is eaſily knowen, onely the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7181:245"/>
difference betweene him and you. But ſeeing that your intention is changed, and that you will make one in ſo worthy a buſines: I will goe along with yee for company: grieuing at nothing elſe, but that the time is too ſhort for leuying our people. For if I had the leyſure to prepare an Army; aſſure your ſelfe, I would leade along with me a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aſſembly. But that defect ſhall not ſtay my preſent purpoſe. I will onely take ſuch knights as are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt for me, and ſo away vpon my iourney.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Floreſtan</hi> heard this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration; hee ſtood ſilent a long while, as vnable to vtter a word, but at laſt; he ſaid to the King. By my faith, Sir, when I conſider the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> which (but for the fauour ſhewen to vs by Lord <hi>Galaor,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza)</hi> had coſt the deare price of all our liues: I hold it impoſſible for me, to doe or wiſhe him any good. Your Highneſſe is not ignorant, how long a time (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then) he deadly hated vs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times making his vaunt, to bee the vtter ruine and extirpation of vs all. Neuertheleſſe, ſeeing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtand on ſuch tearmes as now they doe: I am wel contented, both in the honor of you, and for you are thereto ſo nobly affected, to forget all iniuries at this time, and will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you, as it is my duty to doe. Moreouer, by our agreement made at the Burning Lake, for the ſpace of two yeares, I may beare no armes againſt him, whereby I ſtand partly bound, that if I will bee ſeene at all in the action, I muſt needes bee for him.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> the beſt courſe that we can take then, is cloſely to purſue our enterpriſe, without any other company, then we three one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For if our number ſhould be greater, whatſoeuer we can doe, will but deſerue the lateſt welcome: and therefore (if it, were poſſible) in mine opinion, wee would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be knowne of any. Let it be ſo then, replied the king, I like the motion well, and I haue three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours alike in all reſpects, very apt and proper to our intent, for our better knowledge and aſſiſting of one another; let vs goe preſently, and make proofe of them. So lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Chamber, they deſcended downe into the Court, where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently entred before them, a Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell very richly attired, mounted on a beautifull Palfray, ſhee being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with three Squires one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, each bearing a goodly ſquare. Cheſt before her, and the king thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhe demaunded for him, went towards her with <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> ſaluting her courteouſly, and demaunding if ſhee would ſpeake with the Queene. No Sir, quoth ſhe, my errand is onely to you, and theſe two knights, to whom I am ſent by the Lady of the Vnknowne Iſle, with theſe three preſents which heere you behold.</p>
                  <p>Then cauſing the cheſts to be ſet downe and opened, three Shieldes, three Helmets, and three Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, were taken out of them. The Shields were Siluer, ſeamed all ouer with golden Serpents, ſo arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially wrought, that they appeared neere to life. The Coat-Armours were all alike, but the Helmets diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for one was white, the other greene, and the third gold. The white was preſented by the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to the king, and the Coate-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour thereto belonging; the green to <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> and the gold to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> with theſe words. Sir, my Lady hath ſent you theſe Armes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires you by me, that you will heere-after imploy them better, and your
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7181:246"/>
ſelfe alſo, then (for too long a time) you haue done heere. <hi>Amadis</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her ſo forward in ſpeech, ſtood in feare, leſt his loue affaires with <hi>Oriana</hi> ſhould be diſcouered: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to breake her off from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther language in that kinde, hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Faire Damoſell, I pray yee moſt humbly thanke your Lady on my behalfe, and tell her; I make much leſſe account of her counſell ſent me, then I doe of her preſent, which I will imploy according to my power.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, replyed the Damoſel, ſhe hath ſent armes to you all three, to the end, that you may know, and helpe one another (if need bee) in King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> warre. How? quoth the King, doth your Miſtreſſe know that we meane to be there, and wee our ſelues (within leſſe ſpace then an houre) did not ſo much as dream thereon? I know not that, anſwered the Damoſell, but ſhe aſſured mee, that (at this very houre) I ſhould finde yee all heere, and in this very place, further commanding me, that after I had deliuered ye theſe Arms, I ſhould paſſe hence into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> whither ſhe hath likewiſe ſent mee; wherefore bethinke your ſelues, if you will command me any ſeruice. Now truſt me Damoſell, (replyed the King) you ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part hence, vntill you haue dined. And ſo conducted her further into the Caſtel, where the beſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that could be deuiſed, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on her. Hauing ſuſtayned Nature, and taken leaue of her three knights, ſhe ſet onward on her way to the Sea-ſide, and inſtantly imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>After her departure, <hi>Amadis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with himſelfe, that the day of battell was not farre off, and that (not without great cauſe) <hi>Vrganda</hi> had ſent them thoſe Armes: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof, his deſire grew much more earneſt to be there, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it had done: and therefore to haſten the enterpriſe, he cauſed <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> (ſecretly) to prouide Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pint, wherewith acquainting both the King and <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> they reſolued to ſet away, the night enſuing. Being all aboord, the winde ſate ſo conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently for them, that, vneſpied by any, they launched forth into the maine Sea, coaſting about the Iſle of Great <hi>Brittaine:</hi> where, very ſoon after, they landed ſo neere as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they might, to the place where the ſeauen Kings lay encamped: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, after they had once noted their diſpoſition, to ioyne them-ſelues with King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> And to that intent, they entred a Forreſt, where their Squires erected them a Pauillion, and where they attended more ample newes of the Army: ſending daylie one of their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the enemies Campe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire when the day of battel ſhould be. Alſo they ſent another, to <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> by whom they gaue him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that they were in <hi>Gaule.</hi> And the Squire had expreſſe charge to tell him, that he left them al three together, and earneſtly deſired, that (after the victory) hee would write to them, concerning his owne good health, and their other friends.</p>
                  <p>Wiſely did the Squires fulfill the charge committed to their truſt, ſo that on the third day following, the firſt returned to them, and reported, that the Army of the ſeauen Kings was very great and ſtrong, by reaſon of infinit numbers of ſtrangers, who were lately there arriued, and that they layed ſharpe ſiege to a Caſtell, which was ſaid to belong to certain Ladies. And albeit it was very ſtrong, and almoſt impregnable by power of Armes; yet they were in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7181:246"/>
great danger of yeelding it, becauſe food and ſuſtenance greatly fayled therein. And further (quoth the Squire) as I croſſed thorow the Campe, I heard <hi>Archalaus</hi> the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter conferre with two of the Kings, ſaying, as hee walked along with them, that within ſixe dayes they would bid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> battel, becauſe no further order ſhould bee taken, for bringing them in any victuals by Sea, and that their munition began to fayle them alſo. Yet all goes well (anſwered <hi>Amadis)</hi> in the meane while, we ſhall haue good leiſure to refreſh and recreate our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>The very ſame day, the other Squire (ſent to the Campe of King <hi>Liſuart)</hi> returned likewiſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he met with <hi>Galaor,</hi> and what countenance hee ſhewed in reading the Letter. And truſt mee (quoth he) very hardly could he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from teares, when he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that you were all three in <hi>Gaule:</hi> for he made a ſetled aſſurance of the victory, if the King could haue enioyed yee in his company. Moreouer, he ſends ye word by me, that if hee eſcape with life from the field, he wil forthwith make haſte to ſee ye. But what (quoth <hi>Amadis)</hi> is thine opinion of their Army. Truſt me my Lord, (anſwered the Squire) ſo few fighting men as they be, yet are they al marſhalled in exceeding good order, and diuers worthy knights are ſaid to be among them: but they are all ouer few, in regard of the others mighty multitude. Notwithſtanding, King <hi>Liſuart</hi> is not daunted a iote: but intendeth (as I heard it credibly reported) within two dayes to meete them, or elſe the Caſtell of Ladies will be conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to yeeld it ſelfe, hauing no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of men nor meate. Well, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> we ſhall ſee what will enſue on this buſines.</p>
                  <p>Thus they continued in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, vntill ſuch time as they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that the two Armies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ioyne: whereupon they diſlodged, and drew neerer to the Campe of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> which was ſeated on the ridge of an hill, and ſo neere to the enemy, that but a little Riuer diuided them, running tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the plaine, where King <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne</hi> (earneſtly deſirous of fight) had paſſed his men. This King laſt mentioned to ye, was choſen the chïefe; and Coronall of the whole Army: belonging to the ſeauen Kings, and to him all the principall Captaines of the band, had made ſolemne oath and promiſe the day before, to obey him without any contradiction. For he deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe (as he ſaid) neither could haue any iote more; but onely the honour of the enterpriſe: referring all the ſpoyle and booty to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, &amp; the common Souldiers. And that he might the better acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his intent, he ordained nine battalions, in each of which hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed twelue thouſand knights: reſeruing to his owne charge, fifteen hundred, and more, commaunding on the morrow (by breake of day) the Trumpets &amp; Clarions to giue ſummons, for all to ſet themſelues in order, and bee in readineſſe. Before he would diſlodge, ſeeing his men forward to their deuoire: for their encouragement, he thus ſpake.</p>
                  <p>What need it (Gentlemen) that I ſhould vſe any great perſwaſion for your bold fighting: conſidering you are the only authors of this war, and wherein you haue elected mee for your chiefe conducter? And that is the only reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mouing me to ſpeak, to the end, you may the more heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fixe before your eyes, the cauſe why you are aſſembled in ſo great a multitude.

                  <p>King <hi>Aranigne</hi> hauing thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his Souldiers, hee cauſed them to march in good order to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their enemies: who likewiſe marched in maine battell on the hill top, making ſuch a glittering radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with their Armes, that it was a moſt goodly ſight to behold.

For in weening (vnder confidence of power) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge their iniuries, their ſhame ſhall thereby be encreaſed, and a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable concluſion of their liues, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily enforced, and ſought by themſelues. Full well you know, that we are no new learners, how to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7181:247"/>
be ſeene in ſuch conflicts as theſe: but old and well tryed Souldiers, ſo experimented and approoued by themſelues; and ſo (I hope) at this time they ſhall finde vs. Their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie victory, is grounded onely on the huge multitude of men in their Campe, a baſe and raſcal breed of people, collected from many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous places, the moſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without order, obedience or diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. The very ſight of our well-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected approach, will ſtrike amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their ſoules; yea, before we ſhall haue leyſure to vaile our laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and let vs but once enforce them to diſorder, wee haue as much as we can deſire. Marche we on then vndauntedly, and let vs make them know, that they are no meete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for our company: Onely, that our ground will be faſtened in being their graues, and our hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarued wolues ſatisfied with their carrion, as three or foure times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, ſuch as they, haue beene ouer-thrown in ſeueral battailes, by the vertue and magnanimity of you and your aunceſtors.</p>
                  <p>Such were the words of this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle King to his knights, who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their enemies making towards them, marched in a well ordered part to meet them. King <hi>Perion, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> &amp; <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> lay hard by, cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ambuſhed, with no intent to ſtir themſelues, till they ſaw how the fight would ſpeed on either ſide. Perceiuing <hi>Brian</hi> and his troupe to coutche their launces, they beheld them forthwith among their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; mony good knights layed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on the earth, and as many ſlain outright. But King <hi>Targadan,</hi> who led the firſt battallion of King <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne,</hi> was ſuddenly ſuccoured by <hi>Abſadan,</hi> with 1200. knights, by which meanes <hi>Brian</hi> was conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue backe againe. King <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> perceiuing it, ſaid to <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> Me thinkes, it is now high time to ſhewe our ſelues; for neuer can we looke for fitter occaſion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemy hath to much aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ouer King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> people. On then Sir (quoth they) in Gods name let vs go helpe them.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſpeaking; they gaue the ſpur to their horſes, &amp; the firſt that King <hi>Perion</hi> met, was king <hi>Targadan,</hi> who before had not charged any knight, but downe hee went to the ground. But King <hi>Perion</hi> gaue him ſuch a welcome with his Launce, that it pierced his Shield &amp; armor, and ſo paſſed on quite thorow his body, that hee fell downe dead to the ground. If this encounter proued ſo hard to him, no leſſe was that of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadan</hi> the Braue: for <hi>Amadis</hi> met him with ſuch might, that hee gaue his ſoule preſent paſſage out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The enemies became ſo daunted hereat, that their hearts failed them, and <hi>Brian</hi> and his followers preſſed ſore vpon them. <hi>Floreſtan</hi> made his aime at King <hi>Cardueil,</hi> in whom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted (well neere) all their hope, &amp; met him at ſuch apt aduantage, that he caſt him quite out of his Saddle, and down he fell between his horſes feete. Now began a moſt dreadfull conflict between the two armies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſtroue with maineſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which ſhould moſt offend the other: &amp; they that had ſeen <hi>Amadis</hi> cut the way thorow the crouds, wold haue thought him no ſuch maner of man, as layſlothfully idle ſix months together; for he neuer ſtroke, but it either ſlew outright, or moſt cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, notwithſtanding all their ſtout reſiſtances. For they of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> fought for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty &amp; ſafety: whereas K. <hi>Aranigne</hi> &amp; his men, labored only to conquer anothers country, thereby to enrich the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues; thus each ſide contended
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7181:248"/>
who ſhould doe beſt, in bearing thence the honour of the day. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> had his horſe ſlain vnder him; but hee was ſpeedily ſuccoured, by ſuch ayde as King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> and his followers ſent him: who did all perfourme ſuch incredible deedes of Armes in enery place as their enemies fell into confuſion; &amp; King <hi>Aranigne</hi> was ſo ſore wounded, that, being paſt any hope of life; hee fled to his Shippes, and the greater part of his people after him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>As the other ſide purſued them very valiantly, <hi>Brutaxat,</hi> one of the beſt knights in the whole Army of the ſeauen Kings, beholding this faint-hearted flight, and foule diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order: thruſt in with his followers, &amp; made ſtay of them that chaſed King <hi>Aranigne,</hi> beginning as bloody a fight againe, as formerly had bin. In which ſpace, they that moſt feared the fights ſucceſſe, got into their Ships, &amp; many were ſo ſaued: but <hi>Amadis</hi> entring among them, aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Brutaxat</hi> with ſuch a powerfull ſtroke, that down fel heon the earth. This, much augmented the terror of the enemy, ſo that, for their eaſie means of flight, they threw downe their weapons &amp; armor in the field; ſome running to the Sea, others to the woods &amp; rocks, euen as Fortune could beſt conduct them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though King <hi>Liſuart</hi> &amp; his knights, found worke enough againſt their foes in the beginning: yet euery ey took particular obſeruation of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders done that day, by three knights, bearing Serpents in their armes, ſo that the King himſelf often ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, ſaying: Either theſe are <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſes,</hi> or three deuils in their likenes. Notwithſtanding, when he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what iniury he had done him, he then fell into a contrary perſwaſion.</p>
                  <p>Thus King <hi>Liſuart</hi> remained vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, and encamped himſelf (for that day) in the ſame place where he conquered his enemies: and as he diſarmed himſelfe, he queſtioned, what was become of the knights of the Serpents? No other anſwere could then bee returned, but that they were ſeene gallopping towards the forreſt, with all the ſwifteſt ſpeed their horſes could make. On my faith (quoth the King) I am not a little diſpleaſed, that they would not remaine with me: for he that hath three ſuch knights in his company, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y boldly boaſte of ſecure aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Sir (anſwered a Squier, that met them ryding to the Forreſt) all three of them ſpake to me, and gaue me charge to tell ye, that they were conſtrained to leaue your Army, &amp; beſtow their trauails in far countries where they may chance to fall into his power, that means to ſhew them but little mercy: humbly entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you to hold them excuſed, that they gaue you not due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence before their departing.</p>
                  <p>Vndoubtedly, theſe words proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued truer, then <hi>Amadis</hi> expected when he ſpake them: but the Squi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, continuing on his meſlage, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid. Sir, moreouer they deſire you, that if any part of bootie be fit for them: it may be giuen to thoſe Ladies, that defended their Caſtell ſo worthily for you, that ſo they may receiue ſome recompence for the iniuries done to them. Before God I ſweare, anſwered the King, their requeſt ſhal be accompliſhed. But fair Sir (quoth he to <hi>Galaor)</hi> doe not you imagine your brother <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> to be one of the three? No ſurely Sir, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> becauſe I receiued Letters (ſome few dayes ſince) from him, whereby he gaue me to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that neither he, nor <hi>Floreſtan</hi> would ſtirre out of <hi>Gaule,</hi> vntill they heard ſome newes from me.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7181:248"/>
I cannot chuſe then, replyed the King, but maruaile, of whence, and what they are. I know not, (quoth <hi>Galaor)</hi> but whatſoeuer they are, heauen ſhreld them from any il ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; for (neuer in my life) did I looke on more braue and worthie Knights, or men that could doe more for you, then this day they haue done.</p>
                  <p>So ſpent they out the reſt of the day, in no other diſcourſe (almoſt) but onely concerning the knights of the Serpents. And raiſing their Campe on the morrow, they went to <hi>Gandale,</hi> where the Queene and Ladies awayted the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: there alſo hee brake vp his Atmy, diſcharging euery man to his owne home.</p>

them with her deſire, entreeting them (at their Ladies motion) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of one nights entertainment in her Caſtell.</p>
                  <p>The knights being ſomewhat crazie, and wearied with the rough tempeſt endured on the Sea, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that her will accorded with their words, and that no treaſon lay hid vnder this honeſt out-ſide; yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to hers and their requeſt, riding ſoftly on with her, and entring into a pleaſant ſeated Caſtel, where they were moſt graciouſly entertained, and conducted to a very goodly Chamber, and there they vnarmed themſelues.

At length, they aroſe to finde either ſome window for aire, or doore for paſſage to get forth, but all was in vaine, no likelyhood appeared anywhere of opening, or that might yeeld them the ſmalleſt comfort. But continuing on, in this doubtfull maze, they could heare the ſteppes and treadings of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ouer their heads, and about ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or eight houres after, they ſaw a window opened vp aloft, and a knight (but meanely aged) putting thorow his head, demaunding (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnmanerly) what new-come gueſts came ſo willingly to looke for good entertainment there?

Neuertheleſſe, hee being a wiſe and vertuous Prince, beganne not onely to be of courage, but alſo to comfort them, in this manner. How now my Sonnes? are yee ſo ſoone daunted at the diſſemblings of Fortune? are yee now to learne her mutabilities (vpon my faith) I did euer hold ye to be more ſtrong and conſtant.

For, your extremity of ſadneſſe doth ſo ouer weigh my ſoule, as that is ſufficient onely to be my death. Therefore, reſume your wonted courage, and let vs put our truſt in God: he is almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and able to free vs from this place, committing all care to him, and reſting perſwaded of his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>But who could euer haue imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that, eſcaping the dangers in ſo bloody a Battaile: we ſhould fall into ſuch an accident, by the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions onely of a ſilly woman, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the couller of ſuch a dumbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? Therefore, louing Sonnes, ſeeing we are not in caſe to diſpoſe of our ſelues; ſetting apart all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pitty and compaſſion, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you can haue of me, or I of you: let vs be patient, and not miſlike our fortune, which we are not able any way to mend. <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> hearing their Father ſpeake with ſuch a chearefull and conſtant reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; it appeared to them, that they were disburdened of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieſt load of their diſaſter; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded, to reioyce in all tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations whatſoeuer ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto them. And ſo they ſpent all the reſt of the day, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing either meat or drinke, till ſomewhat late in the euening: at which time <hi>Archalaus</hi> came to them againe, and opened the window, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Danarda,</hi> and two auncient knights, bearing in their hands faire lighted Torches, and calling to his priſoners, he ſaid:</p>
                  <p>Knights, you that ſleep ſo ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at eaſe, is not your appetite yet ſtirring, to eate ſome good meate, if you could come by it? Sir, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> if you were pleaſed to giue vs any. By my ſoule, replyed <hi>Archalaus,</hi> I haue no will to giue yee any, but rather to take meate from ye, if ye had it. Notwithſtanding, becauſe ye ſhall not bee altogether diſcomforted, to delight ye a little, I haue ſome good tidings to tell yee, whereof (perhaps) you will be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. This euening, two Squires and a dwarfe came hither, making enquiry after certaine knights, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Armes of Serpents: them haue I alſo taken into my cuſtody, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them as faire a lodging as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7181:250"/>
yours is; but if they tell me not to morrow morning, of whence and what you are, you cannot imagine a death more cruell, then that I will put them to. Heerein, <hi>Archalaus</hi> did not diſſemble with them; for they in the Shippe, perceiuing that not any of them returned againe, ſent forth <hi>Gandalin,</hi> the Dwarfe, and <hi>Orpheus,</hi> the Arras-weauer, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what was become of them, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuing (by chance) at the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, where their Lords and Maiſters were impriſoned.</p>
                  <p>The three knights hearing theſe newes, were greatly diſcontented, and not without eſpeciall cauſe: for they ſtood in doubt, leſt torment, or ſome other meanes, ſhould cauſe them diſcloſe, whatthey would haue concealed. Yet <hi>Amadis,</hi> making no outward ſhew thereof, returned this anſwere to <hi>Archalaus.</hi> Truſt me, Sir, when you ſhall know of whence, and what we are, I am well aſſured, that you will allow vs better wel-come, then hitherto you haue done: For your ſelfe being a knight, as wee are, and (perhaps) heretofore, falne into the trecheries of Fortune, as now we are; would finde the fauour of a friend, as we could affoord the like to you, ſtood you in the like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity as we do. And if any mater of manhood be in vs, me thinks, that might well inſtruct yee (aboue all things elſe) to offer vs no wrong. How now Sir (anſwered <hi>Archalaus)</hi> haue yee learnde to prate ſo boldly? you ſhall finde, who it is that holdes diſpute with ye, and whether I offer ye wrong or right. And let this bee your comfort, that like fauous as I would vſe to <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> were he in my power, the very ſame, and no other will I extend to you.</p>
                  <p>Vncle ſaid <hi>Dinarda,</hi> if you meane to ſend their heades to King <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne,</hi> doe it not, vntill ſeuerity of famine haue cauſed their death: for, ſuffering them to liue ſomewhile in miſery, death will then appeare the more welcome to them. Beleeue me Niece (quoth he) it is well adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and I am content to allow there-of: whereupon, hee ſaid vnto them, that they ſhould haue ſome ſmall mater of feding; prouided, they muſt reſolue him, whether hunger or thirſt moſt offend them; anſwere therefore (on your faith) which is the moſt irk eſome to yee? Seeing, (ſaid King <hi>Perion)</hi> you coniure vs ſo powerfully; I could like well to haue meate, but thirſt doth afflict vs in much extreamer manner. So, (quoth <hi>Archalaus)</hi> I haue a piece of fat Lard, which hath lien in powder aboue theſe three moneths; that (I am ſure) will quenche your thirſt. Preſently it was brought, and hee hurling it in at the grate, ſaid. There, take it friends, make good cheare with it, and ſay not now, but you are kindly entertained. So they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, leauing a Damoſell at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, to liſten what ſpeeches ſhould paſſe betweene them. Much talke had ſhe heard concerning the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of perſon and manly proweſſe, of him that wore the golden Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met; eſpecially, that in the late bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell againſt King <hi>Aranigne,</hi> hee had declared ſuch deeds of Armes, as no knight elſe could performe the like. This raiſed (in her) great pitty and compaſſion, and for his ſake, ſhe prouided a Flagon of wine and water, which letting down ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, ſhe ſaid. Gentlemen, be ſecret in this fauour I ſend ye, and (as I may) I will defend ye from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. The knights returned her moſt hartie thankes: ſo ſhutting faſt the window, ſhe bade them go to ſuch reſt, as that foule place would aſſoord them.</p>
                  <p>Now, concerning the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7181:250"/>
of <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſought after King <hi>Perion</hi> and his company, being falne into the hands of <hi>Archalaus,</hi> as hath bin ſaid already: be it knowne to yee, that they were ſuddenly ſhut vp in a darke vault, ouer the Chamber where the ſuppoſed dumbe Lady had formerly lodged their Maſters. There they found two knights and a Damoſell, wife to the elder of the knights, who had long time beene kept there as priſoners: who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Squires, that by the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of their priſon, they ſaw three knights (bearing Armes of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents) brought in thither, and very worthy welcome giuen them at the firſt. Neuertheleſſe (quoth one of them) at length they were let down into a deepe Dungeon, by the moſt horrid treaſon that euer was heard of: for the Bedde wherein they lay, was fixed on a ſcrew or giuing viſe; which eaſily, and without the leaſt noyſe, conueyed them aboue twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fathome in depth, they being in a ſound ſleepe, dreading no harme at all.</p>
                  <p>Full well knew <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the other, that theſe knights were their Maiſters, thus betrayed: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they made no outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance thereof; but (as if they had neuer ſeene or knowne them) <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> thus anſwered. For ought I can perceiue, moſt vnhappily came we hither, where ſuch worthy men are ſo cruelly handled, of whom we haue heard much fame and faire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. But is there no way or means whereby to ſuccourand helpe them? I am vndoubtedly perſwaded, that if they were deliuered, our abiding heere would not be long. Let mee tel ye (anſwered the ancient knight) the maine butte or end of the vice, which ſupporteth the bed wherein they lye, is vnder the plancher of this Chamber, and heere you may behold it. If all our ſtrength &amp; labor will ſerue to turne it about, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the bed vp againe to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place: they may eaſily get forth, becauſe the doore is neuer ſhut; and moreouer, the Guardes or Keepers of the Caſtell, are now all in their deadeſt ſleepe. Let vs try (quoth <hi>Gandalin)</hi> what we can do; ſo euery one ſet to their hand.</p>
                  <p>Such was their painfull labour &amp; endeauour, that the ſcrew of the vice turning by little and little, the bed beganne to riſe: and King <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (being then not able to ſleepe) felt how it mooued: wherefore, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> hee ſaid vnto them - Doe not you feele that we are remounting vp aloft? Aſſure your ſelues, the villaine <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalaus</hi> will keepe promiſe with vs, for (doubtleſſe) wee are diſcouered to him.</p>
                  <p>I know not (ſaid <hi>Amadis)</hi> what may be his meaning: but hee that firſt layes hold on me to do me out-rage, ſhall pay the reckoning for all the reſt. While thus they confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; by little and little the bedde drew vp neere to the plancher, and attained to fixing in his firſt place. Then our knights, leaping lightly on their feete, drew forth their Swords, looking all about them, to ſee who had thus raiſed them again. But they could not ſee any body, to their no little maruaile, and they found their Armes in the ſame place where they had lefte them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went to reſt, wherewith they armed themſelues immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Afterward, they iſſued forth ſo ſecretly, that ſeazing the Guards, they hewed and ſliced them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, before any ey could take notice thereof, vntill ſuch time, as, by the great noiſe they made, in breaking the bolts and barres of the gates,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7181:251"/>
and ſharpe aſſayling ſuch as they met withall: <hi>Archalaus</hi> awaked, and heard <hi>Amadis</hi> cry with a loude voyce. For <hi>Gaule,</hi> for <hi>Gaule,</hi> this Caſtell is ours.</p>
                  <p>In great affrightment he roſe, and hauing no leyſure to arme himſelfe, he ran into a ſtrong Tower, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the top thereof, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp the Ladder after him; where ſeeing himſelfe in ſafety, putting his head out ata window, he called to his people ſo loud as he could. In the meane while, our three knights had made way to <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the reſt, freeing them from the ſlauery of <hi>Archalaus:</hi> whom they eſpied bawling aloft on the Tower, with ſome other, for their better ſafety. And becauſe they could by no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible meanes come at them, they made a great fire, and ſmoakt them in ſuch ſort, as they were glad to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into-he loweſt vaults, where they were likewiſe almoſt ſmothred with ſmoke.</p>
                  <p>At length, the knights, ſeeing the Caſtell all engirt with fire; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their horſes to bee led forth; where mounting on them, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Archalaus</hi> to all his deuils; and the Dwarfe cryed out, <hi>Archala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Archalaus,</hi> remember how kindly thou didſt vſe me, when thou tiedſt me faſt by the feete; in the Caſtel of <hi>Valderin,</hi> where I was as well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd, as thou art now. The dwarfe deliuered theſe words ſo angerly, &amp; with ſuch a ſtrange geſture, as made them all to laugh hartily. And when they were ſomewhat further off, they looked behind them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Caſtell flaming gallantly: perſwading themſelues, that they were ſufficiently reuenged on <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalaus,</hi> and that he could no way eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape with life.</p>
                  <p>By this time, bright day appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and they arriued at the place where they left their Ship; &amp; there, the Gentlewoman that had bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered with the reſt, remembring the words of <hi>Amadis</hi> in the Caſtell, when he cryed, For <hi>Gaule,</hi> for <hi>Gaule:</hi> deſired to know of <hi>Gandalin,</hi> which of them was the man. <hi>Gandalin</hi> pointing her to <hi>Amadis;</hi> ſhee went and fell at his feete, deſiring pardon of him. For (quoth ſhee) I am <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oletta,</hi> that committed your life to the mercy of the Sea, euen the very ſame day that you were borne. But beleeue me, my Lord, I did it to ſaue the honour of the Qaeen your Mother, who otherwiſe had bin put to death: for no one did know, but my ſelfe onely, that the King your Father (who is heere preſent with yee) was as then married to her. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis;</hi> was much amazed heereat, for he had neuer heard the cauſe, wherefore he was left in ſuch ſorſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken manner: ſo, taking <hi>Darioletta</hi> by the hand, he ſaid vnto her. Faire Friend, I pardon ye, perceiuing it was done vpon ſo iuſt an occaſion: and (heretofore) <hi>Galuanes</hi> hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten told me, that he found me floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Sea; but, till this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, I was vtterly ignorant, how it came to paſſe. Then ſhe related all from point to point (without omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing) euen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of King <hi>Perions</hi> loue, to his Queene <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and the ſucceſſe of euery accident: wherein the king tooke no little delight, and often entreated <hi>Darioletta</hi> to repeat the ſweet pleaſures of his youth.</p>
                  <p>But while this company were thus in quiet and contentment, the caſe of <hi>Archaiaus</hi> carried no correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondencie therewith: for hee and hir, remained inthe deep vault vnder his ſower, where he was as well fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouredly ſmoakt and perfumed, as euer <hi>Rainard</hi> the Foxe was in his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derground kennel. And if his Niece
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7181:251"/>
                     <hi>Dinarda,</hi> and ſome others had not ſuccoured him; hee had there miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ended his dayes. But they came to him ſo ſoone as the knights were gone, finding him ſo ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ouercome, as he was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſtirre either hand or foote. Taking him forth of that ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vault, they threw vineger and cold water in his face, ſo that (ſoon after) he began to breathe, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his eyes, beheld his Caſtell all on a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>So calling for his Litter, he wold preſently bee thence conuayed to Mount <hi>Aldan.</hi> For (quoth he) it vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etl my very ſoul, to behold the ruin of ſo beautifull a place, without any meanes in me to helpe it. As they rode on the way, at the entrance of a neere neighbouring Forreſt; they eſpied two knights, refreſhing themſelues by the brim of a goodly Spring or Fountaine; who ſeeing the Litter attended by fiue knights, and two Damoſels: they imagined, that ſome wounded body was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; where upon, they made toward it to be reſolued: which, when <hi>Archa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> perceiued, he ſaid.

                  <p>Heere you muſt note, that theſe two thus ſent for by <hi>Archalaus,</hi> were <hi>Galaor,</hi> and his companion <hi>Noran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del;</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     </gap>hen the other knights came, fiercely they commaunded them to lay downe their Armes, and come ſpeake with him that was in the Litter. What ſaucie Sir is hee, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> that would haue vs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme our ſelues, and then come to him? You ſhall know no more then you doe, replyed one of the other knights: but if yee vſe any longer conteſting, we wil make ye come to him with cudgelling. I would laugh at tha (tſaid <hi>Norandel)</hi> I am ſure you meane not as you ſay. That ſhal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare (quoth they) and ſo ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: but <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Noran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> vnhorſed the firſt two they met withall, albeit they all fiue gaue the encounter together, and yet could not ſtirre them in their ſaddles. The fight grew fell and fierce betweene them; but the knights belonging to <hi>Archalaus,</hi> were not able to endure the blowes of the other two, who tooke ſuch order with them, that three of them were ſlaine out tight, and the other fled into the wood to ſaue themſelues, whom they reſuſed to follow, leſt he in the Litter ſhould get away from them in the meane while.</p>
                  <p>To the Litter they came, &amp; found <hi>Archalaus</hi> left all alone: becauſe they that kept him company, had quite forſaken him, vpon the ſoile &amp; flight of the ſiue knights; only there was a Boy remaining, who guided the horſes of the Litter. <hi>Archalaus</hi> was not a little amazed, to ſee him-ſelfe in the power of ſtrangers, who might well be reuenged on him, for the outrage done them: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, be thinking himſelfe on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſubtile ſhift, he ſaluted them in very humble manner.

                     </gap>? I ſweare by heauen. this is the laſt outrage thou ſhalt doe to any man liuing. <hi>Galaor</hi> hauing ſpoken theſe words, lifted vp his arme to ſmite him: but <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalaus</hi> (in great feare) cryed out. Alas my Lords, for Gods ſake mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

Worthy Lords, anſwered <hi>Archalaus,</hi> you cannot doe me a greater pleaſure, then bring mee to my Couſin <hi>Grumedan,</hi> who knowes me to bee another manner of man, then you imagine me. It is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to him, that (at all times) I haue laboured, ſerued and honored Knights errant, ſuch as I now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you are.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Norandel</hi> heard him ſpeake ſo honeſtly, and named <hi>Grumedan</hi> to be his kinſeman, they were halfe offended with themſelus, that they had giuen him ſuch rough language, and anſwered him thus. What moued you then to ſend vs ſuch an iniurious command by your men? In good faith my Lords quoth he, if you pleaſe but to heare me, I will acquaint you with the whole truth.</p>
                  <p>Know then, that as I (not long ſince) croſſing the For eſt of the Black Lake, I met with a Damoſell, who made complaint vnto me of a great wrong done her by a knight, which my duty and order binding me to repair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e I purſued him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her direction, and entring the Combate with him, before the Count of <hi>Ganceſte,</hi> ſoyled him. But it chanced afterward, as I returned hometo my Caſtell, that villaine Traytour, which firſt of all you ſlew, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with two other knights, who lay cloſely ambuſhed to entrap me; watching their fitteſt oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did all ſet vpon me, and would forcibly compell me, to make them Lords and Commanders of mine owne dwelling. What ſhall I more ſay to ye. They followed mee with ſuch violence, as notwithſtanding, all I could doe in my beſt defence: they tooke me, and ſed me priſoner to a Fortreſſe not farre hence, where they long time detayned mee, in the moſt iniurious manner could be deuiſed, not permitting ſo much as the dreſſing of ſuch wounds, as I had receiued in fight againſt them, and are heere apparant to your view.</p>
                  <p>With theſe words, hee ſhewed them diuers skarres and hurts. And becauſe (quoth he) they ſtood in feare, leſt I ſhould eſcape fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, and go to the Court of good King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> there to require ayde and inſtice, of the gentle knight <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis de Gaule,</hi> or of his noble Brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> by the ſuitherance of my Couſin <hi>Don Grumedan:</hi> this very day, they had me along with them in this Litter (becauſe I was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure trauaile on horſe-back) purpoſing to carry me, God knowes whether: doubting the friendſhip and helpe of my honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable kinſmen, that laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe mee out of their thraldome ſome few dayes ſince. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, they no ſooner eſpied you, but thinking you to lye in waite for the ſame occaſion, they made no conſcience in abuſing you, as they had done mee in moſt rigorous maner.</p>
                  <p>Worthy Sir (replied <hi>Galaor)</hi> on the faith of a knight, by this diſcours of yours, they were truely villaines. For, you being kinſman to one of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7181:252"/>
the beſt-deſeruing men in the world, your wrongs haue bin too great and vnſufferable. But let me entreat you, to tell vs your name, and to pardon the iniurie wee haue likewiſe done ye, being ignorant of whence and what you were. I am named (quoth <hi>Archalaus) Branfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> and know not whether you haue heard of me heere to fore or no. Yes that I haue, and vnderſtand your merit among the very beſt (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Galaor)</hi> in doing all honorable courteſies to knights errant, at what time ſoeuer you can compaſſe the meanes, as <hi>Don Grumedan</hi> himſelfe hath many times told me. I am glad of it (quoth <hi>Archalaus,)</hi> and ſeeing you haue receiued knowledge of me, let me in kindneſſe obtaine ſo much fauour at your hands, as to take off your Helmets, and to tell me your names, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thankes to my Couſin <hi>Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> for your extraordinary curteſie.</p>
                  <p>This knight (ſaide <hi>Galaor)</hi> my deare friend and companion, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Norandel,</hi> and he is Sonne to King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> And I am <hi>Galaor,</hi> brother to <hi>Amadis de Gaule.</hi> Happy man that I am (anſwered <hi>Archala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> (diſſemblingly lifting vp his eyes to heauen) could any greater felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty befall me, then to bee thus relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with two of the beſt knights in the world. This conference he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the longer, taking good note and obſeruation of them, that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they ſhould happen into his hands, he might be the better reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on them. And my good Lords (quoth he) command me what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice ſhall like you beſt, for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my life to be onely yours: aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring ye on my faith, that if you at any time come where I may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ye, you ſhall effectually finde what loue I beare ye. Friend <hi>Branfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> good ſucceſſe attend ye: but if you pleaſe, we will ride along with ye, for your better ſecurity. I hartily thanke ye, replyed <hi>Archalaus,</hi> but this day I ſhall neede no further defence, I am ſo neere to a Caſtell, where I am aſſured of kind welcome.</p>
                  <p>So he departed from them, not a little glad, that he was ſo well rid of them; for if they had knowen him, he had not eaſily eſcaped from them: wherefore, he commaunded him that guided the Litter, to make all the haſte he poſſibly might, and to take the moſt vnfreque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted waies, leſt they ſhould purſue and recouer him again. By this time it waxed ſo late, that the Moon ſhone brightly: wherefore <hi>Galaor</hi> (ſeeing no other helpe) concluded on their byding that night by the Fountain, whereto <hi>Norandel</hi> was as willing as he. As they diſarmed themſelues, one of their Squires told them, that they ſhould haue better cheare then they expected. How ſhall we haue it? quoth <hi>Galaor.</hi> It is ready enough for ye (anſwered the Squire: for, while you were fighting with the 5. knights they that remained with <hi>Branfiles,</hi> forſook him alſo, and left a horſe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with victuals, whereof I took the charge, while the 2 damoſels, which acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied the litter, entred among yonder old ruines of houſes, from whence (as yet) they are not gone, becauſe I haue obſerued them wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Galaor</hi> went with him and the Squire, who ſhewed the place where they had hid themſelues, which was an old Caue: in regard whereof, the Damoſels had falne ſo deepely into it, as they could not by any meanes get out againe. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Squire knew not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, whether any knights were
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7181:253"/>
in their company or no, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Caue being ſo vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, and neither <hi>Galaor</hi> or <hi>Norandel</hi> had their Armes about them: hee would proceede no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but with a loud voyce called vnto them, ſaying. Come foorth Ladies, come foorth, and giue mee not occaſion to fetch ye foorth, leſt perhaps you repent it. Twiſe or thriſe he thus called to them, and they appeared not to heare him: when <hi>Norandel</hi> growing offended thereat, aduiſed <hi>Galaor,</hi> that fire ſhould be made at the caues mouth, and ſo to ſmoake them forth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would or no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dinarda</hi> hearing theſe wordes, waxed very fearefull, and cryed out aloud, ſaying. Alas Gentlemen, take pitty vpon vs, and we will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently come forth vnto ye. Diſpatch then ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> and come away quickly, for we may not attend your leyſure. Beleeue it Gentle-men (quoth ſhee) vnfaynedly, that wee are not able to come vnto yee, without your helpe, we are falne ſo deepe vnder the ground, and further (perhaps) then you will beleeue. Heereupon, <hi>Norandel</hi> went in him-ſelfe, and holpe them out each after other; when, perceiuing them to be ſuch beautifull creatures: I know not which of them was the forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, to entertaine a faire friend, ſo that <hi>Galaor</hi> pleaded poſſeſſion of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda;</hi> and <hi>Norandel</hi> of the other. Then ſending the Squire to prepare their Supper, meane while, they wandred ſomewhat further into the wood; where you may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that hauing a place ſo conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and being furniſhed with ſuch prouiſion, as ſuch yong yeares and wanton deſires could wiſh for: neither of the knights was ſo dull ſpirited, but knew well enough how to entertain his amorous Miſtreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Which dalliances being ended, the knights conducted them to the Fountaine, where they friendly ſupt together, with ſuch food as the men of <hi>Archalaus</hi> had left behind them; vſing ſuch conference all the time of Supper, as doubtleſſe was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way diſpleaſing. By meanes whereof, the Damoſels, who (at the firſt encountring) ſeemed ſtrange, and halfe angry, were now become ſo gentle, milde, and tractable; that Supper was no ſooner ended, but they went into the wood againe with the knights, as familiar in their kiſſes, and kinde embraces, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they had beene to <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Norandel.</hi> In which pleaſures they continued til the break of day, when <hi>Norandels</hi> Lady thus ſpake vnto him. In good ſadneſſe Sir, I feare leſt Madame <hi>Dinarda</hi> will be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me, becauſe I haue abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelfe ſo long time from her. Neuer thinke you ſo (quoth he) for ſhe needes none of your preſence, being ſo well accompanied as ſhee is: And I dare make it good, that ſhe is as willing to be alone, as you are, or can be. But reſolue me in one thing I pray ye; is not this <hi>Dinarda,</hi> the daughter to <hi>Ardan Canile,</hi> who (not long ſince) came into this Country, to aske the counſel of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalaus,</hi> how ſhe might be reuenged on <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> and compaſſe his death? I am not acquainted (ſaid ſhe) with the cauſe of her comming hither; but well I wot, ſhee is the daughter to <hi>Ardan Canile,</hi> and in my poore opinion, he that hath beene pleaſed with her company this night paſt, may well boaſt of his happines &amp; good fortune: for he hath wonne that, which many great perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s could neuer gaine ſo much as a ſight of.</p>
                  <p>Heere let me tell ye, as heereto-fore I haue done, that this <hi>Dinarda</hi> was both cunning and malicious,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7181:253"/>
expreſſing to <hi>Galaor</hi> ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew of loue and intire affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as if her ſoule and behauiour truely conſented together. And ſo farre was his beliefe abuſed by her, that, notwithſtanding his aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by <hi>Norandel,</hi> what ſpeech had paſt betweene him and his night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity, yet hee made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at all thereof, but declared as faire friendſhip to her, as before, not wanting in his very beſt curteſies to her. But at length, he demaunded of her, if ſhe knew the knight that was carried in the Litter? Full well (quoth ſhe,) and did not you know him to be <hi>Archalaus</hi> the Enchanter? <hi>Archalaus?</hi> (anſwered <hi>Galaor.)</hi> Had I but knowne ſo much before, hee ſhould haue felt the keene edge of my Sword. Is he not dead? (reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dinarda.)</hi> No (quoth <hi>Galaor,)</hi> my ignorance (for this once) hath priuiledged his life: but if euer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after we chaunce to meet againe, he ſhall well finde, that a debt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, is not payed, another day will ſerue the turne.</p>
                  <p>Right glad was <hi>Dinarda,</hi> to heare that her Vncle had eſcaped with life: notwithſtanding, wiſely ſhee diſſembled her contentment, and returned this anſwere. Truſt me, Sir, it is no long while ſince I hazarded my life for the ſafety of his: but now finding my ſelfe ſo farre interreſted in your faire affection, aſſure your ſelfe, it is one of my greateſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances, that you did not kill him; for there is not a heauier enemy in the world, to the life of you and your brother <hi>Amadis.</hi> I know it too well, (replied <hi>Galaor)</hi> and ſo long a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, ſhould now haue found a full diſcharge for all his treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but that his ſubtilty outwent my honeſt ſimplicity, which will be quickly footed when time ſhal ſerue.</p>
                  <p>Broad day breaking off theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conferences, they mounted on horſebacke with the Damoſels: who tooke no great pleaſure in their company, though they bare it out with notable diſſembling! But that which moſt offended <hi>Dinarda,</hi> was the report of <hi>Galaor,</hi> that he had left the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> onely to finde his Brother <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> whom ſhe hated more then any man liuing. So long they iourneyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that on the third day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they came to a Fortreſſe, the gates whereof ſtood wide open. In they rode, not meeting with any body whom they might ſpeake to: but ſoone after came the Lord of the place, named <hi>Ambades,</hi> attended with ſome of his ſeruants, on whom (beholding this new come compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) he looked angerly, becauſe they had not drawen the Bridge before their arriuall. Neuertheleſſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that now it could not bee holpen, he made a ſhew of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous entertainment, &amp; much againſt his minde. For he was neere kinſ-man to <hi>Archalaus,</hi> and euery way as wicked as he, quickly taking know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Niece <hi>Dinarda:</hi> by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee vnderſtood the fortunes of his Couſin; and <hi>Dinarda</hi> alſo perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, that ſhe and the other Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell had bin violently deflowred by <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Norandel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereat he grew ſo incenſed with fury, that inſtantly he would haue aſſayled them: but <hi>Dinarda</hi> willed him to be better aduiſed, becauſe they two onely had foyled fiue knights, that had the conduct of her Vncle, and might prooue as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ouer him and his. Therefore Sir, quoth ſhe, as yet it is heſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale your diſcontentment, till their departing hence to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when I and this Damoſell will guide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth: then letting down the Port-cullies of the gate, we ſhall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7181:254"/>
be ſure to tarry with yee in the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſafety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ambades</hi> did not miſlike this counſell, but went to Supper with the Knights and Ladies, betaking themſelues (afterward) to reſt in their appointed lodgings; and the next morning, being riſen, their hoſte came to them, ſaying. Gentle-men, when it ſhall pleaſe you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, I will bee your guide, thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as I am: for ſo am I vſed to doe, with any that accept of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment heere; and before my returne backe againe, I take delight in the ſearch of aduentures, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as other knights errant do. My kinde Hoſte (anſwered <hi>Galaor)</hi> wee heartily thanke yee for your great curteſie. So, their horſes being brought, firſt they holpe to mounte the Damoſels, and themſelues: but they gaue way to <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Noran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> to ride out foremoſt, the women comming ſlowly after with <hi>Amba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> No ſooner were the knights beyond the gate, but downe fell the Port-cullies, and he (with the Damoſels) were now out of their power.</p>
                  <p>Forthwith, they mounted on the wall ouer the gate, and ſeeing the knights looke backe for the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels comming after, he cryed out to them. Villaines, hell be your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, before you get them againe in your poſſeſſion. Goe dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the deuils, and let them vſe you, as ye haue done theſe poore Ladies; who dare venter no further with ſuch baſe-minded men, but chuſe rather willingly to abide here with me. Is it poſſible mine hoſte (anſwered <hi>Galaor)</hi> that after ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and honeſt entertainment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded by your ſelfe to vs in your Caſtell; you ſhould expreſſe ſuch lacke of manhood, as to robbe vs of our faire friends, ſo treacherouſly? If euer they were yours, (replied <hi>Ambades,</hi> or gaue themſelues to ye without conſtraint: it likes mee the better thus to take them from yee, as thinking it may the more vexe and moleſt yee. But I am aſſured, that luſtfully, and meerely againſt their mindes, you haue purſued and enioyed them; and therefore, at their earneſt requeſt made to me, I vſe ye as I doe; ſhame then to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell any further in this maner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how much they deteſt ye. Let them but ſay ſo much themſelus (quoth <hi>Galaor)</hi> to vs, and we ſhall quickly get vs gone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dinarda,</hi> who (all this while) had hid her ſelfe, began to appeare vpon the wall, whereupon, <hi>Galaor</hi> ſpake thus vnto her.</p>
                  <p>Faire Miſtreſſe, this Knight wold gladly make vs beleeue, that willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you remaine with him, and that our company is offenſiue to ye: We can hardly credit any trueth in his ſpeeches, remembring ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that haue paſt betweene vs.</p>
                  <p>Then I perceiue (anſwered <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda)</hi> that fooliſh credulity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed your beſt iudgement in me; for my affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was neuer ſo earneſt towards ye, but I had rather behold your head parted from your ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, then to enioy one minute of your company.</p>
                  <p>Fond, and ydle-headed knight, didſt not thou know that I am Daughter to <hi>Ardan Canile,</hi> and that thy Brother <hi>Amadis</hi> is the man, whom (aboue all other) I haue moſt cauſe to deteſt and hate?</p>
                  <p>How then couldſt thou dreame, that any good inclination remained in me towardes thee: conſidering, that thy greateſt fauour to mee, ſince our late begun familiarity, hath aimed at no other end, but for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7181:254"/>
conueying me to <hi>Gaule,</hi> there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him whom I leaſt deſire to ſee? You may therefore depart hence at your pleaſure, and forget not to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelfe, that in being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I moſt faithfully affected you, you doe, and ſhall find me the moſt deadlieſt enemy you haue.</p>
                  <p>If I had giuen ye any ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (anſwered <hi>Galaor)</hi> yet I am well aſſured, the ſweete ſatisfaction you receiued ſo latel / from me, and to you no meane contentment (as I i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined) did well deſerue more louely language. But I can eaſily aime at your intention; you would gladly borrow as much friendſhip of another man, as fearing that I was not able to pleaſure ye any further: wherein truely, now vpon better conſideration with my ſelfe, you haue reaſon ſo to doe, and I none at all to miſlike it.</p>
                  <p>For, ouer and beſide that generall diſeaſe, incident to all women of your witty diſpoſition, to affect change and nouelty: I ought to haue remembred how difficult a thing it is, from ſo badde a ſtocke as is worth iuſt nothing, that any good fruit can bee expected. For thou art Niece to the onely vyle wretch in the world, and thou muſt needs reſemble him in all kind of villainy.</p>
                  <p>But Madame, ſaid <hi>Norandel,</hi> I hope my amorous Miſtreſie, hath no ſuch cauſe to complaine of me: for neuer woman was better entertayned by her friend, then (for ſo long time together) ſhee was by mee, and that I dare referre to her owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                  <p>As he ſpake theſe wordes, he eſpied her peeping ouer the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhoulder; whereupon hee called to her, ſaying. How ſay you ſweet heart, is it not true? It is ſo true (quoth ſhee) that if I could compaſſe the like power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thee, as (when time was) thou hadſt ouer me; I ſhould eaſily make knowne, with what affection I endured whatſoeuer thou didſt to me, which pleaſed me ſo well, that I referre thee to the deuils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.</p>
                  <p>The deuill (ſaid <hi>Norandel)</hi> cares not for my company, hee likes yours ſo well, and that villaine that is with ye. By Sainct <hi>Mary</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Ambades)</hi> you doe mee wrong, to thinke ſo badly of mee, holding you in ſuch reputation, that if I could haue conquered two ſuch as you are, I could vaunt thereof among the beſt knights in the world; for I hold ye to be but a couple of baſe Groomes. Theſe words mooued <hi>Norandel</hi> to ſuch choller, that he preſently replyed, Baſe Gromes: Haſt thou any ſuch in thy pay or wages? If thou hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt vs in no better eſteeme, come downe from thy Caſtell wall, and thou ſhalt ſoone ſee, that a Groom of my breeding, can knocke a bigger knaue then thou art. But if thou conquereſt mee, then boldly make thy vaunt, to haue foyled one of the greateſt enemies, that eyther thou or <hi>Archalaus</hi> can haue.</p>
                  <p>Gentle words (anſwered <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bades)</hi> haue not I tolde thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that I meane not to meddle with any ſuch paltry companions? what honour then can be had by ſo baſe conqueſt? Tell not me of thy hatred to my Couſin <hi>Archalaus,</hi> thou art vnworthy to ſpeake of a man of his merit; who, as he cares not for thy loue or kindneſſe, ſo he dares thee to thy vttermoſt malice againſt him. So, bending a Turkiſhe Bowe, hee let ſlye three or four ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

cauſed <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Norandel</hi> to part thence, ſmyling heartily to them-ſelues, that they had bin ſo decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by two treacherous women. And yet (quoth <hi>Norandel)</hi> mee thinkes, they lik't their wine ſo well, as they will grieue for the miſſe thereof, when they remember vs. And howſoeuer they haue begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our expectation, yet I can bee well content to be mockt ſo againe, paying no dearer charges then wee haue done.</p>
                  <p>They rode on ſtill thus merily ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, till about ſome three or foure dayes after, they came to the Port of <hi>Arſill,</hi> where they found a Barke ready bound for <hi>Gaule,</hi> whereinto they entred, and the winde ſate ſo fitting for them, that (without hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance or impeachment, they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded where King <hi>Perion</hi> then ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. At that inſtant, <hi>Amadis</hi> was walking on the Sea-ſhore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with his Brother <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> &amp; he remembring his <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a longing looke towardes <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſo ſoone as hee beheld the Barke to caſt Anker in the Port, hee ſaid to his Brother <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> Let vs goe learne of them, who are come hither to take landing, if they can tell vs any happy tidings. Goe we then (replyed <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> for perhaps we may meete with ſome of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.

                  <p>As yet hee had no knowledge of <hi>Norandel,</hi> but <hi>Floreſtan</hi> had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen him, telling him, that he was the baſtard Sonne to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and companion to <hi>Galaor,</hi> as a ſo, one of the beſt knights of his age, &amp; ſo he did worthily declare himſelfe; in the battels at the Burning Lake, where many men of marke ended their liues.

And becauſe none of vs could attaine to the knowledge of them by reaſon of their ſudden par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thence vpon our victory: my companion and I haue ſolemnely vowed and promiſed, according to the cuſtome of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> to ſpend one whole yeare in the queſt of them, before we giue ouer, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any other enterpriſe.

The next morning, <hi>Amadis</hi> being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, went to heare Maſſe; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken leaue of the King, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on horſeback, accompanied on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Gandalin</hi> and the Dwarfe. Notwithſtanding, the King would needes bring him ſomewhat on the way, out of the Citty; and as they rode together, <hi>Amadis</hi> thus ſpake. Sir, you know what trauaile my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and <hi>Norandel</hi> haue bound the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to by vow, which will bee paines without any profit, except you pleaſe therein to eaſe them: for, by no meanes poſſible can they compaſſe their intent, but one of vs three muſt end their royle. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I thinke it expedient, if your Highneſſe were ſo pleaſed, that when you haue forſaken my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, you would tell them the whole diſcourſe, and what we did in the ſeruice of King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> Since you will haue it ſo (replyed the King) it ſhall be done. <hi>Floreſtan</hi> was very deſirous to haue ridden along with <hi>Amadis,</hi> but hee would not permit it: becauſe in trauayling alone, hee had the more free paſſage for his conſiderations concerning <hi>Oriana;</hi> and beſide, he aymed at aduentures of no meane perill, the honor wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould be his owne onely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anadis</hi> being gone, as Fortune beſt pleaſed to direct him, and the King with his company returned home to the Court: he called for <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Norandel,</hi> with whom he diſcourſed in this maner. You haue betaken your ſelues to a ſtrange kinde of queſt, wherein (I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) you will haue but ſlender ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, except it be in this kingdome. And therefore, account your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither to be fortunate, in that I can ſhorten your long-intended trauaile.</p>
                  <p>Know then, that the knights you ſeeke after, were none other then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis, Floreſtan</hi> and my ſelfe. So he declared the whole manner of their enterpriſe, and how at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of their proceeding, <hi>Vrganda</hi> the Vnknowen, ſent them the coate Armours, with the Serpents, the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7181:256"/>
golden Helmet for <hi>Amadis,</hi> the white for himſelfe, and the greene for <hi>Floreſtan:</hi> ſhewing all inſtantly to them, and what harme had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them in the battel.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſaid <hi>Galaor,</hi> heauen hath bin very fauourable to vs, conſidering our long-intended time of trauaile: onely to enter the Combate with them, and make knowne to the whole world beſide (in extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their glory) that one of vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth aſmuch as the beſt of them. Yea (quoth the King) but it is much better to fall out thus, as now it doth.</p>
                  <p>Then he reported to them, how in their returning from the battell, they chanced to bee impriſoned by <hi>Archalaus,</hi> and in what vngentle manner he vſed them. That villain, (anſwered <hi>Galaor)</hi> not long after eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped out of my hands, by a moſt queint and cunning treachery. Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at large, how they met with him, their courteſie to the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and their treaſon afterward at the Caſtell of <hi>Ambades.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King walked thence with them to his owne Chamber, where all the Armours were, whereof they had ſpoken: which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently knew, as hauing well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them in the battell, <hi>Norandel</hi> importuning the King ſo earneſtly, that he frankly gaue him them. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, hauing remained there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſpace of fourteene dayes, they obtayned leaue to part thence; and paſſing into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at the Court of King <hi>Liſuart:</hi> who, not a little glad of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, inſtantly ſent for them, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what had befalne them in their queſt.</p>
                  <p>Sir, (ſaid <hi>Norandel)</hi> wee haue brought ye happy newes, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to your owne deſire. In te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony whereof, behold heere the Armes of them, that perfourmed ſuch worthy ſeruice for you, and in ſuch a time of vrgent neceſſity. This white Helmet was then worne by King <hi>Perion,</hi> and your ſelfe ſaw him in the place, where it coſt many the price of their liues. This greene Helmet belonged to the gentle knight <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> who well declared how hardily hee could handle his Sword. And this of gold appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom deeds of arms cannot be ſeconded by any: for by his aſſiſtance, the benefit of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile redounded to you; but the honour thereof to his immortall glory. How could they (quoth the King) come ſo conueniently to helpe vs?</p>
                  <p>Heereupon <hi>Norandel</hi> diſcourſed from point to point, how euery thing had happened, without the leaſt omiſſion, to the great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the hearers. Beleeue me, ſaid the King, I perceiue that King <hi>Perion</hi> hath bin long time your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourer, and him I neuer ſaw out of his Armes, albeit I greatly deſire to know him. You ſhall then know (anſwered <hi>Norandel)</hi> a wiſe vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and moſt magnanimious Prince.</p>
                  <p>And on my faith (quoth <hi>Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan)</hi> his Sonnes come not behind him in any of his beſt parts. Theſe words were hardly pleaſing to the King, though hee made no outward ſhew thereof: but falling from this maner of diſcourſe, hee departed thence, leauing <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Noran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> to whom <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Mabila</hi> inſtantly comming, they deliuered moſt kinde commendations to them, both from Queene <hi>Eliſena</hi> and the Princeſſe <hi>Mabila.</hi> Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring afterward, that <hi>Amadis</hi> was departed from <hi>Gaule</hi> into farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Countreyes, to ſeeke after ſtraunge aduentures, which ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7181:256"/>
made them very ſorrowfull, becauſe they feared to heare no newes of him in a long while after.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Splandian</hi> hauing attayned to the age of foure yeares, or thereabout; <hi>Naſcian</hi> well knowing, that now it was fit time, to begin his inſtruction in vertuous exerciſes: ſent to his Siſter, that ſhe ſhould bring the childe to him, which ſhee accordingly did. The Hermit perceiuing his growth, to be beyond the ordinary ſtature of ſuch young yeares, beſides his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and commendable forme: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in his minde, that heauen had thus preſerued him to ſome eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall end: ſo that, if formerly hee preſumed of his future happines; he gaue more credit now thereto then euer he had done; endeauouring by all meanes poſſible, to haue him taught all commendable qualities, fit for the knowledge of a Gentle-man; embracing, kiſſing, and vſing him, as if he had bin his owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sonne.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely it was not without great reaſon, becauſe the childe had alwayes declared, as apparant ſignes of loue to him, and rather more, then to his Nurſe, whoſe breſts hee ſuckt. In regard whereof, <hi>Naſcian</hi> concluded to keep him ſtill, ſending his Siſter home to her owne houſe: yet requiring the company of one of her Sonnes, that might bee as a play-fellow to <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> who had ſuckt with him of the ſame milke, whereto ſhee willingly condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>From that time forward, the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit was their ſole guide and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, they liuing there in the nature of brethren; and for their dayly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and exerciſe, he would ſend them to hunt in the Forreſt; ſo that at one time (among other) they ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing earely in the morning to finde ſome game, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> waxing faint and weary, ſate downe by a Riuer ſide, and fell aſleepe. The Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onneſſe (whereof we haue former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken) comming thither, and finding this new kind of prey, ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at his face, began to fawne and moue his taile pleaſingly, euen as if Nature had made an eſpeciall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, of touching, or doing any harme to the creature, which her ſelfe had before bin partly a Nurſe vnto. And appeared to know him ſo perfectly, that had bin a while ſuckled with her milke: as inſtantly, without offering the leaſt violence, ſhe couched down at his feete, ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and licking his hands and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Which, when his waking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companion perceiued, being ouer-come with feare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ranne home to the Hermit, crying to him, that he had left his brother with a great dogge, that would eate him, as hee lay ſleeping on the banke of a Riuer, he not hauing any power to wake him.</p>
                  <p>The holy Hermite, dearely affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7181:257"/>
                     <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> grew doubtfull of his ſafety; and commaunded his young Nephew, to bring him where he left him; which preſently he did. Drawing neere to the place, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Boy and the Lyonneſſe playing together: when <hi>Eſplandian</hi> beholding the Hermite, ſaide vnto him. Father, doth this goodly dog belong to vs. Sonne, anſwered <hi>Naſcian,</hi> ſhee is ſent of God, to whom onely all things appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
                  <p>Truely Father, replyed <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> I ſhould well like his abyding with vs, and would make vſe of him in our hunting. When the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man heard him ſpeake ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, he grew as reſolute in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and going neerer to <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> ſaw him kiſſe the Lyonneſſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as familiarly, as ſhee had bin a Spaniell.</p>
                  <p>Heereupon the Hermite ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Sonne, would you giue her ſomewhat to eate? Yea Father, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> if I had any thing to giue her. With that, the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit tooke out of his Scrip the legge of a Deere, which a Hunter had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him, and giuing it to the Lad, he threw it to the Lyonneſſe, ſaying. Heere Dogge, eate this. The Lyonneſſe tooke it; and while ſhee was feeding on it, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> played with her eares, pawes and taile, euen as familiarly as himſelfe pleaſed, the beaſt offering him no other diſlyking, then if hee had bin one of her whelpes. Such perfect knowledge did ſhe take of him, and (euen by naturall inſtinct) loued him ſo dearely, as ſhe followed him thence to the Hermitage, and (from that time forward) would neuer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly leaue his company, except when ſhe went to ſeeke ſome prey, which ſhe would alſo bring home with her, euen as if ſhe had beene a houſhold ſeruant.</p>
                  <p>And both the Laddes grew into ſuch familiarity with her, that they would leade her oftentimes in a Leaſſe on hunting with them, as if ſhe had bin a Greyhound for game. Which <hi>Naſcian</hi> well noting, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them Bowes fit fot their ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, wherewith they continually vſed to kill Harts, Hindes, Roe-bucks, and ſuch like, ſending ſtill the Lyonneſſe after ſuch game as they had woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>But heere wee purpoſe now to leaue them for a while; returning to <hi>Amadis,</hi> who being departed from <hi>Gaule,</hi> entred the Country of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,</hi> where he perfourmed ſuch rare actions of Chiualry, that euery tongue talked onely of him, and there he was commonly called, the knight with the greene Sword, or, the knight of the Dwarfe, becauſe <hi>Ardan</hi> ſtill attended on him, and there he ſpent foure whole yeares, before he returned to the Encloſed Iſland, not hearing any tydings from his <hi>Oriana,</hi> which was his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry greateſt affliction, becauſe hee found no pains, labor or ill ſucceſſe, any way comparable to the want of her preſence.</p>
                  <p>So long he trauailed from one part to another, that about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring-time, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> neere to King <hi>Tafinor,</hi> on whom <hi>Patin</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Rome</hi> made ſharpe warre: who hated <hi>Amadis</hi> more then any man elſe, for the reaſon formerly declared in the ſecond Booke. Hee ryding purpoſely toward the camp, King <hi>Tafinor,</hi> who for a time, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken truce with his enemy, was then flying his Gerfaulcon at a Heron, which fell at the horſe feete of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe none of the horſe-men could come at her, in regard
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7181:257"/>
of the moiſt and marſhie ground hindering them, the knight of the greene Sword alighted, and tooke her vp, demaunding the Falconers, if they were diſpleaſed thereat: And they anſwered no. Soon after came the King, who had coaſted all along the Riuer for paſſage, and ſeeing the knight ſo compleatly armed, ſtood in ſome ſuſpition of himſelf; till he further noted the greene ſcabberd of his Sword, being the ſame which he had in lone of the ancient knight, as hath bin formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
                  <p>The King had many times heard much fame of his proweſſe, and was ſo well pleaſed with his happy arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall, that he entreated his company to the City, which <hi>Amadis</hi> denied him not; but ryding along with him, the King thus ſpake. Sir, I haue a long while deſired, that I might be but worthy of ſuch a companion as you ſeeme to be. My Lord (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,)</hi> the liberal renown of you and your bounty, which makes you famous in many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, drewe me hither, onely to offer you my ſeruice, if any way it may be acceptable to yee, becauſe I haue heard, that you are warred on by a potent Prince, that giues ye no meane moleſtation. You ſay very true (replied the King;) but I truſt in heauen, and by the meanes of your helpe, to ſee a ſhort iſſue out of theſe troubles, Fortune hauing ſo conueniently guided you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>By this time they were arriued at the Palace, where the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded he ſhould be lodged, and <hi>Graſandor</hi> his Sonne to keepe him company. Now, in regard that the truce taken betweene the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, was vpon the point of ending: each ſide ſtood on their beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and the ſeuerall Campes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all attempts whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Tafinor</hi> walking one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, to vnderſtand ſome tydings from the enemy, hee beheld afarre off twelue knights come riding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; and as they drew nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, he knew the Shield of <hi>Garadan,</hi> borne by his Squire, himſelfe being a neere kinſman to the Emperour; and they came not to fight, but to parlee. The King bare little affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this <hi>Garadan,</hi> becauſe hee procured and raiſed this warre, and well he knew, that his comming was but to occaſion ſome freſh grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance; which made ſtearne anger mount vp into his face, ſo that hee could not forbeare, but ſaid. Ah trecherous villaine, thou haſt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done me ſo many miſchiefes, that I haue iuſt occaſion to hate thee ſo long as I liue.</p>
                  <p>Sir, (anſwered the Knight of the greene Sword,) it may be, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to yee for ſome good end; therefore, it ſhall well become ye, now to diſſemble all paſſion, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning them with good lookes, not taking offence at any thing they ſay, in regard they come to yee as Ambaſſadours from the Emperour their Maiſter.</p>
                  <p>Kinde friend (quoth the King) I allow of your good aduice, and wil be directed thereby; though it is no meane griefe to me, to haue ſo great an enemy neere me. Scarcely were theſe words ended, but <hi>Garadan</hi> and his troupe ſaluted the King, who gaue them kinde welcome deſiring them, that before any ſpeeches paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they would goe along with him to him to his Palace. But <hi>Garadan</hi> made refuſall, ſhewing himſelfe as brauely proud and preſumptuous, as formerly he was wont to do, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Tafinor,</hi> thou muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7181:258"/>
the occaſion of our comming to thee, and before thou parteſt from this place, thou muſt make vs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, ſuch as ſhall ſeeme beſt to thy ſelfe, without aduice or conſulting with any one but thy ſelfe. For in thee onely lyeth the concluſion of two things, wherewith I am to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thee from the Emperour: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, aſſure thy ſelf, before three dayes can be paſſed ouer, the battel will fall out to be ſo cruell and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as it exceedeth all poſſibility, but thou and thy Country will bee vtterly loſt.</p>
                  <p>With theſe wordes he deliuered him a Miſſiue of credence, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation of his ſpeeches. Beleeue me Lord <hi>Garadan,</hi> (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King,) I hope that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and you, wil be more kinde to me, then appeareth by your meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: wherefore, deferre no further time, but deliuer the remainder of your Commiſſion, that I may yeeld you ſatisfaction to my power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Garadan</hi> hearing the King to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ſo mildely, began ſomewhat to qualifie his owne choller, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus. King <hi>Tafinor,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour my Maiſter, hauing power ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to preuaile againſt, yea, &amp; vtterly to ruinate a more potent Prince then you are, being deſirous to make an end of this warre, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for other his more neceſſary occaſions, makes tender to you of two conditions, whereby you may enioy peace if you pleaſe, or elſe not.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if Combate may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of an hundred of your knights, againſt as many of his; or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to a thouſand, the conquerors leauing the vanquiſhed in ſuch caſe, as to them ſhall ſeeme beſt. Or, if you finde this demaund to be ouer-great, hee is content to allow of twelue againſt twelue, of which number I meane my ſelfe to be one, who doe thinke my ſelfe able to fight with ſixe of your knights, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your ſelfe made one in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Therefore, of theſe two ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, chuſe which ſhall appeare the eaſieſt to you: for otherwiſe, be well aſſured, that, ſetting aſide all other affaires, his Army ſhall neuer part from this Country, till you be wholly vanquiſhed, which will be very ſpeedily, becauſe you are not able long to withſtand his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent proceedings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Garadan</hi> (anſwered the knight of the greene Sword) were you to ſpeake to a King of much leſſe merit, yet deſeruing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reuerence, mee thinkes you ſhould bee more mindfull of your owne behauiour, in vſing ſuch proud threatnings concerning your ſelfe, ill beſeeming a Gentleman, appertayning to ſo great a Prince. Notwithſtanding, he may make you what anſwere ſhall like him: albeit, in mine opinion, he ſhould firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, what aſſurance you can make of your ſeuerall offers, if hee conſent to your demaunds. When <hi>Garadan</hi> heard the knight of the greene Sword ſpeake ſo reſolutely in the Kings preſence, hee maruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led greatly what he ſhould be, and looking on him with a diſdainfull eye, he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue me knight, it appeareth well by your language, but much more by your boldnes, that you are not onely a ſtranger in theſe parts, but alſo to all honour and ciuility. And it amazeth me, that the King will ſuffer yee to ſpeake ſo ſottiſhly in his preſence. Neuertheleſſe, if his opinion of you be ſo good, as not to diſallow what you haue ſaid, let him firſt conſent to my demaunds, and then I will anſwere him as I ſee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7181:258"/>
Goe you on, quoth the King, with the reſt of your meſſage: for whatſoeuer, the knight of the greene Sword hath ſpoken on my behalfe, ſhall bee maintayned, if in our power it lye to perfourme it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Garadan</hi> became now more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, then formerly he had beene; perceiuing, that the man whom he had inburied in wordes, was the knight with the greene Sword, whoſe renowne had already ſpred it ſelfe thorow all Countries, and made his ſtout heart ſomewhat to tremble: Neuertheleſſe, he held it as his chiefeſt happineſſe, that hee ſhould haue now ſo apt an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to combate with him; for, he was ſo ouer-weening and vaine-glorious, that he made no doubt of preuayling againſt him, and that very eaſily. Which ydle fond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, cauſed him to loſe all the honour and high reputation, wherein he had liued till that time, promiſing himſelfe an aſſurance of victory, which afterward fell to his enemy. And waxing more chollericke then before, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this anſwere to the knight of the greene Sword.</p>
                  <p>Seeing that the King giues you ſuch power and authority, why are yee ſo ſlow in electing the fight? Becauſe (anſwered the knight of the Dwarfe) it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch importance, as well deſerueth to haue the aduice of the Princes and Ladies of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>And it would highly content mee, if the King pleaſed ſo much to honour mee, as to entertaine me for one of the twelue hundred, or thouſand, that are to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this fight: for no man can bee more deſirous then I am, to doe any ſeruice againſt you, on whom I would not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduenture my beſt blood, but ſerue for him in any place, where he ſhall pleaſe to imploy mee. My deare friend, (replyed the King,) I moſt heartily thanke you, and will not refuſe the offer you haue made me: but doe requeſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that you would make election of the fights in my behalfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you ſhall iudge it beſt, and for our moſt aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>In good ſooth Sir, (reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the knight of the green Sword) therein you ſhall pardon mee, (if you pleaſe;) for you haue about yee ſo many good knights, all louing and reſpectfull of your honour, that if you demaund their aduice in this caſe, their counſell will be both faithfull and honourable. Neuertheleſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall faile in this, or any other matter that <hi>Garadan</hi> can vrge; preſume vpon my loyalty and ready ſeruice. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let me entreate your Maieſty, to demaund, what power he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from his Maiſter, to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the offers already propoſed: and accordingly you may ſhape your anſwere, for the acceptance or refuſall.</p>
                  <p>Saucie companion, (anſwered <hi>Garadan,)</hi> I know thy meaning well enough, as ſeeking how to ſhrinke backe, and ſhunne all the offers made for fight. If you knewe mee well, (ſaid the knight of the Dwarfe) it may be, you would hold better eſtimation of me, then raſhly your raſh opinion ſeemeth to deliuer.</p>
                  <p>And doe not thinke it ſtraunge, that I gaue ſuch aduice to the King, as you haue heard: for if your ſeuerall offers ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward bee diſallowed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7181:259"/>
they may bee the cauſe of ſtearner warre then yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath beene, in ſteed of a milder purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Garadan</hi> could no longer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, but drew a Letter forth of his ſleeue, ſealed with thirty faire Seales, in the middeſt of all which Seales, ſtood that, that belonged to the Emperour: And deliuering it to the King, he bade him to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on a ſpeedie anſwere. By my faith, (quoth the King,) ſeeing you are in ſuch great haſte, you ſhall be anſwered before you part from this place. So, withdrawing thence, &amp; calling ſome of the chiefeſt Lords of the company: he entreated them to aduiſe him particularly what were beſt to be done in this vrgent neceſſity. Then each man deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his opinion, which fell out to be different and contrary, becauſe ſome approued the fight of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred againſt an hundred, and others of twelue to twelue; but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number temporized, and gaue the like counſell, for continuance of warre, in manner and forme as it had beene begunne. For (quoth they) to hazard a kingdome vpon the ſtrength of ſo few men, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very dangerous. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, it appeareth by <hi>Garadans</hi> owne words, that the Emperour himſelfe firſt beginneth to grow weary of this warre, and (it may be) is ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in other places, as he will be (thereby) enforced to withdraw his forces, and leaue vs in peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne will.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſaid Count <hi>Galtines,</hi> it were very expedient (in my minde) to craue the counſell of the knight of the greene Sword. Now, was not he preſent at this aſſembly, and therefore hee was immediately ſent for; and being come, the King thus ſpake vnto him.</p>
                  <p>My worthy Friend, you haue heard at large the ſpeeches of <hi>Don Garadan</hi> to mee, ſo comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (as he ſaith) by his Maiſter the Emperour: let me therefore entreate yee, faire Sir, to aduiſe vs what you thinke meeteſt for our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, becauſe the ſeuerall opinions of our Lords heere preſent, are ſo different, as wee know not which to elect for our beſt courſe. Then he related to him (in order) all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that had paſſed among them without omiſsion of the leaſt particle, and the knight of the greene Sword returned him this anſwere.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I am ſure you can ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently vnderſtand, that the end and iſſue of ſuch attempts, are onely in the hand of Heauen, and not guided or directed by the iudgment of man; but in regard you would haue mine opinion in this caſe, I will acquaint yee with my very vttermoſt power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>If then Sir, I had but one Caſtell onely, and an hundred knights at my commaund, and were beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by ſuch an enemy, whoſe power twiſe exceeded mine. If heauen affoorded mee ſo much happineſſe, to cauſe him condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to a peacefull concluſion, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der haxard of mine owne ſtrength, I ſhould confeſſe my ſelf beholding to him.</p>
                  <p>Neuertheleſſe, honourable Lords (ſpeaking to the other Barons and knights there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) whatſoeuer I preferre as beſt in this caſe: forbeare not you to counſell the King, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fidelity wherein you ſtand bound and obliged to him. Onely my moſt humble requeſt is, that hee would ſo much honor mee, as to ranke mee among their
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7181:259"/>
number that ſhall be appointed for fight.</p>
                  <p>Let me tell you Sir, (replyed the King,) that I now call to minde, what I heard once reported, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> hauing the like occaſion in hand, as ours now is, againſt King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who forcibly had taken from him a great part of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Hee was deliuered by a ſingle Combate, which a young knight (not aged fully eighteen yeares) vndertooke againſt the ſaid King <hi>Abies,</hi> who was recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the very beſt and bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt knights in the whole world: yet was he ſlaine, and King <hi>Perion</hi> put in poſſeſſion of all hee had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly loſt.</p>
                  <p>But aboue all, as a matter moſt deſeruing note, hee then knew him to be his owne Sonne, that had wonne for him that worthy victory: then tearmed the Gentleman of the Sea, and afterward called <hi>Amadis de Gaule.</hi> Thus our Lord (in one day) beſtowed on him two migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bleſſings, by the recouery both of his kingdome and Son. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then (in the like caſe) ſhould not I imitate ſo worthy a man as King <hi>Perion,</hi> and eſſay to deliuer my people out of thoſe great tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as haue afflicted them by a warre ſo long and tedious? Well may I graunt the Combat of twelue of my knights, againſt as many of the enemy: in regard that I am perſwaded of them, as by the help of heauen, and the right of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice being on our ſide, they will beare away the honour of victory. What is your opinion, Knight of the greene Sword?</p>
                  <p>Sir, anſwered he, I neuer had knowledge of that <hi>Amadis;</hi> yet I long time frequented the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Gaule,</hi> where it hath beene my good happe to ſee two of his brethren, who are no way inferior to him in proweſſe, and I haue heard likewiſe, that according as you haue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> declared, ſo it fortuned to King <hi>Perion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as concerning the fight of twelue to twelue, whereas your Maieſty hath reſolued: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God I ſpeake it, had I beene in your place, I ſhould haue done the like.</p>
                  <p>Nay, moreouer Sir, if <hi>Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> had demaunded a much leſſe number, let him be now aſſured, he ſhould not haue beene denyed, were it to the aduenturing mine owne perſon againſt his. And if it pleaſed you but to tell him as much, I would willingly hazard my life, to abate his pride, that prates ſo contemptibly of all men elſe, preſuming vpon his owne vaine glory.</p>
                  <p>I hold it better, (quoth the King,) that you ſhould be twelue equally in number; and therefore I will bethinke my ſelfe, to finde out eleuen of the beſt knights in my kingdome, that may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie you in this attempt. For which, the knight of the greene Sword thanked him.</p>
                  <p>This being done, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Garadan,</hi> and ſpake thus.</p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Garadan,</hi> you haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Combate of twelue to twelue, and I haue yeelded thereunto, vnder thoſe conditions before offered, and to morrow is the day, if you are as ready as wee will be.</p>
                  <p>By my ſoule Sir, anſwered <hi>Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> you yeeld mee the greateſt contentment that euer could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to me, and I could wiſh (if it were poſſible) that your men were as ready, as thoſe that aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7181:260"/>
for the Emperour. <hi>Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> (replied the knight of the greene Sword) ſo the King were ſo pleaſed, and you poſſeſſed with the like deſire of the Combate, as heere you appeare to make ſhew of: I would anſwere your heate this very inſtant houre.</p>
                  <p>What? (quoth <hi>Garadan)</hi> doeſt thou doubt that I will flye from thee? were I ſure to be Emperour of <hi>Rome;</hi> I would refuſe that digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, rather then the offer thou haſt made me. For, if I haue not man-hood ſufficient, whereby to ouer-come thee, and take thy head from thy ſhoulders before it be night, I will willingly forfeite mine owne in the Field. The like hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe (replyed the knight of the Dwarfe) haue I ouer thee: let vs then without longer trifling the time) ſee, whom Fortune will allow the beſt fauour vnto.</p>
                  <p>So both withdrew thence to arme themſelues, returning againe within a ſhort while after; and to the knights that accompanied <hi>Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> thus he ſpake. If euer you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a braue encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter at the launce, doe but obſerue, with what skill and dexterious iudgment, I ſhall giue entertaine to this bold companion, that dare make tryall of his poore fortune againſt me; and repute me neuer to weare Helmet on my head, if I doe not deliuer his head to the Emperour, and leaue the Country quiet, not ſuffering any of you to lay hand to weapon.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Garadan</hi> held on theſe brauing ſpeeches, the knight of the greene Sword, being at the other end of the Field, cryed out aloud to him to defend himſelfe. Then couering themſelues with their Shields, couching their Launces, and giuing ſpurre to their Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers: they ranne againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuch violence, that the knight of the greene Sword was halfe amazed.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Garadan</hi> fell to the ground, ſo farre loſt in himſelfe, that hee lay a long while; vnable to moue either hand or foote, for the launce had pierced thorow his arme, which did put him to intollerable anguiſh.</p>
                  <p>Then the knight of the greene Sword, perceiuing him in ſuch a ſtrange perplexitie, alighted from his horſe, to ſee whether hee were dead or no; and as hee came neere him, <hi>Garadan</hi> being reſtored from his trance, ſtarted vp quickly, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand to his Sword, as if he had felt no harme at all.</p>
                  <p>Now beganne a very fierce and cruell battaile betweene them, and it could not eaſily be iudged, which ſide had the better, becauſe each ſtood ſo ſtiffely to the other, as it mooued no meane admiration in the beholders. And had it not beene for <hi>Garadans</hi> much enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, by the great abundance of blood iſſuing from the wound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in his arme, hee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his enemie more occaſion of trouble and daunger, then as now hee could doe in ſo weake an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
                  <p>At length he found himſelfe ſo ſpent and weary, that to recouer breath, hee thus ſpake vnto him. Beleeue mee Knight of the greene Sword, in regard that I now know yee better then euer I did, I haue iuſter reaſon of wiſhing worſe to ye then before.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to mee, that you beginne to waxe faint, I am well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to ſuffer yee (for a while) to reſt and eaſe your ſelfe. How? (replyed <hi>Amadis)</hi> doeſt thou now talke of reſt, and madeſt vaunt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7181:260"/>
not long ſince to haue my head ſo lightly? Aſſure thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt take no reſt, nor I neither, till one of vs two reſt in death on the ground; and therefore looke to thy ſelfe I would aduiſe thee. Thus ſpeaking, hee charged him fierce, and fiercer, and at laſt let fall ſuch a weightie blow on the toppe of his Helmet, as cleft quite thorow the ſteele, head and braine together, ſo that he fell downe dead in the field. Whereat the Knight of the greene Sword was not a little glad, not ſo much for the ill-will he bare him, as for the diſpleaſure he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to haue done the Emperour, and eſpeciall contentment of King <hi>Tafinor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So wiping his Sword, he put it vp into the ſheathe, rendring thankes to GOD for the victory he had giuen him.</p>
                  <p>Then came the King, and (em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him) demaunded how hee fared. So well my Lord, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> as I haue no wound at all to hinder mee, from entring a freſh fight to morrow morning, with whomſoeuer you ſhall pleaſe to appoint mee. Nay, by my faith (quoth the King) you haue done enough for this buſineſſe. Then was hee conducted into the Citty, with the greateſt triumphe that poſſibly could bee.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes carried thence the body of <hi>Garadan,</hi> ſo daunted with his death, that all deſire of farther fighting was vtterly loſt: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded together, to tell the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that their companion had engadged them (in meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight, adn his owne raſhnes) to decide this difference by Armes: wherein he would needes (ouer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperatly) aduenture himſelfe alone, and ſo loſt the day.</p>
                  <p>No one was againſt this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but a young knight, named <hi>Arquiſil,</hi> a neere kinſman to the Emperour, who perceiuing the bad diſpoſition of the reſt, and the iniury they not onely ſhould doe to the Emperour <hi>Patin,</hi> and to them-ſelues, but likewiſe to the whole Empire, ſpake thus vnto them. How now Lords? will you thus forget your ſelues, and loſe the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Empire? Shall it bee bruited abroade, that eleuen Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane knights (thorow feare of death) were ſo cowardly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as not to combate with twelue <hi>Allemaignes,</hi> groſſe-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fellowes, and very ſlenderly experienced in Armes? So helpe me God, put me alone vpon the enterpriſe, and if you ſtand in doubt of him that hath foyled <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radan,</hi> leaue him onely to me, and ſettle your ſelues to the other; for I dare aſſure yee, if our hearts bee good, wee cannot but ſpeed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefully, and recouer that ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, to our honour, which the misfortune of our friendes hath throwen vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>Let vs fight then, and die eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of vs, rather then deferre it any longer: conſidering, we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to make choice of a death ſo honourable, then liue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in perpetuall ſhame, or ſo wretched a condition of life, as ours muſt needs be.</p>
                  <p>Aſſuredly, the valiant words of this young Prince, preuayled ſo farre vpon the others puſillanimity, and made them ſo confounded with ſhame, as they all reſolued to tempt their fortunes, and euen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute their liues to any perill, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to depart thence, with ſuch diſhonour.</p>
                  <p>They were not ſo prompt and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7181:261"/>
ready for the Combate; but the knight of the greene Sword (hating all ſloth and negligence) was as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to moue the King therein, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, that the next morning hee would appoint the other knights to be in readines, acording to promiſe, &amp; they would accompany them to the field. But the King would faine haue deferred it longer, in regard of the woundes he receiued by <hi>Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi> and being vnable to preuaile with him, he thus ſpake. Knight of the greene Sword, you haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done ſo much for me, as I dare not well deny you any thing you can demand of mee. And ſeeing you will needs haue an end of this controuerſie, my Sonne <hi>Graſandor</hi> ſhall beare you company; for in a better occaſion he can neuer aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his life, nor with a man of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter merit.</p>
                  <p>Sir, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> you ſhould reſerue him for a more ſerious buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; without hazarding him in ſo meane a matter, and where there is ſo ſlender need. Ah Sir knight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Graſandor,</hi> would you offer me a greater wrong then any man elſe can doe? By the faith I beare to my King and Father, if I had ſo much power ouer you, as I freely graunt you haue on me: I would then entreat you ſo farre to honour me, as that I might keepe you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany all my life-time; and I could rather wiſh that I had neuer beene borne, then not to make one in this elected number, and in a caſe of ſuch importance. Seeing it is your pleaſure (quoth the knight of the greene Sword) and that you will needs be one in the fight, I make no doubt but God will aſſiſt vs; for being in your company, it cannot chuſe but wee all ſhall ſpeede the better.</p>
                  <p>So euery one withdrew vntill the next morning when the King came to ſee his knight, whom hee found ready armed; and perceiuing his Armour to be greatly impaired, he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>My worthy Friend, I think it not fit, that you ſhould enter into ſo dangerous a fight, ſo ſlenderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided as you are. Wherefore, let me entreatye to take other Armes, which in my iudgement will bee more conuenient for ye, both in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, eaſe and aptnes. Heereupon, he ſent for an Armour, which hee had kept (a long while) for one of the beſt in the world, and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to the knight of the greene Sword, ſaid. Eſſay Sir, whether it will ſit ye or no, and (for my ſake) arme your ſelfe therewith, which I beſtow on yee with as good a hart, as euer I kiſt Lady in my life. Moſt humbly did <hi>Amadis</hi> giue him thankes; and looking on the Sword, perceiuing it ſo well appointed, he drew it forth of the ſheathe, when it appeared ſo fair and goodly to him, as he ſaid to himſelfe, that he neuer ſaw one of more perfection, then that belonging to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and his owne, which he dearely affected, aſwell for the goodnes thereof, as becauſe he wonne it by the power of loue, as we haue formerly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſecond Booke, in which reſpect, he would not leaue it for the beſt in the world. But ſeeing that this other weapon did well deſerue, to come to the hand of ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy knight: he entreated the Prince <hi>Graſandor</hi> to accept it, whereof he made no refuſall.</p>
                  <p>As they were beholding the reſt of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rmour, newes was brought them, that the eleuen Romaine knights were in the field, and there attended their comming In regard whereof, eachman quickly armed himſelfe, and the twelue knights
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7181:261"/>
rode forth, accompanied with the King, and many other: but when <hi>Arquiſil</hi> beheld them approaching neere, he thus ſpake to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                  <p>Lords, friends and kinde compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, let me entreate ye to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that we go to fight; not onely to winne land for the Emperour, or to maintaine the promiſe made by <hi>Garadan,</hi> but for the honour of the whole Romane Empire. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, I haue ſpoke it, and once again do vrge it, to permit me to combate him, who yeſterday had the victory of our aſſociat. I ſee him come foremoſt, and he ſhall be the firſt (I hope) ouerthrowen: prepare then to meete them, and make ſpare of no man.</p>
                  <p>So taking their ſhields, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched directly againſt their enemies; who perceiuing them to come nere, placed their launces, as they ought, charging manfully one another. <hi>Arquiſil</hi> met the knight of the green Sword, ſo full forward, that he brake his Launce vpon him in many ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: but if himſelfe had not quickly caught hold by the mayne of his horſe, the knight had layde him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on the ground; for he met him with ſuch a direct oppoſition, as he loſt his ſtirrops, and was quite out of his ſaddle. Afterward, perfecting his carriere, he met with one of the other, to whom he gaue ſo ſound a ſalutation on the height of his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, as he diſarmed him thereof. At the ſame inſtant he was freſh char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by two together, and wounded ſo grieuouſly in the thigh, as he was neere falling: whereat hee grew ſo offended, that claſping hand to his Sword, he gaue ſo great a ſtroke to him that was neereſt him, as if hee had not receiued it at his beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, he had beene immediatly ſlaine thereby. But the blow ſlyding by, lighted on the horſes neck, and on the legge of his rider, bearing them both together vnto the ground.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Arquiſil</hi> ſaw that, he came behinde him, and gaue him ſuch a ſtroke on the Helmet, as made his eyes to ſparkle fire: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, hee knew ſo well how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge himſelfe, that he cut off his left arme iuſt at the ſhoulder. Then began the fight to bee more fierce then before, becauſe they all came together pell mell; and although <hi>Arquiſil</hi> felt great pain by his ſo late receiued wound, and loſt his blood ſo extraordinarily; yet for all that, he gaue the by-ſtanders apparant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, that his heart was vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable, and he ſtil maintained the fight, continuing as freſh and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious as any of the reſt. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, at length both he and his companions were ſo ſhreudly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as the moſt part of them lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on the earth, and himſelfe found no meanes, for enduring the ſharpe aſſaults of the knight of the greene Sword, who followed on him ſtill ſo inceſſantly, not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him the leaſt minutes ſpace of breathing, as he was well neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to hold out any longer. Then <hi>Graſandor</hi> buckled with him, and charged him ſo mainely with all his might, that he inſtantly fell downe in a ſwoune. Whereupon he aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his horſe, making ſhewe as if he meant to ſmite off his head. But the knight of the greene Sword perſwaded him to the contrary, and going to him, tooke off his Helmet, that he might receiue ayre: when comming to himſelfe againe, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not a little terrified, when hee perceiued his death ſo nere; where-upon he craued mercy of him. On my faith (quoth the knight) thou dyeſt, except thou yeeld thy ſelfe.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7181:262"/>
Alas, (ſaid hee) I ſubmit to your mercy.</p>
                  <p>Then he tooke him vp, and gaue him aſſurance of life. At which very inſtant came King <hi>Tafinor,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioyfull of ſo happy a victory, demaunded of the knight of the Dwarfe, how hee fared, &amp; whether he were wounded or no. Sir, quoth he, I haue no wound ſo offenſiue to me, but I count it worthily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, in regard that you are ſo hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſerued. So mounting all on horſeback, they returned into the Citty, where the people ſtood in mighty crowds along the ſtreetes, crying out aloud. Bleſſed bee this good knight, by whom (if God bee ſo pleaſed) we ſhall haue peace, and a finall concluſion of warre. In this manner, they followed him to the Kings lodgings, where Chirurgions came to viſit him, aſſuring him (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their liues) that in very few daies they would enable him to ſit on horſebacke, if he would be ordered by their aduice.</p>
                  <p>Now, in regard that all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine knights lay ſlaine in the field, except <hi>Arquiſil,</hi> who was brought in as a priſoner: he entreated the knight of the greene Sword, to ſuffer him to depart thence vpon his faith, that he might carry home his dead companions, vpon condition, that he would return to him at all times, and as often as hee pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arquiſil</hi> (anſwered <hi>Amadis)</hi> you are a Gentleman, and I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that you will performe what you haue promiſed: goe, &amp; returne hither againe ſo ſpeedily as you can. So departed <hi>Arquiſil,</hi> of whom our Hiſtory now ceaſſeth to ſpeake, to tell yee, that within ſome few dayes after, the knight of the green Sword, finding his hurts fully healed, and his body able to beare Armour, hee grew weary of longer tarrying with <hi>Tafinor,</hi> and finding him at conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent leiſure, he ſpake vnto him in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Sir, thankes be to our Lord, you are now in peace, and out of all troubleſome annoyances; wherfore let my departure be with your good lyking: for I am determined to ſet forward to morrow morning, in purſuit of ſuch good fortune, as my faireſt ſtarres ſhall aſſigne vnto me. But thus Sir aſſure your ſelfe, that whereſoeuer I ſhall abide, ſo long as I liue I am your humble ſeruant, as the fauour and honour you haue done me, doth iuſtly binde me. How Sir knight (anſwered the King) will you leaue me? Are you weary of this Country, whereof you onely may diſpoſe, and of my ſelfe alſo. I beſeech you Sir, to accept it as your owne by due deſert, and let mee for euer bee happy by your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</p>
                  <p>Sir, (ſaid the knight) I humbly entreat you to pardon me, and to beleeue, that if it conſiſted in my power, (my earneſt deſire to doe you any ſeruice conſidered) I would yeeld to your requeſt; but my heart by no meanes can permit it. The King knowing that it was ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to detayne him againſt his will, ſaid. To morrow morning I will tell ye more; firſt, wee will heare Maſſe together, and then if it ſhall like you to graunt me one requeſt, which I am to demaund of ye, you ſhall therein do me a ſingular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Sir (anſwered the knight) you haue ſuch power in command ouer me, as (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I thank ye Sir, (quoth the King.) So, falling into other diſcourſe, and night drawing on, the knight of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7181:262"/>
greene Sword, commaunded <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> to make all things ready, for departing thence the next morning by breake of day. But as hee had a purpoſe to repoſe himſelf a while, the remembrance of his Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> ouertook him in his priuate meditations, preſſing him with extraordinary paſſions, as he had no power to refraine from teares, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus to himſelfe. Alas ſweet friend, when ſhall I ſee the time, that I may once more be ſo happy, as to embrace you in mine armes? Loue, thou haſt lifted mee to the higheſt felicity, that euer loyall hart could attaine vnto. But how? looke how much my glory is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable in fauour, the like height it carrieth in tribulation and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the more deſirous I am to ſee ye, the further of ſtill my cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell ſtarres doe ſend me. And that which is my greateſt hell of all, is a grounded feare, that my abſence ſhall either betray me to forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or bring you to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a new loue.</p>
                  <p>Then ſuddenly he beganne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend himſelfe, ſaying. Whence ſhould this idle opinion proceede in me? Deare ſweete, I haue found you ſo firme and conſtant, that I doe commit a ſinne in thinking amiſſe of you.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch is the aſſured proofe of your fidelitie, that the ſmalleſt ſiniſter doubt, is but mine owne ſhame. For well I know, that as my whole life is dedicated to your obedience, ſo you can neuer haue iuſt occaſion to wiſh me ill, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet any vnkinde reuenge on me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you take your ſelfe to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in being more intirely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly affected by me, then any man elſe in the world can doe. And yet I cannot tell, whether Loue be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to puniſh me, becauſe in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining all other, I made my ſelfe ſo wholly yours, as many haue been by me neglected, and diſcourteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed.</p>
                  <p>But well I wot, that my thoughts are ſo familiar in your heart, and your matchleſſe beauty ſo diuinely caractred and engrauen in myſoule, as I may aſſuredly reſolue, that time will ſet a period to all oppreſſions, either by my end, or your accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med loyaltie.</p>
                  <p>Spending thus the night in ſighs and teares, euen vntill the morning appeared, he commaunded <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> to riſe, and being armed, hee went to Church, where he found the King at his deuotions. Hauing heard Maſſe, the King tooke him by the hand, and leading him ſomwhat aſide, ſaid.</p>
                  <p>My deareſt friend, ſeeing you ſtand reſolued to part from me, let me firſt tell yee, that ye haue a King and a kingdome wholly at your command, and heereof take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereſoeuer you ſhall come. Me thinkes you ſhould deferre no longer, to let me know of whence and what you are; promiſing you, vpon the faith and word of a King, that by me you ſhall not any way be diſcouered, except it may bee done with your conſent.</p>
                  <p>Sir (anſwered the knight;) let me entreate yee heerein not to wrong me, for I am minded neuer to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe my ſelfe to any one, except by force I ſhall be thereto compelled. Then you doe me a great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, quoth the King. God ſhield me replyed the knight, from offending ſo good and gracious a Prince: I will rather diſpenſe with my vow, and tell ye. Sir, I am that <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> Sonne to King <hi>Perion,</hi> whoſe name you remembred, when you agreed to the Combate of twelue knights to twelue. By the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7181:263"/>
faith I beare to God, (ſaid the King) my heart did alwayes perſwade me ſo, and reſt your ſelfe aſſured, that this knowledge of you is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to me, then any thing elſe whatſoeuer in the world can bee. Bleſſed be the Father and Mother, that haue yeelded the world ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a man, by whom ſo many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue receiued both profite and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Now was the King much more deſirous of his longer ſtay: but that <hi>Amadis</hi> moſt inſtantly vrged the contrary, whereto he durſt not make refuſall. Wherefore, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on horſebacke, by a goodly company he was conducted forth of the Citty, and there being commended to all good ſucceſſe: hee tooke his way towards <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> ſeeking after ſtrange aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as Fortune pleaſed to direct him.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the gay ſeaſon of Mayes flouriſhing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing long ſoiourned in one place, was entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Ladies, that hee would guide them forth on hunting: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he very willingly condiſcended, and preſently commaunded his huntſmen, to prepare their toyles in the next adioyning Forreſt, and to erect their Tents by the Fountaine of the ſeauen Beech trees, which was the moſt pleaſing place in all the wood, and beſt agreeing with the time. Not farre off thence was the Hermitage, where <hi>Naſcian</hi> the holy man nouriſhed <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> as already hath beene declared to yee.</p>
                  <p>It happened on the ſame day, when the King had left the Ladies in their Pauilions, hee ſo long pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a Hart, ſore hunted and eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from the toyles, that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to take vp into the higheſt of the Forreſt, all along the ſide of a great hill, very well couered with brakes and buſhes. So ſoone as he had attayned to the toppe there-of, on the other ſide he eſpied a young Gentleman deſcending ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, aged (as it might bee) about fiue or ſixe yeeres, leading a Lyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a leaſhe; who ſeeing the Hart ſo hotly chaſed, hee let her looſe after him, and ſhee purſued with ſuch ſpeed, that ſhe tooke him downe before the King. The young youth, glad of ſo good ſucceſſe, ran a pace to the fall of the Deere, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother childe that was his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, where ſeazing on the veneſon, hee tooke out a knife to cut his throate.</p>
                  <p>Then winding a horne very loud, two little Bratches, which ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed to follow him, came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to him, and both they and the Lyonneſſe, had their fees of the game. This done, hee tooke and coupled them in a leaſhe; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7181:263"/>
done the like to the Lyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, croſſed again ouerthwart the wood.</p>
                  <p>The King, ſeeing them make haſte away from him, was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know what they were, and comming forth of the place, where he had hid himſelfe, to note the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of theſe children, called to the young Gentleman, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſtayed, vntill ſuch time as the King came to him, vſing theſe words. Prettie childe, I pray thee tell me what thou art, and where is thy dwelling.</p>
                  <p>Sir knight (anſwered the youth, <hi>Naſcian</hi> the Hermite hath hitherto nurſed me, and (as I thinke) is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both to me, and this my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. This anſwere made the King very penſiue, for he could not comprehend in his thoughts, that <hi>Naſcian</hi> (being aged and decrepit, as alſo reputed for a man of moſt ſanctified life) ſhould or could haue a childe ſo young and goodly: wherefore, as one couetous of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther information, hee demaunded where the Hermitage ſtood. It ſtands (quoth the youth) on the top of this Rocke, and ſhewing him a littly path, leſt him, ſaying. If it ſhall pleaſe yee to follow this tract, it will guide yee thither: for I muſt needs after my fellow to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, where wee muſt dreſſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon, which wee haue gotten this morning.</p>
                  <p>Then the King left him, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending vp the Rocke, eſpied on the height thereof, the poore dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Naſcian,</hi> ſo enuironed with great buſhes, as well witneſſed the wonderfull ſolitude of the good Hermite. Alighting from his horſe, he entred into the firſt room, where hee found the holy man vpon his knees, clothed in a religious habit, and reading in a Booke of deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hee gaue not ouer at his arriuall: but hauing finiſhed his prayers, hee aroſe, demaunding of the King what he ſought for. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, quoth he, not long ſince, as I croſſed the Forreſt, I met with a goodly childe, leading a Lyonneſſe in a leaſhe, I pray ye (for courteſies ſake) to tell me what he is: for, at the very firſt ſight of him, my minde gaue me, that he is iſſued from ſome good place.</p>
                  <p>While the King continued on this ſpeech, the Hermite ſo heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerued him, that hee knew him: as being the man to whom he had done many ſeruices, during the time that he followed Armes. In regard whereof, falling down hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly vpon his knees, hee craued par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his error, in not giuing him ſuch entertainment, as beſeemed ſo great a Maieſtie. But the King rayſing him vp, tooke him by the hand, ſaying. Good Father, will you not reſolue me concerning the young childe which I mentioned to ye? Aſſure your ſelfe (vpon my faith) that the knowledge you may giue me of him, cannot but redound to his great benefit. Sir, anſwered the Hermite, our Lord hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhewen great ſignes of loue to that childe; and ſeeing hee hath ſo carefully kept him, as I ſhall relate vnto ye, it ſtands with good reaſon, that you (as a King) ſhould loue &amp; defend him in ſuch ſort, as no harme or diſpleaſure ſhould bee offered him.</p>
                  <p>You haue (as appeareth by your ſpeeches) an carneſt deſire to know what he is. In trueth Sir, during the time that I haue nouriſhed him, he may be tearmed mine: albeit, it is not yet fully ſixe yeares, ſince I tooke him from the teeth of a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onneſſe, that was carrying him to her whelpes. Wherein our Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7181:264"/>
declared, that hee is the preſeruer of all his creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the beaſt neuer did him harme, but onely ſuckled it among her yong ones, ſo that by the milke of her, and of a little Ewe, which then I had, I compaſſed the meanes of foſtring him for more then a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: In expectation ſtill of mine owne Siſter, Mother to the other yong Lad that keepes him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, who afterward comming to me, ſhe became ſo good a Nurſe and Gouerneſſe to him, that (thankes be giuen to our Lord for it) I am perſwaded, he is one of the goodlieſt creatures this day li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
                  <p>And one thing (more ſtrange then all the reſt) I am to tell yee: vnderſtand Sir, that as I was about to baptize him, my Siſter hauing taken off very rich clothes, wherein he was ſwadled, ſhee ſhewed me a letter vnder his right pappe as white as ſnow, contayning the word <hi>Eſplandian;</hi> and on the other ſide, (directly againſt his heart) were other carracters as redde as blood, which I could neuer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, becauſe they are neither La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, nor of our language. Now in regard of that name, which at his birth (it ſeemes) he brought with him into the world, I haue euer-more ſince, cauſed him to be called <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> accordingly.</p>
                  <p>In good faith Father, ſaide the King, you haue tolde me wonders: but ſeeing you found him in ſuch fort as you ſay, it is to be preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed verily, that he was borne not far off from this Countrie. That know not I, anſwered <hi>Naſcian,</hi> neither co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet I to vnderſtand more, then what our Lord hath permitted. Well then, quoth the King, to morrow good Father, I pray you meete me at the Fountaine of the ſeauen Beeches, where I ſhall be with my Queene, and a goodly company of Ladies. Bring <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onneſſe, and your young Nephew with you, to whom I intend ſome good, for his Father <hi>Sergils</hi> ſake, whom I ſomtime knew to be a good knight. Sir, replyed the holy man, I am bound to doe what you haue enioyned mee, and deſire of God, that all may be to his honour and glory.</p>
                  <p>The King giuing him the good morrow, rode thence, and arriued at his Tents about midday. Now, becauſe none there knew what was become of him, each man was dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in enquiry after him: and (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his moſt intimate familiars deſired to know where hee had bin, yet would he reueale nothing, but commaunded to couer for dinner. As he was ready to ſit downe at the Table, <hi>Grumedan</hi> came to tell him, that the Queene entreated him to ſee her Tent before dinner, about ſome nouell occurrences lately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening. Whereupon hee went thence to her, and being alone by themſelues, ſhee told him, that as they came ryding from the Citty, a very beautifull Damoſell, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon a light ambling Hobbie, and conducted onely by a Dwarfe, preſented her ſelfe before her. And ſhe being very ſumptuous in her apparell, rode by all my Ladies, and women, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Then he reported, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he met him, and all that he had heard of the Hermit: whereof the good Queene was not a little ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as well becauſe ſhee ſhould ſee the childe; as to haue ſome confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the holy man, in caſes of Conſcience, and to be confeſſed by him. Neuertheleſſe Madame, (quoth the King) I deſire that you would not diſcloſe this to any one, vntill ſuch time as hee bee in our preſence.</p>
                  <p>Afterward, they went and ſate downe to dinner, talking of nothing all that while, but what goodly Harts and Hindes they had ſeene in the Forreſt. Then came <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Norandell</hi> with their veniſon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the King to be earely ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the next morning: for they had fayled in the purſuit of a wilde Boare, the moſt huge and ſtrangeſt that euer they had ſeene. But hee made them anſwere, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued certaine letters from <hi>Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> which he would impart to them the day following, and prayed them
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7181:265"/>
therfore in the meane ſpace to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh well the Houndes, till all were perfourmed as he had determined. Then riſing from the Table, the King went and conuerſed with the Ladies, ſo ſpending all the reſt of the day, vntill the houre of repoſe approached, when each one with-drew to their lodgings: and on the next morning, hauing heard Maſſe, each ſaluted other with the good morrow.</p>
                  <p>The day beganne to grow on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, and the weather was ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary warme, that the Queene commaunded the ſides of her tents to bee turned vp, for better recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the freſh coole ayre. Then could ſhe diſcerne a goodly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Ladies, flocking together beneath the toyles; in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the King being arriued (the Ladies and knights conferring on what they beſt affected) he drewe <hi>Vrgandaes</hi> Letter forth of his ſleeue, which hee had receiued the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thus ſpeaking to <hi>Galaor</hi> and the reſt. Now will I ſhew you an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement, that was ſent vnto mee yeſterday, whereat (I thinke) you will no leſſe wonder, then I my ſelfe already haue done. Then he read it out ſo loud among them, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one might eaſily heare it. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, they could not preſume what this happy childe ſhould bee, to whom deſtiny had promiſed ſuch gracious bleſſings: onely the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> excepted, whom it tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched neerer then any of the reſt, not hauing (in ſo long time) heard of her loſt Sonne. This was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to raiſe ſuſpition in her, that this might be her child; wherupon, ſuch an biguous perſwaſions ouer-tooke her thoughts, that aboue ten times ſhe changed colour: yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerned of any there preſent; for they were all attentiue to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters reading, as alſo to the Kings ſpeeches, who demanded of <hi>Galaor,</hi> to know his opinion.</p>
                  <p>Sir, (ſaid he) ſeeing that <hi>Vrganda</hi> hath ſent it to yee, we may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that it will fall out ſo, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the trueth of thoſe things, which ſo many times heeretofore ſhe hath foretold, and no doubt but God will ſo permit it; for it wold be the greateſt to mee, that euer can happen in all my life-time, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

As he ended theſe words, afarre off he eſpied the good Hermite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the two young Laddes <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian</hi> and <hi>Sergil,</hi> with two vanaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, kinſemen to olde <hi>Naſcian,</hi> in ſuch order as I ſhall deſcribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ye. <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had a great Hare, and two Partridges hanging on his ſhoulder, which he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>in with his Bowe by the way as hee came. <hi>Sergil</hi> led the Lyonneſſe in a leaſhe, faſtened with a little cord, and theſe followed <hi>Naſcian,</hi> and the two other: the one of them carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hart, which the Lyonneſſe had kilde the day before; as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath bin related, and the other ledde the two Braches (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Eſplandian)</hi> coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>When the Ladies ſaw the Lyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo ſlenderly guarded, they were ſo afraid, that they came all &amp; ſate about the king: who for their more aſſurance, ſaid. Let none be diſmayed; for he that is maiſter ouer this Lyonnes in power, will defend vs from a more daungerous beaſt then this is. I know not, ſaid <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> who hath moſt commaund o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the beaſt: but if ſhee once waxe diſpleaſed, the Huntſman

So each one aroſe, and the King went and embraced the Hermite, ſaying, hee was moſt heartily wel-come. Then taking the olde man by the one hand, and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> by the other, hee preſented them both to the Queene. Beholde Madame, the very goodlieſt Gentleman that euer you ſaw.

My Lord, I humbly beſeech you, to accept this Hart as your owne, and my Lady ſhall haue this Hare: but theſe Partridges are for the tother Lady ſtanding by her. This hee ſpake of <hi>Oriana</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who darted ſuch a louing look at him, as is eaſier for you to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, then me to vtter. How pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sir? ſaid the King, will you giue nothing to theſe Gentlemen? I haue no more to giue, replyed the childe, but if I come hither againe tomorrow, I will bring them thus, ſuch as I can get: in the mean while if you be ſo pleaſed, you may let them bee partakers of your veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>All this young diſcourſe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered with ſo good a grace, and ſuch pleaſing life of geſture by <hi>Eſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landian,</hi> that it procured much loue and admiration enterchanged with ſmiles and amiable regardes. In good ſadneſſe, ſaid the King, his gentle nature is not to be wondered at: for, by that which hath bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to me, by him who hitherto was his foſter-father, faire deſtiny hath made large promiſes to him. Therefore good Father quoth he to <hi>Naſcian,</hi> to the end that euery one heere preſent, may vnderſtand the trueth of his rare fortune: I pray you once more to diſcourſe, that wherewith you acquainted me yeſterday. Sir, anſwered the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, it is now more then fiue years, ſince I found the childe in the mouth of this Lyonneſſe, carrying it to her young ones newly whelpt: and I am verily perſwaded, that hee was not then fully a naturall day old. Then hee declared the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his ſwadling clothes; what countenance the Lyonneſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, when ſhe firſt gaue him ſucke, and the care hee had all the while of his thus nouriſhing, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his Siſters comming.</p>
                  <p>All this diſcourſe was diligently liſtened vnto by <hi>Oriana, Mabtla,</hi> and the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> well knowing (by the Hermites rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that <hi>Elplandian</hi> was (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly) the Son to <hi>Amadis</hi> &amp; the Princeſſe; which cauſed ſuch
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7181:266"/>
pleaſing contentment in them all, that they knew not well how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it. Old Father, (quoth the King to the Hermite) you told me yeſterday, that ſeeing our Lord had hitherto ſo graciouſly preſerued the childe, I ought to haue care of him in his following-dayes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it like you to leaue him with me, and his young companion like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I will cauſe them to bee ſo commendably educated, that (if God be ſo pleaſed) they ſhall both proue worthy men, &amp; good knights; and I deſire that I may preuaile with you in this requeſt. Sir (anſwered the Hermite) they are yours, ſeeing you are ſo deſirous to haue them: and I will heartily pray vnto our Lord God, to endue them with ſuch grace, as they may hereafter do you ſome acceptable ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Then he gaue them his bleſſing, with theſe words. My Sonnes, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King hath done ye ſo much honour, to allow yee entertainment in his Court, take paines to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient and pleaſing to him. The good olde man ſhed teares in great abundance, during the time of this ſhort ſweete counſell: when the King ſaid vnto him: Graue Father, make no doubt but I wil ſo gouerne them, that they ſhall become ſuch men as I haue promiſed ye. Then I beſeech ye Sir, (ſaid the Queene to the King) that you would referre them to my direction, till they bee more fitting for your ſeruice: and your Daughter ſhall haue <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and my ſelfe will haue care of <hi>Sergil.</hi> Bee it as you pleaſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame (anſwered the King) I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them both to your diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Thus the childe was deliuered into his owne mothers gouerning, who accepted him more gladly, then any gift in the world that elſe could haue beene giuen her: and long time hee continued with her, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to any, but thoſe Ladies that were beſt acquainted with her moſt priuate occaſions. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Naſcian</hi> departed thence, ſhe would needes be confeſſed by him: wherupon (vnder ſhrift) ſhe gaue him to vnderſtand, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was ſonne to her and <hi>Amadis,</hi> and in what manner hee was loſt, by his carriage to nurſe. Beleeue mee Daughter (anſwered the Hermite) our Lord muſt needes be offended with you, in offering ſuch iniury to your owne ſoule, thorow an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and volupruous deſire: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally you being borne of ſo great parents, and ought to be a mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> and example to all the other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, aboue whom it hath pleaſed him to aduance yee. Deare Father, (quoth ſhe,) I know wel, that I haue moſt grieuouſly ſinned: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that which I haue done, was as a woman to her husband; for at the inſtant, we affianced our ſouls mutually together. Heereupon ſhe reported how <hi>Archalaus</hi> had led her away, and how ſhee was after ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured by <hi>Amadis,</hi> according as already hath beene related, in the precedent Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Then the Hermit was reaſonably well ſatisfied, accounting the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſo much the leſſe, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone with ſo good a condition: for after this confeſsion, the effect followed, becauſe by this meanes, (though ſome long while before) <hi>Naſcian</hi> made peace with the King and <hi>Amadis,</hi> being on the very point of entring into a ſharpe and cruell battaile, as you ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand more at large in the fourth Book following. But <hi>Oriana</hi> hauing done pennance, according as <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> had appointed her: he tooke leaue of the King and the whole Court, to returne home to his

                  <p>God defend her from al harmes, (replyed our ſad knight,) albeit I haue no further knowledge of her. But tell me Lady I pray yee, what would this knight haue that came hither with you? Sir, (quoth ſhe) let him no way procure your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte: onely doe what I haue deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and well will come of it. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, (ſaid he) if you will not tell me, I ſhall faile in fulfilling what you would haue. Seeing you are ſo earneſt Sir, (quoih ſhee) you ſhal be ſatisfied, although it is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my minde. Vnderſtand then Sir, that when my Lady had eſpyed you, and this Dwarfe attending on you; becauſe it hath beene told her, that there was a ſtraunge knight in this Country, who performed ſuch actions of Armes, as no man poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly can doe more, and goes alwaies accompanied as now you are: ſhee is halfe perſwaded that you are the man. In which reſpect, ſhe would gladly doe you all honorable ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhe can deuiſe, and diſcouer an eſpeciall ſecret to ye, which (as yet) ſhe hath not reuealed to any perſon liuing.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, as concerning this knight, when hee heard my Ladies motion, he made her anſwere, that he would cauſe you to come to her by force or faire meanes, which is very eaſie for him to doe, in regard of the high chiualry remaining in him; for his equal is not to be found in all theſe Countries: wherefore I would counſell you to credit me, &amp; goe along with me.</p>
                  <p>Friendly Damoſell, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I would gladly doe more for your Miſtreſſe then this: but I muſt firſt trye, whether this knight can accompliſh his promiſe, or no. By my faith Sir, quoth ſhe, I am the more ſorry for ye; becauſe, ſo farre as my weake iudgment can reache, you appeare to bee a moſt courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous knight. So ſhe turned her pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray, and the knight of the dwarfe followed on his way, as before hee had done.</p>
                  <p>When the other knight ſaw that, he cryed out ſo loud as hee could. Cowardly and faint-harted knight, alight from thy horſe, and lead him backward, vſing his taile in ſtead of a bridle. Then come ſo, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thy ſelfe to my Lady, humbly crauing her mercy, becauſe thou didſt not follow her Damoſell; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I ſhall ſmite off thy head from thy ſhoulders; therefore make choice of theſe two offers, which thou doeſt imagine moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thee.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue me Sir, anſwered the knight of the Dwarſe, ſuch ſeruice is better beſeeming you, then mee; fall to it therefore, when you pleaſe. Is it euen ſo Sir? (ſaid the other;) then Ile make yee doe it, whether you will or no. So placing his Launce in his reſt, hee made no doubt of foyling him, as hee had done many before. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, our knight of the dwarfe, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not the leaſt moment of readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to receiue him, gaue the ſpurs to his horſe, and met the other (who was named <hi>Brandaſidel)</hi> ſo full in the carriere, that he caſt him quite out of his ſaddle, and hee lay in a trance vpon the ground; but him-ſelfe was hurt a little in the throate, and finiſhing his courſe, he turned bridle againe for a freſh encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

As <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

How? quoth our knight, haſt thou not the heart to ſpeake? By the faith I beare to God, thy head then ſhall giue me a better reaſon. So diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from his horſe, and lifting vp his Sword to ſtrike; <hi>Brandaſidel</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto him. Hold your hand Sir knight, for I will accompliſh your command, rather then dye in this vile maner. Riſe then, replyed the knight of the Dwarfe, and let mee haue it done immediatly. Then <hi>Brandaſidel</hi> aroſe, and called his Squires to helpe him vp on horſe-backe, according as the knight of the Dwarfe had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, ſitting with his face backward, and holding his horſe taile in ſteed of a bridle, turning his Shield alſo the in ſide outward. In this maner rode he to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> who ſeeing him come ſo honourably, could not refraine from laughing, not any in her company, to ſee him thus worthily corrected with his owne rodde. In which regard he was ſo aſhamed of himſelfe, that he du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> not look vp; but holding down his head like a micher, rode thence away into the Towne.</p>
                  <p>Now, the Damoſell that was ſent from this Lady to our knight of the Dwarfe, heard the wordes which paſſed betweene the two knights, and obſerued the manner of their encounter, whereof as ſhee was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king report to her Miſtreſſe, the knight of the Dwarfe came thither, where humbly ſaluting <hi>Graſinda,</hi> he thus ſpake.</p>
                  <p>Madame, by that which one of your women told mee, you haue a deſire to ſpeake with mee. Indeed Sir knight, (quoth ſhee) ſhee told you nothing but trueth; and ſeeing it hath pleaſed you to doe mee ſo much honour, you are moſt reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely welcome. For, ouer and beſide thoſe miracles of manhood, which I haue heard (for trueth) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by you in theſe our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: I was made acquainted (not long ſince) with the extraordinarie fauour, which King <hi>Tafinor</hi> of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> (my Couſin) receiued by your meanes. In which reſpect, I muſt confeſſe my ſelfe to ſtand obliged to you, and doe therefore entreate you (ſo farre as my poore power may preuaile with you) to accept a lodging in my Palace, where your hurt may bee diligently attended: thus aſſuring your ſelfe, that to no place you can be better welcome, nor receiue ſpeedier cure. Madame, (ſaid he) perceiuing in what kinde manner you haue entreated me, let me perſwade you to reſt reſolued, that I will make no ſpare of my ſelfe in all perils of the world, to doe you any ſeruice: and therefore, reaſon ſtrictly bindeth me, not to refuſe your moſt gracious offer, mine owne neceſſity ſo much requiring it.</p>
                  <p>Thus rode they on towardes the Towne, conferring very kindly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7181:268"/>
and <hi>Graſinda</hi> ſeeing him to be ſo goodly and compleate a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, inſtantly fell into amorous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And let me tell ye, ſhee was a Lady of moſt exquiſite beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, young, delicate, well-ſpoken, affable, in the gayetic of her time, worthy of the chiefeſt liking, as any Lady elſe could be, hauing liued in marriage not fully a yeare, being now a widow, and without any childe. But the knight of the Dwarfe had his thoughts elſe-where buſied, the Idea of his <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> being continually before his eyes, by whoſe abſence he endured extreame paſſions: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he knew ſo well how to conceale them, as the cunningſt eye could hardly make any diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery.</p>
                  <p>As they entred into the Towne, the inhabitants (who had already heard of the ſucceſſe betweene him and <hi>Brandaſidel,</hi> who before had bin reputed the tougheſt knight in all that Countrie,) thronged thorow the ſtreetes to ſee him, ſaying to one another as hee paſſed along: This were a happy fortune to our Lady, if ſhee might haue this man to bee her husband; for a more good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon is no where to bee found, nor of greater valour. Being come to the Palace, and conducted into a very ſumptuous Chamber, he was there vnarmed.</p>
                  <p>Then came Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellent Chirurgion, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſeene the wound which he had receiued in his throate, ſaide vnto him. Sir, you are wounded in a very dangerous place, and haue need of long reſt: otherwiſe, your perſon will be in great hazard. Very ſorry was our knight to heare theſe words, and ſaid to Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet.</hi> I will doe whatſoeuer you will haue me, prouided, that you promiſe me, (vpon your faith to God, and your Miſtreſſe,) that ſo ſoone as you ſhal ſee me in diſpoſition, to endure tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, you will not faile to tell mee, becauſe whatſoeuer I doe, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to reſt in any quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vntill it pleaſe our Lord to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that I may bee where my heart deſireth to ſoiourne. Thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, he fell into ſuch a melancholy fitte, as teares iſſued abundantly out of his eyes, whereof he was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed: neuertheleſſe, reſtrayning them ſo couertly as he could, hee ſhewed a more chearefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance then before. And Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> ſaid vnto him: I pray you Sir, vſe as little ſadneſſe as poſſibly you may, and I truſt in God, in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort while to ſee you ſafely cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Then were the Tables comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be couered, and <hi>Graſinda</hi> her ſelfe ſerued in perſon, perſwading him very earneſtly to be merry: and ſupper being ended, they betooke themſelues ſeuerally to reſt; but in ſteed of ſleeping, he (according to his wonted manner) beganne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his <hi>Oriana,</hi> in whom was his ſole delight and pleaſure, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing (notwithſtanding) thoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations with extreame torments and paſſions, which combatted continually one againſt another, ſo that in the midſt of this trauaile, at length he fell aſleepe. But if loue preuayled ſo powerfully in him, hee was of no leſſe might in our new Loue <hi>Graſinda,</hi> who being with-drawen into her Chamber, ſoone after, betooke her ſelfe to bed: when (ſuddenly) the comely graces and feature of our knight of the greene Sword, in liuely conceit preſented themſelues before her, which helde ſo ſtrict a commaund ouer her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as ſhe had no ability to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict thoſe impreſsions, ſo that

ſhe fell to this conference with her ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Alas, whence ſhould proceede this ydle fancie? The death of my late husband, did ſo farre eſtraunge mee from this behauiour, as I haue many times ſolemnely purpoſed, neuer more to come in ſubiection to any man liuing.

                  <p>Now, as ſhe purpoſed to diſcloſe her hearts oppreſsions, feare and ſhame, inter-mixed with that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt baſhfulneſſe, which euermore held ſoueraigne dominion ouer her, had ſo cloſely lockt vp her lips, that ſhe ſate vnable to make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny anſwere. But ſhe ſent him ſuch a heart-ſpeaking looke, as made her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>re complexion to alter; which our knight of the Dwarfe wel obſerued, but imagining this weakeneſſe to proceed from ſome other occaſion, he thus ſpake. Madame, ſeeing your diſpoſition hath bin ſo diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to yee, me thinkes I ſhould not miſcounſell yee, to goe and lye downe againe, and ſleep may come vpon ye better, then before. Let me tell ye Sir (anſwered <hi>Graſinda,)</hi> this diſeaſe is too frequent with me, and will paſſe away (by Gods leaue) as ſudd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>She ſpake this, to preuent all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of leauing his company, wherein ſhee ſpent the whole day, taking ſuch delight in looking on him, as ſhee had almoſt forgot her ſelfe, that it was now a due houre to command her abſence. Wherefore, giuing him the good night, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her bed, where, if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent night ſhee tooke little reſt, this that enſued, was much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to her, becauſe inceſſantly ſhe turned from one ſide to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by reaſon of this fiery loue tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in her. So that, ſetting aſide all other cares, ſhe concluded (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further delaying) the very next morning, to let the knight vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand her martyrdome. And
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7181:269"/>
queſtionleſſe, had he not bin woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo violent was her extreamity; that inſtantly ſhee would haue gone to his bed. For, thoſe delights and ſolaces, which (for leſſe then a yeares ſpace) ſhee had with her late husband, added freſh fuell to her flame, and was as tinder to her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing paſſions: which at length ſo ouer wearied her, as ſhee fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe, and ſo continued till it was broad day.</p>
                  <p>Being vp and ready; according to her vſuall cuſtome, ſhee went to ſee how her knight did, more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then euer before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſhee had bin; and whereas in her night fittes, ſhee had reſolued to acquaint him with her diſquiet, Day had put her on ſuch a Robe of ſhame, as quite alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her determination. Thus for more then a moneths ſpace ſhee continued in theſe agonies, till one day among other, meeting with <hi>Gandalin</hi> at apt leyſure, ſhe thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpake him.</p>
                  <p>Friendly Squire, in the loue that you beare to God &amp; your Maiſter, let me entreate to mooue one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to ye, concerning him, which cannot but returne to his great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and profit, and by mee ſhall not bee diſcouered to any liuing. Madame (quoth <hi>Gandalin)</hi> if your motion be within the compaſſe of my capacity, aſſure your ſelfe that I will reſolue ye. Tell me then, ſweet Friend, (ſaid <hi>Graſinda,)</hi> doe you know of his affection to any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that may contradict his loue to another, if it ſhould grow to ſuch a purpoſe? Madame (quoth he) it is but a little while as yet, ſince the Dwaife and I became his ſeruants; whereto nothing more incited vs, then his admired vertues and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne: And he hath expreſſely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid vs, to enquire either of his name, or any of his affaires: but to declare the fidelitie of our duty, in knowing no more then he thinkes fit for vs. But thus much I dare tell yee, that wee haue already ſeene ſuch valour in him, as you may well credit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion, that he is the beſt knight in the world.</p>
                  <p>Now, as <hi>Gandalin</hi> made a more ample relation of his Maiſters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, ſhe held her eyes fixed on the ground, and (in ſighing) ſhewed her ſelfe ſo penſiue, that hee eaſily perceiued the loue ſhee bare to his Lord. But tell me then Sir, I pray ye, (quoth ſhe,) why did hee fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeping the other day in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Truely Madame, ſaid he, it is a matter continually happening to him, and ſo often doth hee ſighe both by day and night, that I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile much how he can liue. Yet I know him to be ſuch a man, and of ſo great ſpirit, that this proceedeth not from any dread of peril, or from any hazardous enterpriſe he can vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake: whereby it may bee eaſily preſumed, that it is entire loue and affection, which he beareth to ſome Lady that I know not. So God help me, (replyed <hi>Graſinda)</hi> I do beleeue as much, and highly thanke yee for this courteſie. Now, you may go to him, when you pleaſe, and heauen ſend him as ſpeedie a remedie for his hurts, as I could willingly wiſh to mine.</p>
                  <p>Hauing thus ſpoken, ſhee with-drew thence into her Chamber, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading her ſelfe aſſuredly, that ſhe was preuented in her hopes: where-upon, ſhe promiſed by all diſcreete meanes, to quenche the fire already too much kindled. Neuertheleſſe, Loue ſtill gaue a maine oppoſition, and fed her imaginations with idle conceit, that (in time) ſhee ſhould hit the marke ſhe aymed at. But it fell out otherwiſe; for ſo ſoone as our knight felt himſelfe able for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7181:269"/>
Armes, he commaunded <hi>Gandalin</hi> to make all things ready, becauſe he meant to ride away the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>At that very inſtant <hi>Graſinda</hi> came into his Chamber, where talking together as they were wont to doe, and falling from one diſcourſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the knight of the Dwarſe at laſt ſpake thus. Madame, I feele my ſelfe ſo exceedingly well reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered (thankes be to God and you) as I am purpoſed, ſo you bee not therewith diſpleaſed, to part from hence very earely to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: coueting nothing more in my defi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, then to ſtudy how I may (during my life-time) beſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the good and honor you haue done me. Therefore Madame, I moſt humbly entreate you, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with your ſelfe, if there be any ſeruice that you ſhal pleaſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me, my imployment therein ſhall ſtretch ſo farre as my lifes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Graſinda</hi> heard theſe wordes, ſhe fell into ſuch a heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as ſhe could not returne him any anſwere: neuertheleſſe, at length ſhe thus replyed. Knight of the greene Sword, I make no doubt, but that your heart and tongue are relatiues, the one agreeing with the others intention, as well for the good which you ſay, you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in my houſe, as for a matter of farre higher moment, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the time, nor your forward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, will now permit to be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Therfore, when the happy houre ſhall come beſt fitting mee to vrge my recompence, aſſure your ſelfe, I will demaund it ſo ſecretly of you, (without either bluſhing, feare or ſhame) as you ſhall well perceiue it to be a matter, which I haue hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to kept concealed in my heart, and neuer reuealed to any one liuing. In the meane while, let me entreate you to tell me, which way you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to direct your trauaile? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me Madame, anſwered our knight, I hope in ſhort time to bee in <hi>Greece,</hi> as well to ſee the country, as the Emperour, of whom I haue heard many good reports.</p>
                  <p>Truely Sir, (replyed <hi>Graſinda,)</hi> I wiſhe all happy ſucceſſe to attend yee; and I meane to prouide a Ship for ye, and to furniſh ye in ſuch ſort, as your voyage ſhall be the eaſier perfourmed. Moreouer, I will giue ye Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> for your health and welfare, when any diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or inconuenience ſhall befall ye: with this promiſe, that if you finde your body apt and able, you ſhall come againe hither to mee within a yeares compaſſe. Our knight had ſmall reaſon to refuſe ſo great kindnes; but in returning <hi>Graſinda</hi> moſt harty thankes, ſaid. Madame, I were the moſt abiect wretch in the world, and no way worthy the name of knight, if I ſhould not endeauour to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſo many gracious fauours, as you haue beſtowed vpon me; and I ſhould think the wearing of Armes farre vnfit for me, if either by dread of death, or any other accident whatſoeuer, I ſhould deferre the fulfilling of what you haue inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me. What I deſire (quoth ſhe) to haue you doe for me, ſhalbe reſpitted till your backe returne, and it is no other thing, but what ſhalbe for your honor and aduantage. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame (ſaid he) ſuch is my confidence in your true appearing vertues, that you will not vſe me in any other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. No, vpon my faith, (quoth ſhe.)</p>
                  <p>Then ſhe ſent for Maiſter <hi>Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> to whom ſhe gaue charge for prouiding a good Ship in readines,

and all neceſſaries elſe fit for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, during the knights voyage to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Which he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed with ſuch care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as (the fift day following) our knight taking leaue of <hi>Graſinda,</hi> went aboord with Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet.</hi> Hoyſing their ſayles, they paſſed many Iſlands of <hi>Romania,</hi> in the more part whereof he performed ſuch rare deedes of proweſſe; that his fame flew (in ſhort while) through the whole Country. But by reaſon he had no more then a yeares limitation, for his returne to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> the Mariners importuned him to more ſpeedines: giuing him to vnderſtand, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him (making ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes by the way) to finiſh the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſo ſoone: Whereupon he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, to land no more till he came into <hi>Greece;</hi> and therefore launched forth into the maine: where (for this time) wee will leaue him to ſpeake of matters happening in Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> during the long voyage of <hi>Amadis.</hi>

                  <p>It hath bin tolde yee in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Booke, that <hi>Patin,</hi> being then no more then a meane knight, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great eſtate or poſſeſſion, liued onely in hope; to bee heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the death of his brother happened, who had no procreated heire of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This perſwaſion, in reſpect of his loue to the Queene <hi>Sardami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> whom he moſt intirely affected, made him vndertake the voyage of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> where he was moſt honourably entertained by King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> eſpecially after he knew him to be the Emperors brother. There he grew forgetfull of his firſt loue, beholding the beauty and comely graces of the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom he requeſted in mariage of the King her Father. Vpon the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere made him, he determined to ſhewe himſelfe among the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant ſpirits, in ſearche of ſtraunge aduentures, and combatting all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant knights he ſhould meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Croſſing through the Forreſt, whereas then <hi>Amadis</hi> was, deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of euer ſeeing his <hi>Oriana</hi> any more (in regard of his baniſhment, ſignified to him by <hi>Durin,</hi> brother to the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke)</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ſing the praiſes of the Princeſſe, and to glorifie himſelfe in the loue ſhe bare him in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. At which time, <hi>Amadis</hi> and he fought together, where <hi>Patin</hi> was conquered, and ſore wounded in the head: in regard whereof, he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> without going backe to King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his marriage in ſuſpence till ſome other time.</p>
                  <p>But it fell out ſo well for him, that ſo ſoone as he was there arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the Emperour his brother left his life, leauing him ſole heire to the Empire. Whereupon, he had far greater deſire then before, to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the affection he had begunne: hoping, by reaſon of the great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity whereto he was now aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he ſhould the more eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe his long-deſired marriage. Which, the ſooner to effect, he ſent Ambaſſadours to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> with a new requeſt of his daughter in marriage: heereto were appointed <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> Prince of <hi>Calabria, Brondariel de Roce,</hi> the great Maiſter, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Tarente,</hi> and the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a gallant troupe of knights, Ladies and Gentlewomen, to bring home the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> as they hoped. But matters happened to another end, as heereafter more at large ſhall be related to you.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Mariners hauing ſet their ſayles, with full intent for <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;</hi> ſo ſoone as they had loſt ſight of the Iſles of <hi>Romania,</hi> the Sea exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſelfe in ſuch ſort, and grew to ſuch a dreadfull tempeſt, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all paines the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners could take, for beſt guiding and gouerning the Ship, it was ſo toſt with contrary windes and waues, as very many times they were in manifeſt peril of ſhipwrack. And being out of all further hope, ſafety not appearing ſo much as in a glimpſe of aſſurance: they atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely the mercy of God, and continued in this extreamity the ſpace of 8, dayes, without knowing where, or in what part they were. For the tempeſt of winde, haile and raine, was ſo thick and continuall, as it ſeemed that heauen and earth and the Sea would meete together. But at length, the Ship was throwen on Shoare about two houres before day, and with ſuch violence, as they feared it would be ſplit; for it was driuen out of the Sea on drye land.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, they ſuſtayned no harme at all, which gaue them better hope then formerly they had, ſo that when bright day appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they knew themſelues to bee in the deuils Iſland, which by reaſon of a ſtraunge Monſter there aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, was ſo diſpeopled, as no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature repayred thither. Then a new feare ſeazed on them, and now they deſpaired of their liues more then before, ſo that they were euen ready to throw them-ſelues into the deepe: when the knight of the greene Sword deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them, what might be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this terror?</p>
                  <p>Alas Sir, (quoth they,) where doe you imagine wee are landed? what gulfe, what ſhipwrack could haue beene worſe to vs then this? Now wee are in compaſſe of the Deuils power, who in the forme of a cruell Monſter, ruinates all this Country. How? ſaid the knight, I ſee nothing yet that ſhould thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze ye: therefore tell me I pray ye, what deuill or Monſter is it, that workes this great deſpaire in ye?</p>
                  <p>Then Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> (leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed then any of the reſt) ſpake for them al, ſaying. Vnderſtand Sir, that this Iſland, wheron our diſaſter hath brought vs, was not long ſince in the poſſeſſion of a Giant, the moſt bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Tyrant that liued in all the Iſles. he had to wife an honourable Lady, as wiſe, milde and vertuous, as hee was wicked and cruell: of whom he begot a daughter, named <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daginda,</hi> that was (in her time) one of the goodlieſt Ladies in the world: And although many great Lords, and men of high merite, would gladly haue enioyed her in marriage: yet notwithſtanding, the rigour of the Giant was ſo extreme, as he ſtill kept them off, becauſe by no meanes hee would haue her to marry. In regard where-of, this Mayden encreaſing in yeares, and thoſe deſires that would faine experiment, what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe it was to liue with a man,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7181:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knowing withall, that her father had ſet downe his reſolution, neuer to beſtow her as a wife on any man: preuailed ſo much by inſinuating blandiſhments, and inceſtuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, that ſhe drew him to affect her, and had his company car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. But that which was much worſe, ſhee machinated the death of her owne mother, that the more boldly, and without feare, ſhe might liue ſtill in this horrid inceſt, wherto the Giant gaue quick conſent. This Mayde that was, perceiuing her ſelfe to grow great with childe: one day, as her mother and ſhee walked together in an Orchard, paſſing by a deepe Well, ſhe thruſt her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo rudely, as ſhe brake her neck in the fall.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe the people began to murmure, the Giant told them, that he vnderſtood by three of his gods (one in the likeneſſe of a Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon, the other as a Lyon, and the third in the ſhape of a man) that of him and his daughter, ſhould bee borne a creature, ſo much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and feared through all the Countrie, that none of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſhould dare to attempt any harme againſt him. And vnder this colour, he openly married his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked daughter, who within no long time after, was deliuered of a Monſter, in ſuch manner as I ſhall ſhew vnto ye. It was ſo full of haire on the face, feete and hands, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be a Beare, all the reſt of the body was couered ouer with ſcailes, ſo hard and ſtrong, as no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ot from a Bow could pierce them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſide, they were ſo broad &amp; great, that they extended quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the backe, defending it like ſo many Shields, ſo that no inſtrument of yron could enter thorow them. From vnder them came forth arms, hands, legs &amp; feete, with nailes and clawes ſo piercing, like to them of a mighty ſtrong Lyon. His eyes ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med properly like two burning coales, or brands, ſo red and ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that in the night ſeaſon they ſeemed like two ſhining ſtarres. And, that which was much more, his teeth were ſo huge &amp; ſharp, that they would bite through &amp; breake the beſt made Armour of ſteele.</p>
                  <p>By all theſe meanes, he did ſo many harmes and miſchiefes, that he brought this Iſle to be diſinhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; eſpecially becauſe he could mount, leape and run ſo ſpeedily, as the very nimbleſt Hart in the world. And if at any time he grew angry or offended (as it happened very often) in fighting with Beares, Lyons and wilde Boares, he would ſend foorth ſuch a dreadfull ſmoake from his noſtrils, as plainly appeared to be a duskie flame of fire, ſo loathſomly ſtinking, as no liuing creature could eſcape infection therby, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed euery one to flye &amp; ſhunne him. When he yelled or howled, hemade ſuch a fearefull cry or noyſe, grating his teeth in ſo ſtrange manner, and clapping his wings ſo hideouſly; as, to the very boldeſt courage, nothing could be more dauntable. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Sea, commonly called him <hi>Endriagus;</hi> as being held and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by them, to be rather a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, then any beaſt produced by nature.</p>
                  <p>Much amazed was our knight of the greene Sword, to heare Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> make this ſtrange deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor being able to comprehend any poſſibility, that ſo horrid a thing could be engendred betweene man &amp; woman. Except the ponderous weight of a ſinne ſo monſtrous, had in ſuch ſort alienated naturall diſpoſition: that the ſoule fiend tooke the place of a reaſonable ſoule, and ſo cauſed this helliſh
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7181:271"/>
procreation. Whereupon hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, why he was ſuffred to liue ſo long, and whether (as yet) he breathed there or no? I will tell yee Sir, anſwered Maſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> all ſuch as haue attempted his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, haue fayled and finiſhed theirliues moſt cruelly, Further-more, you muſt know, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> vnder whoſe ſubiection this Iſland alwaies hath bin, hath ſent hither the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his power, but all hath proued to no purpoſe. I maruaile, (ſaid our knight) why they did not kill him ſo ſoone as he was borne?</p>
                  <p>Vnderſtand Sir, (replyed Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> that <hi>Brandaginda</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her ſelf to be great with child, the Giant her Father was not a litle proud thereof, as hoping to haue ſuch iſſue as his gods had promiſed him. And heereupon, he cauſed three or foure Nurſes to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſought for; conceiuing with himſelfe, that ſeeing the infant ſhould be ſo ſtrong; reaſon requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that his nouriſhing ſhould be anſwerable thereto. But the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers time of deliuering growing neere, ſhee began to feele the moſt bitter anguiſhes in the world. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Giant and ſhee tooke all in good part, perſwading themſelues that thoſe paines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded onely from vigour of the childe: who at the time appointed) came ſo dreadfully forth of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, as all the women then preſent were amazed thereat. Neuertheleſſe, ſtanding in feare of the Giant, they ſwadled it vp in rich clothes, and gaue it to one of the Nurſes to ſucke: at whoſe breſt it drew ſo ſtrongly, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intermiſſion, as, notwitſtanding all her loud cryes, he ſucked the very heart blood out of her body, ſo that ſhee fell downe dead on the floore. The like did the ſecond, &amp; the third, all of the Nurſes inſtantly dying, not only by the poyſon iſſuing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, but alſo by the violence he did vnto them. Theſe tydings being ſent to the Giant, in no little amazement, he went to his gods, and hauing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſacrifice according to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, he demaunded of them, why they had giuen him ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous linage? He that carried the reſemblance of a man, anſwered. It is neceſſary he ſhould be ſuch a one, that as my workes are ſtraunge and admirable, ſo ſhould his be, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to mine, eſpecially to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all Chriſtians: therefore hee hath ſome ſemblance of a man, to whom all things owe obedience. And I, (quoth the other) in fauour of thee, haue giuen him the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of a Lyon to reſemble mee therein. That which mooued me, ſaid the third, to arme him with wings, and ſharpe-piercing tallents or clawes, was in imitation of my ſelfe, that as I partake in a Griffons nature, ſo he ſhould bee Maſter &amp; controuler of all creatures hee can meet withall. And let this ſuffice thee, without further ſorow for the three womens death, that gaue him ſuck but hence forward let him bee nouriſhed with the milke of thy ſlocks and heardes, vntill it be the ſpace of a yeare; at which time, hee will be ſo well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as he ſhal reſemble vs al three. In the meane while, take heed (vpon perill of thy life) that thou, thy wife, or any other then ſhe that muſt tend him, doe ſee him; for elſe great harme will happen to thee.</p>
                  <p>For this cauſe, the Giant (willing to obey the command of his gods) prouided diligently for al that they had appointed him; and ſo this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiliſh Monſter (for a whole yeares limitation) was nouriſhed and kept in a very cloſe Chamber. Which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7181:272"/>
time being accompliſhed, and the mother vnderſtanding by her who had him in gouerning, that hee was growne great and ſtrong, beyond all naturall capacity, had ſuch an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire to ſee him, as ſhee cauſed the Giant to yeeld conſent. Entring both into the Chamber where hee was nouriſhed, and he ſeeing his mother; ſuddenly leapt about her ſhoulders, and caught ſuch hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her neck, that before his father could lend any help, he cruelly kilde her. Whereat the Giant grew ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, that he ran on him to kil him, &amp; in caſting a blow at him with all his might, the Sword rebounded backe vpon his owne leg, wounding it ſo deep, as in the extreme anguiſh he felt thereby, he fell downe to the ground, and there breathed his laſt. At the very ſame inſtant, the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, being named <hi>Endriagus,</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the doore of the Chamber to ſtand open, flew thence into the mountaines, leauing all them in the Caſtell infected to death with his poyſon. Afterward, he did ſo many harmes in euery place, that al the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were glad to forſake the Country, or elſe to dye the death. Thus you haue heard, how this Iſle hath remained deſart for the ſpace of forty yeres, and ſo long is it ſince this helliſh Monſter hath heere li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this manner.</p>
                  <p>By my faith, anſwered our knight, you haue told me wonders, wherein our Lord hath plainely declared, what long patience he hath vſed, in expecting amendment for the ſinnes of men; but finding them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate &amp; too hard-hearted, he hath continued this ſeuerity of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Neuertheleſſe, I am not to part away from this place, vntill I haue fought with this <hi>Endriagus:</hi> hoping aſſuredly, to reuenge the wrongs he hath done to ſo many, &amp; to replant this Iſle again with people, that may religiouſly ſerue God. And becauſe the day was well neere ſpent, he put off his purpoſe till the morning, his company being minded not to leaue the Ship, becauſe their feare ſtil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, beholding the ſea &amp; tempeſt nothing appeaſed, but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe more and more, by the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters houering ouer the Iſland, and eſpecially by the place where the Ship ancred. Night being ouerpaſt, &amp; the bright morning appearing, he called for his Armes, and afterward heard Maſſe deuoutly: then ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them of the Ship about him, he thus ſpake. Louing friends, I will go directly to the Caſtel to ſeek the Monſter: where (if it ſo pleaſe God) I may haue the victory ouer him. And becauſe it appeares to me, that in two or three dayes we ſhal hardly put to Sea againe. I intend, if I finde the Caſtel as yet habitable, to come again hither for ye, that you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in ſafe ſecurity, vntill the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be more calme. So mounting on horſeback, and taking none but <hi>Gandalin</hi> in his company, they aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp the Rock, where preſently they eſpied the Fortreſſe, and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thither to it, found neither man or beaſt liuing in it. Heereupon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had thorowly viſited it, and found it to bee ſtrong &amp; wel-defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, they returned to them in the ſhip, and cauſing them to bring vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals thither for three dayes, commending them all to God, he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Stand vpon your guard ſo well as you can, for I muſt goe to effect mine enterpriſe: thus aduiſing you, that if I haue good ſucceſſe, <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> ſhal winde his Horne to ye, &amp; giue you aſſurance thereby, that <hi>Endriagus</hi> is dead, and I liuing. But if the contrary happen to me, there ſhall be no need of any ſignall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7181:272"/>
to ye, becauſe you will know it ſoon enough. In the meane while, pray to GOD both for mee and your ſelues.</p>
                  <p>So ſetting on his way, hee left them ſad and mourning, for the ſmall hope they had of his returning. But their griefe could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that of <hi>Ardan</hi> the Dwarfe, who being compelled to leaue his knight, by a ſeueare command im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on him, made ſuch ruefull moane, as euery man tooke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on him. Alas, (quoth <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,)</hi> am not I the moſt miſerable wretch in the world, that when I haue moſt occaſion to follow my Maſter, neuer hauing forſaken him before in all my life, he ſhould now forbid and prohibite mee, as if I were a meere ſtranger to him? Then Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> called them all to prayer, while our knight and <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> were thwarting the Iſle among brakes and buſhes, and finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But <hi>Gandalin</hi> was ſo pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, as his Maiſter, perceiuing him to weepe, ſaid vnto him. Ah <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> it appeareth by thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that being with me, thou art afraid to dye: I pray thee, kinde Squire, returne backe to the reſt, &amp; there expect what ſhall become of me. If theſe teares proceede from any doubt in thee, that I cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt the Monſter, aſſure thy ſelfe, that the hope I haue in the mercy of God, &amp; the remembrance of my Lady, who now (euen at this very inſtant) preſents her ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes, doth arme me with ſuch ſtrength, as I am able to fight with the deuill himſelfe, if I could finde him. For my minde perſwades me, that I ſee her in the daunger of <hi>Endriagus,</hi> and that I am come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to defend her: Ah <hi>Gandalin,</hi> canſt thou imagine, that I would ſuffer her to bee offended or outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, conſidering, that on her, my life &amp; beſt happines doth only depend?</p>
                  <p>So pauſing awhile, he then began againe thus. Doeſt not thou know (my louing Squire) that ſhee hath cauſed all the teares which haue bin ſhed by mee, and greater perils al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſt, then this can be? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, <hi>Gandalin,</hi> I feele my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces newly redoubled, and my hopes a thouſand times more encreaſed, in but thinking of her, as I haue told thee. Then ſet aſide all feare, and cry and call as loude as thou canſt, that <hi>Endriagus</hi> may heare thee, and come hither to vs quickly, if hee be in thoſe parts. And one thing I doe moſt earneſtly entreate thee, to wit, that if I dye in this attempt, thou wouldſt compaſſe ſome meanes, to carry my heart to my Lady, which is intirely hers, and tell her I ſent it, that we appearing before God, hee may iudge, that I preſent her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what is her owne as well as mine.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Gandalin</hi> heard theſe words, his heart was ſhut vp in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as hee was ready to fall in a ſwou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e: deſirous rather of his own death, then (with paine) to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh what his Maſter had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him. And as they inſiſted vpon theſe tearmes, they ſaw <hi>Endriagus</hi> come forth of a hollow Rocke, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting from his eyes &amp; throte flames &amp; ſmoke ſo noyſome, as all the ayre thereabout was infected therewith. So ſoon as he had eſpied them, hee came towardes them, hiſſing &amp; ſno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in moſt admirable maner: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it could not daunt our knight a iote, but he boldly marched to meete him, while <hi>Gandalin</hi> ran to hide himſelfe, fully perſwaded, that his Maiſter could neuer ſcape from ſuch a furious beaſt. Our knight perceiuing that hee could by no means cauſe his horſe to come nere

him; quickly diſmounted on foot, and taking his Launce in both his hands, aymed therewith ſo coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly at <hi>Endriagus,</hi> that (by great good fortune) he gaue him a thruſt in the left eye, and put it quite out. Then <hi>Endriagus</hi> gaue a horrible dreadfull crye, and ariſing vp on his hindmoſt pawes, caught hold on the Launce ſo ſtrongly, as, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to breake it between his teeth, he tooke it ſo farre into his mouth, that our knight eſpying ſo apt an aduantage, by aduancing it forward as occaſion ſerued, hee wounded him both in the tongue and throat, and left a part or tronchion thereof ſticking faſt betweene his teeth. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, hee gaue a great leape, purpoſing thereby to ſurprize the knight: but hee auoyded it by ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping aſide, and drawing forth his Sword, gaue him a manfull ſtroke therewith on the right ſhoulder, which proued to no purpoſe; for he might as well ſtrike on a rocke or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuile. <hi>Endriagus</hi> got hold of the Sword with his teeth; but by reaſon of the ſharpe ſteele, and part of the Launce troubling his throate, hee could not keepe it as hee intended. And that which hindred him moſt of all, was his great effuſion of blood, which ranne in ſuch aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding meaſure downe his throate, as he was ſcarcely able to draw any breath.</p>
                  <p>At length, he rent our knights Shield from about his neck ſo rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as his hands were his beſt helpes, to keepe him from the ground; and as he ſtroue to breake it in pieces, our Knight hauing recouered him-ſelfe, taking his Sword faſt in both his hands, ſmote on the top of his head but it entred no more then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mount of Adamant.</p>
                  <p>Then he perſwaded himſelf, that except Heauen gaue him aſſiſtance, he meerely laboured in vaine: for he ſaw no place elſe where to hurt him, but in the other eye, which with great care) he kept and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Heereupon our knight made all his aime at that ſide, and proued ſo happy in his blow, that lighting on his ſnout, it entred into one of his noſtrils, (which were great and wide ſtaring) ſo farre, that it pierced the braine extreamely. This made <hi>Endriagus</hi> ſo mad, that hee got our knight faſt about the body, and with his ſharpe-pointed clawes, tore his coate of maile, yea, and entred through the fleſh to the bone: when queſtionleſſe he had quite kild him, but that his owne blood ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifled his ſtomacke, that, letting looſe his hold, he fell downe back-ward. And as he rendred his ſpirit, the deuill came out of his body, cauſing ſuch a clap of thunder, as all the whole Iſland ſhooke with the ſound thereof.</p>
                  <p>This noyſe being heard by them in the Caſtell, they perſwaded themſelues thereby, that their knight was then at the Combate: and albeit they were in a ſafe and well-defenced Fort, yet the beſt and boldeſt man of them all, was ouercome with extraordinary feare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Endriagus</hi> being thus vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our knight roſe very faintly; and purpoſing to goe finde <hi>Gandalin,</hi> (who was then comming towards him) hee fell downe againe in a ſwoune, by a little perling brooke, that deſcended from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Gandalin</hi> (imagining his Maiſter to bee dead) fell into moſt dolefull lamentations: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neere him, he beheld him to breath: wherupon he vnarmed him. Then recouering his ſpirits, called to <hi>Gandalin,</hi> ſaying. My deare Friend
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7181:273"/>
                     <hi>Gandalin,</hi> now thou ſhalt ſee the ending of my dayes; let me entreate thee, by the kinde nouriſhing which I receiued from thy father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that as thou haſt been loyall to me in my life, thou wilt continue ſo in death, and ſo ſoone as my vitall ſpirits haue forſaken me, to take out my heart, and beare it to my deareſt Miſtreſſe. Tell her <hi>Gandalin,</hi> that as it veelded it ſelfe hers the ſame day I firſt ſaw her, and euer ſince hath continued better and better in her ſeruice, while it was lockt vp in this breſt, or ſad habitation, neuer wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in any obedience to her: that ſhee would be pleaſed ſo to receiue it now, in remembrance of him that kept it for her; and in ſo doing, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that my ſoule ſhall haue the happier reſt in another world.</p>
                  <p>As hee meant to ſpeake more, words fayled him, and againe hee ſwonded. Then <hi>Gandalin</hi> (without ſtaying to anſwere him) mounted on the top of the Rocke, and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the horne which he caryed (to giue ſignall of the death of <hi>Endria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus)</hi> ſo loude, that <hi>Ardan</hi> the dwraff, who was then on the higheſt of one of the Caſtle Towers, eaſily heard it. Wherevpon hee ranne downe preſently, to acquaint Maiſter <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabet</hi> therwith; deſiring him to make haſte to his Maiſter, who (perhaps) ſtood in great neede of his helpe. Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> hauing all things in a readineſſe, mounted on horſe-backe, directing his courſe as faſt as hee could ride, towards the place where hee ſtill heard the ſound of the Horne. Not long had he iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed, but he eſpyed <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who comming to meete him, cryed out afarre off: Alas Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driagus</hi> is dead: but if you prouide not the ſooner for my Lord, hee is gon likewiſe. How man quoth he? Alas, ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> he hath already loſt ſo much blood, as hee is not a ble to ſpeake a word.</p>
                  <p>Very ſadde and ſorrowfull was Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> at theſe newes, and ran quickly to the place where the Knight lay, ſo weake and ouer ſpent as hee had no motion of his pulſe: yet his eyes were wide open, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to comfort him, Maiſter <hi>Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi> ſayd. How Sir Kinght? will you declare ſuch debilitie of courage, hauing brought to end ſo great and glorious an interpriſe? doe yee not know, that I am heare to make you ſound and well againe, ſo ſoone as pleaſeth God. When the Knight heard him, hee ſtroue to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, but could not. Then they layd him ſoftly vpon a cloake, and hauing wholly vnarmed him, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> viewed his wounds; which he found to be ſo many, and dangerous, as hee ſtood in great doubt of his recouery? Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, hee reſolued to performe ſo much as poſſibly he could, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly applyed ſo ſoueraigne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents: as both ſtanched his blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and ſo aſſawaged all vigour of paine, that his ſpeech came to him againe, when with a very feeble and low voyce, he thus ſpake.</p>
                  <p>Oh, my Lord God, who to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme mee tooke humaine fleſh, in the bleſſed Virgins wombe, and afterward didſt ſuffer a moſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous and painefull Paſſion: take pitie on my ſoule, for I well knowe, that my bodie is no better then earth. Truely Sir, anſwered Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> you haue good reaſon to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend yourſelf to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that (by his aſſiſtance) you ſhall receiue the ſpeedier helpe. As he ended theſe words, there arriued diuers of the Marriners, who taking him vp gently in their armes: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed him thence to the Caſtle; where laying him in his bed, he was
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7181:274"/>
ſo voyd of allhis ſences, as hee felt not any thing was done to him. Thus he continued all night, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning continually, as one that endured much, yet without vttering any one worde, till about breake of day he fell aſleepe.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all to auoyd the chamber, to preuent any noiſe for offending him, and ſate downe cloſe by him, till hee heard him wake, and cry: <hi>Gandalin, Gandalin,</hi> ſhield thy ſelfe from this deuill, ſo cruell and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. In good faith, Sir, replyed Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet;</hi> if you had been as ſafely ſhielded as hee, your health were the ſurer, and your recouerie the leſſer.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words, our Knight ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his eyes, and knowing Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> ſaid vnto him; Oh, Maiſter, where are we? Where? quoth hee, in ſuch a place, where you ſhall doe well enough, by the grace of God. And perceiuing his Feauer to haue left him, hee brought him food to eate, &amp; was ſo diligent in care ouer him, that (before night) hee reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his memorie perfectly, and beganne to know and ſpeake to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one.</p>
                  <p>Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> ſeeing all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be well quallified; both hee, and all the reſt gaue thanks to God for it, and continued ſtill ſo reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue of him, as hee grewe hourely better and better: notwithſtanding for twentie dayes hee kept his bed, without any habilitie of riſing. At length, Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> perceiuing that (without any great perill to the his perſon) hee might endure the Sea, eſpecially his Feauers begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to forſake him: one day as they ſate deuiſing together, he ſayd, My Lord, thankes be to God, you are ſoundly recouered, and (in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) when beſt ſhall pleaſe you, you may goe aboard your ſhippe: whereto (I ſo much the rather coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell you) becauſe our victuals growe ſo ſhort, that if wee diſlodge not hence the ſooner, we ſhall be quite emptied. My louing friend, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our Knight, I may iuſtly ſay, that next vnto God, you are the man to whom I am moſt beholding, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mee from the great daunger wherein I was. And let mee aſſure yee, that ſo long as my ſoule liueth as a gueſt in this bodie, you haue a Knight ready to bee employed for you, without reſeruation of hazard or perill whatſoeuer: for you haue done ſo much for me, (I being none other then a ſilly knight, deſtitute of all meanes, my beſt meanes conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in a poore, broken and batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red armour:) that while I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a day of life, you may worthily acknowledge it to be yours.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, anſwered Maiſter <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabet,</hi> you ſay what pleaſeth you of your ſelfe, but howſoeuer, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my ſelfe the happieſt of all other profeſſing my Art; that vnder Gods aſſiſtaunce, I haue ſaued the life of the beſt Knight that euer backt a Courſer: which I dare pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely auouch; you hauing attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and finiſhed matters incredible to common iudgements. So that I am well aſſured, from this time fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, many that haue endured ſhames and iniuries, muſt expect helpe by our means, whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they ſhall remaine miſerably without any hope. Therefore Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne to be the poore occaſion of ſo great a bleſſing; doe accompt my trauell more liberally recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced, then if I had all the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy treaſures of the world together.</p>
                  <p>Worthy Friend, quoth our Knight, leaue theſe commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſome other, on whom (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily) they may be more deſeruedly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7181:274"/>
beſtowed; and councell me I deſire ye, in the buſines I haue vndertaken, as I ſhall make it further knowen to ye: you are not ignorant, that in no meane griefe and heauineſſe, we parted from the Iſle of <hi>Romania,</hi> and by importunity of the Mariners on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: wee ſet ſayle for further paſſage, as purpoſely bound for <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> but that windes and tempeſts haue quite altered our courſe. All which notwithſtanding, for any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill I finde in my ſelfe, my minde va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not a iote from my firſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: ſo that if you can alleage no contradiction, I am more ready then euer, to aduenture the Sea for <hi>Greece,</hi> where I would gladly ſee the Emperour, and ſome ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Countrie, which are no common matters to our knights of <hi>Gaule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, if you be as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, let vs away for that part: our returne to <hi>Graſinda</hi> alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, at all times, when you pleaſe, and according to promiſe at our parting.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>How the Knight of the greene Sword made knowen to the Emperour of Conſtantinople, (to whom the Iſland appertained, where he ſlew the Andriagus) the great fortune and victory he there obtained: And of matters happening to him afterward.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen Maiſter <hi>Eloſabet</hi> heard the minde of our knight of the greene Sword, which euermore was bent towardes <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he ſaid. Truſt me my Lord, I thinke it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient then, that you ſhould firſt write a Letter, to giue aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that by your meanes; but more eſpecially, the grace of our Lord aſſiſting, you haue deliuered this Country from the deuils ſlaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſubiection.</p>
                  <p>Deare Friend (quoth the knight) I vnderſtand, that you haue beene knowen to him a long time, but me he hath neuer ſeene: therefore doe you write ſuch a Letter, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as your ſelfe ſhall beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe it. Whereto Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> willingly conſented, and inſtantly wrote at large to the Emperour, all the aduentures happening to our knight, ſince they departed from <hi>Graſinda:</hi> eſpecially (how miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly) he had fought with, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Endriagus,</hi> a Monſter more diabolicall then humane. Deſiring him, in the knights name, to ſend people to replant, ſo deſart a place, and to let it be called thence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Saint <hi>Mary</hi> Iſland.</p>
                  <p>So giuing the Letter to a Squire his kinſeman, hee commaunded him to goe to the Emperour, and to returne againe ſo ſoone as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hee could with prouiſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victuall their Ship.</p>
                  <p>Being imbarked, the winde ſate ſo proſperouſly for him, that on the third day following, he arriued at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Emperour then being: after ſuch reuerence done as beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemed, hee preſented him the Letter from Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Sir, Maſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> your moſt hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affectionate ſeruant, hath
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7181:275"/>
ſent you this Letter, whereby (I hope) you will receiue no meane contentment. Then the Emperour tooke and read it, being mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, to vnderſtand that <hi>Endria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> was vanquiſhed, which cauſed him to ſpeake thus out aloud <hi>Before GOD, here are very ſtrange tydings.</hi> In the preſence then (among many others) were two Princes his moſt familiars, the one named <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> ſonne to the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Garaſtra,</hi> his ſiſter; a Knight eſteemed among the beſt, and <hi>Count Salender,</hi> Brother to the faire <hi>Graſinda:</hi> taking them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, hee ſhewed them the Letter from Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After much admiration among them all, the Emperour ſayd. The Knight of the Greene Sword, of whom ſo many high prayſes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, hath ſlaine the monſter <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driagus</hi> in ſingle fight: and becauſe this meſſengers owne eyes are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes thereof, I pray you let him make relation of what he knoweth. Vpon my faith, anſwered <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> verily, it is a matter hardly to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, that a mortall man ſhould combate a Deuill with a Sworde: I thinke it was neuer read nor heard of before. Wherefore if it be ſo, as Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> hath written to ye, &amp; that ſuch a man hath ſo much honoured yee, by comming into your Countrey, you ought to giue him the beſt entertainment can bee deuiſed. Let me tell ye, quoth the Emperour, what I haue determined. I thinke it not much amiſſe, that you, and <hi>Count Salender</hi> ſhould firſt goe to him, euen to the Iſland where (as yet) hee remaineth ſickly, and conduct him in the beſt maner you can imagine: taking along with you ſuch victuals and other neceſſaries, as is conuenient for ſuch a purpoſe. But aboue all the reſt, forget not to take ſome excellent Painter with you, to draw in naturall figure that horrible beaſt: becauſe there is no poſſibilitie of bringing him hither, yet we would haue his proportion ſo neere to the life as may be. For it is my purpoſe, where he hath been conquered, to erect a high Pillar of braſſe; on the top whereof ſhall be aduanced the Knights Figure that fought with him, and the Monſters alſo, in liuely ſhape: with ſo ample a diſcription in golden Charracters engrauen thereon: that all ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding times may know this famous Action. In which reſpect, I pray ye to vſe your ſpeedieſt diligence, for I ſhall neuer reſt in quiet, vntill herein I am fully ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>The two Princes, knowing the Emperours will, tooke ſo good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for their ſhipping, as very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the next morning they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked: when hoyſing Saile, with apt and proſperous windes, in few dayes they landed in the Iſle, Saint <hi>Marie:</hi> ſo newly called, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Knight of the Greene Sword. Hee being aduertiſed of their arriuall, went to meete them; doing them all the honour that the time and place could permit: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>Count Salender,</hi> knowing him to be brother to the beautifull <hi>Graſinda.</hi> And although he looked ſomewhat wanne and meagre, by reaſon of his long ſicknes: yet our <hi>Grecians</hi> reputed him to be one of the moſt compleat Cheualiers, that euer they had ſeene. Wherevpon, after ceremonious welcoms ended on all ſides, <hi>Gaſtilles</hi> taking him by the hand ſayd: Sir Knight, Mine Vncle, the Emperour, hath ſent vs expreſly to you, to thanke you (in his behalfe) for the great good you haue done to this whole Countrey, which hath ſo long time layen waſt and ruined. Moreouer, for the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire hee hath to ſee you; hee
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7181:275"/>
entreateth you by vs, to paſſe (with what conuenient ſpeede you may) towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where hee will welcome you according to your due merit.</p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> anſwered our Knight, I haue ſo often heard of the Emperours goodneſſe and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that although I neuer ſaw him: yet am I earneſtly deſirous to doe him any ſeruice: and to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as hee ſhall pleaſe to command me. I muſt further entreate you, ſaid <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> to let vs ſee the Monſter <hi>Endriagus,</hi> that his liuely portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be taken by an expert pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which for the ſame purpoſe, is ſent hither with vs. Here is Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> ſaid our Knight, and <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> my truſty Squire alſo, who was preſent whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I fought with the beaſt; they can eaſily conduct ye where he lieth. But I feare his body is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious, as you will hardly bee able to come neere it. Let vs make triall of that, replyed <hi>Count Salender,</hi> to giue the better report to others, how, and in what manner we found him. Our Knight perceiuing their vnalterable deſire, praied Maiſter <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſabet</hi> to guide them to the place where hee was aſſailed, and to let them know the truth of all.</p>
                  <p>So they mounted on horſe-backe, for it was ſomewhat farre from the Gyants Caſtle, and (by the way) <hi>Gandalin</hi> reported to them, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſights beginning, the doubt hee had of it, and little hope or expectation of his Maiſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. And in this time of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they were come to the place, where <hi>Endriagus</hi> lay ſo ſtinking; as if Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> had not formerly giuen them excellent preſeruatiues, they had beene in great danger of their health. But by this meanes they might come the neerer to him; while the Painter drewe his Figure ſo artificially, as nothing was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but life it ſelfe. But the more they obſerued him, the more they found the aduenture to be: ſo that no iuſt comprehenſion could haue been made of the ſubſtance, except their eyes were reall witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Afterward, they returned back to the caſtle again, and ſoiourned there with our knight three dayes, viſiting the Iſle in euery part: and the day following, they tooke ſhipping thence, with ſo good a gale of wind, that they took landing in the porte of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> not long after.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour hauing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence thereof, ſent Chariots and horſes, for the Knights more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conuoye to his Court: and himſelfe, accompanied with a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Traine of Princes, and great Lords, rode in perſon to meete him. Our Knight offred to kiſſe his hand; but the Emperour embraced him, telling him, that hee was heartily welcome, as he that iuſtly deſerued by his valour, to hold ranke among the greateſt Lords of the world. For if I (quoth he) and ſuch as reſemble me, are conſtituted in the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and authoritie of Emperours of Kings: it comes to vs by the meanes of our Predeceſſors, whe got and conſerued ſuch fortune for vs: but you hauing performed ſuch rare deeds of Chiualrie, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthy of an Empire, but euen of the Monarchie of the whole world, and that meerly by merit.</p>
                  <p>You haue power, mighty Prince, anſwered our Knight, to paint me in what coulours you pleaſe: not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, all that I am or can bee, is no more then your humble vaſſaile and ſeruant; &amp; would it pleaſed God to afford ſuch means, as might expreſſe my earneſt loue to you, in any ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeruice. So ceaſing, the Emperour walked along with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7181:276"/>
him to a chamber which he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be prepared for his lodging: being ſo faire &amp; ſumptuouſly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, as neuer had the like bin ſeen: except that belonging to <hi>Apolidon,</hi> in the <hi>Firme Iſland.</hi> The Emperour with-drawing, left him accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> and <hi>Count Salen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> &amp; went to the Empreſſe giuing her to vnderſtand; that the Knight of the Greene ſword (ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned through the world) was come to Court: To whom he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed all the kinde entertainment could be deuiſed.</p>
                  <p>And therefore Madame (quoth he) be not ſparing towardes him in the very beſt graces may be affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: commanding your Ladyes ſo to decke and adorne themſelues, that it may mooue his deſire to continue in our Court. For beſide his repute and eſtimation, of being the very beſt Knight in the world, and bringing vnder awe and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that goodly Iſland, ſo long time diſpeopled: I am vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded, that hee can bee none other, then ſome great Lord diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for his better veiwe of ſtrange Princes eſtates; therefore let mee commend him to your very choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt reſpect. My Lord (quoth ſhe) ſeeing it is your pleaſure; I will not fayle in effectuall performing what you haue commanded me.</p>
                  <p>By this time it waxed and grew ſomewhat late, and our Knight fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe not halfe currant, after his ſayling on the Sea: departed not out of his chamber till the next morning, when hauing bin with the Emperour at Maſſe, he brought him afterward to ſee the Ladyes, all of them giuing him moſt gracious welcome, Eſpecially the Empreſſe. But hee fell on his knee before her, to kiſſe her hand, and as ſhee tooke him vp, hee ſaid: Madame, among all the bleſſings of heauen beſtowed vpon mee, I eſteeme this one of the chiefeſt, to haue the meanes of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the magnificence of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Court (famous in all places of the world) and that with ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable lookes and entertainment, as I take no little care, how, or which way my power can euer ſtretch it ſelfe, to acknowledge this fauour by any dutious ſeruice. And I would I could tell you in good <hi>Greeke Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> how much I am, and deſire to be, wholly yours, but the ſlencer power I haue in this countrey, may excuſe my ill ſpeaking, and referre to full effect any thing wherein you pleaſe to command mee, and that ſhall beſt witneſſe my good will. Knight of the <hi>Greene Sword,</hi> ſaid she, the Emperour hath long time deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue your company, &amp; wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with al his heart, that your mind were anſwerable to his, for your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance ſtill heere with him.</p>
                  <p>So falling out of one diſcourſe into another, the Empreſſe beeing wise, and curious in vnderſtanding all Nouelties, eſpecially the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and faſhions of ſtrange remote Countries, enquired many matters of him; whereunto he knew how to anſwere, with ſo good a grace and diſcretion: that ſhe ſayd within her ſelfe, it is impoſſible, but hee muſt be of as great proweſſe as prudence. All this while the Emperour enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Queene <hi>Menor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In good faith, anſwered the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe, mother to <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> we are all then highly beholding to him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is ſo ready to vſe his Sword, and ſtand as defence for all ſuch as are in need: no doubt, but Heauen will be his helpe, in defending him from all harme, and encreaſing his great renowne.</p>
                  <p>Then came <hi>Leonorina,</hi> the onely daughter to the Emperor, with the two daughters to <hi>Barandel,</hi> King of <hi>Hungarie</hi>

                     </gap> who was ſo rich in beauty, and all choyce perfections, that ſhe ſeemed a rare pearle among the very faireſt Princeſſes of the world.

Hauing done a gracious reuerence to the Emperour, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to her Mother, ſhee ſate down at her feet. Then our Knight looking on her, remembred when <hi>Oriana</hi> was left by King <hi>Liſuart</hi> in SCOTLAND, being then about her age, at which time, Loue depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him of his liberty, and gaue him wholly as her ſeruant.

                  <p>With the concluſion of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate imparlance, he breathed forth a loud-ſpeaking ſigh; which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour perceiuing, became full of maruaile, thinking ſome ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident had befalne him. But inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they noted a chearefull reuiuing of his ſpirits, and his lookes to bee as freſh and faire as before: yet as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of his ſoules ſudden rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this kinde, to lay his paſſions ſo open to euery eye, the new tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in his countenance gaue eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent teſtimony.

Truſt me Sir (quoth he) I am not able to iudge in this caſe, but ratherſtand as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, to ſee, that ſuch a man as he is, ſhould declare ſo little diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſuch an aſſembly. Aſſure your ſelfe (replyed the Emperour,) this paſſion proceeded from ſome intimat affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to her that hath the higheſt command ouer him. It may be ſo, anſwered <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> but to clear all doubt, let M. <hi>Eliſabet</hi> be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this caſe. Then was he called, &amp; the Emperor ſaid to him. <hi>Eliſabet</hi> my long-loued friend, I am deſirous to know one thing of you, which I charge ye (by the faith you beare to God) to reſolue mee in if you can. And I ſweare to you vpon my ſoule, that by mee it ſhall neuer bee diſcouered. Sir, anſwered
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7181:277"/>
Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> you may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelfe, that I will not lye to a perſonage of your greatneſſe, but will tell you freely any thing I know. Can you (quoth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) yeeld a reaſon, why our new-come knight both ſighed and wept ſo lately: I deſire you not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it from me; for if hee ſtand in need of any thing whatſoeuer, aſſure your ſelfe, hee ſhall be ſupplied in ſuch good ſort, as he ſhall haue iuſt cauſe to ſhake off all melancholy. Sir (replyed <hi>Eliſabet)</hi> heerein I can ſay nothing to you; for he is ſuch a man, the very cloſeſt in ſuch maters, as he will not haue manifeſted, as I neuer ſaw the like. No man can better diſſemble his priuate fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, &amp; yet I haue often ſeene him in ſuch extremities, that if a man might gather iudgment by ſighing, I haue imagined, that his heart muſt needs ſplit in ſunder, yet neuer was it poſſible for me to know the cauſe. But thus much I verily conceiue, that it muſt needs be the controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power of loue, which torments him in ſuch tyrannicall maner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (perhaps) far off from her who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he affecteth. I iumpe with you in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion (ſaid the Emperour) and I could well wiſh, that his loue were to ſome Lady of this country; for I would be ſo liberall in bountie to him, as there is neither King, Prince or Lord ſo potent, but might repute himſelfe happy, to match his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in marriage with him, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might be the more certaine of his company. And if you Maiſter <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſabet,</hi> (my hearts true friend) can worke this mater out of him by your wit, reſt thus reſolued, that you ſhall well vnderſtand my acceptation of the ſeruice, which you may doe in this kinde; and therefore, let me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to purſue it. Sir (quoth he) you ſhall perceiue that I wil do my vttermoſt heerein. So the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror riſing, went to the Empreſſe, &amp; taking her aſide, ſaid. Madame, you haue lately ſeen (as wel as my ſelfe) what ſadnes our knight of the greene Sword ſuddenly fell into, &amp; we cannot gatherwhat ſhould moue him thereto: therfore I entreat you, to deuiſe ſome meanes, wherby we may know it: &amp; likewiſe, if hee will conſent to ſtay here ſtill with me, I wil not be ſparing to him in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund whatſoeuer. My Lord, ſaid ſhe, it were beſt (in my iudgement) that to morrow we ſhould attempt this enterpriſe: for I will take him at ſuch apt oportunitie, as he ſhal haue work enough to deny me. In the meane while, I will allow ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fauours towards him, as both you and I will preuaile in that wee would haue.</p>
                  <p>So they ſpent out the whole day, entertaining the knight, beyond all compas: and on the morrow, after Dinner, the Emperour cauſed the Ladies to meet there againe, where, at the firſt encounter, hee was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Empreſſe, who, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to gaine her intent, ſmyling, &amp; as it were by way of deuiſing, ſaid. Sir Knight, ſince you came into this Court, I wel remember, that a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie melancholy fitte ſeazed on you ſuddenly, and it is no longer ſince then yeſterday: let me entreate ye (fair Sir) to tel me whence it ſhould proceede; for if it were occaſioned by any iniurie, either done heere, or any-where elſe within the Emperors commaund, bee well aſſured, that you ſhall bee righted. And if it might ſtand with your good liking, to abide heere with my Lord the Emperor, no knight in all his houſe can find better welcome. &amp; I would perſwade you thereto, if I might. Madam, (quoth he) if I had ſo much power as to commaund my ſelfe, I
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7181:277"/>
ſhould thinke it a happines for me, to haue ſo gracious an offer: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compelde to obey mine owne hearts affections, (which no way may permit it) I humbly entreate your Maieſty to hold me excuſed.</p>
                  <p>By this the Empreſſe well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that ſhe could neuer compas her intention; wherfore ſhe gaue a ſigne to the Emperor, that he ſhould come to them: which being done, ſhe began again thus. My Lord, I hope you will make good what I haue promiſed to this Knight: my requeſt to him, is, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine here in your Court, vnder this aſſurance, that hee ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected aboue any knight you haue, and yet no more then his owne due merite. Beleeue me Madame anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Emperor, if hee graunt me this one fauour, I am as ready to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him another: for, hee cannot aske me any thing that I will deny him. Sir, (replyed our knight,) you haue already done me ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that I thinke my whole time cannot extend it ſelfe, to performe any ſuch ſeruice, as the very leaſt of your liberall fauours doe deſeruedly challenge. Neuertheleſſe, I haue bin ſo long a while out of mine owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, by being ſubiected to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of one only: as I neither can, nor willingly would offend there, to pleaſe any-where elſe. For I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly aſſured, that in doing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, death wold not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſuffer me to be your ſeruant, nor to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue that duty, where I ſtand bound to pay it.</p>
                  <p>This anſwere was deliuered with ſuch vehemencie of paſſion, as teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſufficiently to the Emperour, that Loue was ſoueraigne Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his affections: therfore he wold no further iwportune him, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into ſome other diſcourſe. While thus they held on confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the faire Princeſſe <hi>Leonorina</hi> came in, carying two moſt rich Crowns, the one vpon her head, and the other between her hands; &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Knight of the Greene Sword, ſpake thus. Sir knight, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet begd any gift, but of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror my Father: notwithſtanding, I now preſume vpon ſuch boldnes, as to requeſt one of you, if you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to grant it me. How Madame? (quoth he) can any Gentleman bee found ſo hard-hearted, that dare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſo faire a Lady, in any motion ſhe ſhall make vnto him? As for my ſelfe, I promiſe to obey you, in any matter you pleaſe to command me.</p>
                  <p>The yong Princeſſe thanked him moſt affectionatly, and taking the Crown fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off her head, ſaid to him: I pray you Sir, ſeeing you promiſe to doe ſo much for me, to preſent this Crown to the very faireſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman you know, &amp; ſaluting her on my behalfe, to entreate her to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me ſo kind fauor, as to acquaint me with ſome tydings from her, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by writing, or word of mouth. The Knight took the Crowne, &amp; as he was about to anſwer, ſhe preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, continuing on her ſpeech in this manner. And this other Crowne, (not a iote leſſe richer then the firſt) ſhalbe for the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lady that you know, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if you be ſo pleaſed, do from me the like meſſage. Yet my lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging is ſuch, as I pray you tell me preſently, what they are, to whom you mean to giue them. Madame (quoth he) by the faith I beare to God, your own ſelfe muſt haue the firſt, and none other; for you are the very faireſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I know. As he thus ſpake, he placed the Crown again vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her head, &amp; (looking about him, ſaid: If there be any knight that dare main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the contrary, I am ready to combate him.</p>
                  <p>Great pleaſure tooke the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7181:278"/>
and the whole company, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Leonorina</hi> vſe ſo gallant a grace to the Knight: neuertheleſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee was the maine obiect of euery eye, ſhe began to bluſh, which made her appeare much more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull. Then the Empreſſe tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeake, ſaying: You ſpeake your pleaſure Sir, of this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: but I had rather haue thoſe Knights to doe me ſeruice, whom you haue conquered in Armes, then thoſe that ſhe hath won by her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But he returned her no anſwere, becauſe <hi>Leonorina</hi> preſented her ſelf again, ſaying: I confeſſe Sir, that you haue done much more for me, then I know how to deſerue: and yet this cannot with-hold me, from coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you (by the thing you moſt dearely affect, aboue all other in the world) to tell me, why you wept ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and what the Ladie is, to whom your heart is moſt engadged in obedience.</p>
                  <p>When our Knight ſaw ſo ſeuere an iniunction impoſed vpon him, to diſcloſe that which he moſt coueted to conceale, he ſtood in doubt, that the Infanta was enforced to do this by the Emperor, or elſe ſome other, that would know more then he was willing they ſhould. Whereupon, his colour changed in ſuch ſort, as euery one did plainly perceiue it: &amp; taking a long pauſe before he ſpake, at laſt he thus proceeded. Madame, I moſt humbly beſeech you, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome other ſeruice of me, &amp; to quit me of this requeſt. You know Sir (quoth ſhe) what you haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, &amp; I as wel know likewiſe, that if you breake not your word, you muſt tell me what I deſire to know. Why then Madame (ſaid he) I will doe it, ſeeing you enforce me to it. When I beheld you firſt, faire Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, I called to mind, that about the time &amp; age wherin you are; Fortune preſented mee with gracious enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, by louing a Lady wholly like to you. So that my heart then being far diſtant from his true felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, gaue teſtimony (by mine eyes) of his piercing paſſions, ſomewhat to allay the extremity of his torments, whereof it appeares you tooke too much notice.</p>
                  <p>Now, in regard of the aduantage you tooke of my word, being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know what ſhe is, to whom (at this inſtant) I ſtand moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: if you would pleaſe to forbeare ſuch an vnneceſſary motion, I ſhould eſteem your prudence more intire then I doe, inplaying thus on the poore diſcretion of a ſilly errant Knight, to diſcloſe more then hee would, and what he moſt deſires to keepe concealed. Neuertheles, ſince I muſt needs paſſe on further in this affliction, I ſweare to you Madame, by my faith, that it is ſhee to whom you haue ſent this other Crowne, who is (as I thinke) the very faireſt Lady that euer was, or euer ſhall be among the moſt perfect. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelfe, faire Princeſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forcing me any further. Vpon my word, replyed the Emperor, ſhe ſhall not, and ſo far our knowledge is enlarged by your relation, that we are euen as wiſe now, as when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. And yet (anſwered our Knight) I haue ſaid more now, then euer I did before: whereto I was more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, becauſe Madame <hi>Leonorina</hi> ſhould well perceiue, how ready I am to doe any ſeruice for her. You may wel Sir, quoth the Emperor, be allowed to keepe ſecrets, when your greatſt reuealings are mere ridls to vs: &amp; therfore ſeeing ſhee hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you, reaſon requires that ſhee make amends. Pardon me my Lord, ſaid our knight, in your better opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for if ſhe haue offended, let her be rankt among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that can induce
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7181:278"/>
and perſwade ſuch demaunds to a poore knight errant, who (as yet) is ſo ſlenderly acquainted with the Greeke tongue, that, when he offers to ſpeake, he may well be laught at, for his fooliſh babbling. Indeed Sir, (quoth the Emperour) I onely am the cauſe of all this contending; and therefore we muſt needs make an end together. The amends, ſaid our knight, is too much made alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy my Lord: prouided, that I may remaine in your good conceit, and that you will remember me hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Let me tell ye Sir, anſwered the Emperor, that heereof you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail, nor in any ſatisfaction that I can make ye, although you ſhould ſtand obſtinat againſt the permiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>Now, albeit the Emperour ſpake theſe words in ieſt, yet followed a time, that they fell out to good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, as you will finde more at large in the fourth Booke following. Sir knight, ſaid <hi>Leonorina,</hi> I know that I haue done you wrong; and ſeeing it is not in my power, at this preſent, to make you a ſufficient amends: I beſeech you to accept this Ring, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with as good a heart, as I was deſirous to know of you all that I demaunded. Taking it from off her finger, he ſtepped forward to giue it him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in ſteed of the Iewell, he tooke her by the hand, ſaying. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, this white and delicate hand, is more worthy to be kiſſed, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other that I haue ſeene within this yeares compaſſe: and the Ring may well repute it ſelfe happy, to be circled with ſo high an honor; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pardon me, I pray ye, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to kiſſe it. All this Sir, (quoth ſhe) cannot hinder the Ring to bee yours, &amp; ſo ſhe preſented it to him again whereof he durſt make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall, but in ſetting one knee to the ground, took it, &amp; ſweetly kiſſed her hand. Aſſure your ſelfe Sir, ſaid ſhe, that you haue ſo excellent a ſtone, as I eſteeme it to bee the onely one of that kinde: albeit I haue the very like in the Crowne which you gaue me backe againe, which two ſtones (indeed) ſhould be but one. So help me God, replied our knight, it is not to be admired, that a thing ſo rare, ſhould bee in the power of the worlds choyceſt Lady: for, like as ſuch a precious Iewell is not eaſily come by; as hardly (I think) can all the Eaſt yeeld another to go beyond you, either in wiſdome, knowledge, and all good graces elſe; therefore this Iewell is only fit for you, before any other. With that the Emperor ſtept in, ſaying. Let me tell ye Sir, when you know from whence it came, you wil make much greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation of it: &amp; if you obſerue the excellency of the Ring, you will find it worthy of right good kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: For it is (of an Emerauld) as faire as poſſible can be: and the reſt is a Rubie of two colours by nature, the one red as blood, the other white as ſnow. Then know Sir, that <hi>Apolidon</hi> my Grand-father, (whoſe renown hath long time circled the whole earth, though I know not whether as yet it came to your ears) holding the place that now I doe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many other ſingular things giuen him by <hi>Filipane,</hi> King of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia:</hi> he ſent him twelue Crownes, the very richeſt that could be ſeene: And although they were of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable value, yet there was one to be prized aboue all the reſt; and that is it which my daughter preſented you firſt, wherin the ſtone (being whole was then enchaſed. But <hi>Apolidon</hi> finding it to be ſo ſtrange, cauſed it to be cut in twain, leauing one of the parts in the Crowne, which he gaue to his Queen &amp; wife <hi>Grimeneſa,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he loued ſo dearely, as more loyall louers were neuer heard of: &amp; kept
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7181:279"/>
the other moitie for himſelfe, which hee wore ſo long as he liued in this Ring, and which, I pray you keepe for her ſake, that gaue it you with ſo good a heart. And if at any time you haue occaſion to part with it, let it be to ſome one of your kinred, to the end, that if Fortune conduct him into theſe parts, hee may know and ſerue the Lady that gaue it you, if ſhe ſtand in need thereof.</p>
                  <p>And ſo it came to paſſe after-ward; for it fell into the power of <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> who for the loue of her, (ſome ſhort while after) performed many deedes of Chiualry, as you ſhall vnderſtand in the fift Booke. Sir, anſwered our knight, I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard ſpeech of that <hi>Apoliaon,</hi> who builded the Arche of loyall Louers in the <hi>Firme I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>and,</hi> where I my ſelf haue bin, trauailing through the country of Great <hi>Brittaine:</hi> there alſo I ſaw the figures of him and his faire <hi>Grimeneſa,</hi> with many other ſingularities, which are there at this preſent.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps then (quoth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,) you know the knight that conquered the Enchanted Palace, whereof I heard ſo much report. Sir, ſaid he, I haue diuers times ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him, and hee cals himſelfe <hi>Amadis,</hi> Sonne to King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who is talked of in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It is he that was found floting on the water, whereupon hee was tearmed the Gentleman of the Sea. In a plaine field of battell, he van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed <hi>Abies,</hi> the moſt potent King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there the King, his father and his mother knew him to be their Sonne. On my ſoule, (ſaid the Emperour,) but that I am perſwaded, that ſo great a Lord would not vndertake ſo long a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I ſhould thinke it were your ſelfe that you ſpeake of, and I ſhould hardly bee altered other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>Our knight made him no aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere at all, but changing into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conference, at length they brake off, and ſixe whole dayes he remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> during which time, neuer had man more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable entertainment. And becauſe the time drew neere of his promiſed returne to <hi>Graſinda</hi> againe, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to take his leaue, cauſing his Ship to be in a readineſſe, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Emperour at conuenient leyſure, hee thus cloſed with him. Sir, you haue beſtowed ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reſpect vpon me, as I can come in no place whereſoeuer, but you may boldly ſay, that I am your ſeruant, ready to obey all your commaunds, as often as you ſhall pleaſe to imploy me. And becauſe I intend ſhortly to bee in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Romania,</hi> according to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne promiſe made, I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech you to licence my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. Worthy Friend (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Emperour,) if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that you could afford longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding heere, you might doe me an infinite pleaſure: but ſeeing your promiſe hath ſo ſtrictly engadged you, God forbid, that I ſhould cauſe you, or any other, to falſifie your word.</p>
                  <p>Sir, (ſaid our knight) I dare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that my honour will bee highly wrongd in doing otherwiſe, as it is well knowne to Maſter <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabet;</hi> therefore I entreat you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mee no longer. Well then, (quoth the Emperour) I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: prouided, that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny contradiction, you graunt mee three dayes longer ſtay. Your will bee done Sir, ſaide our knight, ſeeing it is your pleaſure to haue it ſo.</p>
                  <p>The ſaire Princeſſe <hi>Leonorina</hi> nor being preſent at this parlie, ſhee

ſent for him into her chamber, and being in the midſt of her Ladies, ſhe ſaid vnto him. Sir, you haue graunted the Emperour (as I am enformed) three dayes more to keepe him company: Faire Knight, let me entreate ye to afford me two dayes beſide his, during which time, you ſhall be dayly (if you pleaſe) with me and my Gentlewomen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without any impeachement, wee may the better gouerne you. Therefore aduiſe your ſelfe, with a good heart, we hauing you heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, will compell you thereto per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>As ſhee thus ſpake, ſhee made a ſigne to her Gentlewomen, to lay hold on him. Seeing himſelfe thus engirt by them all, what amiable graces, and milde forces they ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him with, by a voluntary impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, he promiſed to obey them, in this, or what elſe they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him; and ſmyling, hee thus ſpeke vnto the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorina.</hi> Why Madame, being vnable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape ſo ſharpe an impriſonment, as is heere preſented to my face, doe you imagine that I dare any way contradict you or yours? In good faith Sir, anſwered one of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, you doe the wiſer; for if you did the contrary, you would be in greater daunger, then when you fought with the Monſter <hi>Endria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truely Ladies, (quoth he) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue ye aſſuredly, conſidering it is certaine, that a man ſhall haue more labour in offending ſuch Angels, then if he contended againſt twenty worſe Deuils then he was. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I had much rather attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſuch another like warre as that, then fall into the perill of your diſpleaſure. Remember then Sir, anſwered <hi>Leonorina,</hi> what you haue promiſed, and looke that you bee carefull in keeping it.</p>
                  <p>Thus our knight continued in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> fiue dayes longer then he purpoſed, during all which time, he was a good companion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ladies and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: who neuer ceaſed to enquire of him, concerning the ſingularities of the <hi>Firme Iſland,</hi> the <hi>Defended Chamber,</hi> the <hi>Arche of lorall Louers,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Portraitures of Apolido<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as hee made anſwere ſtil to his beſt power, in caſes of this nature; he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with himſelfe, that if his <hi>Oriana</hi> could haue made one in this faire company, he ſhould haue thought, that all the bright beauties in the world were there congregated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. At laſt, he grew ſo diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in his ſoule, that words began to faile him, and he ſtood as falne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a traunce. Which the Queene <hi>Menoreſſa</hi> (Lady of the Iſle <hi>Gaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta)</hi> perceiuing, ſhee held him ſo ſtrongly by the arme, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly hee came to himſelfe againe.</p>
                  <p>Then he well perceiued, that hee had fayled in ſome one kinde or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; wherefore, in excuſe of him-ſelfe, he ſaid vnto them. I beſeech ye Ladies, thinke it not ſtrange, that hauing before mine eyes ſo many admirable beauties, wherewith both God and Nature hath bounteouſly enriched you all: I ſhould finde my ſences quite tranſported from their vſuall courſe, by remembring one, of whom I did ſometimes receiue ſo many gracious fauours, that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my ſelfe now to bee farre off from her; I endure a torment worſe then death, my ſpirit being rapt out

of my body, and liuing in her, to ſerue and obey her as I ought to do. Wherefore, Loue being to blame, for the fault wherein I haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before you; ſhould deſeruedly receiue the puniſhment, and not I, whom hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tormenteth with too much rigour.</p>
                  <p>Great compaſſion tooke all the Ladies and Gentlewomen on the affliction, which they beheld our Knight continually to ſuffer, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ſtroue to comfort him ſo well as ſhe could. But the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, when he muſt needes take leaue for imbarquing himſelfe: the Queene <hi>Menoreſſa,</hi> (who bare him an intire ſecret affection) ſaid vnto him. Sir Knight, by ſomething that I know, your long abſence hence will ſcarcely be well taken: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wee muſt needes endure your loſſe, I pray yee to accept a gift of me, which I am very deſirous to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon you. Then ſhee called for ſixe Swords, the very faireſt and beſt tempered that euer were ſeene: deſiring him to furniſh his friends with them, and not to be vnmindfull of her.</p>
                  <p>Madame, (quoth the Knight,) your gift is ſuch, that (for your ſake (they ſhall come to the hands of ſixe knights, the beſt (in mine opinion) this day liuing, and of whom you may and ſhall diſpoſe at all times, and in all affaires you will pleaſe to command them. That is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (ſaid the Princeſſe <hi>Leonorina,)</hi> which wee all together moue vnto you. By my faith, Madame, quoth he, all my life-time, I ſhall be yours, ready in obeiſance, when you pleaſe to imploy me. I thanke you Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Princeſſe, and doe more-ouer entreate you, that you would pleaſe ſo much to honour vs, as to ſend hither ſomeone of your linage, to remaine particularly ours, and to ſerue vs all, as need ſhall require Madame (quoth hee,) I make no doubt, but, before any long time, to ſend you a neere kinfeman of mine: who being in your ſeruice, you may well vaunt, that you haue one of the beſt knights in the world.</p>
                  <p>This he ſpake, as thinking of his Brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> whom he intended to cauſe to come and ſerue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And albeit hee was yet farre off from Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, finding himſelfe approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching towards the place, that gaue his heart beſt life and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his hopes did ſo heighten themſelues, and his ſpirits were ſo graciouſly cheared, as not anything ſeemed now impoſſible to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, though (in fiue yeares abſence) he had endured a world of afflictions. And now euen as if he felt the heauenly ayre of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> his foule laboured with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of diſcourſe, concerning what things he was to performe, &amp; what meanes he ſhould compaſſe, to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, long before his landing, <hi>Graſinda</hi> had heard by many, what worthy deeds of Chiualrie he had done in all the Iſlands of <hi>Romania:</hi> wherefore, being certified of his arriuall, accompanied with many knights, Ladies and Gentlewomen of the Country, ſhee went to wel-come him as honourably as might be.</p>
                  <p>Then conducting him to her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, there wanted no entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that beſt could expreſſe her affection towards him, and thus ſhe ſpake. Beleeue me Sir Knight, if formerly I held a good opinion of you, at this preſent it is much more encreaſed, conſidering how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully you haue kept promiſe with me, in being returned from your long voyage, before a yeare is fully compleated. Which armeth mee with a perfect perſwaſion, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not fayled in the firſt, you will doe the like in the next, which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome conference paſſed betweene vs, a little before your embarquing for <hi>Greece)</hi> I purpoſed to acquaint you with all at your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>
                  <p>Madame (quoth he) God forbid, that during al my life-time, I ſhould any way ſhew my ſelfe vnthankfull to you: for you haue ſo farre obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to you, that I muſt in dutie confeſſe, that (next vnder God and Maſter <hi>Eliſabet)</hi> who by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand hath kept mee company) I meerely hold my life by your meanes: and therefore you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of me, as ſhee that wholly hath power ouer me. Surely Sir,

ſaid ſhee, if hee haue done you any acceptable ſeruice, I repute it as mine, and take it in as kind part, as if it were performed to mine owne ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe Supper-time drew neere, and the whole day had beene ſomewhat contagiouſly hot, ſhee commanded the Tables to be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a moſt delightfull Arbour, where all varieties of poſſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were plenteouſly to be ſeene, and all delicate viands ſo ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſerued in, as it exceeded the compaſſe of any expreſſion.

                  <p>Our Knight being in bed, in ſteed of ſleeping, he fell into his accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med melancholy; and, as if <hi>Oriana</hi> had bin there preſent, hee thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with himſelfe: Alas, faire Friend, my long abſence from your perſon, hath loaded my ſoule with ſo many dolorous paſſions, that, but for feare of diſpleaſing you, Death had long ſince wrapt mee vp in my graue, and depriued me of my onely happines, which conſiſteth in the ſight of you.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, the more hope you haue of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her againe, the higher do you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to happines, by ſuch fauours as ſhe hath extended to you, farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your merit. Moreouer, you may well remaine aſſured, that her loyaltie is ſo conſtant, as, (by any accident that can happen) ſhe will neuer varie, vnderſtanding my fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in her owne ſoule to be ſuch, as I had rather dye an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, then to loſe the leaſt glimpſe of her kind fauour.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words were ſo loudly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by our Knight, that <hi>Gandalin</hi> (who ſlept ſoundly) awaking at the noyſe, ſtarted vp, and asked if hee would commaund him any ſeruice. Alas <hi>Gandalin,</hi> quoth he, I pray thee take no heed of mine vnruly paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but reſt contented, that I muſt ſuffer them, ſeeing Loue hath brought mee into this extremity. You are a ſtrange man, replyed <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> thus to afflict your ſelfe, when you ſhould be moſt comforted and cheared in heart, conſidering, that we are well on-ward in the way, of returning to your Lady <hi>Oriana,</hi> for whoſe ſake you ſuffer all theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And me thinks you ſhould doe well to throw off theſe diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing paſſions, which preſent ineui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table perill of life, and draw on dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſicknes, when you ſhould haue moſt need of health: for, grief begets ouer-haſty infirmities, which will hardly be auoided at the largeſt leyſure; therefore good Sir, take reſt if you can. How? quoth hee, canſt thou talke of reſt, or returning to <hi>Oriana:</hi> conſidering what a promiſe I haue made to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> which may commaund me further off from her, then hitherto I haue beene:</p>
                  <p>I cannot thinke ſo Sir, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> but am rather perſwaded, that her motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may draw you nerer to her, then you can imagine. What ſayſt thou <hi>Gandalin?</hi> replyed our Knight, doeſt thou thinke that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune can be ſo fauourable to mee? Aſſure thy ſelfe, if ſo great a good might befall me, I could bee well content, to forgiue all her former
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7181:281"/>
cruelties; which, ſince I was caſt vpon the Sea, ſhe hath infinit wayes impoſed on me. And if euer I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſuch a place, where I may compaſſe any meanes for ſending thee to <hi>Oriana,</hi> wilt thou doe ſo much for me, to carry her immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate tydings of me, and make mee once more as happy, as when thou wentſt firſt to her, at my returne from <hi>Gaule?</hi> How ſayſt thou? doeſt thou remember it? That doe I Sir, ſaid <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and can as well ſpeake to her, and make diſcourſe of all your life, as euer I did, if you dare repoſe ſo much truſt in mee; for I know both the Saint and ſhrine ſhe is deuoted to; and therefore, in the meane while Sir, let me entreat you to be of good courage.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſpent they out the moſt part of the night, deuiſing together on ſuch attempts, as might happen by the way in their returne to Great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> Earely the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Knight aroſe, and went to finde the Ladies, who were hearing Maſſe; which being ended, <hi>Graſinda</hi> tooke him by the hand, and leading him ſomewhat aſide, began in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Vnderſtand Sir knight, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a yeare before you came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Country, I happened into an aſſembly, procured by the Duke of <hi>Baſile,</hi> whereto al the faire Ladies and Gentle-women of theſe parts were ſummoned. As we were in the chiefeſt of our good cheare, I know not by what occaſion, but my Brother the Marqueſſe <hi>Salender</hi> (a man whom you well know, and in whoſe cuſtodie I then was) ſpake out aloude before all there preſent, that my beauty was ſo highly excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as no one in all the company might be compared with me; and if any Knight durſt maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hee was there ready to enter Combate with him. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, either becauſe he was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and therefore much feared; or whether the whole aſſembly ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him in opinion, there was no one would contradict him. By which meanes, I bare away the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme honour, from all the fayreſt Ladies in <hi>Romania,</hi> to my no ſmall pleaſure and contentment, as is very eaſie for you to imagine. And now Sir, if (by your meanes) I might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to a further paſſage, and reach to that heighth, which my heart hath euer ſince aymed at, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I ſhould account my ſelfe the happieſt Lady in the world. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame (quoth he) commaund mee what you pleaſe, and if it be in my power to performe, bee well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you ſhall finde mee ready in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                  <p>Heereupon ſhe thus proceeded. My Lord, I haue heard, that in the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bright beauties, not to be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: if you pleaſe to conduct me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and there to au ouch as much for me, either by Armes, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that I may haue the honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue them, as already I enioy ouer thoſe of this Country, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſelfe more beholding to you, then to all the other Knights in the world: for I haue no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then this to make vnto you, and which moſt earneſtly I beſeech you to graunt. Whereto if you condiſcend, I haue reſolued on a ſpeedie parting hence, and to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſuch a company, as ſhall highly honor ſo good a knight as you are. And this may the more encourage you, becauſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the King of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> and all the Lords and Ladies of his Court, you muſt maintaine, that the Lady you haue brought thither, (which ſhall bee my ſelfe) is fairer
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7181:282"/>

                  <p>And for further enlarging the glory of the Conquerour, you ſhall weare a Crown vpon your Helmet, which I will cary along with me, and he againſt whom you contend, ſhall haue another, that the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (in ſigne of triumph) may alſo weare that of the conquered. Wherein if Fortune ſtand fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vs, and that you finiſh this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe according to my minde, then I muſt further entreate you, to conduct mee into the <hi>Firme Iſland,</hi> where (as I haue heard) is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Chamber, that no Lady or Gentle-woman can enter into, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſhee excell <hi>Grimeneſa</hi> in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who neuer could be equalled by any. Then will my chiefeſt deſires be accompliſhed, and you diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of your promiſe made mee: therefore, aduiſe well with your ſelfe, whether you intend to deny me, or no.</p>
                  <p>When our Knight had heard this diſcourſe, he ſuddenly changed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and thus replyed. Alas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, you haue vndone me, in vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a mater ſo far out of my power, and haue euen ſtrooke me dead with your words. This he ſpake, conſidering what wrong he ſhould offer <hi>Oriana,</hi> in attempting a labour ſo highly to her diſhonour. And on the other ſide, he was well aſſured to finde an infinite number of good Knights in King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, who, by any perill that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, would not endure ſo deepe an indignitie: beſide, this was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt way, whereby he might fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Ladies diſ-fauour, and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) procure his owne death by this meanes.</p>
                  <p>In conſideration of all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, he called to minde alſo, his kinde entertainments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by <hi>Graſinda,</hi> what a helpe ſhe had beene to him in ſo vrgent a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and how he had bound him-ſelfe to her by voluntary promiſe: theſe contended ſo mainly with his other cogitations, that when his ſeruice to <hi>Oriana,</hi> checkt him from purſuing this enterpriſe, reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required, and enforced him to the contrary. Heereupon, he fell into ſuch a perplexitie, that he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed hee had neuer beene borne, and curſed Fortune, who was ſo contrary to him in all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Then ſuddenly he called to mind, that <hi>Oriana</hi> was no Maide, but a troth-plighted wife, hauing had a child, as <hi>Mabila</hi> had ſent him word: and therefore, he that ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a fairer Maide, then <hi>Graſinda</hi> was a faire wife, ſhould receiue ſhame, and ſo by good reaſon, he might enter the Combate with him. Which either before, or afterward, (as he found time, place and oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to fauour him) he would make knowen to the Princeſſe: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as one awaked out of a ſerious ſtudie, or eſcaped from ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy dungeon, he began to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate his ſpirits, and with a ſmyling countenance, thus he ſpake to <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinda.</hi>

In good faith Sir knight, anſwered <hi>Graſinda,</hi> I was much amazed, to ſee your ſudden alteration, and heare your refuſall of ſuch a matter, as cannot but redound to your honor, and my glory. But perceiuing you are now in ſo good a deliberation, I pray you to continue it: being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that (by your meanes) I ſhall gaine the like honour ouer the maydes of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> as I haue already wonne from the Ladies of <hi>Romania,</hi> and that I may (afterward) iuſtly weare the two Crownes, as hauing gotten the prime place of beauty by conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue me Madame, anſwered our Knight, the way you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to paſſe, is greatly to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and you muſt needes goe through ſo many ſtraunge Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as trauaile may be very offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue to you, and diminiſh much of that goodly feature, and liuely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, wherewith Nature hath moſt liberally enriched you. So that by gaining in the one, you may (perhaps) loſe in the other; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſideration is very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, before repentance enſue too late.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſaid ſhee, counſell is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken, and my reſolution cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely ſet downe: for, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whatſoeuer may happen, I am not able to be altered, without ſpare of gold, ſiluer, paine or perill any way enſuing. And whereas you ſay, that we muſt paſſe through many ſtrange Lands; the Sea (in this caſe) can beſt releeue vs, as I haue learned by Maiſter <hi>Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</hi>

                  <p>Well then Madame (quoth he) take order for your other affaires, and let vs part hence when you pleaſe. That ſhall be (ſaid ſhe) ſo ſoone as wee may; in the meane while, bee no way iniurious to your ſelfe, but paſſe the time as pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you can: for I haue Hawkes, Hounds and Huntſmen to yeeld you pleaſure; and therefore I would aduiſe you, this day to chaſe the Hart, Hinde, or nimble Roe, or any other game that may beſt delight you. Whereto hee willingly gaue conſent, ſo that after dinner, our Knight, accompanied with many Lords and Gentlmen, rode into the Forreſt.</p>
                  <p>There they met with great ſtore of wilde beaſts, who being well nere ſpent with running, made backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vpon the purſuing Houndes. But as our Knight earneſtly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Hart, which had eſcaped from the toyles, both hee and <hi>Gandalin</hi> were ſtrayed ſo far into the woods, as they were enforced to ſpend the whole night there, by not knowing how to recouer againe their way of entrance. And as they traced from one ſide to another, at length they came neere to a very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Fountaine, enuironed round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with trees of ſuch heighth, as it was impoſſible (almoſt) to meet with taller.

                  <p>And becauſe our Knight could not ſo ſoone betake himſelfe to reſt, hee walked along vnder the faire-ſpreading trees, and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſomewhat neere him a white horſe lye dead, all couered with freſh-bleeding woundes, which hee had l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Ab miſerable man, vnfortunate <hi>Bruneo de bonne Me:</hi> now thou doſt too plainly perceiue, that thou art enforced to finiſh thy dayes, and all thy affectionate deſires, wherewith thy loyall heart hath beene ſo long time afflicted.

O vnkinde Fortune, vtter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to my felicity, thou haſt throwen me ſo farre off from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, as I haue not ſo much as the meanes, whereby I might make knowen my diſaſter to any one, that ſhould reuenge my wrongs, which were no meane comfort to mee, in this wofull caſe, and the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly would my poore ſoule part out of this wretched world. Ah <hi>Melicia,</hi> floure and mirrour of all vertuous perfections, this night thou loſeſt the moſt loyall ſeruant that euer Lady or Gentle-man had, for my whole life-time was deuoutly dedicated, onely to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and pleaſe you in all faithfull ſeruices.</p>
                  <p>And vpon my ſoule, if you well conſider it, perhaps you will finde this leſſe extreame for you, being aſſured, that you ſhall neuer meete with any other, ſo conſtant to you, as your <hi>Bruneo:</hi> Now doth the lampe of my life beginne to burne dimbe, and my afflicted heart lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all his forces, wherewith (by your remembrance onely) I haue heeretofore performed many man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deedes of Armes and Chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, I muſt needes recommend it to you, entreating you ſo to fauour and reſpect it, as neuer ſinning againſt you in loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Death, that hath ſeazed on me, thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe too ſharp and rigorous to me, in robbing me of all my happines, all my ioy and pleaſure in one inſtant. Nor doe I expreſſely blame thee, for depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing me of my life: but becauſe thou couldſt not permit mee before my death, to accompliſh the charge im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by <hi>Melicia</hi> on me, which was, to find out her brother <hi>Amadis.</hi>

                  <p>Heere he pauſed awhile but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently proceeded on againe thus. Alas, this commaund was the very firſt that euer ſhe did put me in truſt withall; and now (as I too plainly perceiue) muſt bee the laſt alſo. Whereby I feele a double torment: for, if I could haue had the meanes to ſatisfie her heerein, my trauaile, (though ending in death) I ſhould haue eſteemed happy. And that, (deare Miſtreſſe) is my chiefeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that my dayes are cut off, before I had the power to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the infinitie of gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours by you beſtowed on me: but reſt you well aſſured, and on my ſoul I proteſt it, that I neuer ſtood in feare of death, in whoſe face I haue oftentimes hazarded my fortunes; but grieue to finiſhe my life thus, in louing you too affectionately.</p>
                  <p>Then a heart-breaking ſigh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted

                  <p>Why, how now deare friend? anſwered our knight, doeſt thou thinke me to be <hi>Laſinde</hi> thy Squire? why man, I am thy companion <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> for whoſe ſake thou art falne into this great danger.

Then viſiting the wounds of <hi>Bruneo,</hi> he found them ſhut and cloſed, by reaſon of the nights ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame coldnes: notwithſtanding, hee applied ſuch excellent oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them, as before they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thence, his paine was well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and he fell faſt aſleep, which gaue vndoubted hope to Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> that the worſt of daunger was paſt; whereof when he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed our knight, no newes could be more comfortable to him.</p>
                  <p>As thus they ſate expecting their ſicke friends awaking, they eſpied a man comming towards them, cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heades of two Knights at his ſaddle bow, and holding an Axe in his hand all bloody.

                  <p>At ſpeaking theſe words, he made moſt pittifull lamentation, and then began again thus. Surely Sir, you wil not thinke what trauaile he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, onely in the ſearch of you, ſo earneſt was his deſire to find you: which would to God he had done, before this great misfortune befell him, by the villainous treachery of two traytors, whoſe heades you may heere behold, not long ſince deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee by <hi>Angriote Eſtrauaux.</hi> He gaue me expreſſe command, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to my Lord if hee were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: if not, to lay them ſo neere to his dead body as I could, that the world might witneſſe iuſt reuenge taken on them. <hi>Laſinde,</hi> anſwered our Knight, he is liuing, thankes bee giuen to God for it, and I left him vnder yonder trees, in better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition then thou imagineſt. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, hee is yet ſo feeble, by his great expence of blood, as he could not declare how, or by whom hee was thus wronged: and if thou wilt follow me, thou ſhalt finde him in no worſe eſtate then I tell thee.</p>
                  <p>But beware (vpon thy life) that before any whoſoeuer, thou call me none other, then the Knight of the Greene Sword. It ſhall bee done Sir, quoth the Squire, ſeeing it is your pleaſure ſo to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me.</p>

And he is gone to a Monaſtery of Ladies in this Forreſt, to ſtenche the blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a wound, which hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his right legge, and there hee will make no long abyding, but intendeth to ſee you aliue, or dead.</p>
                  <p>I pray GOD (quoth <hi>Bruneo)</hi> that hee will defend him from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: but how couldſt thou finde me out in this Deſart place, ſo farre eſtranged from all reſort? Sir, ſaid the Squire, <hi>Angriote</hi> commanded me, to goe directly to that part of the wood, where I ſhould diſcerne the tauleſt trees: becauſe hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Traytours them-ſelues, that there they had woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you to death, which vrged him to ſuch extreme ſorrow, as no mans could be more.</p>
                  <p>Before God, replyed the Knight of the Greene Sword, it were great pitty, that <hi>Angriote</hi> ſhould ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wrong: for he is a man of eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall merit, and one that I would very gladly ſee. Therefore <hi>Laſinde,</hi> conduct mee (if thou canſt) where hee is, while <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and theſe other, conuey thy Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to ſuch a place, where I know he ſhall be moſt kindly welcome.</p>
                  <p>So they layed him gently in the Litter, and our Knight put on the Armes of <hi>Bruneo,</hi> bruiſed and batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as they were, and he rode with the Squire into the Forreſt, where they had not trauailed long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but they eſpied <hi>Angriote</hi> come ryding towardes them, with his lookes deiected to the ground, like to a man very ſad and melancholly. Behind him they ſaw foure knights alſo, making haſte after him, all well armed and mounted, purſuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vpon the ſpurre, and crying out ſo loud as they could: Turne, turne thee Traytour, for thou muſt leaue thy head behinde thee, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of both theirs, whom thou haſt treacherouſly ſlaine, being men of much more deſert then thy ſelfe. At this crye, <hi>Angriote</hi> turned backe, and prepared for his owne defence; which our Knight of the Greene Sword perceiuing, he gaue his horſe the ſpurre, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any blow was ſmitten, came among them, ſaying to <hi>Angriote,</hi> who had not till then ſeene him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Much amazed, but yet greatly comforted was <hi>Angriote,</hi> ſeeing the Knight of the Green Sword, whom (by notice of his Armes) he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be <hi>Bruneo;</hi> and as he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make him anſwer; our knight ranne againſt his enemies, meeting firſt with <hi>Brandaſidel,</hi> (hee that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly would haue forced him, to ride with his face backward, to the horſe tayle, &amp; compell him to come to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> who thought him to be the moſt abſolute Knight in al the Iſlands of <hi>Romania,</hi> as already you haue heard;) but his Launce gaue him ſuch a ſound ſalutation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his Helmet and the Cuirats, as caried him quite out of his ſadle, and there hee lay entranced on the ground. The other three charged <hi>Angriote</hi> all together, againſt whom he maintained his cauſe ſo ſtoutly, as his courage gaue perfect apparance of it ſelfe. And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne the fight betweene two to three, manfully performed on either ſide: but in the end, our knight of the greene Sword, and <hi>Angriote</hi> had ſuch aduantage, as they were glad to turne their backes, becauſe the beſt man among them all, fell down to the ground.

                  <p>This being done, hee purpoſed to follow his companion, whom ſtill hee conceiued to be <hi>Bruneo:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit his ſtroakes and rare Chiualry vrged a contrary ſuſpition, and hee knew not what to imagine, till hee beheld <hi>Amadis</hi> returning towards him, who had then put off his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met to take the aire, by which means <hi>Angriote</hi> knew him. Then, as one much amazed, he rode to him, and ſtretching forth his armes, louingly embraced him, ſaying. My worthy Lord, what high good happe befell me to meet you ſo luckily: conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that but by your aſſiſtance, I had doubtleſſe bin dead. By my faith Sir (quoth our Knight) you owe many thankes to <hi>Laſinde,</hi> who was the cauſe of our happy mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for he perſwaded me, that you were gone to a neere adioyning Monaſterie, for cure of a wound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in your legge. Indeed Sir, (ſaid <hi>Angriote)</hi> ſuch was my deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and thitherward I went, till theſe Traytours came to aſſaile me: But know you what is become of <hi>Brunco?</hi> I am perſwaded, hee is either dead, or in very great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Be of good cheare man (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed our Knight) I hope his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt perill is paſt: for I lately left him, in the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e of one of the beſt Chirurgions in the world.</p>
                  <p>Then he reported, in what maner he found him, and what complaints he made, exſpecting nothing elſe but death; whereby I perfectly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand (quoth hee) what tedious trauailes you both haue endured, onely in the ſearch of me, for which (while I liue) I ſtand highly obliged to you. I would it were in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer (quoth <hi>Angriote)</hi> to let you know how much more I could find in my heart to doe for you: then ſhould you well perceiue, that this which you pleaſe to terme trauaile, is nothing elſe but pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to me.</p>

                  <p>So they returned to the place of encounter, and found one of them offering to riſe: but the Knight of the Green Sword going neere him, made a proffer to ſmite him, ſaying. Trayterous villaine, how du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſwered <hi>Angriote)</hi> this is one of them, that ſo cruelly wounded our friend <hi>Brunco,</hi> and to prooue it true, I left him with him, and two other Knights beſide, that came to ſeeke ſuccour for their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (as they ſaid) that ſhould bee burned moſt ſhamefully. But them-ſelues (afterward) confeſſed the treaſon to me, in returning from a place, where (at the ſame inſtant) I was deſired, to deliuer the Son of an ancient Knight, who was kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner by diuers villaines. Which I did, ſetting him at libertie, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning the other in his ſteed; by which occaſion, I and <hi>Bruneo</hi> were ſundered, whom ſince I neuer ſaw. Is not this true? ſpeake wretch: but hee anſwered not a word, lying ſtill, with his eyes faſt fixed on the ground.</p>
                  <p>Heereupon, the Knight of the Greene Sword called to <hi>Laſinde,</hi> ſaying; Alight from thy horſe, and ſmite off his head. <hi>Laſinde</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſmounted, and as he lifted vp his arme to ſtrike, the other cried out. Alas Sir, for Gods ſake take pitty on me, and I will tell you the trueth inſtantly. Make haſte then, (ſaid <hi>Angriote)</hi> or another ſhall bee haſtier with thee, then thou wouldſt haue him to be. Then (by litle and litle) hee began to relate what had happened, ſaying.</p>
                  <p>Vnderſtand my Lords, I and my companions being aduertiſed, that two Knights errant, were newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in this Country, to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knight of the Greene Sword, we reſolued to kill them, as thinking by that meanes, to doe diſpleaſure to him whom they deſired to finde, becauſe we hate him deadly. And in regard wee feared to ſet on them both together, we deuiſed to ſunder them, by miſinforming them, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready you haue heard. But when we came to the Fountaine of the high Beeches, he whom we condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, in pretence of deliuering the condemned Lady, ſuffered his horſe to water there: and as hee let looſe the reynes of his bridle, we ran vpon him, giuing him ſo many hurts with our Swords and Axes, before hee had the leaſt meanes of defending himſelfe) that he fell down dead, as we ſuppoſed, for he appeared not to moue any limbe.</p>
                  <p>Villaine, (anſwered <hi>Amadis)</hi> durſt thou commit ſuch deteſtable treaſon, vnder colour of thy hatred to me? How Sir, quoth the other, are you the Knight of the Greene Sword? Looke villaine, ſaid <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and ſee it heere hanging by my ſide. Then Sir, quoth the other, you may partly hold me excuſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what I haue done, was by the perſwaſion of a kinſeman of mine, whom you haue ſlaine, and heere you may behold him lying at my feete. A yeare is not yet fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, ſince he receiued by you, the greateſt ſhame that any man could haue, and his name was <hi>Brandaſidel,</hi> whom I know not whether you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member as yet, or no. You made him mount vpon his horſe, with his face backward and to hold the taile
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7181:286"/>
in ſteed of a bridle, with his Shield renuerſed, and ſo preſented him to <hi>Graſinda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heereat hee conceiued ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, that in meere malice to you, he enuied all other knights er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as wee did the like in loue to him. Thus haue I declared the whole truth to you, and humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you, (without any reſpect to mine offence) to graunt mee mercy, beyond all merit.</p>
                  <p>Our Knight beganne to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, anſwering. The mercy thou ſhalt haue, is not to abridge the puniſhment thou haſt iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: but in hope that thou wilt become an honeſter man hereafter, then hitherto thou haſt bin, in this regard thy life is ſpared. But if thou fall to thine old byas, aſſure thy ſelfe, time will fitte me with a ſharper reuenge, r then now I can or will take on thee, So leauing him, they rode directly towardes the Towne: and falling from one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to another, our knight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Angriote,</hi> what newes he had brought out of Great <hi>Brittaine?</hi> He reſolued him all things that hee could, and told him (among other matters) that a reuerend Hermite, named <hi>Naſcian,</hi> had giuen King <hi>Liſuart</hi> one of the very goodlieſt young Gentlemen, that euer was ſeene: whom he recouered (in his ſwadling clothes) out of the teeth of a Lionneſſe, carying him for food to her young ones: Alſo how the Queene had giuen him to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Oraina,</hi> to ſerue her (quoth he) with my Sonne <hi>Ambor:</hi> but there is very great difference betweene them, becauſe <hi>Ambor</hi> is mightily deformed, and the other an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable creature. You may (quoth <hi>Amadis)</hi> report of your Sonne as you pleaſe, but if hee carry reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with his Father, he wil proue a man of extraordinary merit. To women let vs leaue beauty and faire feature, who are curious and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue after ſuch nicities: &amp; would to God your Sonne were of age to follow me, then ſhould I require him of you, and that very earneſtly, to keepe company with <hi>Gandalin,</hi> on whom I purpoſe to beſtow knighthood, ſo ſoone as I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into <hi>Gaule.</hi> Truſt mee Sir, ſaid <hi>Angriote, Gandalin</hi> doth well deſerue much at your hands, and if my Sonne were ſo happy as you wiſh him, my hopes would mount farre higher, then as yet they can doe.</p>
                  <p>Falling from this, into other talke, <hi>Amadis</hi> demaunded, how long ſince he and <hi>Bruneo</hi> had iourneyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Since our departure from Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> anſwered <hi>Angriote,</hi> we neuer abandoned one anothers company, for any fight or Combat whatſoeuer could happen, till ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday: and yet notwithſtanding, we haue ended many ſtraunge and dangerous aduentures, albeit (all of them) inferiour to your high for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, againſt that deuiliſh Monſter <hi>Endriagus,</hi> according as wee haue thereof bin aduertiſed. Wherfore I beſeech you to let me vnderſtand, how, and in what maner you fought together.</p>
                  <p>We muſt referre that, replyed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> till ſome more apt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient leyſure, becauſe we now are neere to the Towne, and that will require a much larger diſcourſe, then the ſhortneſſe of the way will permit vs.</p>
                  <p>By this time they were arriued at <hi>Granſidaes</hi> Palace, who hauing heard tydings of their comming, came very kindly to welcome them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting them to the Chamber where <hi>Bruneo</hi> lay, who beganne to finde himſelfe better and better, by

ſuch good meanes as Maſter <hi>Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi> had vſed to him. But when hee ſaw them all three ſo well met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was not a little ioyfull, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God for ſuch a fortunate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
                  <p>And as they parled on their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed aduentures, our Knight of the Greene Sword, declared to them, the promiſe which he had made to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> and what ſhipping ſhee prepared for paſſage into Great <hi>Brittaine:</hi> whereof they were all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ioyfull, in regard of their long-deſired returne thither.

                  <p>As thus he ſpake, hee made an humble reuerence to the Ladies, and ſo rod towards the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillions. <hi>Grumedan</hi> had heard all this diſcourſe betweene the Knight and the Ladies, which made him ſuddenly preſume, that he was ſome kinſman to noble <hi>Amadis:</hi> and it mounted his ſpirits very io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, with a hopefull perſwaſion, that he would qualifie the ouer da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pride of the Romaines, who (vpon opinion of their owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe) contemned all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world. Comming forth of his Tent, he beheld him to handle the Shildes each after the other, and that in ſuch manner, as daring their Maiſters to come to the louſt: afterward he with drew thence, croſſing ouer the little ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, in expectation of them that had any quarell againſt him. The fiue Romaine Knights mounted on horſebacke, intending all together to ſet vpon him: but <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in this manner, ſaying.</p>
                  <p>How Lords? would you offer to breake honorable cuſtome, and combate fiue againſt one Knight onely? you ought to goe one after another, according as your Shields haue beene touched: and remember your ſelues well, for by the Knights outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, hee will not eaſilie be put to diſgrace. Lord <hi>Gramedan,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Gradamor,</hi> wee Romaines differ very farre from you, becauſe you commend, before the deed be done, and we, after it is effected: and let me tell yee, you will hardly finde any Knight equall to vs. I know not (replied <hi>Grumedan)</hi> what they are whom you talke of, and hold in ſuch high eſtimation: but if I were to deale with any of you, that offered me the very leaſt iniury: I ſhould hope to looſe no honour thereby. <hi>Grumedan, Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> anſwered <hi>Gradamor,</hi> you haue a good conceite of yourſelfe, and I could wiſh (though it did coſt me my fayreſt fortune) that we two were now as ready one for another: as I ſhall quickely be for him, that is ſo boldly come hether to ſeeke his owne ſhame. And yet I feare it will neuer fall to my turne; becauſe hee whoſe Shield he firſt handled, will handle him with ſuch ſeuere chaſtiſement, as I ſhall not need to diſplay mine arme againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Here at <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſmiled, ſaying. Well Sir. take heed you hap not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hazard, for many times it comes to paſſe; that they who thinke to vanquiſh others, are disfauoured and foyled themſelues by fortune, who neuer was friend to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous. I vnderſtand you well (ſaid <hi>Gradamor)</hi> and that thus we may conteſt heere till it be night. So, going to him whoſe Shield was firſt toucht, he ſaid. Goe my deare companion, and make it apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, what difference there is betweene well ſpeaking, and bad
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7181:288"/>
doing. Be confident in me, replied the other, I am not made for prating enterparlaunce, and neuer let any account be had of me: if (at our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt ſhock) I make him not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his length on the ground; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he deliuer me his Shield, and his horſe to you Lord <hi>Grumedan,</hi> which I perceiue is very faire and goodly. So croſſing the riuer, and placing his Launce in his reſt, hee ran againſt <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> againſt him, but fayled of breaking their Launces: neuertheleſſe, they met with their Shields and bodies together ſo mainely, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine (being leſſe expert then the other) was caſt downe from his horſe, and breaking his arme in the fall, lay all along ſo am azedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, as hee was able to moue neither hand or foote.</p>
                  <p>Herevpon, <hi>Floreſtan</hi> cryed out to his owne Squires, to ſtay the horſe, which ran about the field, and and to take the Shield from about the Knights neck and hang it vp vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a tree, where hee poynted him. Then returning to the place where he began his courſe, he attended for a ſecond man, to ſuccour his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, who very ſoone after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelfe. But if the firſt found a curſt entertainement; this other met with one much worſe, for <hi>Floreſtan</hi> gaue him ſuch a wel-come with his Launce: that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred quite through his Shield, coate of Maile; and pierced farre into the fleſh, ſo that his girts braking, by ſtrength of the encounter, he tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ouer and ouer, with the horſes ſaddle betweene his legges, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing perfected his race, <hi>Floreſtan</hi> turned back againe, ſaying. By my faith, Knight, the Saddle ſhall be yours, but the horſe mine, vpon condition: that (hereafter) you publiſh your proweſſe in the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll of Rome, in what manner you attempted, and how you ſped.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words were ſo audibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, as the Ladies might eaſily vnderſtand them: which pleaſed <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſo highly, that hee ſaid to the other Knights. If you ſpeed no better then your companions haue done: I am of the mind, that at your returne to Rome, they need not breake downe any part of the walls, to let in the glory of your triumph. Beleeue it Sir, anſwered <hi>Gradamor,</hi> before the ſport is ended, you ſhall ſee a contrary turne of chaunce, to his diſaduantage that you make ſo much account of, who (accidentally hath ouer-throwne two of our friendes. I know not (ſaid <hi>Grumedan)</hi> what may happen, but (for ought I yet ſee) he meanes to defend his Shield manfully, and conquer yours: for cariage of them to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> as he ſaid, not to be placed in ranke of thoſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to loyall loouers, but among ſuch Knights, as left their armes more vpon compalſion, then with their owne good wills. Therefore, it ſtands you now vpon, and that very needfully, to diſplay the ſtrength of your arme, that I be not troubled to day to arme my ſelfe, to defend the honor of our knights, on whom you haue throwne ſuch foule aſpertions, and ſcandalous imputations.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words <hi>Gradamor</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hartely, and nodding his head (as in deriſion) replied Lord <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan,</hi> it likes you to be pleaſant, and to imagine mee of no more might or courage, then to combate againſt your brauing ſpeeches: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well aſſured, that (before day light ſhut in) I ſhall make you to repent them. I heare you ſay ſo, anſwered <hi>Grumedan:</hi> but hee that hath begun to feaſt your fellowes will dreſſe a

better diſh for you before it bee night, very much offended was the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> to heare <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> conteſt thus vpon no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In this time, <hi>Floreſtan</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the downe-caſt Knights horſe, and hung his Shield vp by the other. Then returning to his firſt place, and taking a new Lance, hee ſtayed the comming of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Then came forth the third knight, who, with a ſtearne countenance, ſhooke his ſtaffe ſo ſtrongly, as if he would haue doubled it together, and giuing the ſpurres to his horſe, ranue againſt <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> But <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan</hi> (who was one of the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue Knights in the world) met him with ſuch direct encounter on the Helmet, that it fell off from his head; and the ſhocke was ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as, if he had not quickly caught hold about his horſe necke, hee had falne to the ground. Then turning bridle, he tooke his Launce by the ſteele head, intending to ſmite him with the great end thereof: but hee turned aſide from the blow, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe with his Shield, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Floreſtan</hi> caught ſuch faſt hold, that he core it from his neck, beating him ſo often about the pace, as hee was enforced to fall downe. Where <hi>Floreſtan</hi> left him, crying out, that euery one might heare him. By my faith Knight, it was ill done of you, to beginne ſo badly, with triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer our Shields at <hi>Rome,</hi> when yours muſt keepe company with theirs, that I muſt ſend to the <hi>Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iſle.</hi> The like ſucceſſe befell to the fourth man, who, in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from his horſe, brake his legge.</p>
                  <p>Now, there remained none but <hi>Gradamor,</hi> who continuing ſtill his preſumptuous ſpeeches, ſaid to <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan:</hi> See you bee ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere me, ſo ſoone as I haue diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinde vonder ſaucie companion, in whoſe behalfe you haue ſpoken ſomewhat too liberally this day: and I if I doe not make you to vnſay thoſe words, let me neuer here after backe a horſe that may bee worthy any thing. That will appeare by and by, replyed <hi>Gramedan;</hi> but I dare beleeue nothing till I ſee it: and if you come fairly off from the ſtrange Knights entertainement, you and I ſhall haue leyſure to talke together the better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gradamor</hi> would then returne no anſwere, but in a great rage paſſed ouer the Riuer, and cryed to the Knight, to guard himſelfe. Then <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ranne againſt him; and the ſhocke was ſo violent betweene them both, that <hi>Gradamor</hi> bended his Shield together: but <hi>Floreſtan</hi> tooke him at ſuch apt aduantage, that hee threw him quite out of his Saddle, into a quagmine, full of ſtinking ſoyle and dirt. Now I dare ſweare, ſaid <hi>Gramedan</hi> (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king then to the Queene) for ought I yet know, I ſhall haue leyſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to breathe my ſelfe, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Beleeue me Sir (quoth ſhe) he hath but badly maintained thoſe great words which he ſpake to you: but hee did like them, to whom de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerued chaſtiſement is due, and therefore you may well hold him excuſed.</p>
                  <p>All this while, <hi>Gradamor</hi> labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very painfully, to get himſelfe out of the filthy bogge, wherein he feared leſt he ſhould bee drowned, but at laſt, hee came very fowlly forth, ſo aſhamed of his misfortune, as death could haue bin more wel-come to him. Then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ooke he off his Helmet, for he was almoſt poisoned with the ſmell of the puddle, as
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7181:289"/>
being no way able to endure it. And as he ſtood to recouer breath <hi>Floreſtan</hi> (in a mocking manner) ſaid to him. Knight, thou that canſt skill ſo well, of threatning men that thou knoweſt not: if thou canſt handle thy Sword no better then thy Launce, thou art not the man that muſt carry my Shield to <hi>Rome,</hi> as of late thou madſt thy brag to doe,</p>
                  <p>Before God, anſwered <hi>Gradamor,</hi> mine arme is yet ſtrong, and my Sword keeue enough, to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge on thee, and the very boldeſt Knight in all Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> if hee offer mee any iniury: as thou ſhalt preſently perceiue, if thou darſte maintaine the cuſtome of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try againſt mee.</p>
                  <p>Now, albeit <hi>Floreſtan</hi> was there with much better acquainted, then <hi>Gradamor</hi> could be, yet he demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him what it was? It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient (quoth hee) and agreeing with the order of Armes, that thou ſhouldſt either reſtore me my horſe, or elſe alight on foote, that our manner of fight may be equall: then, he that ſhall gaine the better, let him deal with his enemy as likes him beſt without any admiſſion of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Truſt me, replied <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> I will fulfill thine owne deſire: although I am well aſſured, that thou wouldſt not ſhew ſuch courteſie to mee, if thou hadſt mee at the like aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as now I haue thee. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it were very vnreaſonable, that ſo goodly a Romaine Knight, beeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oylde with ſuch filth and dirt, ſhould make his horſein as bad a caſe as hee is himſelfe: I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounte from mine, at thine entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. So he alighted on foote, and couerieg himſelfe with his Shield, marched boldly againſt <hi>Gradamor,</hi> who made no doubt now, but to reuenge his iniury very ſufficiently.</p>
                  <p>The fight began, and continued (for ſome while betweene them) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharply and cruell: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it laſted not long; for <hi>Floreſtan</hi> (who was one of the moſt skilfull Knights then liuing) brought his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to ſuch extremity, that hee drew him ſo farre as to the Queenes Pauilion, where he fell downe, by reaſon of a mighty ſtroke deliuered on the toppe of his Helmet; and lay ſo bere ft of al his ſences, as he could ſtirre neither hand nor foote. Then <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſet his foote vpon him, and taking him by the legge, dragde him a long to the miry puddle, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he fell at the firſt: but the Laces of his Helmet chaunced to breake, ſo that it fell off from his head, and the freſh ayre driuing away his trance, gaue him ſight of his immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, which made him craue pardon of <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> and cry out to the Queene for helpe.</p>
                  <p>By my faith (quoth ſhee to <hi>Grumedan)</hi> this ſhame and perill is iuſtly falne vpon him: for by the ſame Law which he made him-ſelfe, he muſt now receiue his ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Floreſtan</hi> looking angerly on <hi>Gradamor,</hi> ſaide vnto him. Canſt thou craue mercie, conſidering what couenant hath paſt betweene vs, and on an edict willingly ſet downe by thy ſelfe? Looke for none other fauor, then what I am bound to, by thy owne conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Wretch that I am then, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Gradamor,</hi> there now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines no hope or comfort. No, (quoth <hi>Floreſtan)</hi> and ſo aſſure thy ſelfe, except thou doeſt two things that I ſhall command thee. Alas Sir, ſaide <hi>Gradamor,</hi> I am ready to obey you, and to doe whatſoeuer you ſhal enioyne mee. Write then preſently, replyed <hi>Floreſtan,</hi>

thy name, and thoſe of thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, with thine owne blood, vpon theſe Shieldes, and afterward, thou ſhalt know the reſt of my will. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> was in ſuch feare, as hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather dead then aliue: for <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſtood with his Sword ſtill ouer him, ready (at a word) to ſmite off his head. Whereupon, he called for one of his ſeruants, to bring him a Penner ſpeedily, and taking foorth a penne, filled it with his owne blood, and ſo perfourmed the commaund of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On horſe-backe mounted hee preſently, and taking a ſtrong Launce from one of his Squires, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe to <hi>Gradamor,</hi> ſaying: Baſe Knight, this Launce was neuer made, but for their reuenge, whom thou haſt hitherto cowardly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuriouſly abuſed: thou dieſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inſtantly, except <hi>Grumedan</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate mee to ſaue thy life. Alas Sir, quoth <hi>Gradamor,</hi> hee will neuer doe it.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely had hee finiſhed theſe words, but <hi>Floreſtan</hi> made a proffer to thruſt it in his throate: which made him fearefully crye out: Ah gentle Knight <hi>Grumedan,</hi> entreate ſome fauour for mee. At this crye <hi>Grumedan</hi> came neere, and returned him this anſwere. Beleeue mee knight, your great preſumption hath brought you into this daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate: and if he whom you ſo audaciouſly threatned, ſhould ſmite your head off from your ſhoulders, hee did no more then you haue iuſtly deſerued. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, for this time, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to pardon and forgiue you.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> turning to <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan,</hi> ſaid. Lord <hi>Grumedan,</hi> you haue power to commaund me: and ſeeing it is your will that hee ſhall liue, I am contented to remit him. And therefore, thou Romaine Knight, thanke him for thy life, and remember withall, that ſo ſoone as thou art come to <hi>Rome,</hi> thou report in the open Senate, what honour all of you haue wonne, againſt the Knights of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> whom (in your common talke) you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and deſpiſe. And if your Emperour take delight to heare you ſpeake, bee not neglect, in telling him it often. Becauſe (for my part) I will make knowen to the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> the great liberalitie of you Romaines in this Countrey, by parting ſo lightly with your Armes, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Shieldes, to men that you know not, and when you are no longer able to defend them.</p>
                  <p>All theſe wordes vttered by <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> could not procure the leaſt anſwere from <hi>Gradamor:</hi> but he held downe his head in no meane rage, to ſee himſelfe ſo flouted and ſcornde.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Grumedan</hi> hauing heard all this conference, nothing could better content him, then to ſee theſe proud Romanes thus diſgraced by one Knight onely. On the other ſide, <hi>Gradamor</hi> was in ſuch tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting affliction: as (without retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any anſwere to <hi>Floreſtan)</hi> hee ſaid to <hi>Grumedan.</hi> I pray you Sir, let mee be carried into one of the Tents: for I feele my ſelfe ſo ill, as it is not poſſible for mee to liue any long while.

                  <p>Sir Knight, if it agreed with your good liking, I would gladly know of whence, and what you are, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing my ſelfe therein the more beholding to you: and ſo much the rather, becauſe a man of your eſteem and merit, ought not to conceale his name among his friends. Lord <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan</hi> (quoth he) you muſt needes pardon me, becauſe I haue ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended the Queene, and theſe Ladies heere preſent this day, as I would not by any means be known, although their excelling beauties were the onely cauſe thereof. For, ſeeing them all ſo faire, my ſences were ſo tranſported, as I ſate gazing on them, not vſing any ſalutation to them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, I entreate you to pray them to pardon me, or elſe to take ſuch ſatisfaction of me, as ſhall be liking to themſelues: then ſend me anſwere to the round Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, where I intend to repoſe my ſelfe all this day.</p>

                  <p>In good faith, anſwered <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan)</hi> I make no doubt of it; for I know you to be ſo loyall, as if all men were of your minde, treaſon or villanie could finde no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment among men, as now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes they doe, and that too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly.</p>

with whom he had ſome parlance, at his arriuall firſt at theſe Tents. Very ioyfull was <hi>Grumedan</hi> of this preſent, becauſe it was wonne from the menacing Romaine, but much more io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So, he conducted the Squire, where the Lady was, to whom he thus ſpake. Faire Lady, the Knight that was this day contemned by you, in too many ſeuerall diſgracefull kindes, onely for carrying ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good opinion of your vanquiſhed Romaines, haue ſent you their foure horſes, and deſires you to beſtow the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Lady ſhaping her anſwere to the Squire, replyed thus. Honeſt Friend, thanke your Maſter, and tell him, he had better pleaſde mee in ſending his owne horſe, then all theſe, conquered againſt my minde.

                  <p>The Squire tooke his leaue of her and <hi>Grumedan,</hi> returning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Maiſter, that awayted his comming, to whom hee recounted all the diſcourſe betweene him and the Lady: whereat <hi>Floreſtan</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heartily. And cauſing them to take thence the conquered Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines Shields, hee tooke his way to the Hermitage, determining to ſtay in no place more then one night, vntill he arriued at the <hi>Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied Iſle;</hi> where hee hoped to finde <hi>Galuanes,</hi> who kept it during the abſence of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and there hee would leaue the Romanes Armes, according as he had formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them.</p>
                  <p>Heere you are to vnderſtand, that ſo ſoone as the Squire parted from the Lady, <hi>Grumedan</hi> went to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> to whom he made knowen, that he who had vanquiſhed her Knights, was <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> brother to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and tolde her (beſide) what tokens hee had ſent.

                  <p>That I doe (quoth ſhee) it is onely out of his hatred to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

whereat he conceiued ſuch diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as hee would very gladly any way contriue his death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſmyling at theſe words vttered by the Queene, replyed: By my faith Madame, if the Emperor were ſo well aduiſed as hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might be, hee hath more reaſon to loue and reſpect him, in ſauing him from the diſhonour that he might there haue falne into, as many more did, that eſſayed thoſe aduentures, yet none but the good Knight <hi>Amadis,</hi> could haue the glory of finiſhing them.</p>

                  <p>So walking vp and downe within the Tent; with a louing embrace, <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſaid. Tell me Sir, I pray you, what haue you done with the Shields you caried hence yeſterday?

And if any other Knights of <hi>Rome</hi> deſire to re-obtaine them, as in reuenge of their fellowes ſhame, they may there alſo compaſſe the meanes, by triall, how well they deſerue at the <hi>Arch of loyall Louers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſpeaking of theſe wordes, the Queene <hi>Sardamira</hi> entred into <hi>Grumedans</hi> Tent: which cauſed <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan</hi> to be ſilent; and meeting her with humble reuerence, fell on his knee to kiſſe her hand. But the Queene ſtayed him by the arme, and raiſing him vp gently from the ground, ſaid, that he was moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily welcome. Madame (quoth he, I haue all my life time bin a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to Ladies: by a much ſtronger obligation (then euer) doe I now ſtand engadged, to imploy my very vttermoſt paines for you, whoſe merit reacheth beyond them all. In good faith Sir, replied the Queene, I muſt needes thanke you, for the great paines you haue taken; and ſeeing you are ſo ready to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, for the fault wherein my Knights haue offended: reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that I ſhould likewiſe pardon you, for any error againſt me or my women.</p>
                  <p>Me thinkes Madame (anſwered <hi>Floreſtan)</hi> that I can feele no paine or trauaile by obeying you: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that your admired beautie doth well deſerue the conduct of a farre better Knight then I am. But in affording me this honour, you bind me to ye, in more then I ſhalbe able to ſatisfie.</p>
                  <p>Let vs breake off this talke, ſaid the Queene, and tell me; ſhall wee now ſet forward on our iourney? When you pleaſe Madame, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Floreſtan.</hi> Firſt, quoth <hi>Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> I hold it meere, to conuey theſe wounded Knights, to a Towne not farre hence, where they may be well attended, vntill they bee able to mount on horſebacke. Let it bee ſo, ſaid ſhe. Then was a goodly white palfray brought her, whereon being ſafely ſeated ſhee ſet onward with her Ladies and Gentlewomen, being guided by <hi>Floreſtan</hi> and <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan,</hi> who entertained the time with ſuch good diſcourſe, as the way ſeemed neither long or tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>Heere I muſt tell yee, that the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> had (long before) heard of the Queenes comming to <hi>Mirefleure,</hi> onely to ſee her, which grieued her very greatly, knowing ſhe would talke with her concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Emperour, whoſe very name was hatefull to her. But when ſhe vnderſtood withall, that <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> came in her company, her ſorrow was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently aſſwaged, hoping to heare (by them) ſome tidings of <hi>Amadis.</hi> And as ſhee was buſied in theſe thoughts, newes came, that they were alighted at the gate; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon ſhepreſently went to welcome them.</p>
                  <p>The Queen <hi>Sardamira</hi> going for-moſt, made a low reuerence to the Princeſſe, with a proffer of kiſſing her hand: but ſhe tooke her by the arme, and ledde her into a goodly Haule, expreſſely prepared for her
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7181:292"/>
entertainment. There they ſate downe each by other, and the two Knights neere vnto them; and as they were in talke together, <hi>Oriana</hi> (perceiuing the Queene <hi>Sardamira</hi> lend an attentiue eare, to a priuate diſcourſe betweene her and <hi>Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan)</hi> ſoftly ſpake thus to <hi>Floreſtan</hi> aſide.</p>
                  <p>In good ſadneſſe Lord <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> it is a very long time ſince wee ſaw you in this Countrie, to my no litle diſcontentment: as well in regard of the good-will I euer bare you, as for the great loſſe many a poore ſoule hath ſuſtayned, who were wont to finde helpe by you, your brother <hi>Amadis,</hi> and many other of your followers. But curſed be they that cauſed this ſo long ſeparation, and I beleeue that I ſpeake it not, but vpon vrgent occaſion: for I know a poore Damoſell, in daunger of diſinheriting, becauſe ſhee hath no man to right the wrong offered her.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Amadis</hi> were heere once againe, and ſo many more as are too farre off abſent: ſhee might well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her ſelfe, that that which is hers in iuſtice, ſhould not ſo eaſily be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her; whereas by reaſon of their abſence, ſhe hath now no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hope or comfort, then onely in death. <hi>Oriana</hi> continuing on theſe ſpeeches, teares iſſued abundantly from her faire eyes, as fore-ſeeing her vnfortunate end, if the King ſhould ſo much forget himſelfe, to deliuer her to the Romanes. And ſhe had ſolemnely vowed betweene God and her ſoule, that ſhe ſhould be no ſooner on Ship-bord, but ſhe would throwe her ſelfe into the Sea, and this was her finall conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>Very well vnderſtood <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> that this cloſe-couched Enigma concerned her ſelfe; whereupon he thus replied. Madame, God being all made of mercy, will neuer bee vnmindefull of them that put their truſt in him: for (as yet) hee neuer did, and doubtleſſe, he will not now beginne with ſo deſolate a Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. As for my Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelfe, that he is in perfect health, continually in queſt of ſtrange aduentures: ſo that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous deeds in farre diſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, renownes his name in all parts of the world,</p>
                  <p>All theſe words were ouer-heard by the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that they ſpake of <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhe ſaid to <hi>Oriana.</hi> God keepe him from the Emperours fingers: for hee is the onely man in the world that he hateth moſt, next to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knight, who ſoiourned ſome while in the Court of King <hi>Taffinor</hi> of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> This Knight I now ſpeake of, not much aboue a yeare ſince, ouer-came (in open field) the moſt gentle Knight <hi>Garadan,</hi> the onely man in all the Romaine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: except the noble Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> who is now come into this Countrie to the King your Father, to conclude a marriage betweene his Lord and you. And hee beares him this hatred, for cauſing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer throw of eleuen other Knights beſide: whoſe hope was to reuenge the iniurie done to their friend on the day following the Combate with the firſt knight, being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo many to ſo many. This miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ſo diſmayed the whole Romaine Armie, that the Emperor was compelled (according to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-made couenant) to raiſe his Campe, and to render back to King <hi>Taffinor,</hi> whatſoeuer he had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from him.</p>
                  <p>Afterward, ſo briefly as ſhe could, the Queene reported, the whole manner of the ſeuerall fights, and to

what iſſue they ſorted, as you haue heard already at large. So helpe me God, Madame, anſwered <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan,</hi> although your Emperour ſhould neuer looue him, yet there are many other worthy men, that wiſhe him all true happineſſe and honour: and (in my poore opinion) Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> needes not care for his malice.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, make knowen to vs (faire Queene) if you can, the name of the man ſo much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by your ſelfe. Vnderſtand Sir, (quoth ſhe) one while he cals him-ſelfe, the Knight with the Greene Sword, and another while, the Knight of the Dwarfe: albeit I am verily perſwaded, that neither the one or the other is his true name indeed. But becauſe hee weares a Sword, that hath a ſcabberd of greene colour, and a Dwarfe doth ordinarily attend on him: theſe names haue therefore beene impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on him, and vſually he makes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to them.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Floreſtan</hi> heard theſe wordes, he was very ioyfull, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a certaintie, that it was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis:</hi> the like did <hi>Oriana,</hi> who had noted the ſame reportes before by many. And becauſe ſhee was now ſome hinderance to her, that ſhe could not haue any longer pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conference; ſhee aroſe, thus ſpeaking to the Queene <hi>Sardamira.</hi> Madame, in regard of your tedious iourney this day, you cannot chuſe but be weary; wherefore a place of repoſe is more conuenient for you. Then ſhee conducted her into a goodly Chamber, and there leauing her to her owne deſſeignes, went downe into the Garden, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with <hi>Mabila</hi> and the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> to whom ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared all her former intelligence, concerning the knight of the Green Sword, whom they knew aſſuredly to be <hi>Amadis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On my faith Madame, ſaid <hi>Mabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> if it be ſo, let mee tell you the Dreame which I had this laſt night paſt. Me thought that wee were in a Chamber cloſe ſhut vp, and that we heard a great tumultuous noiſe without, which made vs feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beyond meaſure: but your <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> ſuddenly comming thither, brake the doore, calling for you out aloud. Then I ſhewing you to him, me thought hee tooke you by the hand, and ſo brought vs forth, placing vs in a very ſtrong Tower, ſaying to vs: Abide heere, without any dread or terror, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I happened to wake. This makes mee verily beleeue, that hee will ſet you at libertie, and free you from their power, that hope to haue you hence.</p>
                  <p>Deare Friend and Couſin, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> you giue mee great hope and comfort; and if I were worthy of ſuch a happineſſe, I could deſire our Lord to heare your good wiſhes: otherwiſe, that wee might both dye in one inſtant. Forbeare ſuch words, replyed <hi>Mabila;</hi> for he that is aboue all fortunes whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, will ſend you (at his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) a better iſſue out of all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, then you can wiſh or imagine. But conferre with <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> and earneſtly deſire him and his friends, to doe their beſt endeauour, to breake the Kings intention, that no ſuch concluſion may paſſe for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
                  <p>Now, let me tell you, that <hi>Galaor</hi> had already done ſo much as was poſſible for him, not by any aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement or entreaty vrged to him on the Princeſſes behalfe: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he plainely perceiued, what ſhame would enſue by diſinheriting <hi>Oriana,</hi> for the aduancement of her
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7181:293"/>
Siſter <hi>Leonora.</hi> For, ſome day or two before <hi>Floreſtans</hi> arriuall at <hi>Mirefleure,</hi> King <hi>Liſuart</hi> being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from hunting, tooke <hi>Galaor</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, as they rode on the way, thus ſpeaking to him. My louing friend, I haue euermore found ſuch fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in you, and repoſed ſuch truſt in your counſell, as I neuer intend to conclude any mater of importance, without imparting it firſt to you. You vnderſtand what honour the Emperour hath done me, and his embaſſage ſo lately ſent me, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to haue my daughter <hi>Oriana</hi> as his wife: wherein (as I conceiue) our Lord hath wrought moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly both for her and me, becauſe he is the onely potent and redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prince, at this day liuing in all Chriſtendome.</p>
                  <p>In which reſpect, hee being thus allied with me, I ſhall neuer haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny neighbour or enemy, that dare preſume any way to offend me, and I ſhalbe more reſpected and drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then euer any King of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> heeretofore hath beene. Moreouer, it is a matter almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to ſeeke any better prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for her; for ſhee being wife to ſo mightie an Emperour, <hi>Leonora</hi> ſhall afterward remaine ſole Lady of my Dominions, which otherwiſe may happen to be diuided, to our no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle detriment and danger. And yet let me tell you, I purpoſe not to doe any thing in this caſe, without the aduice of the Lords and Knights of my Court: but more eſpecially of you, whom I coniure (by the loue and affection you haue alwayes borne me) to tell me freely your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and without any diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Much amazed was <hi>Galaor,</hi> to heare the King vſe ſuch language, perceiuing apparantly heereby, that he meant wholly to diſinherite his eldeſt Daughter and right heire, to aduantage the ſecond. For this cauſe, he ſtood a long while very penſiue, without anſwering ſo much as a word, till the King began again thus to rouſe him. Come Sir, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake your ſilent cogitation, and tell me truely what you think. Sir (quoth he) I beſeech you to hold me excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for I finde my capacitie ouer feeble, to yeeld you any faithfull counſell in a caſe ſo important. Moreouer, you are minded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate the chiefeſt Lords of your Land, to commune with them in ſo ſerious a buſineſſe: and they (no doubt) like loyall ſubjects, will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you as becomes a King. But yet (quoth the King) I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt haue your aduice, elſe you will giue mee cauſe to miſconceite you. God ſhield me Sir, ſaid <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> from ſo doing: rather I will li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally lay my heart open to you, according to mine owne poore iudgment, and the true integrity of my minde.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſaid he, whereas you ſay, that in marrying your Daughter <hi>Oriana</hi> with the Emperour, there remaines no poſſibility of a fairer fortune: ſurely, I am of a quite contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for, ſhe being your principall Heire, and ſent into ſo remote a Country, to loſe a kingdome alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prouided for her, you ſhall leaue her poore without meanes, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to a people, but ſlenderly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with the manners and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of this Nation. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you conceite, that in being wife to an Emperour, and dignified with the name of an Empreſſe, her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and renowne is the ſurer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: before God Sir, let mee plainely tell you, that you wrong both your iudgement and reaſon therein. Fore-thinke what may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, and ſay ſhee haue heires male
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7181:294"/>
by her husband, which is the ſole comfort of any kingdome: ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming a widdow, the firſt fauour her owne childe ſhall doe for her, is, to vrge her retreate, to hold poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Empire by himſelfe. If he take a wife, then it falles out far worſe for her, becauſe the new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe will be ſecond to none, and then it is moſt certaine, that your Princely Daughter lyes open to a thouſand inconueniences, and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoydable grieuous extreamities. For firſt, ſhee hath loſt this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which was certaine to her, as being her naturall place of birth and breeding, to liue in a ſtrange land, farre from parents, ſubiects and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, which is no common kind of affliction.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you alleage, that by his alliance and fauour, you are ſure to be ſuccoured, and much fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Surely Sir, I muſt tell you, that (thankes be giuen to our Lord for it) you haue ſo many true friends, and truſty Knights at your command, as (without any helpe of the Romaines) you may eaſily extend your limites when you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>And I am perſwaded, that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectation of ſupport from them, they will rather ſeeke to ruinate and deſtroy you, then furniſh you with any ſuch aſſiſtance as you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, ſcorning all equality, or any to bee greater then themſelues. Moreouer, it is moſt certaine, that they can couet no better meanes, then by compaſſing ſome apt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to regiſter you downe in their Chronicles, to your ſhame and their glory, vnder the ſhadow of ſome ſleight fauour, irregularly affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; then which, no greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe can happen to you and yours.</p>
                  <p>And alas Sir, what reaſon haue you to ſend the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> ſo farre from you, being your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and chiefeſt Heire, onely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the Princeſſe <hi>Leonora,</hi> who is her yonger Siſter? By my ſoule, of a moſt vpright and vnpartiall King, renowned through the wide world for the Authour of Iuſtice: you will procure the greateſt ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to your reputation, and wound your vntainted honour ſo deepely, as neuer powerfull Prince or King did the like.</p>
                  <p>But I hope that Heauen will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter direct your iudgement, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more ſurer cogitations in your ſoule, which I (as the very meaneſt Knight in your Court) doe hartily deſire. And beleeue it Sir, that I durſt neuer haue beene ſo bold, to tell you the free cenſure of my ſoul, but that you pleaſed ſo expreſſely to command me, and I (as a loyall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant) could doe no leſſe. And let this be your perſwaſion of me, that during my life time, I will keepe my promiſe, faith and fidelity to you, as one that ſtands much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to you, for infinite good turnes and fauors done me.</p>
                  <p>Well declared King <hi>Liſuart</hi> by his countenance, that he was ſcarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed with <hi>Galaors</hi> remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance: and he likewiſe as quickely apprehended it: wherefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing on his ſpeech, he ſaid. Sir, King <hi>Perion</hi> my Father, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded mine attendance on him in <hi>Gaule,</hi> ſo ſoone as poſſibly I can: and becauſe I meane to ſet hence to morow morning, to the end you may not conceiue, but that I haue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled you faithfully; if you bee ſo pleaſed, whatſoeuer I haue ſpoken, I will ſet downe in writing, that you may acquaint them with it, whom you intend to aſſemble together. I pray you doe ſo, anſwered the King. And at theſe wordes, they were
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7181:294"/>
come neere vnto the City, which made them alter their diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Being alighted, the King betook himſelfe to his Chamber, where he ſate downe very ſad and penſiue, and would not all that day be ſeene in any company. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Galaor</hi> tooke ſhipping, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his former determination: for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ould not bee preſent at the reſolution of this mariage, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certainly, that the King would not bee altered from his purpoſe, notwithſtanding all aduice and councell to the contrary. More-ouer, he knew ſome part of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacies betweene <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who all this while remooued not from <hi>Mirefleure,</hi> whither the Queen <hi>Sardamira</hi> came to ſee her, as you haue heard already, finding her to be the onely faireſt Princeſſe in the world. What would ſhee then haue thought, if ſhe had ſeene her in her former condition, before this continuall melancholy ſeized her, for the abſence of her <hi>Amadis,</hi> and this new purpoſe for marriage, which grieuouſly oppreſſed her? Being now ſomewhat meagre, pale and penſiue: yet ſhe appeared, as if Nature had ſtudied all her life-time, to make her the mirrour of choiceſt perfection.</p>
                  <p>The Queene finding the day no way fauourable, to acquaint <hi>Oriana</hi> with the cauſe of her comming, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it till the next morning; when reſorting againe to ſee her; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing firſt heard Maſſe together, they walked along the allies of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and proceeded ſo farre into the buſineſſe, that ſhe told her, how dearely the Emperour affected her, what purſuite he made to enioy her as his wife, and what ſupreme feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city attended her, onely by this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                  <p>But the anſwere of <hi>Oriana</hi> was ſo vntuneable, as the Queene durſt proceede no further with her: but in the interim, <hi>Floreſtan</hi> came to them, who purpoſing to take his leaue, that he might returne to the <hi>Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iſle,</hi> ſhe tooke him aſide, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, what infinite afflictions houre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encompaſſed her, &amp; how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the King her father dealt with her, by compelling her to marry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtraunge Country, and to the onely man of the world, whom ſhe leaſt reſpected.</p>
                  <p>But beleeue it Sir, (quoth ſhe) if he continue in this humour, the firſt newes he ſhall heare of me, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my departure hence, will be my death. For come what may, if he ſunder me from this Country, Death, and the Sea ſhall diuide me alſo.</p>
                  <p>For it is my full intent, to drowne all my diſaſters in the waues: who (for euer) ſhall remaine witneſſes of my ſorrowes, and in them I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to find more compaſſion, then in mine owne kinred, countrie, friendes and ſeruants. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, honourable Lord <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> I humbly beſeech you, (for Gods ſake) to imploy ſome paines for diſſwading him from his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: otherwiſe (vpon my faith) it will be a great clogge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to him, and the very ſtraungeſt miſ-fortune, wherein a poore diſinherited Lady can fall, being forſaken of God and men.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſpeaking, ſhe wept ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, that <hi>Floreſtan</hi> (although he was one of the greateſt ſpirited men in the world) could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from teares, hauing his heart ſo confounded with compaſſion towards her, as hee was not able to vtter a word. Notwithſtanding, at laſt he got the maiſtrie of this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing paſſion, and ſaid. Madame,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7181:295"/>
you ſhall doe me great wrong, if you hold not this conceit of me, that I am wholly yours, ready to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey you in any ſeruice till death. But to ſpeake to the King your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as you would haue me, it is a matter beyond all poſſibility: for you your ſelfe do know, what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred he beares to me, onely in the deſpight of my Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of ſo many high and worthy ſeruices, as both he and all his linage haue euermore done to him. And if he haue receiued any from me, hee neuer needs to thank me for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, I neuer did any for his ſake, but onely by the commaund of him, who hath ſoueraigne power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me, and whom I will not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict at any time. And that was the reaſon, for my being in the laſt warre of the ſeuen Kings, not as any helpe to them of Great <hi>Brittaine:</hi> but onely for preſeruation of your iuſt title and right thereto, as ſhee that ſhall one day, (by Gods leaue) bee Lady and Queene thereof.</p>
                  <p>Preſume alſo Madame, that you haue this intereſt in me, that this which you haue told to mee, I will thinke on and make knowen to King <hi>Perion,</hi> and other good friends, to procure ſome remedy for you in this diſtreſſe. And I make no doubt, but he will prouide for you in ſuch ſort, as you ſhall haue occaſion to reſt contented. Nor purpoſe I to ſoiourne in any place, vntill I come to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> where I ſhall finde the Prince <hi>Agraies,</hi> who is very deſirous to doe you any ſeruice, as your ſelfe doth well know, eſpecially for the loue of his Siſter <hi>Mabila.</hi> There ſhall wee conſult together, what courſe is beſt to be taken in this caſe, without ſpare of any thing remaining in our power. But know you certainely, (quoth <hi>Oriana)</hi> that <hi>Agraies</hi> is, or will be there? Yes Madame, ſaid he, as Lord <hi>Grumedan</hi> hath aſſured me, as hee receiued inſtruction by one of his Squires, that came thence within theſe few dayes. I beſeech you then, replied <hi>Oriana,</hi> to relate vnto him amply, what confidence I do repoſe in him: And if you heare any newes of your Brother <hi>Amadis,</hi> faile not to acquaint me therewith ſo ſoon as poſſibly you may. There-of aſſure your ſelfe Madame, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Floreſtan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With theſe wordes, he tooke his leaue of her, kiſſing her lillie-white hand, and returning to the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> ſpake thus. Madame, I am conſtrained by force to leaue you, and elſe where to ſeeke after my further fortunes: but whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I ſhall beſtow my ſelfe, be bold, that I am alwayes your knight and ſeruant, and ſo I pray you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of me. In good faith Sir, ſaid ſhe, they that refuſe ſo faire an offer, may wel be reputed but poore in iudgment: becauſe I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that you are held to be one of the beſt and moſt courteous knights this day liuing. And God ſhield me from ſuch monſtrous ingratitude, to deny a ſeruant of ſuch honor and worth: rather moſt louingly I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your kindnes, and returne you thankes with all my heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> looking on her with an affectionate eye, and beholding her to be ſo amiably faire, ſaid: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, I beſeech our Lord, (who hath enriched you with ſuch rare beautie) to grant your own hearts beſt deſires: and thankefully I take your moſt gracious anſwere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now I can doe nothing elſe for you, but remaine in ready willingneſſe of ſeruice, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you ſhall pleaſe to commaund me. So taking leaue of her, <hi>Mabila,</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:7181:295"/>
and the other Ladies, he mounted on horſebacke: deſiring Lord <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan,</hi> that if he receiued any ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of <hi>Amadis,</hi> he would let him vnderſtand thereof ſo ſoone as he could, at the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> whether he now went, to ſee <hi>Agraies</hi> and his other aſſociates.</p>

                  <p>Then the Knight with the Greene Sword, beholding the Country, where he hoped to finde his beſt happineſſe and comfort, became exceeding ioyfull. And becauſe he would by no meanes be diſcouered, he deſired <hi>Graſinda,</hi> and all the reſt in his company, to enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle him no other thence-forward, but the Greeke Knight.

Then Maſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> called for a Skiffe, which inſtantly was broght, whereinto they entred: and as they made towards the Shoare, they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied a Ship lying at Anker.

When our Greeke Knight heard ſpeech of the place, whereto he was ſo much affected, and that two of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were there, his heart leapt with ioy; and <hi>Angriote</hi> continuing his queſtions, deſired the Patrone, to cauſe the two Knights to come vp on the Deck, and (in the meane while) to tell him, how they were named. That may not I doe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Patrone, leſt they ſhould grow diſcontented with me; but I will call them vp to you; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his word accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Then they came vp on the Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop; and <hi>Angriote</hi> ſaluting them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, if they knew where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> lay? Truſt me Sir, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one of them, wee will gladly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you in any thing we can; but firſt we would entreate you, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue vs in one matter (if it conſiſt in your power) for which wee haue vndertaken this voyage, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not to ſoiourne in any place, vntill wee can be therein ſatisfied. If wee know it, ſaid <hi>Angriote,</hi> you may be well aſſured, that we will not conceale it from you.</p>
                  <p>Sir Knights, (quoth the other) haue you heard any newes of a Knight, named <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> in ſearch of whom, many of his friends haue endured much paines and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and haue left few places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enquirie?</p>
                  <p>Theſe wordes did ſo touch our Greeke Knight with ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, that hee could not refraine from teares: conſidering, what affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo many worthy men did beare him, and what ſorrowes they ſuffered for his ſake. Firſt tell me, ſaid <hi>Angriote,</hi> what, and who you are, and afterward, you ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſo much as I know. Then the other, who (all this while) had bin ſilent, ſtepping forward, ſaid: Such as know me, call me <hi>Dragonis,</hi> and this my companion is named <hi>Enill,</hi> both reſolued to ore-run the whole Ocean, and queſtion Port by Port, vntill we finde the men wee ſpeake of. Gentlemen (quoth <hi>Angriote,)</hi> God be your ſpeed, and for your ſakes, I will gladly enquire of our Shippes, wherein are ſtraungers of many Nations, what they can ſay to this demand of yours. Our Greeke knight vrged him to this anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee would not be knowen ſo ſoone, <hi>Angriote</hi> then began again, ſaying: I pray you Sir, where may we finde King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and what newes is in his Court? Sir, anſwered <hi>Dragonis,</hi> he is now in a certain Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his, called <hi>Tagades,</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Port of the Sea, confronting <hi>Normandie.</hi> And there is a great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of his knights, ſitting in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, about a motion made by the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> to enioy his Daughter <hi>Oriana</hi> in mariage, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no one will giue conſent. Alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy there are arriued many Romanes to conuey her thence with them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom is the Prince <hi>Saluſta Quide,</hi> Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> &amp; other the greateſt Lords of the Empire, beſide a worthy traine of Ladies and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen; and ſhee is (already)
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7181:296"/>
called Empreſſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> But ſhe mournes inceſſantly; for it is much againſt her mind, that this marriage ſhould be ſo much as talked of.</p>
                  <p>We may well imagine, that this was more then Greek to our Greek Knight: for neuer was man ſtrooken into ſuch an aſtoniſhment; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, vnderſtanding the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grates and grieuances of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. Notwithſtanding, his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits recouering chearefull vigour, and being reſolued withall, that it was quite againſt her conſent, and contrary to the liking of the Lords of Great <hi>Brittaine:</hi> hee might the more eaſily helpe her by Sea or Land, wherein hee would not faile the very meaneſt Gentle-woman in the world. Much greater duty then he owed to her, without whoſe grace and fauour hee could not liue one houre, as he was verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his ſoule. And highly than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God, for vouchſafing his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall in a time ſo opportune, that hee might doe her any ſeruice. As not doubting but to compaſſe the height of his attempt, (getting her into his power, and without any blame by her) and to ouercome all his misfortunes together. And here (in his ſoule) he read a lecture to his Ladie, diſcourſing his bitter ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and languiſhments, the paines and perils by him endured, ſince the time he ſaw her laſt, and now, the cataſtrophe of all contentment, after a more then Herculean labour.</p>
                  <p>Now, ſaid <hi>Angriote</hi> to <hi>Dragonts,</hi> you are ſure that the Romaines are already come about this buſineſſe? On my faith (quoth he) it is yet but foure dayes, ſince wee parted from the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> &amp; on the very ſame day, there arriued <hi>Quedragant, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> his Nephew, <hi>Garnate</hi> of the <hi>Dreadfull Dale, Mandacian</hi> of the <hi>Siluer Bridge,</hi> and <hi>Helye</hi> the <hi>Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> who came to know of <hi>Floreſtan</hi> &amp; <hi>Agraies,</hi> when they ſhould begin the queſt of <hi>Amadis de Gaule.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Quedragant</hi> purpoſed to ſend to the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to vnderſtand there ſome tidings by ſtrangers: <hi>Floreſtan</hi> made him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that it wold be but loſt labor, in regard, that himſelfe had made the like queſtion, &amp; could know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But wee heard by one of his Squires, that there happened ſome difference between them, which he corrected in ſuch ſort, as he is much commended in all places for it. I pray you Sir (quoth <hi>Angriote)</hi> tel vs, what is that <hi>Floreſtan?</hi> He is (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Dragonis)</hi> one of the ſons of king <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth the goodnes and worth of his two other brethren.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, at large he recited the contention between him &amp; the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, in preſence of the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> &amp; how his Squire (after-ward) came to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle</hi> with their Shields, wheron (in bloody ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters) was written each mans name. And becauſe they were ſo ſhreudly handled by <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> the Queene ſent after to entreate him to be her conduct to <hi>Mirefleure,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhee went to ſee the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana.</hi> Theſe newes were highly pleaſing to the Greeke Knight &amp; his aſſociates, neuertheleſſe, when he heard him name <hi>Mirefleure:</hi> his hart began to tremble, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring what delight and pleaſure hee had there ſomtime receiued. Wherfore, with-drawing himſelf aſide, he called <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi> to him, ſaying. My friend <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> thou heareſt (as wel as I) theſe tidings concerning <hi>Oriana,</hi> &amp; doeſt know withal, that if they ſhould take effect I could not liue one houre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: therefore let me preuaile with thee, to doe one thing which I will aduiſe thee, and this it is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:7181:297"/>
Goe thou with <hi>Ardan,</hi> to <hi>Graſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and tell her, that you two, (with theſe other Knights heere preſent) will trauaile to finde out <hi>Amadis de Gaule.</hi> Being come to the Knights, ſecretly tell them, that I am heere, and deſire them (with thee) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle.</hi> Finding there <hi>Quadragant,</hi> and <hi>Agrayes,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate them from me, to keep them-ſelues there together, vntil the time of my arriuall, which ſhall be (by Gods helpe) within eight dayes, little more or leſſe. Say alſo to my Brother <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> and to thy father <hi>Gandales,</hi> that I would haue them to take order, for prouiding ſo many Shippes, and other Veſſels in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, as they can procure. For I purpoſe to be ſeene (ſhortly) in a place, where (if they be ſo pleaſed) I would gladly requeſt their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and thou knoweſt ſufficiently <hi>Gandalin:</hi> what diligence is required in a caſe ſo important as this is; wherefore, once more I deſire thee, not to bee ſlow or tardie heerein. Then he called the Dwarfe to him, and ſaid: <hi>Ardan,</hi> goe with <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and follow thoſe inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he ſhall giue thee from mee.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Gandalin,</hi> according to his Maſters commaund, went to <hi>Graſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> in this maner. Madame, quoth he, we two are determined to leaue the Greeke Knight, and goe abord this Shippe, becauſe wee would tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile along with theſe two Knights, in the ſearche for <hi>Amadis de Gaule.</hi> Therefore, good Madame, conſider with your ſelfe, if you haue any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to comand vs: returning you moſt humble thankes, for your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold fauours done vs, without any merite at all on our behalfe. The like they ſaid to the Greeke Knight, <hi>Angriote</hi> and <hi>Brunco;</hi> and ſo went aboorde the Shippe to <hi>Dragonis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heere I muſt tell ye, that <hi>Angri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> was made acquainted with this intention: wherefore, to palliate and conceale it the more cleanely, he called to <hi>Dragonis,</hi> ſaying: Sir Knight, this Squire and Dwarfe are deſirous to keepe you company, in your queſt of <hi>Amadis de Gaule:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as themſelues ſay) they ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſerued him. <hi>Dragonis</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nili</hi> knew them immediatly, which made them the more willing to accept their company, entertaining them with very kinde and louing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: but much more welcome were they, when they vnderſtood what <hi>Gandalin</hi> tolde them, which made them weigh Anker preſently, and ſet on towards the <hi>Encloſed Iſle.</hi> The like did our Greeke Knight and his company, hoping that day to take harbour, in the neereſt Hauen to <hi>Tagades,</hi> where (as then) King <hi>Liſuart</hi> kept his Court.</p>
                  <p>Heere were aſſembled with him, moſt of the worthieſt Lords in his kingdome, whom purpoſely he had called together, to conclude the marriage of his Daughter <hi>Oriana</hi> with the Emperour. But they, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the good and welfare of the Realme, as it became loyall and true Counſellers to doe, were all of a quite contrary opinion, ſhewing him by many ſound and probable reaſons, that hee went againſt all right and equitie, committing his chiefe Heire, into the ſubiection of a preſumptuous and giddie-headed ſtranger, who (as they approued by precedent examples) might as quickly grow in hatred to her, as he was haire-brained in his ouer-ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den affection. All which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanding, the King would not liſten to, but alleage ſtill ſuch perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie reaſons, meete and conuenient for ſuch a Prince, as will allow nor like any aduice but his owne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:7181:297"/>
In which regard, Count <hi>Arga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> abſented himſelfe from this meeting, to a Caſtell of his owne, which was ſome two dayes iourney from the Court: notwithſtanding, he was ſent for againe and againe, and ſo much importuned, as he was brought thither in a Litter, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo weake and impotent by age, as hee was not able to ſit on horſe-backe.</p>
                  <p>The King being aduertiſed of his comming neere the Court, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on horſebacke to meet him, and the next day hee ſate in councell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Lords, deliuering diuers conſiderations, for maintenance of his former opinion, till at length (ſpeaking to <hi>Argamont)</hi> thus hee ſaid. Honorable Vncle, you are ſufficiently acquainted with the occaſion, why I haue called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this great aſſembly, which plainly is, for mariage of my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> a matter by him moſt earneſtly labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and deſired. Wherefore, let mee entreate you firſt, to tell mee what you conceite thereof: to the end, that theſe Lords may the more freely afterward, acquaint mee with their ſeuerall opinions. A long while the old Earle excuſed him-ſelfe, till being vrged thereto by the Kings expreſſe commaund, after ſome alligations for his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, he ſpake as followeth.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, ſeeing it is your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that I ſhould ſpeak my minde in this noble aſſembly, concerning the Emperours marriage with the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana:</hi> I moſt humbly beſeech you, to receiue in good part what I ſhall ſay. I know it to be treaſon in as high a degree, to diſſemble with a Prince in matter of good counſell, as otherwiſe to offend againſt his royall perſon: and therefore, without any clouding or diſſembling, credit what I ſpeake in my poore aduice, albeit I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten enough told it you before. Sir, you know, that Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> (your eldeſt Daughter) ought to ſucceede you, and by iuſt reaſon, is heire to the Countries, which God and Fortune hath giuen to your charge; whereto, by the right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe hath more true title, then euer you had, or could pretend. For it fell to you, onely by the death of King <hi>Falaugris,</hi> who was but your Brother, and ſhee is your owne Daughter, and the eldeſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſider with your ſelfe, that if the like had beene done to you, which now you purpoſe to the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> you could not haue bin (at this day) ſo great a Lord as you are.</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould you exile her (as it were) hence, to plant my Niece <hi>Leonora</hi> in her place, conſidering, ſhee neuer offended you, to our knowledge? And if you thinke, that by marrying her to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Patin,</hi> you ſhall thereby make her a greater Princeſſe, and moſt happily prouided for in your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: Beleeue me my Lord, you come very farre ſhort of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. For you are not ignorant, that if they haue children together, ſhe ſuruiuing the Emperour, ſhall but ſimply remaine Dowager of <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſteed of being (after you) Lady and Queene of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>Nay, which is much more, doe you thinke that your Subiects will euer agree thereto? I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in my ſoule, if they ſhould ſay, yea, it were againſt the Religion of their ſoules. And therefore, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen fore-fend, that I ſhould tell you otherwiſe, then my conſcience aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures me to be true: albeit I know (to my no litle griefe) that, let vs alleage
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7181:298"/>
whatſoeuer we can, you will be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernde by your own fancie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moſt humbly I deſire you, to pardon what I haue ſaid, being compeld thereto by your ſeuere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, againſt which may bee no gain-ſaying.</p>
                  <p>Then he ſate ſilent, and the King gaue order, that euery man ſhould deliuer his minde: but they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the opinion of Count <hi>Argamont,</hi> which the King percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, he thus replyed: My Lords, I haue fully vnderſtood your ſeueral iudgements: all which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, how can I (with mine honour) reuocate what I haue already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Emperours Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours? Therein (quoth the Count and the reſt) you may doe as you pleaſe, for wee haue diſcharged our dutie.</p>
                  <p>By this time, the day being faire, and the Sea calme, our Greeke Knight and his company coaſting along: the Mariners had deſcryed the mountaine, whereof the Towne <hi>Tagades</hi> tooke his name; and where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> as then reſided, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath bin related. Some of them alſo went to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her, that if the winde chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not, they would land her in the Hauen within an houre, or leſſe: and our Knights walking aloft on the Deck of the Shippe, declared them-ſelues thankfull to our Lord, for eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping ſuch infinite perils and ſhip-wrackes, as euery minute was inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them.</p>
                  <p>But whoſoeuer had the greateſt cauſe of contentment, was farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in ioy to our Greek Knight, who ſince hee ſet eye on the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wherein liued all his hope, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and ſupport of life, was ſo delighted in his ſoule, as no mans felicity could be anſwerable to his: neither had he power to looke off that long-wiſhed land. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, fearing left his folly ſhould be too plainly perceiued, he went downe into the Ship, and going to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Madame, wee are now (as your ſelfe may ſee) at the place which you ſo much deſired, and where I hope (by the perfection of beautie abyding in you) to attaine the full iſſue of mine enterpriſe: ſo that you ſhall ſafely returne home into your Country, with ſuch honour as is iuſtly due to you. For right and reaſon being both on my ſide. God (who is a moſt vpright Iudge) will wholly maintaine the cauſe for you and me.</p>
                  <p>Now, albeit <hi>Graſinda</hi> ſtood in ſome doubt of her ſucceſſe; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing ſhee was come ſo neere to the point, where ſhee muſt either winne or loſe what ſhe much coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhee made a manifeſt ſhew of a reſolued aſſurance, anſwering the Knight in this manner. Beleeue me Sir, my hope and perſwaſion is greater in your manhood and good fortune, then all the beautie remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in me.</p>
                  <p>But one thing let mee moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreate you, that when you are in the chiefeſt heate of your buſines, you would fixe before your eyes, that you neuer attempted any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, but you brought it to a full and finall effect. In ſo doing, your renowne will highly enlarge it ſelfe, and my ioy likewiſe, whereby I may the more iuſtly ſtile my ſelfe, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy Lady now liuing.</p>
                  <p>It is very expedient (replied our Greeke Knight) that we now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is to be done. You haue a Gentle-woman attending on you, who hath a quicke and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue ſpirit, being named <hi>Goniſeſa,</hi> and ſhe ſpeakes French very perfectly: we will deliuer her a Letter, which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7181:298"/>
ſhee ſhall preſent to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and his Queene <hi>Briſena,</hi> who doe (both of them) well vnderſtand, and ſpeake that language. Expreſſe charge muſt bee giuen to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, that ſhe make no anſwer to any queſtion demaunded of her, but in <hi>French</hi> onely. After ſhe hath concluded with them, hee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne hither againe to vs, becauſe we purpoſe to ſtay in this place for her comming backe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Graſinda</hi> liked this motion excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well; wherefore, without any longer delay, the Gentlewoman was called, and the Letter giuen her: then ſhee entred into a ſmall Barke, with her father, and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knights, that were her bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Not much differing from the ſame inſtant, the Greeke knight gaue order to <hi>Laſinde, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neoes</hi> Squire, to follow after her, (without her knowledge thereof) for a more certaine obſeruation of her entertainment in the Court, and what ſpeeches ſhould bee vſed to her, after her leaue taken of the King.</p>
                  <p>And the better to colour his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there, hee had expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to pretend a diligent inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his Maſter, ſaying to ſuch as demaunded any newes concerning him, that he ſaw him not, ſince hee left him ſicke in <hi>Gaule,</hi> when he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-tooke the queſt of <hi>Amadis,</hi> meaning to returne to him againe, ſo ſoone as he could.</p>
                  <p>So departed <hi>Laſinde,</hi> hoping right well to accompliſh his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. Soone after, the Gentle-woman arriued at the Town, where ſhe was heedfully obſerued by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, as well in regard of her beautie, as for her commendable manner of attendance. Paſſing from ſtreete to ſtreete, enquiring where ſhee might finde the King: ſhee chanced to meete <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> with two Merlinson his fiſt, which he was going to flye in the field. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Gentle-woman making towards him, went and met her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding if ſhee would command him any ſeruice. Faire youth (quoth ſhe) I ſeeke for the Kings lodging, whither I pray you to be my guide. That will I Lady (quoth he) and gladly ſhall I ſhew it you, if you do not know it. A thouſand thankes ſweete youth, anſwered the Gentle-woman.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Eſplandian</hi> tooke hold on the reines of her Palfray, and ſerued her as a Squire, leading her Palfray to the Palace, where after ſhe was diſmounted, hee conducted her to the King, whom they found walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Gallerie, with the chiefeſt Ambaſſadours of <hi>Rome,</hi> according for the marriage of his Daughter to the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The Gentle-woman falling on her knees before him, humbly ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with theſe words. Sir, if it might ſo pleaſe you, that the Queen and all her Ladies were here in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, I ſhould then deliuer a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to you, from her that hath ſent me hither to you. And if it ſo fall out, that any of them doe finde her ſelfe intereſſed, by ſuch matter as I am to let them all vnderſtand: ſhe muſt eſſay (if ſhe thinke good) to finde out one to defend her, againſt a good knight, who purpoſeth to be heere very ſpeedily: prouided, that your Maieſty do graunt him ſafe conduct.</p>
                  <p>Truely Damoſell, anſwered the King, wee will not hinder you in your charge. Whereupon, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly he ſent Count <hi>Argamont,</hi> his Vnkle, and <hi>Arban,</hi> king of <hi>North-wales,</hi> for the Queene, who ſtayed not long but came thither with her Ladies. Then the ſtrange Gentle-woman,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7181:299"/>

                  <p>Before God (quoth the King) the Lady muſt needes be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary faire, and the knight bold and valiant, that vndertakes ſo great an enterpriſe: the end whereof will not be eaſie in the attayning, becauſe ſuch fortunes are full of danger, and opinions (in this caſe) as diuers. Notwithſtanding, Damoſell and faire friend, you may returne when you pleaſe; and while we attend for your Ladies arriuall heere: ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhall bee publiſhed according to her owne deſire; and if ſhee finde none to gain-ſay her challenge for beauty, ſheeſhall (in my minde) haue the accompliſhment of her
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7181:299"/>
owne deſires. Sir, replyed the Gentlewoman, you ſpeake like a good and gracious King, as euer-more you haue bin eſteemed. The Greeke Knight hath two Knights more in his company, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined likewiſe to combate for the loue of their Ladies, againſt all ſuch as dare encounter with them, and they deſire alſo ſecurity from your Highnes, for their ſafe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and returning. Faire friend, anſwered the King, you ſhall haue all that you can requeſt, and I am well pleaſed that it ſhould bee ſo.</p>
                  <p>Sir then (quoth ſhe) reſt your ſelfe aſſured, that you ſhall ſee them all here to morrow morning, in the company of her, who thinkes her ſelfe to be the onely beauty in the world. Wherefore Madame (ſaid ſhe to the Queene,) cauſe your choyceſt Ladies, to put on their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt accoutrements, and not to forget any thing that may illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their perfections, if they hope to gaine any glory from her.</p>
                  <p>So, taking her leaue, ſhe mounted on her Palfray, and returned direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame way ſhe came; where finding the Barke awayting for her, ſhe went aboord, and had the winde ſo fitting for her, that ſhe was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Graſinda,</hi> to whom at large ſhee reported, all that had paſſed betweene King <hi>Liſuart</hi> and her, who had graunted all that ſhe requeſted. Hereupon, the Greeke knight was minded to haue their Tents and Pauilions forth-with erected ſo neere to the Towne as might be; and therefore concluded, that both he and all his company would goe on land the day following. But heere I muſt tell ye, that ſo ſoone as the Damoſell meſſenger was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Court, the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> who had bin preſent at the whole conference, and heard what anſwere was made her, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forth with other Romaine Knights, and falling on his knee before the King, ſaide as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>Sir, we that are Romaines, and ſtrangers here in your Country, do moſt humbly beg one boone, which we muſt needs craue of your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, redounding highly to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and benefit. Truely Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the King, there is no reaſon then, that it ſhould be denyed you. All of them gaue him moſt hearty thankes, and then the Prince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on thus. Let it then bee pleaſing to your Highnes, that we ſtrangers may maintaine the cauſe for ſo many faire Maides, as are here preſent in your Court. And if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen be as fauourable to vs, as equity and reaſon ſhall ſhew themſelues gracious in our attempt: we make no doubt, but to effect this buſines much better, then any of your Knights can doe, becauſe our long acquaintance with the Greeks man-hood, hath ſufficiently inſtructed vs, how to deale with them, being men commonly ouercome by vs, as our manifold encounters can well witneſſe, and their very name ſhall more renowne our chiualry, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny effect whatſoeuer can enſue by them, to the men of this Country, although they were all to grapple with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Grumedan</hi> hearing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Romane, and with what audaciouſnes he ſpake, could not endure it, but riſing vp, thus hee ſaid to the King. Albeit Sir, it is very high honour to Princes, when ſuch ſtrange aduentures happen in their Courts, whereby their renown and magnificence may be the more augmented: yet notwithſtanding, many times they returne to their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7181:300"/>
ſcandall and diſgrace, if they be not embraced with ſuch diſcretion and reuerence, as is euer more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in all potent Kings. I ſpeake theſe words Sir, for the Greeke Knight, who is ſo lately come into your land, vnder hope of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſuch matters as hee hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted you withall: wherein if he ſhall preuaile, and conquer them that would contend againſt him, though the danger will be theirs, yet the ſhame and diſhonour muſt be yours. Wherefore, if you were ſo pleaſed, all ſhould be deferred till the comming of <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Noran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,</hi> who will be heere within foure or fiue daies, as I am credibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſome Knights that haue ſeene them. And by that time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Guillan</hi> the Penſiue will be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and able to beare Armes: which (in mine opinion) would fall out better for you, becauſe they are meeteſt men to confront any challenger, and to defend the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and reputation of your Court, with all the beauties therein aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                  <p>The King ſuddenly ſtarting vp, replied. This may not be graunted, becauſe my promiſe is already paſt to the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> and theſe other Gentlemen his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who muſt be the protectours of our beſt beauties, and are able to anſwere a more high and daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enterpriſe, then this is or can be. It may be ſo, ſaid <hi>Grumedan:</hi> but I am well aſſured, that none of our Ladies or Damoſells will conſent thereto. Let it ſuffice then (quoth the King) that I will graunt to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe for them, then as alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die I haue determined, and my word paſt for it. Hereupon, <hi>Saluſte Quide</hi> thanking the king moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Grumedan,</hi> ſaying. Lord <hi>Grumedan,</hi> you may ſay what pleaſe you: neuertheleſſe, I hope to winne the honor for theſe Ladies, and to ouercome the Greek Knight in Combate, of whom you make ſo great account. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are two other Knights in his company, of no leſſe valour and proweſſe then hee, as I am gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vnderſtand: I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Combat againſt them, and you if you haue any wil to take their part: prouided, that two of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions may ioyne with mee. By this meanes it will be apparantly diſcerned, to whom the honour of victory ſhall fall: the fight being equall, of three Romaines, againſt two Greekes and a Knight of great Brittaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſmiling at the Princes pride, returned this anſwer. It were ſhame for me to make refuſall, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I accept your offer I, and thoſe two that ſhall take my part. Thus ſpeaking, he drew a Ring from off his finger, and making a low reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the King, ſaid. Behould Sir, here is my gage, which moſt humbly I beſeech you to receiue, on the behalfe of mee and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; as in iuſtice you can doe little leſſe, the Prince <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſte</hi> hauing challenged the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, as you your ſelfe haue heard; otherwiſe, hee muſt either vnſay his words, or yeeld him ſelfe van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. By God, ſaid <hi>Saluſte,</hi> ſooner ſhall the Seas be dryed vp, then the word of a Romaine be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, or the leaſt iniury done to his honour. And I doe much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile <hi>Grumedan,</hi> that you dare ſpeak words ſo voyd of reaſon: but if age haue made your ſences faile you, your body muſt iuſtly pay the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in combate, for ſpeeches ſo indiſcreetly deliuered. Surely Sir, anſwered <hi>Grumedan,</hi> I am yet yong enough, to bring mine enterpriſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7181:300"/>
to a good iſſue, and to gaine that from you, which you imagine to get ouer-eaſily from me. And let me plainly tell you, that mine age hath taught me more experience, then euer, young pride or preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could learne, as I hope is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſeene in you, by the proud perſwaſion you haue of your ſelfe, who rather appeares to be a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Braggards<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, then a man to performe any matter indeed.</p>
                  <p>With theſe words aroſe vp King <hi>Arban,</hi> &amp; more then thirty Knights beſide, to take the cauſe in hand, &amp; to maintaine what <hi>Grumedan</hi> had ſpoken: but the King impoſed ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on them, commanding them (on perill of their liues) not to vſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymore ſuch words in his preſence. Whereupon, euery man departed to his lodging, leauing Count <hi>Arga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> alone with the king, to whom he ſpake in this manner. Sir, haue you not obſerued the audacious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of theſe Romanes, and how vnreuerently they dare abuſe the knights of your Court? In your own iudgement, they that are ſo malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert here, what will they not doe in other places? In good faith Sir, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they declare ſo litle diſcretion, I greatly feare their behauiour to the Princoſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> euen ſo ſoone as you ſhall haue loſt ſight of her. And yet notwithſtanding (as I hear) you haue already giuen them your grant for her, which makes mee to meruaile not a little, whence this ſtrange fancie in you ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, conſidering, that neuer did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prince (ſo wiſe and &amp; iudicious as you haue alwayes bin eſteemed) ſo far forget himſelf, wherby plainly appeareth, that you are deſirous to tempt your own good fortune, &amp; to let looſe the reines of diuers diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, very ominous to this whole kingdome. Haue you forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what eſpeciall graces our Lord hath (in a maner) heaped vpon you? And doe you not ſtand in feare of his anger? Fortune, is not ſhe mutable? Are you now to learne, that when ſhee growes weary of good turns to him whom ſhe hath exalted, ſhe wil cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe him afterward with many ſtripes, yee, with ſuch cruel tortures, as are a thouſand times worſe then death? Pardon me Sir, I beſeech you, if the faith I beare you, haue made me thus bold; to ſpeake ſuch words, as (perhaps) you like not: you are not ignorant, how tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the matters of this world are, and that all the renowne &amp; glory, which by long and tedious trauell can bee gotten in this life, is oftentimes quenched and quite buried, vpon a very ſmall occaſion, if Fortune doe but once diſtaſte the perſon. So that if any remembrance remaine of a mans former felicity, this blame will only liue vpon him, that hee did not make vſe of his precedent happines, but rather entertayned it with an idle and negligent reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Pauſing here a while, and hearing the King to returne no anſwere, hee began againe thus. Sir, doe but thinke on the fault you ſometime fell into, by baniſhing ſo many good Knights farre hence, as <hi>Amadis,</hi> his brethren, kinred and friendes, by whom you were feared, honoured and reſpected euery-where. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarcely freed from this miſhap, will you voluntarily fall into a worſe? Vndoubtedly I muſt needes imagine, that God and all good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe hath forſaken you, becauſe you haue firſt forſaken him. For, if it were otherwiſe, you would accept the counſell of them, that deſire to liue no longer, then in loue &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruice to you. But ſeeing what I doe, I am content to diſcharge the homage and duty I owe you,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7181:301"/>
and with-draw my ſelfe into mine owne territories: becauſe I will auoyde (ſo much as poſſibly I may) the iuſt complaints and teares of your Daughter <hi>Oriana,</hi> at ſuch time as you deliuer her, according to your promiſe, and the manifold miſeries that will enſue thereon, to your diſhonour, and woefull ouer-throw of this famous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme.</p>
                  <p>Vncle, replied the King, that which is done, is done, were I to dye, I will not falſifie my word. But I pray you to abide heere two or three dayes longer, to ſee what iſſue theſe new-attempted Combats will ſort vnto: becauſe I elect you as Iudge of theſe exploytes, with ſuch beſide as your ſelf ſhal make choyſe of. Heerein you ſhall yeeld mee great contentment, and ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice as cannot be more acceptable, becauſe we haue no one heere, that vnderſtandeth the Greeke language better then you doe. Sir (quoth Count <hi>Argamont)</hi> ſeeing ſuch is your pleaſure, farre be it from me to contradict it: yet vnder this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that afterward, you will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with my departure; for it will be impoſſible for me to abide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch grieuous mournings, as muſt needs ſucceed this hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So breaking off their diſcourſe, by reaſon of the Prince <hi>Saluſte Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> comming: Count <hi>Argamont</hi> with-drew himſelfe, leauing the King and Prince in priuate confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Now, we may not bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of <hi>Laſinde,</hi> the Squire to <hi>Don Bruneo,</hi> who compaſſed ſo good meanes, that he attained to true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, of all matters and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſince the Damoſell-Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers departure. Wherefore, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the night faſt haſtening on, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly he left the Court, and made his ſpeedy paſſage by Boate to the Greeke knight, whom he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Prince <hi>Saluſtes</hi> requeſt to the King, the anſwere of <hi>Don Grumedan,</hi> and all things elſe in their due proceeding. This fell out to his no little comfort; and ſo much the rather, becauſe now hee knew he ſhould meddle with none but Romanes: whereas he feared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that either his brother <hi>Galaor,</hi> or ſome other as worthy a Knight of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> would ſteppe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his place on the Ladies behalfe. And then hee knew too well, that neuer could the fight be ended, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without his death, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his deareſt friends, or (it might be) of both together. But theſe doubts being ſomewhat aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged, he thought the time ouer long, till hee was at the combate; whereupon hee ſaid to <hi>Graſinda.</hi> Madame, if you bee ſo pleaſed, to morrow morning wee will earely heare Maſſe in our Pauilions, and then take our way towardes King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> with ſuch attendants as you ſhall appoint: and I make no queſtion, but (by the helpe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen) you ſhall obtaine your long-wiſhed deſire.

Wherefore by breake of day the next morning, they were conueyed aſhoare, with the company appointed to attend vpon them: and after they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly heard Maſſe, they all moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on horſebacke, ſhaping their courſe to the Towne of <hi>Tagades,</hi> where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> with his Lords, exſpected their arriuall.

                     </gap> long before conquered for her, in the manifeſtation of her beauty.</p>
                  <p>Cloſe by her ſide rode the Greeke Knight, in very honourable equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, hauing on a rich Armour co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with a coate of Armes of his owne colours. Next to him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Brunco,</hi> bearing a Shield of Sinople, in the midſt whereof was figured a faire Damoſell, with a Knight on his knees before her, as ſeeming to require mercy and fauor of her, his Armour being all ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wauie with gold. By him rode <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griose,</hi> mounted on a gallant Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, armed likewiſe with a coſtly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, all thicke ſeamed ouer with flowres of gold: and he guided the Damoſell, that had bin Meſſenger to king <hi>Liſuart</hi> the day before. In this manner came <hi>Graſinda,</hi> to the place appointed by the King for this buſines, in the midſt wherof was raiſed a ſquare baſe of black marble, containing the height of a man; wherupon, he that intended to enter the Combat, was to fixe either his Helmet, Shield, Gauntlet, or elſe ſome greene branch. The Greeke knight looking on all ſides about him, beheld the King, and many knights of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> but moſt he obſerued the Prince <hi>Saluſt Quide,</hi> in an Armor thick ſeamed with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, which made him ſeeme ſo great of ſtature, and being mounted alſo on a Horſe of huge aduantage, that he appeared to be a Giant. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liſting vp his eies, he ſaw the Queen, &amp; a faire troup of Ladies about her, each one wearing a rich Crowne on her head. But he could not ſee there his <hi>Oriana,</hi> which beganne to touch him ſomewhat in ſoule: wherefore he turned head to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her eye fixed on the Prince <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſte Quide,</hi> he could eaſily gather thereby, that ſhe was in great doubt of her ſucceſſe, when ſmiling to him ſelfe, he thus ſpake to her.

                  <p>Then the Knight took the Crown which ſhe woare on her head, and ryding gently toward the ſquare baſe, placed it thereon: afterward, returning to his Squire, who had three mighty ſtrong Launces (each hauing a little Penon at the point, enriched with faire flottes of fine gold,) and taking which of them he beſt liked, rode afterward to the King, ſpeaking thus to him in the Greeke tongue.

Know that I am a knight of a ſtrange Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as my outward appearance makes manifeſt to you, and I by commaund of the Lady (who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath power ouer me) am come into this Country, to approue my fortune againſt the knights of your Court, ſo great is their fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne in all places. But for ought I can perceiue, my intent is wholly fruſtrated, and you haue graunted that to Romanes, which I deſired of your owne.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing it is ſo, and that it may bee none otherwiſe: may it ſtand with your Highnes liking (without any further waſte of time) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him that firſt intends the combat, to take the Ladies Crown, whoſe cauſe hee meaneth to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and to place it on the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rrou,</hi> according as alreadie I haue done mine.</p>
                  <p>Hauing ſpoken theſe words, hee gaue the ſpurre to his Courſer, and made him bound, curuet and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere ſo dexteriouſly before them, and with ſuch a commendable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing performance, as euery eye took delight to behold him, with no meane praiſes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Afterward, hauing attained the length of the field, hee turned with an extraordinary gallant grace, exſpecting who durſt firſt preſent himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Now, the King knew not what all this while had beene ſpoken to him, becauſe he vnderſtood not the Greeke language: wherfore Count <hi>Argamont,</hi> who ſtood neer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt to him, interpreted all that had beene ſaid, with this addition of his owne. In good faith Sir, quoth he, it would highly pleaſe me, to ſee the ouer-daring pride of the Romanes, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle qualified by this Grecian knight. Before God, anſwered the king, wee ſhall annon behold one of the ſtear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt encounters, that euer was ſeene in this land: for I perceiue the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> already is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Liſts. And to ſpeake truely, he aduanced himſelfe very proudly, enuious and much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to heare what praiſes were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally giuen of the Greeke knight, which made him rate and reuile the people, crying out againſt them, ſaying: Fye on ye fooliſh ſottes, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, and beetle headed Brittaines, what mooues you to this ſenceleſſe admiration, of a blockiſh paltrie companion, that ſhewes all the wit and courage he hath, in tormenting a poore horſe vpon no occaſion? Before God, if he were a man of any wiſdom, he would make more ſpare of him, for the better defending him ſelfe againſt me, or elſe for his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier flight, before he be therto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. Alas poore ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you expreſſe your great want of knowledge, concerning the name of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7181:302"/>
a Romaine, who is ſo dreaded throughout all the Eaſt, as there is no Greeke Knight ſo hardie and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturous, that dare contend with a Knight of <hi>Rome.</hi> Alas, I ſee the death of this miſerable vnfortunate fellow, whom I ſhal ſo boyſterouſly ouer-throw at the firſt blow, that the very reines of his backe will flye in ſunder: and not onely the Crowne muſt be my boory, but the glorious Lady alſo, who hath taken ſo much paine and trauaile, to come hither into this Country, heere to receiue perpetuall ſhame and infamie.</p>
                  <p>Speaking thus, he rode toward the Ladies; and addreſſing himſelfe to <hi>Olinda,</hi> demaunded of her, if ſhe pleaſed to deliuer him her Crowne, that thereby hee might defend her beautie. For, in mine opinion (quoth he) any man of good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will confeſſe, that iuſtly you ought to haue that other Crowne, which the fond Greeke hath placed on the <hi>Perrou.</hi> Moreouer, I haue made choyce of you, among all the reſt, to be my beſt beloued; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech you grant me leaue, that I may begin the Combate for you, as ſhe to whom I am vowed and dedicated. For, no ſooner ſhall the Empreſſe haue made her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the great City of <hi>Rome:</hi> but there I meane to make you my wife, as ſole Lady and gouerneſſe of me, and all my greateſt fortunes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olinda,</hi> tired and much troubled with this idle talke of <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> made him no anſwere; but turning her face another way, feigned a conference with one of her owne company: which the Prince percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, as halfe in anger, thus he ſpake to her. It ſeemeth Madame, by your manner of behauiour, that I am a man vnable to execute what I haue ſpoken: but let mee neuer haue loue, or any eſteeme of you, if I doe not perfourme much more. Only this being granted, that my firſt encounter with the Launce, may haue but your gracious looke, and that you turne not your face till it be done. This earneſt importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity did ſo embelliſh the beautie of <hi>Olinda,</hi> by a moſt ſweet and amiable bluſh: that ſhe knew not how to bee rid of this vexation, making no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at all of his words. Which the Queene obſeruing, ſhe took the Crowne from her head, and ſent it to the Prince <hi>Saluſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> who receiuing it very thankfully, went to the baſe or <hi>Perron,</hi> and ſet it by that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Graſinda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterward, taking a ſtrong Lance, he beganne to ſhake it in ſuch ſort, as if he meant to ſnap it in ſunder: then ryding proudly to the King, with his Helmet on his head, and Shield about his necke, thus hee ſpake. King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> I ſhall ſoone let you ſee the difference, betweene vs that are Romanes, &amp; the Knights of your Court: for this braue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Greeke, that thinkes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with ſo many one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhal preſently receiue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſhame that euer Knight did. And then, let his other two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions come if they pleaſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his cauſe if they can: for this I dare promiſe you, that before I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from hence, I will preſent you with their heads, inſteed of Crowns.</p>
                  <p>So much offended was <hi>Grumedan,</hi> at theſe arrogant proud wordes of <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uſte;</hi> as he could hardly forbeare to ſmite him. Neuertheleſſe, in regard of the Kings ſtrict counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes before, he diſſembled his anger, and went to him only with this anſwere. Lord <hi>Saluſte,</hi> you haue not yet forgot the Combate, that muſt bee betweene you and me, if (as you ſay) you eſcape from the Greek, &amp; come fairely off
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7181:303"/>
My memorie is more perfect then ſo, replyed Prince <hi>Saluſte,</hi> and your ſelfe ſhall haue good cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it.</p>
                  <p>So cloſing his beauer, claſping cloſe his Shield, and placing his Launce in the reſt, he ranne mainly againſt the Greeke Knight, who met him with ſuch force (neither of them failing in the attaint) that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſte</hi> was vnhorſed: and our Greeke Knight finiſhing his race, found a truncheon of the Launces ſhaft ſticking in his Shield, whereby eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man thought that hee had beene wounded. But hee quickly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there was no ſuch matter, and ſnatching it out, threw it on the ground, turning againe to meete with his enemie, who moued nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand nor foot, he was ſo daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the fall. And not without great cauſe, conſidering what a height he fell, and the heauy charge of his armour, ſo that his right arme was broken in twaine. And yet it happened farre worſe to him; for in falling downe, his left foot hung faſt in the ſtirrop, and being vnable to get it forth, his horſe offended at his vnfaſhionable burden, gaue him ſuch a blow with his foote on the Helmet, that it fell off from his head, and he lay ſtill as one entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                  <p>The Greeke Knight beholding him in this pittifull condition, ſpake out ſo loud, as euery one might heare him. Beleeue me gentle Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, the Lady for whom you haue performed this rare chiualry, is wonderfully beholding to you: notwithſtanding, if you doe not quit her Crown from my Miſtreſſe, (who deſerues it better then ſhe, as excelling all in beautie) you lye fairely for the loſſe of your head preſently. But <hi>Saluſte</hi> made him not any anſwere; whereupon the Knight rode to the King, thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in Greeke to him: Sir, he that ſo lately gaue perſwaſions to your people, to relye confidently in his manhood, will not now render his Ladies Crowne to my Miſtreſſe, to whom (by the teſtimony of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) it iuſtly appertaineth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may it pleaſe you (as an vpright Iudge) to doe me right: otherwiſe, I will ſmite off his head before this faire aſſembly. Then ſuddenly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning bridle, and alighting from his horſe, he went to Prince <hi>Saluſte,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhewe, as if he meant to kill him.</p>
                  <p>Which Count <hi>Argamont</hi> ſeeing, ſaid to the King. Sir, you ought (in my minde to graunt the Greeke Knight what he demaundeth, and ſaue the life of the other, elſe you may heereafter bee blamed for it. And why? anſwerd <hi>Grumedan.</hi> I pray you Lord <hi>Argamont,</hi> let Fortune deale as pleaſeth her. Haue you not yet ſeene enough of theſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines ſaucineſſe? I proteſt to you vpon my faith, that with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorie audaciouſneſſe, they are become as malicious as olde Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, and you ſhall perceiue it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, if the Greeke Knight bee hindred from purſuing his victory. For although <hi>Saluſte</hi> be ſo neere his ending, yet I dare giue you all my lands and goods, if the King doe ſaue him: that he will iuſtly ſay here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, he ſaued him from death, that will bee the greateſt enemie to his life. Therefore, I beſeech you Sir, delay your ſentence for a while, till it may be certainely kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, what will bee the iſſue of the fight.</p>
                  <p>During this diſcourſe, the Greek Knight made ſhew of diſarming <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſte,</hi> for more eaſie ſmiting off his head from his ſhoulders: which the King fearing, prayed his Vnckle to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7181:303"/>
vrge the ſtay, and to graunt him the Crowne which hee deſired. Then the olde Earle aroſe, and tolde him in the Greek tongue, what the King had commanded him. Heereupon, the Knight ſtept backe, and putting his Sword vp into the ſheath, ſpake to the Count in this manner. In honour of ſo good a King, and you, for once I will ſaue the life of this preſumptuous Romane. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, if any of his companions fall into the like danger, let them be well aſſured, that they muſt make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for him. For I neuer heard of any vaine-glory like to theirs, wherein they haue gotten an habite and cuſtome, to condemne any Knight errant, in reſpect of their owne worthineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer Sir, I pray you tell the King, that for the much good I haue heard of him, I ſhall neuer bee willing to yeeld him any diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or enter into any ſeruice hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him. But withall, I humbly entreate him, to fauour me in the proſecution of my victory, if others ſhall preſent themſelues for the Combat: to the end, that hereafter they may not bee forward in deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing other men, after the manner of the Emperor <hi>Patin;</hi> who hath great delight in threatning others, and yet beares away the blowes ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully himſelfe, like to theſe Bragado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiaes of his band.</p>
                  <p>So mounting on horſebacke, he rode to the ſquare <hi>Perrou,</hi> whence he tooke the two Crownes, and carried them to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> who (you muſt needes preſume) was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily pleaſed; and thanking the Knight heartily, prayed him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede on, ſince he had begunne ſo well.</p>
                  <p>Then calling for a new Launce, which ſpeedily was brought him, he returned to the end of the Liſts, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending when another ſhould come offer himſelfe. And ſeeing no man ſtirre, being wearie of ſo long way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he called for the Damoſell Meſſenger, that brought the Letter to Court, ſaying thus to her. Faire friend, I pray you goe to the King, and tell him, that I moſt humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him, if the Romanes will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate no more, that he ſuffer not any of his Court to ſupply their defect: for, ouer and beſide the ſmal honour they ſhall gaine, by vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſo ſilly a Knight as I am, yet at this time, I am not willing to meddle with them. But, if any of the other will reuenge their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions diſgrace, I am heere ready to receiue them all, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yea, or two of the very beſt of them both together. The Damoſell rode preſently to the King, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered all that the Greeke Knight had committed to her truſt, where-to he anſwered: That hee was well pleaſed with his motion, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the great impoſition layde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him by his Lady. And if hee liked to loue him, and be one of his followers, he would honour him as highly as any Knight of his Court. Moreouer (quoth the King) aſſure him from me, that he ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer iniury by Combate, againſt none other then the Romaines, who ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly craued it at my hands. And he had great reaſon for this anſwer, becauſe he had then no Knight able to contend with the Grecian: For all were abſent from the Court, in regard of the tempeſtuous trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, except <hi>Guillan le Penſif,</hi> who was then ſicke, and <hi>Cendile de Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note,</hi> who the day before (by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie accident) was ſhot through both his legges with an arrow, as the King came to the fall of a Hart.</p>
                  <p>This anſwere being vnderſtood
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7181:304"/>
by the Damoſel like a wiſe &amp; diſcreet Gentlewoman, humbly thanked the King, ſaying further, thus. Sir, if the Greeke knight could ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily haue beene entreated, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had not ſo ſoone loſt him: but hee will neuer ſubiect himſelfe to any, as hauing more affected liberty, then all the goods and treaſures of the world. And thus aſſure yourſelfe, that his onely deſire and felicity, is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the right of Ladies and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, in preſeruing them from wrong or abuſe offered to them: in which honourable imployment, he hath wonne ſuch immortall fame and renowne, in manifold difficult and dangerous attempts, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall reports would ſeeme incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So, with your anſwere I will returne to him, or any ſeruice elſe you pleaſe to commaund me: gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing you further to vnderſtand, that, till it be midday, he will attend them that dare aduenture the Combate, but afterward he ſhall hardly ſtay, or admit any ſuch ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>Then ſhe returned to the Greeke knight, who hauing heard the Kings anſwere, went to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> ſaying. For ought I can perceiue, Madame, the Crowne is your owne franke and free, and I clear'd from all further danger of the Romanes: neuertheleſſe, in expreſſion of my dutie to you, I will tarry yet a litle longer, to ſee if any of them haue the heart to aduenture his fortune. Hauing thus ſpoken, he called one of his Squires, and ſaid to him. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my Shield, and ſet it on the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou;</hi> then proclaime aloude, that if there be any other Romaine, who is willing to enter the Combate, let him come and aduance his Shield by mine.</p>
                  <p>The Squire did as hee was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, yet (for all this) not a man of them would ſtirre, but ſtood loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one vpon another: eſpecially <hi>Maganill,</hi> who (among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes) was reputed for one of the beſt Knights in the world, yet being very fearefull of the Greeke, and willing to excuſe himſelfe, he thus ſpake to his other companions.</p>
                  <p>You know, my friends, that ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke the Combate againſt <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan,</hi> and I made him promiſe, that if he were vanquiſhed by him, that I and my two brethren would reuenge his cauſe: therefore (of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie) I may not now aduenture. But I am much amazed at you all, to ſee you ſo voide of heart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as to ſtand like men confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſoule, at one onely encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Launce perfourmed by the Greeke.</p>
                  <p>Then he called to <hi>Gradamor</hi> and <hi>Lazanor,</hi> two young Romaine Knights, of ſpirit enough, and ſaid to them. Me thinkes you are too ſlow in aduenturing your fortunes. You ſee, the Greeke make proffer of combatting with any two among vs, and I am very certaine, that if you two will accept his challenge, hee ſhall finde it no eaſie matter to deale with you; let mee therefore perſwade you to vndertake him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words did ſo puffe them vp with a vaine conceit of themſelues, as they called immediatly for their Armes, and entring into the Liſts very boldly, depending more vpon preſumption, then any mannerly education, paſſed by before the king, without any offer of ſalutation, or ſeeming ſo much as to ſee him. Then ryding to the <hi>Perrou, Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> (in very deſpightfull manner) hauing his Sword drawen in his hand, ſmote with all his force at the Greeke knights Shield aduaunced
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7181:304"/>
thereon, and brake it in pieces, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo loud as he could. Ill may be thriue, that ſuffers any longer this ſaucie mates Armes to ſtand heere ſo proudly.</p>
                  <p>When the Greeke Knight both heard and ſaw this iniurie, he grew ſo highly offended, that, without ſtaying to call for another Shield, he tooke a new Launce, and giuing the ſpuries to his horſe, met the two Romaine Knights ſo couragiouſly, that one of them was throwne to the ground ſo amazedly, as he knew not whether it was day or night, and euery man thought that his necke was broken, hee lay ſo qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe our Greekes Launce was ſhiuered in many pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he drew his Sword, and turning his face to <hi>Lazanor,</hi> loaded him with ſuch mighty ſtrokes, as, if hee had not caught faſt hold on the maine of his horſe, hee had falne to the earth. But as he lay thus bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Greeke ſeized on his body, and by meere ſtrength of arme (tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Shield from about his necke) hee threw him againſt the ground. Neuertheleſſe, quickly he receiued footing, and went to helpe vp his brother: In this time the Greeke was diſmounted from his horſe, which he feared to looſe, becauſe he ran about the fielde: but minding more his preſent buſines, hee ranne pell mell vpon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, laying ſo ſtearnely about him on euery ſide, as they were no way able to endure him. Now gaue he good teſtimony of his valour, and that hee was no learner in ſuch extremities: but as one of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes was running about the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou,</hi> and the other following ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after him, onely to auoide the Greekes keene edged Sword, hee gaue <hi>Lazanor</hi> ſuch a ſtroake on the right leg, as it was well neere cut in twaine, ſo that meere paine and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh made him fall downe, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly he craued mercy.</p>
                  <p>But the Greeke Knight preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that either he heard or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him not, he ſet his foot on his breſt, and ſo left him ſtretcht out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on the ground, returning to <hi>Gradamor,</hi> who fled to the king for warrantie of his life. All which would not ſerue his turne; for with his Sword, he did beat him backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the <hi>Perrou,</hi> where being quite out of breath, he fell downe all along: where the Greeke ſetting foote on him, ſmote ſo many blowes on his Helmet, that it fell off from his head, which hauing now at ſo apt aduantage, he purpoſed to ſmite from his ſhoulders, but that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cryed out to him. Ah gentle knight, for Gods ſake mercy, I am ready to doe whatſoeuer you ſhall command me.</p>
                  <p>Remoouing his foote from off him, he ſuddenly looked back, and eſpied <hi>Lazanor</hi> creeping on his knees to ſteale away: but he quickly caught hold on his arme, and dragd him along to the <hi>Perrou,</hi> laying him cloſe by his brother <hi>Gradamor,</hi> which made euery one imagine, that there he would ſmite off their heads together. Whereupon <hi>Don Grumedan,</hi> who hated them to the death, ſpake out ſo loud, as euery man might eaſily heare him. Mee thinkes the Greeke hath ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged the wrong done to his Shield, as <hi>Gradamor</hi> hath good cauſe to remember it while he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> liues.</p>
                  <p>As he ſpake theſe words, <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> came to him, and the Greeke demaunded what hee would haue. Sir, anſwered <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> I beſeech you (for my ſake) ſpare the liues of theſe two Knights, ſeeing they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7181:305"/>
yeeld themſelues as vanquiſhed. But he feigned as if hee vnderſtood him not: wherfore <hi>Eſplandian</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Count <hi>Argamont,</hi> to interprete for him, which he did. Truely Sir, (quoth the Greeke) I will gladly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow their liues on this ſweet youth, prouided, that you will tell mee of whence, and what he is. Beleeue me Sir, replyed the Count, I know not any man in this Court, that heerein can reſolue you, for he was brought hither almoſt by miracle. Then briefly he reported, how, and in what manner the aged Hermite found him.</p>
                  <p>I haue often heard of him, ſaid the Greeke, in <hi>Romania,</hi> and that he is named <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> by reaſon of certaine naturall letters or carra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters vnder his breſts. You ſay true, anſwered the Count, and you ſhall ſee them preſently, if you pleaſe. So he commanded <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> to ſhew his breſts, as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he did: whereat the Knight not a little meruayling, ſaid. Faire youth, I pray God to bleſſe thee, and ſend thee good fortune in the higheſt degree.</p>
                  <p>So mounting on horſe-backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he left the Romaines with young <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and returned to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> ſaying. Beleeue me Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, I haue beene ouer-trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to you, but I was compelled thereto (as your ſelfe hath ſeene) and could make no ſpeedier diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch.</p>
                  <p>Vpon my faith, anſwered ſhe, you can neuer doe any thing, but I ſhall very thankfully accept it, let vs now then goe on-ward, if you pleaſe. So getting forth of the crowd, they tooke the way to their Shippes, in ſo high content on all ſides, as poſſibly could be. Being come aboord, they commanded the Mariners, to ſet ſaile for the <hi>Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iſle.</hi> But becauſe the Greeke Knight had ſome ſuſpition, that <hi>Don Grumedan</hi> would ſtand in need of Knights helpe, to maintaine the Combat, which he had vndertaken, if ſo be it ſhould go forward, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Angriote</hi> and <hi>Bruneo,</hi> to ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, &amp; ſuccor him, &amp; in the meane while to vnderſtand ſome tydings of <hi>Oriana,</hi> if any way they could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereto.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lready hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to you, that the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Mirefleure,</hi> the Queene <hi>Sardamira</hi> (by the conſent of King <hi>Liſuart)</hi> went thither to ſee her, and to acquaint her with the Emperours affection towards her, as alſo with what mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence ſhe ſhould be wel-comed to <hi>Rome.</hi> Now, in the proſecution of our Hiſtory, you muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that after full concluſion was paſt with the Romanes, concerning her: the King would haue her come to the Court, commanding his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Giontes,</hi> to take two Knights more with him, &amp; bring her thence away with all conuenient ſpeed. But he gaue him charge (vpon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7181:305"/>
of his life) that none, but they of her owne company, ſhould haue any conference with her.</p>
                  <p>For execution of the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Giontes</hi> tooke <hi>Sadoce</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanor</hi> with him; who being come to <hi>Mirefleure,</hi> after they had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with her fathers purpoſe, they made ready a Litter for her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe ſhee was vnable to trauaile, ſhe was ſo weake and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by reaſon of her continual mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yet on ſhe needes muſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Queene <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira,</hi> and other Ladies. Betweene <hi>Mirefleure</hi> and <hi>Tagades,</hi> where the King ſoiourned, approaching nere to a goodly Fountaine, enuironed with diuers young ſpreading trees, they eſpyed in a little groue, a Knight, ready prepared for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, bearing a Shield of Sinople, and a Launce, with a Banderole or Pennon of the ſame colour: who calling to one of his Squires, ſaid. Goe, and tell them that guard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame <hi>Oriana,</hi> that (in courteſie) I entreate them, to let me ſpeake a word with her; elſe, I will ſtriue to doe it, whether they will or no. The Squire going to <hi>Giontes,</hi> told him as his Maſter had commanded him: whereat he beganne to laugh harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he (being alone) ſhould ſend them ſuch a threatning braue; wherefore hee gaue them this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: Friend, returne to the Knight, and tell him, that he cannot (at this time) ſpeake with Madame <hi>Oriana:</hi> moreouer, that if hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend violently to doe it, he will not find it eaſie for him.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Oriana</hi> heard theſe words, ſhe tooke them very vnkindly, and ſaid to <hi>Giontes:</hi> Fair Sir, why ſhould you be offended at any mans ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with me? Perhaps he brings me ſuch good newes, as may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſing to me. Madame, (quoth he) the King hath commaunded vs on our liues, that no one may come neere your perſon, much leſſe ſpeak with you, vntill you come to him.</p>
                  <p>The Squire returned his anſwere to his Maſter; in the meane while <hi>Giontes,</hi> miſdoubting that hee muſt needes try the Combate, made him ready for it. As readily came the Knight (who ſtiled himſelfe the Greene Knight) into the fielde, and both giuing the ſpurre to their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, met together ſo furiouſly, that their Launces flew in pieces, and <hi>Giontes</hi> his horſe being ſhouldered, fell to the ground with his Maiſter vnder him, ſo that he could not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily recouer himſelfe. Whereupon the Greene Knight trotting to him, deſired him once more, that hee would permit him to ſpeake with <hi>Oriana.</hi> By my faith Sir, anſwered <hi>Giontes,</hi> if you do, it is much againſt my will, and by this miſ-fortune of my horſe.</p>
                  <p>Hardly had he concluded theſe words, but the Greene knight heard <hi>Sadoce</hi> crying, that hee ſhould ſtand vpon his guard. Wherefore, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Giontes,</hi> he ranne againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and failed in the attaint: which <hi>Sadoce</hi> did not, but met him ſo man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that his Launce flew in infinit pieces. The Greene knight, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at his miſſe, took another Lance, and giuing his horſe the ſpurre, met <hi>Sadoce</hi> ſo powerfully, that hee caſt him quite out of his ſaddle. Which <hi>Lazanor</hi> ſeeing, and hoping to bee reuenged for his two companions, couched his Launce againſt the Greene Knight, with full perſwaſion to vnhorſe him: but they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ſo furiouſly with their bodies, that <hi>Lazanors</hi> arme was broken, and hee ſate ſo amazedly on his horſe, as hee had not the power to ſtay him, till hee had runne out his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7181:306"/>
whole race, becauſe the Greene Knight (in his paſſage by him) had pluckt the bridle off his head, and ſeeing him runne in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed manner, he fell a laughing at him.</p>
                  <p>Then came he to <hi>Oriana,</hi> and humbly ſaluting her, ſhee imagined him to be <hi>Amadis:</hi> wherefore, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her ſelfe in the Litter, ſhe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comde him very graciouſly. Then the Knight gaue her a Letter, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus to her. Madame, <hi>Agrais</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> doe duteouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelues to your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and haue expreſly ſent me to you, to bring you their mindes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that writ. Wherefore, conſider with your ſelfe, if you will command me any ſeruice to them: for I muſt returne to them with all poſſible ſpeed, being well aſſured, that although I am a man of ſlender valour, yet they may ſtand in neede of my helpe, before their enterpriſe will be ended.</p>
                  <p>Now truſt me Sir, quoth ſhe, they may well faile of meeting with a better Knight then you are, witnes the paines you haue taken to ſpeake with me. But good Sir, ſeeing you haue done ſo much for mee, vouchſafe to let me know who you are, to the end, that I the more thankefully remember you heere-after, when better I may performe it.</p>
                  <p>Madame, they that know mee, ſaid he, doe tearme me <hi>Garnate of the Dreadfull Dale,</hi> whoſe griefe is not a little, for your fathers vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and cruelty to you. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, hardly will he bring his purpoſe to paſſe, it will firſt coſt the liues of many good Knights, who (for your ſake) will defend you to their vttermoſt power. Ah my deare friend <hi>Garnate,</hi> quoth ſhe, I pray GOD giue mee the meanes, whereby I may acknowledge this wonderfull loyaltie. Madame, ſaid he, I haue all my life-time deſired to doe you ſome ſeruice, as one that is your moſt humble ſeruant, and now I muſt needes take my leaue of you. For he ſaw the Queene <hi>Sardamira</hi> comming neere, who beholding <hi>Oriana</hi> aduiſedly, imagined her lookes to be more chearefull, and her preſent diſpoſition much alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the former, whereupon ſhe ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Madame, I doe not know the Knight that ſpake with you, but he hath handled your guards as rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>Floreſtan</hi> did them that had the charge of me, ſo that now they need not mocke one another. I know not, whether it be the miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the way, or through their owne want of courage: but well I wot, that I neuer ſaw two worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er knights, then this and <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Oriana</hi> faintly ſmyling, anſwered. I ſaw not how yours were dealt withall: but as for theſe heere, it ſeemes that they met with one, who knew well enough how to chaſtiſe their harſhneſſe. As they held on this merry mocking, <hi>Giontes,</hi> and the two other came towards them, ſo much aſhamed of themſelues, as they durſt not hold vp their heads, to looke them in the faces. But ſetting on toward <hi>Tagades, Oriana</hi> called <hi>Mabila</hi> into the Litter to her, as deſirous to haue her company. So being together, they cloſely read the Letter, whereby <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed the Princeſſe, that <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and <hi>Ardan,</hi> the Dwarfe to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> were both arriued at the <hi>Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iſle,</hi> where they exſpected their Maſter within eight dayes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according as hee had ſent word thither; and <hi>Galuanes, Agraies,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide many more good Knights,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7181:306"/>
were all purpoſely there met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; onely to lend her ſuccour, ſo ſoone as they ſhould haue intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of her ſhipping away, to bee ſent for <hi>Rome;</hi> wherefore, in the meane time, ſhe ſhould comfort her ſelfe, and be of good courage, as now ſhe had no other cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe newes were ſo welcome to both the Ladies, as nothing elſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could be more; and they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that either they were newly reuiued from death to life, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of a darke dungeon, into an incompatable glorious light. And all the way as they rode along, they could finde no other argument of talke, neither ſo much as thinke on any thing elſe, but only to reade and re-reade the Letter ouer and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which queſtionleſſe they did an hundred times. But being come to the Court, new ſorrow ouer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered this iocund ſolace; fearing, leſt the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> ſhould not be able to execute their enterpriſe. Now, ſo ſoone as <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> was alighted; ſhe went to her own lodgings, neuer going to the Queenes her Mother, according as ſhe was wont to doe, making an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that ſhe was not wel. Whereof the King receiuing knowledge, hee went to ſee her, accompanied one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Arban,</hi> King of <hi>North wales.</hi> No ſooner was he entred the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: but ſhee thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Alas my King and Father, for Gods ſake remember your defolate daughter in compaſſion, and bee not leſſe fauourable to her, then (al your life-time) you haue beene to meane Ladies &amp; Gentlewomen, in requiring your ayde and aſſiſtance: Ah my worthy Lord and Father, when <hi>Archalaus</hi> led you away priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it was for the fame of your great goodnes, in helping her, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vrged you. And can it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that now you ſhould forget ſo rare a vertue, that euermore was moſt familiar with you? will you deale worſe with me, then euer you did with any liuing body? I haue heard that you will ſend me to the Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> with intent that I ſhould be his wife: But if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell me thereto, you ſhall commit a moſt haynous ſinne; for it muſt bee done in deſpight of my ſelfe; and I am certaine, that I ſhall ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to mine owne death. Deare Daughter, anſwered the King, think you that I reſpect not your good &amp; honor, as I ought to doe? Father, quoth ſhe, I know not how you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand my good &amp; honor, but this I can aſſure you, that if you ſeparate me from you, you will be an homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide to your owne blood. Then ſhe fell into ſuch ſighes and teares, as the King was enforced to forſake the Chamber, and leaue her, ſhee moned ſo much pity in him.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Arban</hi> King of <hi>Northwales</hi> ſtept to her, and hoping to comfort her, ſaid. Madame, you haue alwayes hitherto bin eſteemed wiſe, &amp; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that now you will wander from that good reputation.

Ah my royall Couſin, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, ſeeing Fortune is ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe to me, &amp; determines to worke her vttermoſt malice on me, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing you &amp; many more of al means of ſuccouring me by force of arms, wherein you haue paſt through infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit dangers, to deliuer afflicted La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; Damoſels from tribulations: let me then (at leaſt) entreate you, to helpe me with your good word,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7181:307"/>
in counſelling the King from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me ſuch ſhame, except he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to tempt God, and conſtraine that happineſſe, (which alwayes to this inſtant hath attended on him) vtterly to forſake and abandon him, leauing (in ſteed thereof) all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and miſery. For Gods ſake therefore, returne againe to him, and find ſome meanes to bring him hither once more, with mine olde noble Vncle Count <hi>Argamont,</hi> and <hi>Don Grumedan,</hi> to the end, that you three together may the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with him.</p>
                  <p>In vttering theſe words, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Princeſſe was ſo grieuouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, that ſhe ſeemed rather dead then aliue, for ſhe fell downe on the ground in a ſwoune: which King <hi>Arban</hi> ſeeing, he departed out of the Chamber, while <hi>Mabila</hi> and other Ladies (who were then about her) might miniſter ſome helpe to her in this extremity. He went to the King, and told him all that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> had ſaid to him: which moued him to ſuch compaſſion, as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſtraction might be very eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned. Notwithſtanding, for all the perſwaſions he could vrge vnto him, he would not goe to her: vntill Count <hi>Argamont</hi> and olde <hi>Grumedan</hi> were ſo earneſt with him, that at laſt he yeelded. And as they entred into her Chamber, they be held her former traunce as yet to continue: wherefore he went nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to her, and taking her in his armes, ſaid: Deare Daughter ſpeake to me; but ſhe moued neither hand nor foote, but lay as if ſhe had bin dead.</p>
                  <p>At length, by the helpe of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and cold water, her ſpirits came to her again, &amp; ſhe, breathing forth a vehement ſigh, able to breake a ſtrong heart in ſunder, ſeeing her Father ſo nere, ſaid vnto him. An my deare father, take pity on me. Sweet child (quoth he) what wouldſt thou haue me do?

the Queene then came in; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her Daughter in ſuch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition, was much amazed thereat: for <hi>Oriana</hi> no ſooner ſaw her Mother, but ſhe fell into a ſwoun againe. In which time, the King left the Chamber, committing her to the care of women, who were not a little buſie about her. After the was ſomewhat recouered, as the Queene demaunded how ſhe fared: the wofull <hi>Oriana</hi> opening her eies, which (in a manner) were quite drown'd in teares, beganne to looke vpon her very ruefully, and with a voyce meerely forced, ſaid. Alas deare Mother, my preſent eſtate is much better then it ſhould be, or I (in heart) could wiſh it: for Death now is my onely deſire, and thereto my ſpirit ſoly inclineth, ſeeing my ſelfe vtterly forſaken of the King &amp; you.

                  <p>The Queene being moued with much compaſſion, replyed thus.

                  <p>You ſee my Lord, what extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie your Daughter <hi>Oriana</hi> is in, and if you well conſider thereon, you may eaſilie iudge, what inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may happen to her perſon, by an inward violent-conceiued deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, which afterward (all your life-time) you may at leyſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
                  <p>Beyond all this, you will runne into an vnauoydable blame, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſtrangers; but euen of your owne ſubiects, and thereby grow hatefull to them, whereon muſt needes enſue many miſ-fortunes.

Therefore beleeue the counſell of them, that ſolie deſire the good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and honour of you and your kingdome, whereby no perill what-ſoeuer can happen to you in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but if it ſhould fall out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, yet you ſtand clearely excuſed, and they bound to prepare all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remedies.

In the meane while, forbeare a little, that ſhe may forget what ſhee muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, and prouide your ſhipping in a readines; for this next weeke enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will deliuer her to you fully furniſhed. My Lord, anſwered the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> it is not to bee wondred at, if at the firſt ſhe mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer, if you pleaſe, to grace <hi>Olinda</hi> with her company, I meane to make her my wife ſo ſoone as ſhe comes there, becauſe I finde her to be a wiſe and vertuous Lady. Beleeue me (quoth the King) I wiſhe it might bee ſo: And then he entred into a large diſcourſe, of ſuch eſpeciall vertues remaining in her, as more could not be found in any Lady.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Tables were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered for dinner, in the midſt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they that intended to combate with <hi>Grumedan,</hi> came and preſented themſelues, ſpeaking thus to King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> Sir, you know what words were vſed ſome few dayes paſt, by Lord <hi>Grumedan,</hi> to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the Romanes, ſo that Prince <hi>Saluſte,</hi> and we with him, do come to challenge him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Becauſe hee ſhall well know, that it ill becomes ſuch an old do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard as he is, to make compariſon with knights of <hi>Rome:</hi> therefore, if you be ſo pleaſed, it ſhall be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med tomorrow, for it grieues vs, that he ſhould remaine ſo long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Grumedan</hi> hearing himſelfe thus abuſed, beganne to change co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and as hee was about to make anſwere, the king ſeeing him in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, aroſe, and ſaid to him. <hi>Grumedan,</hi> you haue euermore hitherto beene wiſe and temperate, eſpecially in ſpeech: let mee then requeſt you, to conceale your diſpleaſure, and onely anſwere to the combat, which theſe Knights doe vrge you to.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7181:308"/>
Sir, ſaid <hi>Grumedan,</hi> ſeeing it is your will, it ſhall be ſo, and to morrow I will not faile to meete them in the field, according to my promiſe, where I hope to reuenge the wrong they haue done mee in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                  <p>So the King roſe from the Table, and went into his Chamber with <hi>Grumedan,</hi> demaunding there of him, where were they whom he had choſen to take his part? Sir, ſaid he, firſt I know the right on my ſide, and if <hi>Galaor</hi> come to morrow (as I think he will) I am well aſſured, that hee will beare me companie: but if hee come not, then will I fight with them all three, one after another. That may not be, anſwered the king, for you haue conſented to three a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt three, and ſo the oath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines before me recorded, which makes me ſtand in great doubt of you, becauſe they are young and ſtrong, you aged and weake, and without any to helpe you. Sir, ſaid <hi>Grumedan,</hi> God who hateth pride and preſumption (wherewith they are too much enflated) can prouide helpe, when it is leaſt looked for. But if the worſt ſhould happen, I know two of mine owne kinſemen, that wil not deny to ayde me againſt them, were they far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The King pauſing a while, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſaid. I haue conſidered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe for you, I will diſguiſe my ſelfe, and ſecond you in the cauſe: for, aſſure your ſelfe, you and I ſhall well hold out againſt them all three. God forbid Sir, anſwered <hi>Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> that you ſhould ſo endanger your royall perſon for me. Why? ſaid the King, in better place I can neuer doe it, and neuer elſe can I iuſtly acknowledge the manifold ſeruices you haue done for me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding your life in ſo many ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dangers, onely for the defence of me, and my Realme. Sir (quoth he) the preſent demonſtration of your gracious goodnes towardes me, hath ſo farre enlarged the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of my duty to you: that if I could dye a thouſand deathes in your ſeruice, I ſhould yet confeſſe my ſelfe more indebted to you. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Grumedan</hi> gaue him the good night, and went to his owne lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether he ſent for two knights his kinſmen, ſpeaking thus to them. You know the Combate, which I haue vndertaken to morrow againſt three Romanes, and becauſe you are they in whom I haue moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: I would make choiſe of no other Knights then you, to ſecond me in ſo good an action. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted this offer very ioyfully, and reputed themſelues highly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereby: ſo they departed to make ready their Armes; and <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan</hi> entred into a Chappel, where hee remained in prayer till the next morning, and then went to make all things fit for him.</p>
                  <p>As he began to arme himſelf, the Damoſell belonging to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> (of whom you haue formerly heard)
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7181:309"/>
ſuddenly came thither, bearing one of the goodlieſt Swords that euer was ſeene; and ſaluting <hi>Grumedan,</hi> ſpake thus. Sir, the Greek knight, who dearely loues and reſpects you, for the manly ſpirit alwayes knowen to be in you, hath ſent you this Sword, which he frankely giues you, as being one of the beſt knights in the world: and it is the very ſame, wherewith (not long ſince) he chaſtiſed the Romaines in your preſence.</p>
                  <p>By me he tels you further, that he hath heard of your vrgent neceſſity, for two Knights to aſſiſt you in this fight: wherefore, he hath left two of his own aſſociats, whom he reputes no way inferiour to himſelfe, and prayes you (for his ſake) to make vſe of them, and not to imploy any other in this buſines. Faire Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, (quoth he) I humbly thanke both the Knight, and you, for the great pains you haue taken to bring me theſe tydings, which are not a little welcome to me.</p>
                  <p>So receiuing the Sword, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him one of the beſt that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he had ſeene; and guirding it on his thigh, he ſaid to the Damoſell. Truely, the Greek knight hath done much for me, conſidering the ſmall knowledge we haue together; and God giue mee grace, that I may make amends for this fauor one way or other. His two friendly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions (quoth ſhe) do attend you, and are ready to enter Combate ſo ſoone as you ſhall pleaſe: therefore ſlacke you no time, for I ſaw the three Romaines as I came hether, in good forwardnes to their owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor. Then the horſe was brought, which <hi>Floreſtan</hi> had giuen him, the very ſame which hee conquered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Queene <hi>Sardamira:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mounted thereon, he rode ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the place where the Combate ſhould be performed. There hee found the two knights, that were come to helpe him; and they ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another, <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Gentlemen, I know not who you are, but that which you come to doe for me, giueth appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant teſtimony, that all my life-time I muſt acknowledge you for my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt friends.</p>
                  <p>As he ended theſe wordes, they ſaw the three Romaines enter the field, with Trumpets and Clarions ſounding before them, and making ſuch a noyſe in the ayre, as it eccho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round about in euery place. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly was the King mounted on his Scaffold, who caſting his eye euery-where, as exſpecting <hi>Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> hee ſaw him betweene the two knights and the Damoſell, whom he knew ſo ſoone as he beheld her. But he could not deuiſe, who they were that tooke part with <hi>Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi> wherefore he called to the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, and demaunded of her, if ſhe had brought them. Sir, ſaid ſhee, the good are euermore ſupported by ſuch as themſelues are, and that is the reaſon, why the Greek knight, vnderſtanding the loyaltie of Lord <hi>Grumedan,</hi> and the Combate he had vndertaken againſt the Romaines; alſo, what ſlender meanes he had of helpe at this preſent, all the beſt knights being now abſent from your Court: Hee hath therefore ſent two of his owne companions, whom you may eſteeme little infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to himſelfe, in all thoſe good parts belonging to manhood. And thus Sir, you may alſo aſſure your ſelfe, that <hi>Grumedan</hi> neuer exſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted any ſupply: for he neuer knew thereof, till ſuch time as he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to mount on horſeback, and that I my ſelfe preſented them to him. Truſt mee Damoſell, anſwered the King, the Greeke knight hath done
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7181:309"/>
much for him, eſpecially, in ſuch a neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely were theſe wordes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but the three Romaines came before the Kings Scaffold, ſpeaking to him (ſo loude as all might heare them) in this manner. Sir, in re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gard that we haue reſolued with our ſelues, to carry the heades of three Knights to <hi>Rome,</hi> that dare preſume to combate with vs. We humbly deſire, that you will not bee diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therewith, although <hi>Don Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medans</hi> head be one of them, which yet you may helpe, by ſending word to him, that if hee will deny his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words heere before your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and freely confeſſe, that we Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines are the beſt knights in the world, we are contented to forgiue all. Doe (quoth the King) that which you come to doe, and hee that remaineth conquerour, let him deale with his enemie as beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>By this time, the Queene and her Ladies had taken their ſeates, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Guillan le Penſif,</hi> and <hi>Cendill de Ganote,</hi> both yet ſo weake, by reaſon of their ſickneſſe, as they could hardly ſupport them-ſelues: For <hi>Guillan</hi> was newlie deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from a continuall Feuer, and <hi>Ganote</hi> had both his legges ſhotte through with an arrow, as the King was hunting in the Forreſt. Now, the Queen much miſ-doubted, that Fortune would deale frowardly with the good old <hi>Grumedan,</hi> and therefore calling <hi>Guillan</hi> to her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his opinion in this caſe. Madame (quoth he) the hazards of fights, are euermore in the will of heauen, and the good right of the Combatants: but not in the armes ſtrength, nor in the preſumption of men.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore Madame, we all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Grumedan</hi> to be wiſe, a vertuous Knight, and as honeſt a man as the world can yeeld (far differing from the ouer-weining pride, of thoſe men that he hath to deale withall:) it makes me verily think, that (weak as I am) if I were in his place, I ſhould eaſily winne the honour of the day. This anſwere did highly content the Queene, yea, and in ſuch ſort, that ſhe conceiued better hope of <hi>Grumedans</hi> victory, then formerly ſhe had done.</p>
                  <p>Now, the Knights on eyther ſide, encountred together ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as their Launces flew vp in many ſhiuers: but there befell ſuch an accident, as neuer happened in King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court before, for the three Romanes were all vnhorſed, and none of the other loſt ſo much as a ſtirrop, wherefore, turning their faces readily, they ſaw them lye on a heape together.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Bruneo de bonne Mer,</hi> one of them which the Damoſell brought to helpe <hi>Grumedan,</hi> ſaid to him. Seeing wee haue let the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes perceiue, that we know how to breake our Launces, it were very vnreaſonable, that we ſhould aſſaile them any longer on horſebacke; for they being downe, let vs deſcend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Be it as you pleaſe, anſwered <hi>Grumedan,</hi> and diſmounting from their horſes, being couered with their Shields, manly they marched againſt the Romanes, to whom <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griote</hi> ſpake ſo loud as hee could, thus.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue me, Gentlemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> I thinke you make little, or no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at all of vs, or elſe, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to beſtow your horſes on vs, you are content to diſmount ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, as (for your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>kes) we will doe the like.</p>
                  <p>The Romanes, whoſe hearts (be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore) were ſo highly aduanced, as none could reache a loftier pitch.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7181:310"/>
finding their proud hopes to bee thus fruſtrated, were ſo confounded with ſhame, as they would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ſo much as a word, but hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downe their heads, ranne vpon their enemies with ſuch ſwiftnes, as eaſily might their inward malice be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>But if they ſhewed themſelues rough and ſharpe aſſayling, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were not negligent in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, eſpecially <hi>Grumedan,</hi> who in his earneſt deſire to be reuenged, entred among them, laying blowes hardly to be endured, wounding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and receiuing ſome himſelfe. Notwithſtanding, in the end, he and his two companions (laying aſide all care of perill) layde ſuch heauy loade vpon the other, that they were compelled to recoyle, and <hi>Maganil</hi> fell downe backward. Then <hi>Brunco de bonne Mer,</hi> who ſharply purſued him, ſtept vpon him, and violently plucking the helmet from his head, threw him againſt the Scaffold, whereon the Queene and Ladies ſate. Where <hi>Maganil,</hi> ſeeing him ſelfe in danger of death, cryed out for pitty and compaſſion: but <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi> pretending not to heare him, bade him yeeld himſelfe, or elſe hee would ſmite off his head. Sir (quoth he) I will doe whatſoeuer you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund me, and heere I am ready to confeſſe, that I haue lied falſely: for the Romane Knights are not ſuch as I haue boaſted them to be nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way comparable to them of Great <hi>Brittaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This acknowledgement was heard by the Queene, and <hi>Guillan,</hi> who pittying him that ſo earneſtly ſued for pardon, ſaide to <hi>Brunco.</hi> Worthy Grecian Knight, mee thinkes you ſhould haue little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to that head, which is full of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but pride and vain-glory: wherefore, leaue it to himſelfe, as a matter of no value, to the end, that when he is returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> hee may there make report, what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit he got heere by his inſolence and preſumption; the Queene and her Ladies ioyne with me in this ſuite to you.</p>
                  <p>Since ſo vertuous a Princeſſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, doth command me, and you (whom as yet I know not) doe alſo deſire it, farre be it from mee to deny it. So taking his foote off from <hi>Maganil,</hi> he returned to <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan,</hi> who had beaten downe the ſecond, and he likewiſe fearing the loſſe of his head, made the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends as his fellow did.</p>
                  <p>Now there remained none but the third, who had loſt ſo much blood, that he fell downe dead at the feete of <hi>Angriote:</hi> wherefore he tooke him by one legge, and dragde him out of the field. In which while, <hi>Grumedan</hi> remounted on horſebacke, and imaging that his two new friends would follow him, with-drew thence to his owne lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that his wounds might be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto.</p>
                  <p>But ſo ſoone as he was gone, <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> and <hi>Angriote,</hi> without putting off their Helmets, as fearing to bee knowen, preſented themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, and ſaid vnto him. Sir, we muſt now take our leaue of you, and returne to our worthy friend the Greeke Knight, with whom we are ſo much honored and eſteemed, as in no place elſe we can deuiſe to finde the like. Wherefore, if you pleaſe to commaund vs any ſeruice to him, we are ready to doe it with moſt willing mindes. God be your guide, anſwered the King; for certainly, both he and you haue made it ſufficiently knowen, that you are no new learners to deale in ſuch combates.</p>
                  <p>Then the Damoſell, who had bin

their conduct thither, ſaide to the king, that ſhee deſired to ſpeake in priuate with him, concerning a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much importing him. That ſhall you faire Damoſell, ſaid he. So, all being commanded thence, ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the Scaffold, to afford <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> and <hi>Angriote</hi> the better meanes of departure, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>turning the ſame way, as they came; and ſhe being come to the King, beganne thus. Sir, quoth ſhe, you haue hitherto bin held for the moſt eſteemed King of Chriſten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So the Damoſell deſcended, and departed, and arriuing where the two knights were, they rode on to the Sea, finding a Brigandine there attending, which <hi>Graſinda</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them. And becauſe they knew for certainty, that king <hi>Liſuart</hi> had ſet downe his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to deliuer his Daughter the firſt day of the weeke enſuing, they made what haſte poſſibly they could to be with the Greek knight, that he might alſo bee acquainted there-with.</p>
                  <p>And they ſtayed not aboue two dayes and two nights. but they took hauen in the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> where the other were landed but a little before.

                  <p>Madame, I pray you bee no way diſcontented, that thus long I haue concealed my name from you, which is <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> of whom your ſelfe haue often ſpoken. Theſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7181:311"/>
other are my kinred and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, friends and followers, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to doe you any ſeruice what-ſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> anſwered ſhe, you need not deſire any pardon of me, conſidering, you haue neuer offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me: but rather I am highly to be condemned, that haue had you ſo long time in my houſe, not like a great Prince and Lord, as you are, but rather in the nature of a meane Knight errant.</p>
                  <p>And you had reaſon to conceale your ſelfe from me; for if I had ſo well knowen you then, as now I do: I ſhould haue ſtrouen with my beſt endeauour, to doe ſuch honour, as you iuſtly deſerue. Sweete Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, ſaid he, neuer vſe ſuch words, in regard you haue done ſo much for me, as I remaine obliged vnto you while I liue.</p>
                  <p>Walking on in this conference, they entred into the Palace of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidon,</hi> where they found the Tables couered for dinner, and the meate already ſerued in: Scarcely were they ſet downe, but <hi>Angriote, Bruneo</hi> and the Damoſell came in before them, where we need make no doubt of their hearty welcome. And as <hi>Amadis</hi> had queſtioned them, what iſſue <hi>Grumedans</hi> Combate had againſt the Romanes: they related to him, that the King was fully minded, to deliuer his Daughter to the Emper ours Ambaſſadours, and that within three or foure dayes at the vttermoſt.</p>
                  <p>Heereat <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo moued, that his colour preſently chaunged, as being doubtfull, that either they ſhould not haue time enough for her reſcue, or that they of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Iſle,</hi> would not partake with him in ſuch an enterpriſe againſt King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> Therefore to feele how they ſtood affected to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſo ſoone as the dinner was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, falling into much variety of diſcourſe, and growing into ſome reportarie of his long voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, at laſt thus he beganne with them.</p>
                  <p>My worthy and honourable friendes, for ought I can perceiue, matters are much altred in Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ſince we haue bin out of it, and the King hath got him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of humour, then he was wont to haue in precedent times. For I haue ſeene and knowen, that he would readily more regard the affaires of poore diſtreſſed Ladies, then matters of moſt moment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelfe. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to my no little amazement, he is bent to the deſtruction of his own naturall daughter, that peereleſſe Princeſſe, Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> then whom, neuer was childe more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and reſpectiue of her parents, then from time to time ſhe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes declared her ſelfe. And yet, as <hi>Angriote</hi> and <hi>Bruneo</hi> doe plainly tell me, without regard of all this duty and obedience, euen in the meere deſpight of her, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the iudgement of all the Lords of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> he hath relegated and confined her, to the onely man in the world, whom ſhe moſt hateth; which moueth me ſo much to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate her caſe, as, if you would both beleeue me, and lend me your aſſiſtance, we would free her from this thraldome, and ſet her at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>
                  <p>Sighing and pauſing a while, hee began againe in this maner. What-ſoeuer I haue ſaid (my deare-eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med kinſmen and friends,) aſſure your ſelues, that I will not vndertake any thing, without your counſell and furtherance. And yet wee ſhould all remember the ſolemne oath we made to the Queene <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſena,</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:7181:311"/>
at the very laſt Court held in the City of <hi>London:</hi> where wee then ſware, neuer to ſuffer wrong to be done to any Lady or Damoſell, if ſhe required helpe of vs. Shall we now then endure, that ſhe ſhall be captined, and vyllie entreated, of whom (heeretofore) we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo many honorable fauours? Shall the Ladies and Virgins of her company, be carried away perforce, and (for euer) baniſhed from their owne country? Before God, I ſpeake it, if we doe ſuffer this hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous indignity, we are well worthy of eternall blame, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or pretence to ſhield vs: nay, we ſhall fall into the baſe reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of recreant and vnworthy knights, regardleſſe both of honour and Armes.</p>
                  <p>Let vs then aduiſe here together, what you think meeteſt to be done. For, as concerning my ſelfe, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to deferre a voyage, long ſince by me intended: as, not many dayes ſince, I made knowen to my Couſin <hi>Agraies, Floreſtan,</hi> and others, by <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and now with ſuch Ships as I ſhould finde heere, labour ſo much as lies in me, to breake the purpoſe of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and reſcue ſo many wronged Ladies. Among whom, next to the moſt wofull Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> is vertuous <hi>Olinda,</hi> whom the King (in this new-deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed tyranny) will compell to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> albeit vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne liking.</p>
                  <p>And now Lords, let me mooue one matter to you: I would gladly know, by what autority he can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant this crueltie, to them that are none of his ſubiects, neither borne within any of his Dominions? There is my Couſin <hi>Mabila,</hi> ſent by the King her father into Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> not to be confined for <hi>Rome,</hi> but to remaine with the Queene, and keep the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to whom her loue hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bin ſuch, as neuer could bed greater betweene two Princeſſes. And I much maruall, that his whole kingdome doth not reuolt againſt him, or (at leaſt) ſome bold and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Knight vnder-take the cauſe, to counter check his folly honorably by Armes.</p>
                  <p>We ſee (deare friends) that no one (as yet) ſteppes forth in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and therefore I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you, that, according to the ancient commendable cuſtome, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently obſerued among alknights errant: you would be carefull, that ſuch a ſhamefull and diſhonourable deed may not be done. In ſo doing, we ſhall winne more fame and true renowne, then euer hitherto we haue done, without any euill impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or ſiniſter miſconſtruction. Tell me then, what you thinke here-of, to the end, that according to ſome reſolued concluſion, we may take order for the moſt expedient execution.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Agraies,</hi> whom it neereſt concerned, as well for his Siſter, as for the honorable affection he bare to <hi>Olinda,</hi> as hath bin declared to you in the firſt booke: anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all, in this manner. I know not where the man is, that would be dull or ſlow in ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table an enterpriſe; conſidering, that before you (my Lord and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin) arriued here: we were all aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in this place, to make prouiſion for this in conuenience. And now, that you finde vs ſo conformable to your will, I am certaine, that no man among vs, is of any other minde; but that Fortune meerely calles vs, to vndertake the buſineſſe, and promiſes vs an vndoubted vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. For ſhe ſeemeth weary, that ſhe hath fauoured King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſo
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7181:312"/>
long a time, and he makes no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment thereof any manner of way. Why ſhould hee ſend my Siſter (againſt her wil) into a ſtrange countrie? Did my Father giue her him, to diſpoſe of at his pleaſure? You all know, that ſoone after our departure from Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> I demanded her of the Queene: but ſhe denyed me, ſending me word by <hi>Gandales,</hi> that ſhe would keepe and reſpect her as her owne perſon. Is this then kindſhip, or courteſie, to keepe her in ſuch ſort, as to ouer-throw all her fortunes in the end? <hi>Mabila,</hi> hath ſhe no other place of retirement, but to the Court of the Emperour? Is not the kingdome of SCOTLAND of ſufficient opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, for her breeding and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</p>
                  <p>Striking his hand on his breſt, with a very ſmall pauſe, he brake forth againe thus. I proteſt before God, this dealing of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> is both vile and diſhonourable; yea, and ſo farre off from common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that I had rather die a thouſand deathes (if it were poſſible for me) then not to be reuenged; and alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I haue acquainted the King my Father herewith, that he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide ſome remedie for it. In the meane while, let me entreate you al, my honorable Lords and friends, to lend me your aſſiſtance, eſpecially you, whom this iniurie toucheth as neerely as my ſelfe, it being offered, not only to the perſon of my Siſter, your Couſin and neere kinred: but alſo to <hi>Olinda</hi> &amp; others, for whom, according to our ſolemne oath and promiſe (as my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> hath well remembred) wee ought in duty to ſteppe forth, and ſtand as their protectors and defenders.</p>
                  <p>Lords, ſaid <hi>Quedragant,</hi> as for my ſelfe, I am ready to depart, when it ſhall pleaſe the company, and if I make any ſpare of my paines, let me be excluded from all good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and I beleeue there is no man heere among vs, but he will ſay as much as I haue done. For, if wee hazard our liues often, and vpon little or ſleight occaſion: we haue great reaſon now to aduenture fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not to be ſparing of our very vttermoſt endeauour. How ſay ye, my friends, haue I not ſpoken the trueth?</p>
                  <p>Then euery one anſwered, that no danger, or death ſhould cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deferring, but it required quicke and ſpeedy diligence, to keepe the Romanes, from paſſing through the ſtraites of the Mediterranean Sea, before any fight were made vpon them. Eaſily, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhal we make this prouiſion, for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning wee will be all well ſhipt, and winne the way before them; which was ſet downe for a full reſolue.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Graſinda</hi> was preſent at all this conference; and ſhe to giue them the more encouragement, ſaid. Before God, Gentlemen, your enterpriſe is high, and worthy of the greateſt commendation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that beſide the good you ſhall doe to her, whoſe helpe and reſcue you intend, you ſhal giue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to many other worthy Knights (either of this, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrange Country) that heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by your imitation) they ſuffer no ſhame or wrong to be done, to any Lady or Gentlewoman whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer. Wherein you will make your ſelues ſo memoratiue to them, that ſhe, or they that now liue, or ſhal many hundreds of yeares here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, will ſing rare Peans of your praiſes.</p>
                  <p>Madame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> God enable vs to effect our enterpriſe, according as (I know) you heartily
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7181:312"/>
wiſh it. In the meane while, if you be ſo pleaſed, you ſhal remain here, in the company of <hi>Yſanie,</hi> the good old Gouernour of this Iſland, who ſhall be as obedient to you, as to my ſelfe. Maiſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> muſt go with me, becauſe I repoſe great truſt in him. My Lord (quoth ſhe) you may diſpoſe of me and mine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as to you ſeemeth beſt. <hi>Amadis</hi> humbly thanked her, and gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that euery man ſhould bee prepared, to go aboord thoſe Ships, by breake of day, which <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> had there readily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, according as they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſent them by <hi>Gandalin.</hi> Then, the next day, being all embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued, they ſet ſaile directly for Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> hoping to meet with the Romans, as afterward they did.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He day being come, according to King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarts</hi> promiſe, that he would deliuer his Daughter to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, to be conducted to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, hee continuing conſtant in his wilful opinion, without any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of alteration, either of pitty to her, importunity vſed by the Queene, and all the graue aduice of his Lords to the contrary. To effect the full iſſue of his owne humour, he went to her Chamber, where ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe by her, and taking her by the hand, thus he ſpake. Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you haue euermore ſhewen your ſelfe obedient to my will, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vſing any contradiction: will you now hold on in the ſame mind, according as Reaſon doth require? You haue put on a ſad and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly diſpoſition, at the marriage which I haue determin'd for you, whereat I am not a little amazed. Do you imagine, that I would doe any thing, but for your benefite and honor? or can you conceipt any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in clination in me towards you? I ſweare to you vpon my faith, that the loue I beare you is ſo certaine, as I do no leſſe grieue for your farre abſence from me, then you can doe your ſelfe. But you doe well know, that it is impoſſible, to prouide ſuch an happines for you neerer home. Wherefore I pray you, that in vſing your wonted wiſdome and diſcretion, you would ſhew a more chearefull countenance, &amp; reioyce in the great fortune ordained for you, being wife to the greateſt Prince in the world. If you doe, (beſides the high eſtimation gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be made of you) you ſhall glad your fathers ſoule, who grieues at your ſtrange alteration, as no man poſſibly can doe more.</p>
                  <p>During all theſe ſpeeches, <hi>Oriana</hi> had her ſpirits ſo contracted, that ſhe was not able to ſhed a teare; and therefore, as a woman, out of ſenſe of her own ſorrow, ſeeing there was now no further remedy for her, with a bolde and ſtedfaſt reſolution, thus ſhee replied. My Lord, you haue then (for ought I can otherwiſe perceiue) reſolued on my mariage
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7181:313"/>
to the Emperor: but therein (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily) you haue committed one of the greateſt errors, that any Prince aliue can doe. For firſt, ſo long as my life laſteth, I ſhall neuer loue the husband you haue choſen for mee; and next, I am very certaine, (as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes I haue told you already) that I ſhall neuer ſee <hi>Rome:</hi> rather ſhall the fiſhes vſe their mercy to me, then I will goe to a home that is my hell, or dwel where I can haue no affection or deſire. And I am of the minde, that you could not be heereto induced or perſwaded, but onely in the loue you beare to my Siſter, being deſirous to leaue your inheritance to her, and make mee heire to all the miſeries in the world. Neuertheleſſe, God, who is iuſt, will neuer ſuffer this your vnreaſonable purpoſe to take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; ſooner he will marry mee to my death.</p>
                  <p>When the King heard <hi>Oriana</hi> anſwere in this manner, pitty and anger mixing themſelues together, made him likewiſe change his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer language, and thinking to win her by menaces, ſaid. You play the foole with me, and you will not yeeld, for all the entreaties I can make: but if you dallie thus with me any longer, inſteed of wiuing you to the Emperour, I will wed you to the Tower, and where you ſhall ſee neither Sunne nor Moone. My Lord, quoth ſhe, you can not commit me to a more hatefull pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then <hi>Rome,</hi> and you ſhall doe me a great grace, to make me an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting dweller in your Tower. Then aroſe the King, very highly diſpleaſed, and leauing her, went to the Queene, ſaying to her. I pray you go to your daughter; for, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the meanes I can vſe to her, ſhe will not be ſent to the Emperour, and I cannot reuoke my promiſe to the Ambaſſadours.</p>
                  <p>Now, you muſt obſerue, that the Queene had practiſed all poſſible wayes, to breake off this intended mariage, till ſuch time, as at her laſt mouing the matter, the King grew ſo offended, that he charged her to motion it no more, except ſhee meant to endure his heauy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Wherefore, as not daring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe him any further, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning him any anſwer, ſhe went to <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom ſhe found ſo full of ſorrow, as none could be more. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> leaned on her left arme, beating her other hand againſt her breſt; when the Queen ſaid to her. Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the king is wonderfully offended with you: I pray you be obedient to him, ſeeing all that he doth, is for your good and honor. Ah Mother, (quoth ſhe) I ſee now that I am loſt for euer; for I feel death ſo nere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching, as it is impoſſible for me to liue any longer. Speaking theſe words, ſhe fell down in a ſwoun, and the Queene likewiſe hard by her, which made the Ladies cry out ſo loud, that the King heard it, &amp; came thither, imagining that <hi>Oriana</hi> was dead indeed. But finding it no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then a traunce, he would needs haue her caried ſo aboard the Ship, notwithſtanding all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies teares, &amp; mourneful entreaties.</p>
                  <p>Being thus brought into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine appointed for her, the Ladies were likewiſe ledde thither, that ſhould go with her, among whom was <hi>Olinda,</hi> ſtrugling and ſtriuing with all her might, &amp; crying to the King, that ſhe might not be ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently forced and abuſed. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he would not lend her any attention, but ſuffered her ſo to be hurried thence, ſo great was his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of ſpirit. Before they weighed ankers, he called to the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> and other the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7181:313"/>
choiſeſt of the Ambaſſadours, to whom he recommended his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: praying them to entreate her in all honourable manner. Which they promiſed to doe; and taking a ſolemne farewell each of other, the King returned to his Court, and the Romanes launching forth into the Maine, ſoone loſt the Coaſte of <hi>Tagades, Oriana</hi> not knowing or perceiuing any thing, ſuch was her rapture quite from her ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſadours to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, had bequeathed <hi>Mabila</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to keepe company with her in her Cabine; and the Queene <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira,</hi> with the reſt of the women, were beſtowed in another Shippe, and ſo (in no litle ioy) ſayle on the Romanes, till at length they deſcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Sea, a great Fleete of Shippes, making directly towards them.</p>
                  <p>But, at the firſt ſight, taking them to be either Merchants, or ſome ſuch other peaceable people, they made no further reckoning of them. By and by they beheld them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide into three ſeuerall bands, and make faſt on them, by the helpe of oares: which gaue them good cauſe to prepare for defence, if they ſhould aſſaile them. But I am ſure you perceiue, that this was the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour for <hi>Oriana,</hi> led by noble <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and a great number of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Knights, as well of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> as diuers other of his friends thus met together, all determining to dye, rather then to permit the Ladies to be thus forcibly carried away.</p>
                  <p>When they perceiued ſo many ſailes together, and in ſuch martiall manner prepared, eſpecially for ſo great a conuoy, there grew a iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous doubt among ſome of them; which <hi>Amadis</hi> perceiuing, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, leſt their ſuſpition might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harten the reſt, he ſpake to them in this manner. My honorable friends and companions, were I not fully aſſured of the vertue and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity remaining in you, I ſhould (doubtleſſe) be ſlow enough, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding the fight againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that comes ſo ſtrongly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs. Neuertheles, knowing you to be ſuch as you are, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes haue beene; eſpecially, the iuſt occaſion that hath called vs all hether: it appeareth to me, that we ſhould not inſiſt on the leaſt delay, but, ſetting aſide all ſeruile feare, goe couragiouſly to the buſines. The captiuity of ſo many deſolate Ladies, ſtand as inciting obiects to our eyes, and honour calles vs to their reſcue, by our ſolemne oathes taken for their freedome. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I earneſtly entreate you, that we may brauely boord their Ships, and make ſuch expreſſion of our duty, that ſetting the Ladies at libertie, the conductors of them may carry no tydings to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner were theſe wordes thus ſpoken, but Drummes and Trumpets ſounded chearefully: for the two Fleetes were ſo neere each to other, as there could be no ſhrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king backe from fight. Now, Darts, Slings, Arrowes, wilde fire balles, and other offenſiue engines, flew li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>) was ſo fierce, as no iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be giuen, which ſide had the better or worſe. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> (by the meanes of that exquiſite Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, Maſter <hi>Eliſabet)</hi> got before the winde, and ſunke two or three of the Shippes of the enemie. At the very ſame inſtant, the Ship where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Agrates</hi> and <hi>Quedragant</hi> were, by the meanes of grapling y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, caught hold on that of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7181:314"/>
Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> and the men entred into her. But if <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Quedragant</hi> made ample proofe of their manhood: <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> and <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the Dreadfull Dale</hi> did no leſſe, hauing boarded another Ship hard by. For they aſſailed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Ancona,</hi> and the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Tarente,</hi> while <hi>Amadis</hi> fought with the Ship wherein <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiell</hi> was; whereto hee had moſt minde, becauſe it ſeemed the beſt diſpoſed, and had a goodly Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, with great ſtore of Flags and Streamers, bearing the armes of the Emperour, euen as Admirall of the whole Fleet, which made him imagine, that the Princeſſe was there.</p>
                  <p>Great and ſtout reſiſtance was a long while made, but <hi>Amadis</hi> and his followers plyed them ſo hotly, that they cut ſo many in pieces, as they met withall, crying out aloud, <hi>Amadis, Amadis, Gaule, Gaule.</hi> As he purſued on in this good ſucceſſe, he met with <hi>Brandaiell,</hi> to whom hee gaue ſuch a ſtroke on the helmet, as he ouerthrew him; and tearing it from his head, made ſhew, as if he would ſmite it off. Alas Sir (cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out <hi>Brandaiel)</hi> take ſuch ranſome of me as you pleaſe, and ſaue my life.</p>
                  <p>Tell me then, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> what haſt thou done with <hi>Oriana?</hi> You ſhall finde her (quoth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mabila</hi> being in the Cabine with the Princeſſe, had formerly heard the voyce of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and <hi>Gaule,</hi> and ſaid to <hi>Oriana,</hi> being laide (much trobled in mind) vpon a rich Couch, and had heard nothing al this while of the fight: Madame, beleeue, that heauen hath ſent vs helpe; for me thinkes I heare your <hi>Amadis,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring for you, therefore raiſe vp your ſpirits, and reioyce. At the very word <hi>Amadis,</hi> the Princeſſe ſeemed to riſe (as with a ſudden ſtart) demaunding, where is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madame, quoth ſhe, I heard him (I am certaine) euen now both ſpeake and fight in the ſame Shippe where we now are. Doe not you yet heare the noyſe among the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shippes? Vndoubtedly, the fight is hot and fierce. Come, come, deare <hi>Mabila,</hi> anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> queſtionleſſe you are in a dreame. No, vpon my ſoule, replyed <hi>Mabila,</hi> I heard the ſlaſhes of Swordes, and the noyſe of a very potent Fleete.</p>
                  <p>At this very word, <hi>Amadis</hi> entred, and ſeeing <hi>Oriana,</hi> he fell on his knee before her. But ſhe (ouer-come with extremitie of ioy) held him by the arme, and glewed her lippes ſo faſt to his, as if ſhe meant they ſhould neuer be parted, and thus ſhe ſtood a long while, robde of all power for ſpeech, till at length ſhe ſaid. Ah my deareſt Loue, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I am now in your cuſtody, I feare not them that would take me from you, or going any further with them, for Death it ſelfe ſhall now neuer more diuide vs. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, ſaid he, one of the greateſt fauours that euer heauen affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me, is this, in giuing me ſo good an occaſion of returne into this country, onely to doe ſuch needfull ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>As they meant to continue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger this kinde of diſcourſe, <hi>Mabila</hi> ſaid vnto them. Why ſtand you muſing in this manner? Doe you
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7181:314"/>
not ſee Sir, what need there is of your helpe in yonder other Ships, where the fight is fiercer and fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer? Good Couſin, goe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour your deare friendes, you may afterward conuerſe at more leyſure with the Princeſſe. Goe then, deare hart, ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> and returne againe ſo ſoone as you can to me. Then he departed out of the Cabin, leauing <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Mabila</hi> to the charge of <hi>Angriote,</hi> and entring his owne Ship, beheld <hi>Landin de Faiarque,</hi> and his aſſociats, aſſayled by a Romane Veſſell, that preſſed very furiouſly vpon them. But hee made in with ſuch a ſtrength, as they were ſoone ſunke: And now remained no more to bee fought withall, but that Ship wherein the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide</hi> was, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted ſtoutly againſt <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Quedragant.</hi> Neuertheleſſe, at the arriuall of <hi>Amadis</hi> the Prince by no meanes could auoyde, but that he was ſmitten downe vpon the Orelope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agraies,</hi> who hated him to the death, becauſe he caried away his beloued <hi>Olinda</hi> forcibly; caught the Helmet from off his head, and (at one blow) parted it from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Now, the Knights of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Iſle,</hi> ſeeing Fortune had bin ſo fauourable to them, placed guardes vpon the conquered Ships, while <hi>Amadis,</hi> went to enquire for the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ladies (whom he found in the Ship, where the Prince <hi>Saluſt Quide</hi> lay ſlaine) quaking like leaues vpon a tree.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Olinda</hi> eſpied <hi>Agraies,</hi> ſhe (more ioyfull then euer) ranne and embraced him, before he had a ſight of her: but afterward, ouercome with the ſame extremity of delight, making a low reuerence to her, he ſaid. Madame, I pray you pardon what I haue done to the Prince <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſte Quide,</hi> who in ſeeking to make you his wife and miſtreſſe, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the reward of his preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by my Sword.</p>
                  <p>Sir, quoth ſhe, I know not what might mooue him to affect me ſo much, conſidering, I neuer ſhewed leſſe loue to any man liuing: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what he ſought to compaſſe by extremity, hath returned vpon him condigne puniſhment, and now I neede mourne the leſſe for a whole yeare. But I pray you tell me, how you happened to ſuccour vs in ſuch a need? Madame, ſaid he, that muſt be related at more leyſure, when all this tumult is blowen ouer.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Olinda</hi> were thus in talke together, <hi>Amadis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> (who knew not him) and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, deſiring her, not to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for the diſaſter happening to her company: but ſhee wept ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely, as that it would haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any heart to pitty, which made him leaue her, and goe to the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell of <hi>Denmarke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Queene demaunded of <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> what he was that had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to her? Madame, quoth he, it is Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> that worthy Knight. Nay then, ſaid ſhe, I am of better comfort then euer, and cannot faile of good entertainment in his company: for all my life time I haue heard, that all Ladies and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels receiued from him nothing but honor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> ouer-hearing her, left the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to her againe, ſaid. Madame, you may thinke your ſelfe as ſafe, and welcome into this company, as when you were with the Prince <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſte Quide;</hi> and therefore bee no longer diſconſolate. Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:7181:315"/>
anſwered ſhee, I haue heard euery where reported, what honorable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours you haue extended to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which giueth mee ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that you will deale with me no worſſe, but better if you can. And reaſon good, Madame, ſaid he, for you being a Queene, deſerue to haue the very beſt entertainement. And as for my ſelfe, I promiſe you on my faith, that I will endeuour what I can for you: and to begin my word with you, if you be ſo pleaſed, I will conduct you to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame <hi>Oriana,</hi> to the end, that you being both together, may enioy conſolation one with another, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to your owne contentments and liking.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Amadis</hi> commanding the two Ships to be vnited together, and entring into that where the Princeſſe was, leading the Queene <hi>Sardamira</hi> by the hand, he preſented her to <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſaying. Madam, here is the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> and all the Ladies and Gentlewomen that ſhould attend you, who deſire, that you would accept of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>Amadis</hi> (quoth ſhe) I am your priſoner, and therefore you may and muſt command me, well knew <hi>Amadis,</hi> that ſhe ſpake theſe words, onely to palliate their cloſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherefore hee would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere her one word: but <hi>Oriana</hi> ſhaping her courſe to the Queene, ſpake thus. For ought I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Madam, we muſt take another way now, then going to <hi>Rome,</hi> and endure our fortunes patiently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no other remedy. Further on ſhee would haue thus proceeded, but that <hi>Agraies</hi> entred the Cabine, leading <hi>Olinda</hi> by the hand, which <hi>Oriana</hi> perceiuing, ſhe left the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> and came and imbraced them, as one that had not in a longtime ſeene them. The like ſhe did to <hi>Floreſtan, Quedragant,</hi> and many more, than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them perticularly, for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall fauours done vnto her: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Garnate,</hi> to whom ſhee ſaid. My worthy friend <hi>Garnate,</hi> but for you, I had beene dead: but the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you brought me from <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> did preſently reuiue me. Madame, ſaid he, I did but my duty as very glady I would doe, in all occaſions elſe, you pleaſe to command me.</p>
                  <p>After theſe courteſies, to all that came and preſented themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her; ſhe called <hi>Amadis</hi> aſide, and ſaid vnto him. Beleeue mee (ſweet friend) if I had gone on but a little further, all your right had beene loſt with mee: but our Lord hath prouided better for vs both, and now I am where willingly I would be. Madam (quoth hee) I haue not done any thing for you, equall to the infinite of your graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fauours towards mee: and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire pardon for your greeuous feare, which this rude encounter could not but put vpon you. I heard none at all, ſaid ſhee, I was ſo ouercome with extreame melancholy &amp; if <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila</hi> had not told me of it, I had bin as vtterly ignorant of any fight, as they that dwell in Great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> But tell me I pray you, whether are you minded to cary mee? Let mee coniure you (deare ſweet) by all the loue you haue euer borne mee, that ſeeing wee are now met together, and in ſo good company: you would ſpeake nothing to me in any place, that may returne to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice, but when you are willing to command any thing, your Couſine <hi>Mabila</hi> may eaſilie enterpret be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs. My further intent is, to be conuayed to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> where I would gladly be: till hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen afford more fauour for mee, and my Father may vnderſtand
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7181:315"/>
what wrong he hath done me. Let me liue no longer Madame (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis,</hi> then to doe you my vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt ſeruice; wherefore you may well perſwade your ſelfe, that your will ſhall any way be accompliſhed. And I hold it very expedient, that you ſhould make your mind known to <hi>Agraies, Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> who couet nothing more, then to pleaſe you with their vttermoſt paines. Well (quoth <hi>Oriana)</hi> when you meete in counſell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will ſend your Couſin to them, to know how they wil diſpoſe of me.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Amadis</hi> departed from her, and called all the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle</hi> in counſell, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand which way they would take. Many contrary opinions paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, ſome thought it meet, that <hi>Oriana</hi> ſhould be conueyed to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle;</hi> others would haue her into <hi>Gaule,</hi> to king <hi>Perion:</hi> but the moſt part agreed for SCOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND; till <hi>Mabila</hi> comming to them, ſaid. My Lords, Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> entreates you, that ſhe may bee conducted to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> vntill her reconciliation with her father King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> And ſeeing you haue already ſo well begunne this buſines, that, proceeding on from good to better, you would ſtill ſtand faſt for her, as alwayes you haue done for diſtreſſed Ladies and Damoſels requiring your help, with due conſideration had to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her perſon. Madame, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Quedragant,</hi> I am ſure, that my Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> and al we of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, are determinately reſolued, to ſerue her till death, without ſpare of coyne, friendes, or any thing elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning in our power, yea, were it againſt the King her father, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, or any other that dare of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her, not doubting, but by the helpe of God, and the iuſtice of our cauſe in doing her ſeruice, we may lawfully make reſiſtance againſt them. Conſidering alſo, that there is not a man among vs, but hath ſolemnely ſworne, neuer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from this aſſociation, vntill ſhe be at perfect liberty. And ſo you may ſafely aſſure her from vs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all which hath bin ſaid, as not to be denyed by any one in this company.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mabila</hi> thanking them moſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionatly, departed from them, and comming to <hi>Oriana,</hi> declared what the Knight had ſaid vnto her, wherof ſhe was not a litle ioyful, &amp; inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all betook themſelues to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral Ships.

The Queene returned her this anſwere. Lady, it is eaſie for him that is in ioy, to comfort (as you doe) one downe caſt with griefe. Neuertheleſſe, if you felt the woe that ouer-maiſtereth me: you would complaine (pehaps) much more then I doe. And yet I well know, that you tell me truth, although it is impoſſible for mee, ſo much to command ouer mine own paſſions, as (inſtantly) to follow your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Wherefore (for Gods ſake) let me entreat you, that in excuſing my imperfections, you, and all the Ladies here would rather helpe me, in the due complaint of mine vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerable vnhappineſſe. Madame, anſwered <hi>Mabila,</hi> if this greefe, which you entreat of vs, would doe you any good, I dare ſweare to you vpon my faith, that in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany there is no one Lady (as I thinke) but willingly would doe it withall her heart. But then you know withall that when it is ſo don; there muſt be (of neceſſitie) an end of your mourning, either by the compulſion of time, or as wiſdome commandeth.</p>
                  <p>Continuing in theſe remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, <hi>Oriana</hi> returned to them againe, and found the Queene in more moderation of her ſorrow. During this time, <hi>Amadis</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen order, to hoiſe ſailes, and make for the <hi>Encloſed-Iſle,</hi> which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the third day following: in regarde whereof <hi>Gandalin</hi> was ſent before in a Skiffe, to aduertiſe <hi>Graſinda</hi> of their comming, which being vnderſtood by her, ſhe was ſo highly pleaſed, as none could be more: eſpecially when ſhe heard of their victorie, and conqueſt made of ſo many Ladies and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſells, but chiefly of <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom ſhe deſired to ſee more then any other. For which cauſe, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared her ſelfe (in the beſt manner ſhe could deuiſe) to entertaine her, preſuming ſo much on her ſelfe, that (without all doubt) ſhe ſhould accompliſh the aduenture of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidons</hi> Pallace, and attaine to (in her preſence) the verie higheſt degree of honour, that euer Lady or Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell might doe.</p>
                  <p>Seeing them approach ſome-what neere, ſhe entred into a Barge to meete them: when <hi>Oriana</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of <hi>Bruneo,</hi> of whence, and what ſhee was. Madame, quoth he, I beleeue it is <hi>Graſinda,</hi> ſhe that ſo lately obtained (by the meanes of Lord <hi>Amadis)</hi> the prize for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, againſt all the faireſt maides and Virgins in the King your fathers Court, and ſurely, I take her to be one of the wiſeſt Ladies, that euer I haue ſeene. Then hee related at large, the honour, gracious enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, and fauours ſhe had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded them, during their ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in her Countrie. Beleeue me Sir, ſaid the Princeſſe, you ſhall ſhew your ſelfe very ingratefull to her, if you doe not make due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of ſuch courteſie, when ſhe hath occaſion to imploy you.</p>
                  <p>As thus ſhe concluded, <hi>Granſinda</hi> came aboord their Ship, <hi>Angriote</hi> ſtepping foorth to helpe her vp, and preſenting her to <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſaid. Behold Madame, this is the Ladie, to whom my Lord <hi>Amadis, Bruneo</hi> and I are beholding for our liues. At theſe words, the Princeſſe and <hi>Graſinda</hi> made reuerence to each other, and ſo paſſing on into the port, they went a ſhoare, many goodly palfrayes (very richly trapt and harneſſed) there wayting to receiue them, whereon they all mounted. Then, being conducted by the Knights, they rode on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> and (by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7181:320"/>
the way) diſcourſing, what honour <hi>Amadis</hi> had wonne in King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarts</hi> Court, vnder the name of the Greeke Knight: <hi>Oriana</hi> ſaid to <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinda,</hi> I promiſe you Madame, if I had knowne it, you ſhould not haue had ſuch contentment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me: but I neuer heard of any thing, vntill it was ended. That was my onely ioy, anſwered <hi>Graſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and the higheſt fauour Fortune could doe me, for if you had beene preſent (conſidering your rare and admirable beautie) I hardly thinke, that my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> (how good a Knight ſoeuer hee is) would haue finiſhed his enterpriſe, to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and mine: for the Crowne had beene due to you, beyond all other in reaſon, but you being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Conqueſt only was made for me.</p>
                  <p>As ſhe ended theſe words, ſhe perceiued <hi>Amadis</hi> to be very nere, and fearing leaſt her liberality of ſpeech had offended him; in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing her ſelfe, ſhe prayed him to pardon her. For neuer (quoth ſhee) did mine eyes hope to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſo abſolute a beauty as this of Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> therefore I cannot but confeſſe her right aboue all other. <hi>Amadis</hi> being not a little pleaſed, to heare her ſo highly commended, whom (beyond all things elſe) he moſt eſteemed, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, thus replied. By my faith, I ſhould confeſſe my ſelfe voide of all good iudgement, if I ſhould thinke ill of the honour you doe to Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſhe deſeruing the title of the moſt vertuous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe that I know. <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abaſhed at ſuch great prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: could not ſo well containe her ſelfe, but that a vermil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion bluſh lept vp into her face, which made her appeare tenne times more perfect. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, thinking more on her inſtant happie Fortune, then the due merit of her beautie, ſhe ſaid to <hi>Graſinda.</hi> I will not now contradict the good opinion, which it hath pleaſed you to conceiue of mee, for then I ſhould conteſt with a perſon of moſt pregnant iudgement: it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſeth mee, I dare aſſure you, that (ſuch as I am) all my life time, I ſhall wiſh your welfare and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement, ſo much as lies in the power of a poore diſinherited La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to doe, for now you ſee me in no better condition.</p>
                  <p>So long laſted this kinde of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, that they arriued at the Pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> where they all alighted with the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana.</hi> Now, becauſe it was one of the moſt ſumptuous buildings in all the world: I thought it not a miſſe, to deſcribe it by writing.</p>

of white-marble. At the front of this foundation, was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Pallace, which had in his ſquare, an hundred, fortie and one fadomes, and at the foure corners, was exalted foure huge Towers, one of Azure ſtone; the ſecond of Iris or Opall-ſtone; the third of Chriſolite; and the fourth of Iaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; which had in the Diameter of their circumference, eight fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, two foote, and three inches. In each of them was two Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, foure warderobes, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cabinets: comprehending in theſe, the <hi>Defended Chamber,</hi> which was in the Tower of Azure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
                  <p>Now, in regard it was the moſt excellent of the reſt, I will deſcribe the ſingularities thereof ſeuerally to you. It was wainſcotted about with vnicornes horne, faſhioned like to the feete of Lampes, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with Lignum, Aloes, Balme and Cedar, all wrought in antique engrauerie with fine gold, thickly embelliſhed with enamelled flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets. The pauement was of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolite, carued in loue knots, enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Corall and Cipres, cut in little ſcales, and faſtened with threds of gold. The doore and window worke was of Ebonie, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with ſiluer mouldes, and the glaſſe all Chriſtall. All the chinks and crannies of the Warderobes and Cabinets, were ſtuffed with Agats, cut in Lozenges, wherein (euen as it were naturally) infinit figures of all kinde of creatures were plainely to be ſeene. In the roofe of this Chamber hung two Lampes of gold, at the bottomes whereof were enchaſed two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, which gaue ſo bright a ſolendour round about the roome, that there was no neede of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light.</p>
                  <p>But all this riches was of ſlender value, in regard of a Mirrour or Looking-glaſſe of white Saphire, the onely orientall that euer was ſeene, which had three feete in ſquare, ſtanding vpon a plate of gold, ſo bordered and garniſhed with great Diamonds, Emeralds, Rubies and Pearles, as neuer was ſeene a thing more to be admired. Betweene thoſe foure Towers, whereof I haue told you, were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted foure faire great Halls, all of equall largeneſſe, the worke being throughout of Porphirie-ſtone, with Dorick pillers, contayning thirtie foote in height, fixed vpon baſes of braſſe, couered with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans of gold, vnder Architranes of Porſeline, vpon which were Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of Iuorie, with diuers deuiſes in all languages: and aboue thoſe Frizes, were Corniſhes of Topaze, enriched with Turkeſſes. Directly facing the portall of this Pallace, had <hi>Apolidon</hi> formerly placed thoſe Perrons, whereof we haue ſpoken in the firſt and ſecond Bookes, and next to them, the Arke of loyall Louers, as already you had heard.</p>
                  <p>Paſſing on further, you ſhould enter into a very goodly Court, contayning three and fiftie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in ſquare, Orthogonally cornered by iuſt leuell of line, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paued with Iaſper-ſtone, wrought in workes after the Moſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the Diameter round about were foure other ſumptuous Halls, of twentie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in height, deuided by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Towers, of no leſſe beautie then the former. The winding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7181:321"/>
ſtaires conducting to them, were of guilded copper, made in the forme of a lanterne, retained by bowing pillers, and ſuſtained with Atticque Collomnes of Craterite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone (very hard to cut) after the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient manner, and the mounting of theſe ſtaires met not together, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by line Orthogonall, or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligonall in angle.</p>
                  <p>This dungeon had foure ſtages or roomes vpon one platforme, wherein were ſixteene great lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and in the midſt roſe vp the gyring ſtaire, and foure Pauillions, beſide the foure Towers wee ſpake of before, which with the ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillions, ſurmounted the platforme of two ſtages vnder couerture. Now, to tell you whereof this dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon was made, you muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the firſt ſtage was of Chalcidonie-ſtone, enriched with Dorick collomnes of very white Alablaſter, with mouldes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances anſwereable to the others height. The ſecond ſtage or roome, was of greene Marble, brought from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Ionick collomnes of fiue Topas, mouldings, heads, baſes and ſeatings like to the other. The third ſtage was of red Marble, with ſpeckled Corinthian collomnes of Iuorie. And the fourth was of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthe, with Proeſme Tuſcane col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomnes of Emerald.</p>
                  <p>Eaſily might theſe repeated plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes beſeene, vnder which were the foure ſtages, paued with Poiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, as alſo thoſe of the foure Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillions, and all the reſt ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the chiefe plat formes, made of wood of Cypres, Codar and Cethin, which cannot be toucht by any corruption, couered with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Pearle, and the reſt of them with glaſſe of fine tranſparant ſteele, knit together with fillets of gold. All the portalls of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace were of pure Alablaſter, wrought in the forme of damaske worke, with mouldings, tympaines and frontiſſons of Amber, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million Agath: whereon were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly engrauen in antique ſhapes (euidently to bee knowne) many battailes and redoubted ſeruices, as well of the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> as of the <hi>Gaules:</hi> and vnderneath them, the Images of <hi>Prapus Mars</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> with thoſe other of <hi>Venus, Ceres</hi> and <hi>Miaerua</hi> of the beſt polliſhed white marble that euer was ſeene. And <hi>Apolidon</hi> cauſed the moulding workes and portalls, to be expreſſely made of Diamonds, to the end, that as they were opened, they might ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of themſelues, euen by the meere vertue of that ſtone. The Pauillions and Towers were ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally garniſhed, with ſixe and fifty Chambers, foure-ſcore Warde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes, and as many double Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, the beſt guilded and adorned that poſſibly might be.</p>
                  <p>Paſſing through this ſecond Court, entrance was into a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed meaſure of the buildings quarter, it was naturally planted withall kindes of ſluores and good hearbes that could be deſired. In the midſt thereof ſtood a goodly fountaine, the water iſſuing from the two dugges of a <hi>Venus,</hi> mode of Agath (mounted on a great piller of Emerald proeſme) and falling into an huge Baſen of Azure ſtone.

the ſelfe ſame golden Apple, which <hi>Paris</hi> adiudged to her, when he was made the arbi rator for the three gaddeſſes in <hi>Ida</hi> Forreſt, whereon followed that vnfortunate warre, betweene the <hi>Greekes</hi> and the <hi>Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> This Apple was afterward ſtolne from <hi>Venus</hi> by <hi>Iuno</hi> through the meanes of iealous <hi>Vulcane,</hi> and then in following time (going from hand to hand) happened to <hi>Apolidon,</hi> who found it among the vnualuable treaſures of the King his father: with the Pearle (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tearmed the <hi>Vnton)</hi> which <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opatra</hi> long time had in her poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, after the had quaft off the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the company of <hi>Marke An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie.</hi> And this Peaſle alſo hung at the left care of the ſame God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, and was ſo ordered by Arte; as it could by no meanes be taken away, till the faire creature that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the <hi>Defended Chamber,</hi> had drunke of the water of that cleere Fountaine.

At two corners, which directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted the Patke, they had winne in building, a Chamber, a Warde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe and a Cabinet double ſtaged. The nether part or floore of theſe Galleries, was painted (by moſt exquiſite Painters) with all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall kindes of hunting and fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: for there might be diſcerned (to the life) what delight Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen take, being ſo aſſembled together, ſitting or lying on the freſh greene hearbes, to heare the Huntſmans pleaſing report, who ſoone after might be ſeene, ſeeking all about with his hound in a line, queſtyning after the ſtricken Hart. And by the countenance of the man, he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to winde his horne a long while, to giue notice, that he had found the fall of the deare.</p>
                  <p>Beſide, in emboſſing or moulded workes, were the other hounds to be ſeene, that gaue report of his defeature, or death, with the horſe-men galloping after them, mainly on the bridle, with their Bugles at their mouthes (and ſwolne bigge cheekes) appearing ſo pleaſing to the eye, as it almoſt gaue euident perſwaſion, that the ayre made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerberation of the noiſe, euen as if it had beene performed indeed. But aboue all, what is he, that would not be extraordinarily delighted, beholding the Stagge in the full honour of his head, running ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, breaking through the brakes and buſhes, croſſing one the lands, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his head aloft, and his tongue their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

All which yet is nothing, to ſee him forced from the ſoile, and compelled to the bay when the hounds ſwiftly running, hang vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his haunches, loudly proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his death, and then haue their

                  <p>A little further off, was the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the wilde Boare or Swine, whom the Lime-hound had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to forſake the buſhes, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to paſſe along by Grey-hou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds; whereupon, the beaſt being fierce and furious, at the winding of the hornes, ran among the hounds and hunters, grunting, ſnoring and ouerthrowing whatſoeuer he met withall. And that which was worſt of all, with his long and ſharpe Tuſhes, he bit and kilde the boldeſt Grey hounds that durſt encounter him, notwithſtanding the beſt contriued Iacks, made for defence of their bodies. But the Huntſmen, being quick and ready, making at him with their Boare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeares, and wounding him deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, layde him all along. Then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to contend no longer with the hounds, flocking round about him, ſome tugging him by the coddes, others by the eares and thighes, would neuer ceaſe vntill he was dead. Aſſuredly, it would require much length of time, to deſcribe (in due order) the ſeuerall kindes of hunting, and the like ſportes, painted all along this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Gallerie. And the Painter deſerued no meane commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the extraordinarie excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his worke: eſpecially, his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable perſpectiue, in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hawking, which was figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red meerely to the life.

Then ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe began to diſcend, and being fiercely purſued, fell downe to the ground, where the hounds were ready to receiue her.</p>
                  <p>If theſe paintings affoorded ſuch pleaſing contentment, much more then did they in the higher Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, where was figured the moſt part of the battailes betweene <hi>Semira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> and <hi>Ninus;</hi> the ouerthrow of <hi>Aſtiages</hi> by the <hi>Perſians;</hi> the death of <hi>Marcheſia,</hi> Queene of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zones,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Aſia;</hi> the diſcomfiture of <hi>Cyrus</hi> by Queene <hi>Thomiris;</hi> the aſſaults of <hi>Hercules</hi> againſt <hi>Androgeus</hi> and <hi>Otreus;</hi> the flight of <hi>Vexores,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> aſſailed by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite other fights, well deſcruing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall memorie. The pauements of theſe Galleries were thus ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly beautified, being of Iarecote, blacker then any <hi>Moore,</hi> and the ſeeling formed in Oualls, made of Zedroſus, the bone of a fiſh, which the Kings of <hi>Arabia</hi> hold in high eſteeme. The walls were of pure ſiluer, wrought with curious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and enammelled beaſts: the gutters and water paſſages of Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaſter, extending long out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the walls, betweene arteficiall Croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, enriched with golden leaues, and other workes cut after damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king manner. The doores and windowes (in their wood worke) were of Ebonie, and the glaſſe wholly of baſtard Diamond.</p>
                  <p>Going from hence, they entred into the Parke, contayning three hundred Acres of woods, enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and planted with Pines, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres trees, Laurells, Holmes, Palmes and Terebinthine trees. Therein were diuers delectable and pleaſant Arbours, appearing, as if Nature had contended with her owne skill, not onely to make them ſingular, but admirable alſo: for there were an infinite number of Orenge trees, Date trees, Citron trees, and Myrtle trees, all iuſtly planted by the line, with other the very ſweeteſt fruitages, that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7181:322"/>
in the world could be wiſhed for. On the other ſide was a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, watered by a great many little Riuers, by meanes whereof, the ground brought forth ſtore of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable hearbes, with Violets, Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Paunſies, and other moſt odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifferous floures.</p>
                  <p>Yearely, in the month of May, came the Phoenix (as a Gardiner) thither, and for the amenitie of the place, tooke ſuch pleaſure to be there: that there ſhe caſt her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo ſoone as <hi>Apolidon</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the enchantments of his Pallace, which was moſt ſſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and magnificent.

And <hi>Apolidon</hi> appointed (when he departed thence for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople)</hi> that this precious Fanne, ſhould be kept among the other ſingularities of the Iſle, as the moſt excellent thing of all other: wherefore <hi>Amadis</hi> preſented it to <hi>Oriana,</hi> on the ſame day when ſhe landed there.</p>
                  <p>And to the end, that this pleaſant place might continue embelliſhed, with all things that poſſibly could bee had: <hi>Apolidon</hi> leſt there two Vnicornes, which the Prince of <hi>Quinſay</hi> had ſent him, and there they liued ſo long, that King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> found them there, after the mariage was ſollemnized, between the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Amadis.</hi> Moreouer, there were many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet and Maske-cattes, which made the ayre ſo extraordinarily ſweete, as nothing could bee therewith compared: and ſometimes the Pellicane alſo made her ſent there. Great ſtore of other worthy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures liued there alſo, as Harts, Hindes, Roes, Goates, Hares, Connies &amp;c. withall diuerſitie of Birdes and Fowles, as it was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull to heare the varietie of their noates, eſpecially the Nightingale, and the ſolitarie Owſell, affecting alwaies to be alone.</p>
                  <p>From forth of a nere neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring high Rocke, deſcended a great water, which filled the Lake, whereof you haue heard i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the ſecond Booke, where the Hart loſt his life, narrowly purſued by the hounds, as hath beene already rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And thither vſually reſorted the Beuer to bathe himſelfe, with an infinite number of Swannes, Cignets, Cranes, Storkes, Cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, Heronnes, with a plentifull ſtore of all other Birdes. But all theſe made not this Lake ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as the frequent reſort of a Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide, which was heard there (were neere) continually ſinging, as neuer was heard more delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hermony. From this Lake iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued many Riuers and Currents, which made diuers little Iſlands in this Meadow. In one of them was a Dedalus or Labyrinth, contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning onely foure Acres in ſquare, planted with the moſt precious Balme, that euer grew in <hi>Engadia.</hi> And it was continually kept by two Serpents, bred of his kinde, that watcht the golden Apples in the Garden of <hi>Heſperides</hi> day and night.</p>
                  <p>Directly in the midſt of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalus, was a Coloſſus of guilded Braſſe, contayning the height of ſixe ſcore Cubites, holding in his left hand (raiſed vp on his head) a Lanterne of Chriſtall, and in it, the rod yet burning, wherewith <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi> kept the fire which he ſtole
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7181:323"/>
from heauen: yeelding ſuch a bright ſplendour day and night (without diminiſhing) that for the ſpace of an hundred miles, round in compaſſe, the Mariners made their reſort thither, as they did to <hi>Pharos</hi> neere <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This flaming Rod, <hi>Apolidon</hi> had gotten (by great induſtrie) from the Prieſts and Magitians of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea:</hi> And whoſoeuer could looke on this vnextinguiſhable fire, in his true nature, and without couering in this manner, hee ſhould attaine to moſt mighty prouidence. But the Serpents kept the place very ſtrongly, without doing any harm, to them that tooke delight in the Parke: prouided, that they preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to enter the Dedalus, for then they would belch forth ſuch fire and flames, as was able to daunt the boldeſt ſpirit. And all this was thus ordained by <hi>Apolidon</hi> who was (as you haue formerly heard) one of the very greateſt Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in all the world: yet, when the matchleſſe beautie, entring into the <hi>Defended Chamber,</hi> ſhould come neere to this Coloſſus, the Enchantments muſt ceaſe, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie might this admired fire bee looked on.</p>
                  <p>Now, gentle Readers, conſider ſeriouſly with your ſelues, if the like Pallace can now a dayes bee eaſily found, accompanied with ſuch plentie of ſingularities, as <hi>Oriana</hi> ſaw there? To proceed on now in our Hiſtorie, the Ladies and Gentlewomen being brought to their ſeueral lodgings: the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle</hi> departed from them, committing them to their good reſt, becauſe (in deed) it was ſomewhat late. Neuertheleſſe, the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> (all that night) could not ſleepe, partly through wearineſſe on the Sea, and partly by her fearefull conceite, of harme that might enſue to <hi>Amadis,</hi> vpon this bold and hardie aduenture, which gaue her ſome reaſon to fore-thinke, of an inteſtine warre betweene him and King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> And now ſhe beganne to conſider with her ſelfe, that to palliate the earneſt affection betweene them, there was neceſſarily required: that ſhe ſhould gouerne her ſelfe much more diſcreetly, then formerly ſhe had done to kill all occaſion of ill conceiuing of her.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, the next morning, ſhee ſent to <hi>Amadis</hi> and the other Knights, requeſting to haue a little conference with them, and they, who deſired nothing more, then to ſerue and honour her: came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vpon her commande, and after courteſies paſt on either ſide, <hi>Quedragant,</hi> who had charge from the whole companie, to vnderſtand her will, ſaid. Madame, as we are enfourmed, you haue ſent to ſpeake with vs, let vs know what you will pleaſe to command vs? In good faith Sir, anſwered the Princeſſe, commaunds are no matters for mee, eſpecially to them, in whoſe power I am as a priſoner, you may ſpeake your pleaſure. Madame, quoth hee, but there is not a man among vs, who is not willing to do you any ſeruice. <hi>Oriana</hi> returned him many thankes, and then repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus. Let mee entreate you then to bee ſo pleaſed, that during the time of my reſiding in this place, my women and I may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from all other company, and alſo to promiſe vs, that none of you (whoſoeuer it bee) may come to ſee vs, without our leaue and permiſſion: for you well know, that the ſurprizall you haue made of vs, and of the Emperours people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once divulged abroade, it will

In regard where-of, queſtioning with his owne thoughts, that it would require no meane might, to withſtand ſuch potent Armies, as from either ſide would be made againſt him: yet notwithſtanding, hope, conducted by the power of loue, gaue him this reſolution, rather to die a thouſand deaths, then redeliuer her to <hi>Patin,</hi> without whom hee could not liue an houre.

                     <hi>Quedragant</hi> returned him this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7181:324"/>
anſwere. I ſweare vnto you Sir, at our firſt and giddie-headed eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, we ſee ſo great a fire already kindled, as (we may eaſily preſume) is impoſſible to be quenched with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a hard and daungerous warre, which we may not well maintaine and endure for any long time, without the ayde and ſuccour of our deare friends and companions, wherefore, I thinke it expedient, that all the reſt which are here, ſhould be made acquainted there-with, to know their opinions; to the end, that they may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enclined to ſuſtaine the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if they ſhall conclude on warre. I pray you then, ſaid <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> that we may all meete together tomorrow, and take the charge (if you pleaſe) to ſummon them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Quedragant</hi> gladly condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, the day following, they met together, and <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the midſt of them, beganne in this maner. Honourable Lords, yeſterday, Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> ſent to pray me, that we all would conſider one ſome good meanes, to winne againe the loſt grace and fauour for her, with the offended King her father, qualifying in him (if it bee poſſible) that ſtrange conceit of his, to marry her with the onely Prince in the world, to whom ſhe beareth the leaſt affection; otherwiſe, death will be much more welcome to her. And therefore I thought it good (after I had ſpoken with ſome of this company particularly) to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand from you all in generall, what you thinke thereof: For, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wee haue beene friends and companions, in the procuring of her libertie; it is much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that we ſhould all agree to maintaine it.</p>
                  <p>But before I enter into further ſpeech, I humbly deſire you, to fixe before your eyes, that (already) your fame &amp; renowne is ſo knowne through the world, by reaſon of the rare actions of Chiualry by you performed: that (at this day) there is neither King, Prince nor State, but ſtand in feare of your high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. For they all well know, that to winne immortall honour, you haue contemned, not onely the ſumptuous treaſures and kinde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, inherent to you in your owne houſes: but the deare blood of your owne bodies, where-of you haue made no ſpare, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the boldeſt ſpirits to know, the ſharpe and keene edges of your ſwords, to the mightie perill of your owne perſons. And, as markes and teſtemonies of your proweſſe, the wounds receiued in many parts of your bodies, may render ſuch apparant faith, as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune thinkes her ſelfe much obliged to you: being willing to ſhew you, how much her owne ſelfe is in deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you. And being deſirous to recompence your former high deſeruings, ſhe made plaine proofe thereof by deliuering this glorious victorie into your hands, which you haue had againſt the two chiefeſt Princes of Chriſtendome, King <hi>Liſuart</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor.</p>
                  <p>Nor doe I ſpeake, concerning the ouerthrow of their men onely, being farre inferiour to you in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: but of the worthie ſuccour you haue giuen, to the moſt wiſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonnaire, and vertuous Lady this day liuing. Wherein you haue done a very acceptable ſeruice to God, by executing that dutie, whereunto you are expreſſely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: namely to ſuccour the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7181:324" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be angrie, yet, ſeeing right is on our ſide, and God (who is iuſt) will ſtand for vs alſo: let vs giue them to vnderſtand, that if their owne experience cannot teach them iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but by might and power they meane to aſſaile vs; we are able to meete them with ſuch reſiſtance, as ſhall remaine in memory while the world endureth. Therefore, let euery man ſpeake his minde in this caſe, what he conceiueth meeteſt to be done, either to finiſh the war begun: or elſe to motion peace, by reſtoring Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> to the King her father, according to her owne deſire. For, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my ſelfe, know, that I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yeeld thereto, except you be ſo pleaſed, nor ſhall fond opinion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſway me in this matter, beyond the compaſſe ſo your liking. I know you to be men indeed, and your vertues of apparant: as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can withdraw you from true valour and magnanimitie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to aduenture on any action, whereby your honour (in how ſmall a degree ſoeuer) may receiue any baſe imputation.</p>
                  <p>So he ceaſed, leauing the mindes of all the companie highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and ſatiſfied, by ſuch an humble and gracefull remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, as he had made vnto them. Then <hi>Quedragant</hi> (commaunded thereto by all the aſſiſtants) ſtood vp, and anſwered <hi>Amadis</hi> in this manner. Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> it is moſt certaine, that our attempt made vpon the Emperour, was not for any hatred wee bare to him: but onely to keepe the faith, whereto euery good Knight ſtandeth oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in maintayning and defending afflicted perſons from wrong, eſpecially all vertuous Ladies, of whom it is our dutie to be protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. And therefore I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, that before we vndertake any further warre; wee ſhould ſend to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to let him fully vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, vpon what occaſion we dealt with the <hi>Romans.</hi> And if he be found diſcontented; then, in the verie mildeſt manner can bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, to ſhew him withall graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous demeanour) what ſhamefull iniurie he offered to Madame <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> vnder collour of marrying her to a forraigne Prince, vtterly to diſinherit her at home, a matter euery way offenſiue to God, and not to bee ſuffred by his owne Subiects.</p>
                  <p>Pauſing a very little while, and clapping his fiſt vpon the boorde, thus he proceeded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If therefore it may ſtand with his good pleaſure, to forget his conceiued anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her (if there be any entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his royall breſt) then we to offer deliuerie of her againe, on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and not elſe. If he refuſe or diſdaine the dutie, wherein we ſend vnto him: then to tell him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, wee feare him not a iote, but if he will make warre vpon vs, we are as ready to defend our ſelues. In the meane while, I hold it very neceſſarie, that wee ſtrengthen our ſelues with all ſuch things, as an action of ſuch importance doth require, as this is. At leaſt, that he may not come vpon vs vnprouided, whenſoeuer hee determines to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile vs (if he be ſo minded) albeit, in mine opinion, peace were much better then warre. But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is not to be tardied by any meanes, rather we muſt put our ſelues in due preparation, diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hence meſſengers to our kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and friends, to ſupply vs with their beſt ſuccour, when we ſhall require it.</p>
                  <p>Such was the anſwere of <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant,</hi> and approued by all the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7181:325"/>
Knights there preſent: whereupon it was concluded, that <hi>Amadis</hi> ſhould ſend a meſſenger to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> alſo <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> into <hi>Scotland, Brunco</hi> to the Marqueſſe his father, and <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> to the Queene of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of whom he ſhould haue many able men, if her husband King <hi>Cildadan</hi> brought no worſe, then he did to the ayde of King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> This was made knowne to the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> and their finall delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for procurement of peace.</p>
                  <p>As thus they continued in theſe conferences, ſome of them ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the gazing windowes, which had full view vpon the fields: they eſpied comming from the coaſt, that gaue entrance into the Iſle, a Knight all armed, with fiue Squires attending on him, who when hee drew neerer, they knew him to be <hi>Briande Moniaſte,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Lazadan,</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of whoſe arriuall they were all right ioyfull for hee was an amiable, bold and hardie Knight, and as courteous as any whatſoeuer.

Truſt me, my Lord, the queſt I vndertooke to heare newes of you, is ſooner ended then I expected: for I was giuen to vnderſtand, that you were ſo cloſely hid, as it was a matter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to finde you, but God be praiſed for it, me thinkes I ſee you in very ſound health. Couſine, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> you are moſt kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcome hether, aſſuring you, that as Fortune hath releaſed you from one toyle and trauaile: ſo now ſhe hath as readily fitted you with an other, anſwerable both to to the time and place, where your preſence and imployment may much auaile vs, as you hereafter ſhall heare more at large. In the meane while, I thinke it conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that you ſhould be diſarmed, and then wee will tell you our mindes afterward.</p>
                  <p>So taking him by the hand, hee conducted him to his lodging, where, as they were taking off his Armes, ſeeing ſuch ſtore of Knights flocke more and more about him, he ſayd to <hi>Amadis.</hi> My Lord, I am verily perſwaded, that ſo faire an aſſembly of worthy and valiant men, could neuer be thus met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but vpon ſome extreame vrgent cauſe: therefore, I pray you tell me what it is. Hereupon, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> amply related to him, how, and in what manner all things had paſt, eſpecially the churlliſh ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which King <hi>Liſuart</hi> vſed, not onely to the Knights that had done him infinite ſeruices: but alſo to his owne children, enforcing one of them (through ouergreedie and great auarice) to bee diſinherited from her right, and (meerely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her will) ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be wife to the Emperour, and that is Madame <hi>Oriana.</hi> And this is the cauſe, that ſo many of vs are here aſſembled together? quoth <hi>Brian,</hi> is the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> at <hi>Rome?</hi> No, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> we haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly taken her from the <hi>Romans,</hi> that had the charge of her conuoy: And now at this preſent, ſhee is here in this Pallace, with all the Ladies, and Gentlewomen that were in her companie. Now ſhall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7181:325"/>
we eaſily redeliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, except King <hi>Liſuart</hi> determine more reſpect of them, then hitherto he hath done.</p>
                  <p>Afterward, he told him what was reſolued on by them all, which <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> liked as well as they: albeit hee conceiued, that the iniuries of two ſuch potent Princes (by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feature) would not bee ſuddenly appeaſed. Notwithſtanding, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which was done, could not be recalled: he diſſembled his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, and onely anſwered thus. I know King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to be one of the moſt reuengefulleſt Princes this day liuing, and very hard to endure an iniurie, therefore, you muſt quickly conſider on ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, if he ſhall offer to aſſaile you: and I hold it more requiſite, to take order for all inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which may enſue by his means, then to conſume time in friuolous words. Of one thing I am high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glad, that Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> and her women haue ſo happie a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and I would gladly ſee her, if you pleaſe. Let me tell you Sir, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> my Couſine <hi>Agraies,</hi> and my Brother <hi>Floreſtan</hi> are appointed, to make her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our deliberation, and you may goe along with them: being well aſſured, that it will be no meane eaſe to her, to conferre with you on her misfortunes in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate.</p>
                  <p>No time was delayed in going to her, but before they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to enter her lodgings; they ſent her word, that they came to her from the whole company. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their entrance was admitted, and ſhe went to meete them: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>Brian,</hi> whom ſhe had not ſeene in a long time, and therefore as he did her reuerence, ſhe ſaid vnto him. Couſine, you are come hither in a very good time, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the libertie of a Lady, who ſtands in great neede of ſuch helpe as yours. Madame, ſaid he, I had not ſo long delayed my comming hither, but that preſently, after the ſeuen Kings ouerthrow in Great <hi>Brittaine:</hi> the King my father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my home returne, to with-ſtand the warre, which the people of <hi>Affrica</hi> made vpon him. And ſcarſely was it ended, but I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, my Couſine <hi>Amadis</hi> was ſo farre diſtant from his friends, through ſome conceiued griefe or diſpleaſure; as no tidings could be heard of him. Wherefore, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt he was loſt for euer, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to enter vpon his queſt, both in the loue and reuerence I beare vnto him. This was the occaſion that drew mee from <hi>Spaine,</hi> being fully perſwaded, that I ſhould ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner haue notice of him here, then in any other place elſe whatſooner. And Fortune (I thanke her) hath guided mee hither, where I haue met with apt occaſion, not onely to doe him ſeruice, but alſo for you, royall Princeſſe; for which great kindneſſe, <hi>Oriana</hi> returned him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite thankes.</p>
                  <p>But now, before I paſſe on any further, I thinke it very neceſſarie to tell you, what was the principall motiue and reaſon, why ſo many good Knights and worthy men, ſhould beare ſuch honour and good will to this Princeſſe. Aſiure your ſelues, it was not for any guifts or preſents ſhe had beſtowed on them, ſhe being (as yet) voide of all meanes to that effect. Much leſſe, for any fauour by <hi>Amadis</hi> borne to her, the loue betweene them both being kept ſo ſecret, as you haue heard at large in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Bookes. But indeed, ſhe was ſo humble, wiſe and debon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire, that by her meere humility
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7181:326"/>
and courteſie, ſhee knew how to ſteale the heartie affections of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. A matter ſo apt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to heroyick perſons, and them deriued from great place: as they haue no other powers or faculties, but ſuch as make them to bee more honoured, praiſed and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>Conſider then, in what reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they ought to be held, who (by ouer-ſtrange perſumpſion) haue delight in all immodeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, when all is duely weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they beget the peoples disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, a ſecret contempt among all good mindes; yea, and diſtaſte of many of their owne appearing wel-willers, that particularly deſire their ruine, to abate the ouer-wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pride, they take in ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. Gracious language, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſiue grauitie, and humble modeſtie, are ſo proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Princes and great perſons, that whenſoeuer they but ſpeake: it begetteth their ſubiects cordiall loue, abſolute obedience, with a generall foare of offending; And the contrary is ſo deadly daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as nothing can be more harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them. Let vs conceiue then, how well it agrees with a knot of ſuch baſe minded companions, to put on a boaſting ſpirit of brauerie: as thinking by their outward glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearance, to make them-ſelues reſpected and feared. Before God, mee thinkes they ſhould conſider, both what they are, and what they ſhall bee: then they may eaſily know of them-ſelues, that they are full of ſhame and all diſgrace, and for ſuch, I am content to leaue them, returning againe to our former purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Vnderſtand now, that after <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> had a long while conuerſed with <hi>Brian:</hi> ſhee called for the Queene <hi>Sardamira,</hi> and ſaid vnto her. See Madame, here is the ſonne to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> I am ſure you know him yet. Then the Queene going neerer to him, after ſhe had very graciouſly ſaluted <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> entred into ſo ſerious a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him, that <hi>Oriana</hi> found the meanes of leauing them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So, with drawing her ſelfe aſide, ſhe called <hi>Agrates</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtan</hi> to her: entreating them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, to acquaint her with the cauſe of their comming. <hi>Agraies</hi> wholly related to her, whatſoeuer had paſſed among them in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, what true and honorable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection all the Knights did beare her: and laſtly, what reſolution they had agreed on, concerning her cauſe, deſiring her withall, to ſend backe her minde, whether ſhe liked their intention, or no. Alas Sir, quoth ſhe, they are all ſo wiſe and vertuous, as no bad thought can preuaile among them. One thing I would moſt humbly requeſt of them, that (euen for Gods ſake) to ſeeke ſome meanes, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they may, and agreeing with their honour; to worke my peace with the diſpleaſed King my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Then, pretending to whiſper ſome thing in the eare of <hi>Agraies, Floreſtan</hi> (as one not to learne ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uility) retired thence, leauing them both together. When <hi>Oriana</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſhe might ſpeake at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: ſhe began her womed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to him, in this manner. Deare Couſine, although I haue great hope in the prouidence of your kinſman <hi>Amadis,</hi> and in the loyall affection which all theſe Knights doe beare me: yet (mee thinkes, reaſon requireth, that I ſhould moſt of all relie on your fidelity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my bounden dutie to the

                  <p>Madame, anſwered <hi>Agraies,</hi> as concerning the good entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you receiued in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King my father and the Queene, did no more therein then they ought to doe: and ſuch (I am ſure) was their affection towards you: that in all things, which their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding could reach vnto, there wanted no loue or kindneſſe in them to you, as their beſt reſpected allie and k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>fewomen. Now, as concerning my ſiſter and my ſelfe, our actions ſhall daylie make knowne to you, in what vnfeigned reſpect we hold you: deſyring you to beleeue, thet you may command vs, as they that couet nothing more, then your good and honour, preferring them before our owne liues. And whereas you wiſh me, to forget the iniurie, which the King your father hath done, not only to mee, but to all my kinred and friends: aſſure your ſelfe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, the wound was made ſo wide and deepe, as it will neuer be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led while I liue. It was no little ingratitude to vs, denying my Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> my ſelfe, and many other good Knights, the humble requeſt we made vnto him, to giue the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza</hi> to mine vnckle <hi>Galua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> who dearely deſerued it, and much more: conſidering, that it was conquered by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>our and vertue, that became an humble ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it. Neuertheleſſe, for your loue and honou, I am content to diſſemble my diſtaſte, and deferre (for ſome time) my iuſt occaſion of wiſhing him ill eſpecially, for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing vs from his Court ſo ſtrangely, euen as if we had beene his deadly enemies, and neuer minding or reſpecting, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great ſeruices we had done for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:7181:327"/>
And to let you know, that I will wholly imploy my ſelfe to pleaſe you: I promiſe you Madame, I will eſſay (to my vttermoſt) to doe as you haue deſired me. But it would hardly agree with reaſon, that it ſhould be ouer-raſhly vndertaken, becauſe, if I ſhould bee coole in ſpeech now, matters being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpoſed for warre: in ſtead of edging the courages of ſo many worthy Knights, as are now met together in this Iſle, I ſhould intimidate the greater part of them, by hearing mee preach of peace, and raiſe in them an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, that I vſe ſuch lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage, as being the man firſt affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Wherein I muſt fall into two euills together, which hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will redound to the great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of vs all, but eſpecially mine vnrecouerable ſhame. But ſome being ſent to the King your father, and hauing heard his anſwere: I will entreate my worthy friends, to doe according as you haue adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. In the meane while, mee thinkes you ſhould greeue ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as poſſibly you may, ſupporting both Time and Fortune, with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly, conſtant and inuincible pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience. Couſin (quoth ſhee) I acknowledge it very requiſite, not to daunt their manly ſpirits, that are aſſembled here about my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but rather, to maintaine their height of minde, committing all things to their care and diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>During all this conference, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grates</hi> continually obſerued <hi>Olinda,</hi> whom he affected with all his heart, as he had made good proofe of, in paſſing (for her loue) vnder the Arch of loyall Louers: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, preferring vertue before his paſſions, hee knew ſo wiſely to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale them, that leauing her there ſhut vp with <hi>Ortana,</hi> hee departed without ſpeaking to her, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer frequented the place, albeit it was an inſupportable paine to him.</p>
                  <p>So, at parting from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, hee ſaid: Madame, I will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually performe what you haue enioyned me. Returne then, ſaid ſhe, and commend mee moſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the whole companie. The like ſhee did to <hi>Floreſtan</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who taking leaue of her, went to ſeeke <hi>Amadis</hi> and the reſt, who awaited their comming, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to them all her anſwere. Whereupon was concluded, that ſome ſhould bee ſent to King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> ſo ſoone as poſſibly might bee; wherefore <hi>Brian</hi> and <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant</hi> were entreated by all the company, to take that charge vpon them, which they could not well refuſe, becauſe the other were ſo importunate.</p>

ſpeeches paſſed betweene them, <hi>Amadis</hi> thus ſpake vnto her. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, I am much diſcontented with my ſelfe, that I haue no better opportunity, of doing you honour, in this place, and giuing you wel-come equall to your deſerts: but time being contrarie to my deſires, robs me of all due occaſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly entreate you, that (in excuſing me) you will conceiue no offence, or impute it to any want of good will: for you haue ſo much bound me to you by your paſſed fauours, as I cannot enioy one day of my life, that I may not graunt but to be onely yours, in any ſeruice whatſoeuer I can doe for you. And becauſe it is now a long while, ſince you departed from your Countrie, and (perhaps) this long abode of yours here, may be more diſpleaſing to you, then I could wiſh: I am deſirous, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your owne deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the end, that I may endeauour all poſſible meanes, to obey you in whatſoeuer you ſhall pleaſe to command me.</p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> anſwered <hi>Graſinda,</hi> I might well be reputed poore in iudgement, if I knew not certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that both the companie, and fauours you haue done for me hath ſorted to the very higheſt honour, that euer could befall me. As for the good entertainment, which you alleadge to haue receiued in my Country, if it could deſerue the name of goodneſſe: hath it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie beene more then fiue fold recompenced, to your great ſame, and partly my reproach? Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, to put you out of doubt of my determination; I will boldly diſcloſe my minde vnto you.

                           <hi>SIR, if euer I did any ſeruice, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie your liking and acceptance, the honourable and kinde entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I receiued of you and yours, all the while I remained in your Court, hath made me much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (ſo long as I liue) to make no ſpare of my perſon, but alwaies to be in due preparation, for your continuall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſeruice. Wherefore I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreat you, not to imagine, that the ſending of this preſent meſſenger to you, is in expectation of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence: but rather, remembring the honeſt offers you made mee at my departure from</hi> Bohemia, <hi>it drew me on to ſo much boldneſſe, as, by this meanes of ſending to you, earneſtly to deſire you, to giue mee aide in abuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which nerely concerneth mee, and wherewith this bearer will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquaint you. I beſeech you Sir to credit him, euen as my ſelfe, and to command his diſpatch with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſpeed: to rid him out of all dread, that is readie to ſacrifice his life for you. And that is</hi> Amadis de Gaule, <hi>ſirnamed in many places,</hi> The Knight of the greene Sworde, <hi>euermore by you and yours to be commanded.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mbaſſadours being diſpatched to all parts, as you haue formerly heard, <hi>Gandalin,</hi> being readie to depart for <hi>Gaule:</hi> came to the lodgings of the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> according as his Maiſter before had appointed him. And becauſe no man might enter, without command and permiſſion from the Princeſſe, the gate being alwaies kept by one of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7181:330"/>
women: he ſent word to <hi>Mabila,</hi> to know from her, if ſhe pleaſed to write to the Queene her Aunte, or to her Couſine <hi>Melicia. Mabila</hi> being acquainted by the Gentlewoman, concerning the motion made by <hi>Gandalin,</hi> went and told <hi>Oriana</hi> thereof, ſo loude as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one might heare her, ſaying. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, <hi>Gandalin</hi> is going for <hi>Gaule</hi> towards King <hi>Perion:</hi> may it pleaſe you commaund him any thing to the Queene, or to my Couſin? Yes mary will I, anſwered <hi>Oriana,</hi> cauſe him come in, that I may ſpeake with him. Then <hi>Gandalin</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dmitted into the Princeſſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when ſeeing him, ſhe preſently aroſe, and taking him aſide (as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to giue him ſome priuate enſtructions; ſhe beganne to ſigh, and ſpake in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gandalin,</hi> my deare friend, what thinkeſt thou that Fortune is ſo contrarrie to me, bereauing me of the onely man in the world, whoſe company I moſt affect, he being ſo nere me, and I altogether in his power? Neuertheleſſe, we cannot haue the meanes for the leaſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conference, without great tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to mine honour, whereby my heart endureth ſuch affliction: as, if thou kneweſt it, I am certainely perſwaded, that thou wouldſt take more pittie on me then thou doeſt. And ſo I pray thee tell him, to the end, that though I haue iuſt cauſe to complaine: yet he may reioyce, by the augmentation (dayly more and more) of mine vnfeigned loue and loyaltie to him. And I would haue him deuiſe the meanes, by ſome pretie ſtratagem among his aſſociates; that yet we may ſee one an other, vnder collour of thy voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and to comfort me.</p>
                  <p>Madame, anſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> you haue great reaſon to beare him ſuch loyal affection, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo ſome remedie, whereto (aboue all things elſe) hee would gladly aſpire: for if you knew the extremitie, wherein I haue ſeene him an hundred times, you might very well beleeue, that loue is a Lordly tyrant ouer him. I haue ſeene him halfe dead (as it were) a thouſand times, thinking on the paſſed fauours you haue affoorded him, and as manie times to recouer life againe, onely by the meere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them. I haue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeene him (among the deadli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt dangers in the world) performe ſuch incomparable actions of Armes, calling onely vpon you to be his comfort: that it can hardly bee credited, any Knight ſhould haue ſo much valour in him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſweete Madame, I pray you take pittie on him, and vſe him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his high deſerts. For this I dare aſſure you, neuer was any Knight more loyall, or more yours, then he is: neither euer had any Lady ſuch power ouer a man, as you haue ouer him; in your hands only lies his life and death, and you may diſpoſe of him as you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gandalin,</hi> replied <hi>Oriana,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue thee vndoubtedly, feeling in mine owne ſelfe, that which thou relateſt in him, and his life is mine, for I haue no other breathing, but by him, and in the companie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he onely makes me liue. But I pray thee, make mee not die, as ſometimes thou didſt, when thou broughteſt me tydings, of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from <hi>Gaule</hi> into Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:</hi> for, in being depriued now of all meanes, to doe what willingly I would for him, I may doe wrong to him, and to myſelfe alſo, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring my deſires ouer-earneſt and affectionate. Therefore, I pray
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7181:331"/>
thee ſpeake no more, but returne to him, and will him to worke ſome way, that I may ſee him ſo ſoone as poſſible he can. So <hi>Gandalin</hi> tooke his leaue, and as he was parting out of the Chamber, ſhee ſpake ſome-what audibly: faile not to come for my letters, before you goe hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> attended his returne in ſound deuotion, and no ſooner ſaw him, but ſayd vnto him. Well, <hi>Gandalin,</hi> haſt thou ſeene my Lady? I pray thee tell mee, what hath ſhe ſaid to thee? Then hee declared (word by word) what had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, how deſirous ſhe was to ſee him: and (for a finall reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) wiſhed him, to come with ſome other of the Knights, vnder collour of comforting her. But when hee came to thoſe words of kindneſſe, which (in the zeale of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) ſhe had ſpoken: hee ſtood as one entranced, till recouering ſpirit againe, he thus ſpake. Alas, <hi>Gandalin,</hi> how ſhall I do what thou ſaiſt? Hauing apprehended a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit ſuddenly, thus hee proceeded. Thou muſt needs goe to <hi>Agraies,</hi> and tell him, that becauſe I ſend thee into <hi>Gaule,</hi> thou was deſirous to know of my Couſin <hi>Mabila,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhee would write to my ſiſter <hi>Melicia,</hi> or no. And after ſome few ſpeeches paſt betweene you, ſhe told thee, ſhe held it very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that we ſhould oftener vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> then wee vſe to doe, and make meanes, to cauſe her forget the extreame melancholie, whereto (ouer-much) ſhee addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her ſelfe, leaſt, being ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſad, ſhee fall into ſome dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſeaſe. And be very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, hee diſcouer not, that thou haſt ſpoken with me, or that I know any thing of this matter. And once more I pray thee tell mee, didſt thou not finde her very ſad?</p>
                  <p>You know well enough Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and for no little length of time, that ſhee is one of the moſt wiſe and vertuous Ladies, as euer was borne, and knowes ſo diſcreetly to diſſemble her paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as the cunningſt cenſure can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not reach them, or gather by her lookes, whether ſhe be inwardly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted or no. And yet I am verily perſwaded, that ſhe is too much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to melancholie. Heauen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord mee ſo much fauour (quoth <hi>Amadis)</hi> for her, that her deſires may ſort to ſome good effect: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer then ſhall I feare either life or death, or any thing elſe that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune can impoſe vpon me. Doubt nothing Sir, replied <hi>Gandalin,</hi> I hope, that as our Lord hath euer-more preſerued you, and preferred you before any other Knight: hee will not now forget you, and in a time of ſuch vrgent neceſſity. Goe thy way then, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> to my Couſine, and bring mee newes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſo ſoone as thou canſt.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Gandalin</hi> departed, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Agraies</hi> at leiſure, diſcharged his meſſage ſo effectually: that the Prince (imagining all to be true he had ſayd) thus anſwered. Truſt me, my ſiſter ſhewes her ſelfe to be very well aduiſed, and what ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, ſhall bee done. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her viſitation hath hitherto beene deferred; it was for no other reaſon, but in feare of diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Madame <hi>Oriana.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I will confer hereon with the companie, whom I ſhall finde (I make no doubt) as readie as my ſelfe to obey her. So, without any further tarrying, he went to Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> to whom hee declared all that <hi>Gandalin</hi> had told him, as from his ſiſter. <hi>Amadis</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as if hee had neuer heard
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7181:331"/>
thereof, replied, that he referred to him and the reſt, whatſoeuer they thought fit to be done in this caſe. Whereupon, <hi>Agraies</hi> imparted it to them all, yet without any notice, that it proceeded from the opinion of <hi>Mabila:</hi> but rather from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion in himſelfe, as accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it very conuenient, to goe comfort the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom <hi>Gandalin</hi> found to bee mightily ouer-come with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
                  <p>And beleeue it (quoth hee) if in ſuch extremities, the ſtrongeſt and moſt magnanimous ſpirits ſtand in neede of conſolation: by much more reaſon then, doth the weake conſtitution of young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies command it, who beeing fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of themſelues, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the oftner be viſited and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. Hereunto all the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle</hi> condiſcended, and (for a beginning) the very ſame day they ſent to the Princeſſe, to knowe if ſhe would allow thereof, or no: And ſhe returned them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that they ſhould be moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiuely welcome. Whereupon they preſently went thither, and as they fell from one diſcourſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, <hi>Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Brian</hi> ſaid. Madame, if you pleaſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand any thing to the King your father, or to your mother the Queen, wee are appointed from this companie, to depart for Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> about your buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now was <hi>Amadis</hi> withdrawn aſide with <hi>Mabila,</hi> while <hi>Agraies</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred with <hi>Olinda,</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griote</hi> with <hi>Graſinda.</hi> And well we may conceiue, that <hi>Amadis</hi> was in a ſtrange perplexity, ſeeing her ſo neare him, whom hee loued aboue all creatures in the world, and yet hee durſt not ſo much as ſpeake to her: but regarded her with a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt eye, whereto her eye alſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make anſwere, euen as if an imparlance had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which made his words to <hi>Mabila,</hi> to ſauour of idle and fond imperfection. But ſhee, well knowing the Saint of his deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to cure him of his ouer-awing fit: bethought herſelfe of the moſt honeſt meanes that could be, both to quicken him, and recouer ſome ſpirit likewiſe in <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſaying ſoddenly, Madame, you promiſed <hi>Gandalin</hi> yeſter day, that you would write to Queene <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and to <hi>Melicia,</hi> and (for ought I heare to the contrary) he is preſently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and you haue forgot your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oriana,</hi> who vnderſtood well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at what marke ſhee aymed, anſwered: Let him come hither, and by word of mouth, I will as well ſatisfie him, as if I had trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him with my Letters. Then one of the Damoſels aroſe, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth of the Chamber, called for <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who preſently entred with her. Well had hee beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by <hi>Amadis,</hi> concerning what hee was to doe, if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe would ſpeake with him before this company: wherefore beeing come where ſhe was, hee made her an humble reuerence, and then to his Maſter, who talked all this while (as I formerly told you) with <hi>Mabila.</hi> It was not long, before <hi>Oriana</hi> (who ſate between <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> and <hi>Brian)</hi> aroſe, and taking <hi>Brian</hi> by the hand, ſaid to him. I pray you Coſen, to witneſſe with mee, what meſſage I ſhall ſend by <hi>Gandalin,</hi> to the Queene of <hi>Gaule</hi> and her daughter <hi>Melicia:</hi> to the end, that you may report it to the King my father, if hee inquire any ſuch matter of you. In the meane while, Lord <hi>Quedragant</hi> (if ſo hee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7181:332"/>
be pleaſed) ſhall abide with the Queene <hi>Sardimira,</hi> who knowes well enough how to entertaine him.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Brian,</hi> who was one of the moſt gentle and courteous Knights liuing: would not follow her, but, with an amiable ſmile, thus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Madame, you muſt pardon me, for, beeing appointed (as I haue told you) to goe to the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your buſineſſe: my friends heere may grow ſuſpitious of me, and ſtand in doubt, that I may be ſo ſubborned by your gracious ſpeech, as I ſhall ſhew my ſelfe more milde and tractable to him, then conſiſts in my commiſſion, and the charge I haue receiued from them. Nay Sir, replied <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> heare but the reaſon, why I would haue you acquainted with this meſſage. It is to no other end, but by hearing mine owne tongue to relate my hearts tribulations (wich I deſire ſhould bee knowen, not onely in Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> but likewiſe in all countries of the world:) you would bee the more indulgent, to mediate my peace, and to deliuer al theſe Ladies from impriſonment. And if you were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to any one amongſt them; her vertue might preuaile againſt any ſterne deliberation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oriana</hi> deliuered theſe wordes with ſuch a gracious demeanour, as they all tooke delight to heare &amp; and behold her. Eſpecially <hi>Brian,</hi> who although he was young, faire, and of goodly forme: yet was hee more addicted to follow Armes, then loue; and fewe Knights were more actiue then hee, to handle his launce and ſword, for the defence of iniured Ladies, whenſoeuer they ſtood in need of his help. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee became a friend to all in generall, and did them infinite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſeruices, which being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that <hi>Oriana</hi> ſhould take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, (thus hee anſwered.</p>
                  <p>By my faith Madame, you may eſteeme of mee as you pleaſe, but if I ſhould long tarrie in ſo good company: I greatly feare, I ſhould ſoone loſe that, which I haue alwaies held as mine owne, ſince firſt I had knowledge of my ſelfe. Therefore, I had need to get me further off, and leaue my roome to Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> &amp; your Coſen: they may ſerue you for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, if they be ſo pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for he retired with ſuch a grace as declared ſome baſhfulneſſe of what hee had ſpoken: leauing <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> cloſe by <hi>Amadis,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had any priuate conference with her, ſince his departure from King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>But now, ſeeing opportunity ſo graciouſly fauour him, as he might freely ſpeake what hee vvould hee was ſo vtterly loſt in ioy, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Before God I ſpeake it, I haue no pleaſure but by you, neither any eaſe but to ſee you ſatisfied. But, conſider the tumultuous eſtate wherein we are, and that if we were (neuer ſo little) diſcouered, it would bee to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine of vs both. So many eyes obſerue our behauiour here, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did the like, when wee were in company with the Queen my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And here our actions are ſo narrowly purſued, as (without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terme danger) no ſuch aduenture may be made as you ſpeake of. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me therefore I entreat you, &amp; let this remain for your ſettled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, that I am ſo faithfully yours, as both my oath and promiſe haue ſtrictly bound me. Madame, anſwered <hi>Amadis</hi> I will practiſe how I may beſt pleaſe you, and to bring my thoughts to your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: albeit I much miſdoubt, that this compulſion will hardly holde out, if it be not the better backt by your fauour, from which it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth you ſeek to exclude me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending either in worde or thought, and that I dare maintaine on the perill of my ſoule</p>
                  <p>With theſe wordes, the teares guſhed out of his eyes, where at <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> grieuing, ſaid. Exclude my beſt comfort! Sooner let me die ten thouſand deaths. I know the truth of your loyaltie, and can deſire no better teſtimony thereof, then the iuſt apprehenſion of mine owne conſcience. And take not in ill part what I haue ſaid to you, for the feare of your ſo long abſence from me, as in theſe lauer yeares you

                  <p>As ſhee would haue continued on theſe ſpeeches, <hi>Mabila,</hi> who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but as a ſhadow, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many eyes fixed vpon them, ſpake thus cloſely.

                  <p>No ſooner was hee entred the Chamber, but the Queene behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, fell downe in a ſwoone: yet hauing good helpe about her, quickly ſhe came to her ſelfe again.

wiſedome would preuaile againſt this womaniſh weakeneſſe: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, thoſe matters (about which you thus afflict your ſelfe) being brought to ſo good an end, that our daughter may iuſtly ſtile her ſelfe, one of the greateſt Princeſſe in all <hi>Europe.</hi> Wherefore I pray you be better comforted, and if you will not doe it for your owne ſake: yet let it be done for mine, otherwiſe, you will giue mee occaſion to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſter worſe than I doe. The Queen, well vnderſtanding all that hee ſaide, would expreſſe no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance thereof, but ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any intermiſſion: which mooued the King to ſuch compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as he could not refraine from weeping. But becauſe hee would not be noted hee went downe into the garden, where he walked ſadly alone by himſelfe: till ſuch time as King <hi>Arban</hi> came vnto him, who not ſeeming to perceiue the Kings ſorrow, ſaid. Sir, your huntſmen willed mee to tell you, that they haue found (in this neare neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Forreſt) the greateſt Hart that euer was ſeene: may it pleaſe you (to morrowe) to goe ſee the paſtime? yes, with all my heart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the King.</p>
                  <p>As thus they continued talking, diuerſe Knights came thither, who to alter him from his melancholie diſpoſition: fell into diuerſitie of diſcourſe, ſome of hunting, others of hawking, ſo that all the reſt of the day, they talked of nothing elſe. But the next morning, as they were readie to mount on horſeback, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who is ſeldome ſatisfied with any paſſed misfortunes, brought a new occaſion of much greater ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe. For, ſome of the <hi>Romanes</hi> which had eſcaped from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the <hi>Encloſed Iſle:</hi> preſented themſelues before the King, in very ſory and baſe garments, declaring at large all their diſaſter, his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſurpriſal, &amp; death of the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may now imagine, whether theſe bad tidings amazed him, or no, notwithſtanding, declaring conſtancie, &amp; vnconquerable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: hee made ſhew of little or no diſtaſte at all, but anſwered, as if the matter concerned him a great way off. Friends (quoth hee) I am ſorrie for the death of the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> and the miſhap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen to you: but for the wrong done mee by them of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> I haue been vſed to receiue (&amp; oftentimes to returne alſo) the like Alarums, knowing well enough how to reuenge greater iniuries. Be of good cheere, and at my returne from hunting, I will further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on your buſineſſe. Then calling for one of the maſters of the houſe-holde, hee commanded them to giue them good entertainement.</p>
                  <p>Away rode King <hi>Liſuart</hi> and his traine, declaring a iocond ſpirit all the way, euen till hee was well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Forreſt: where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued three whole daies, pulling downe many a goodly Deare.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7181:334"/>
ſome one, not only in his perſon and goods, but in his honour and reputation: then it agrees with good reaſon, not only to declare paſſion and melancholie, but alſo to practice all meanes of prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to take vengeance on him that committed the offence, and to let the world vnderſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, how highly the greatneſſe of the caſe hath mooued him to impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeake not this to you without cauſe: you haue declared a ſorrow too apparant, for the abſence of your daughter, according to the naturall inclination of mothers: and yet notwithſtanding, I ſhould account my ſelfe happy, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued hope, of ſoone forgetting ſuch griefe. But in the tayle (as we vſe to ſay) is the venomous ſting hidden, and the end of actions doe approue their good, or euill: and therefore I muſt tell you, that ſuch an iniury hath lately been done me, and toucheth me ſo neare, as I ſhall neuer take reſt, till I haue ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anſwerable to my deſire. The <hi>Romans</hi> that had the conducting of your daughter, are diſcomfited, the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide</hi> ſlaine, <hi>Oriana,</hi> and all the other Ladies in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, taken priſoners, by the knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle:</hi> who imagine themſelues not meanely happy by ſuch a victorie, hauing done (as they thinke) more than euer any men did in great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> And becauſe the ſame thereof will ſoone ſpread it ſelf thorow the world, it is very requiſite, that you ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble ſorrow, and vſe more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than paſſion. In ſo doing, you ſhall remaine highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, our enemies daunted, and I extraordinarily contented, hoping to prouide ſo well in this caſe, as your honour and mine ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently defended.</p>
                  <p>When the Queene had heard theſe newes, ſhe ſate very penſiue, not ſpeaking a word. And as ſhee was one of the wiſeſt, and beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed Ladies in the world, &amp; dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly louing to her husband: ſo could ſhe ſuddenly conſider, that it was more neceſſarie, to procure peace betweene the King, and the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> then to ſharpen his fierce ſpleen againſt them, theirs being alſo as hotte towards him, whereupon ſhe returned him this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, you haue conceited (as beſt pleaſed your ſelfe) of my inward affliction, for the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of me and my daughter. But as concerning the fauour done her by the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> if you doe but well conſider the time, when you were a Knight errant, like vnto them, and what you your ſelfe haue done in the like caſes: you would gently excuſe them, in the greater part of their enterpriſe. Doe you thinke, that hauing heard the lamentable moanes ſhe made, euen commonly noiſed in euery countrie, how (in meere deſpight of her) you would marry her to the Emperour: that this would not mooue them to lend her ayde? No man better than your ſelfe doth know, that nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by God and man, then helpe and ſuccour giuen to wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Ladies, eſpecially when it is ſo vrgently required: by very ſtrong reaſon then, ought they to afforde it your daughter, whom they haue knowne and well thought on ſo long a time. Beleeue it my Lord, they can receiue no ſhame by the deed, and your ſelfe will confeſſe in the end, that their attempt ſhold not bee diſpleaſing to you: they preſuming (it may be) that you haue
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7181:335"/>
beene greatly importuned to this marriage, and yeelded thereto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your liking.</p>
                  <p>I well perceiue (quoth the King) that you are not much offended with the matter, but rather you can both like and allow thereof: but I ſweare by God, I will make them dearely repent it. So, riſing in a great rage, hee flung out of the chamber, &amp; entring into his owne, ſound there King <hi>Arban, Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and <hi>Guillan le Penſif,</hi> who went not from him, till hee had tolde them all the conference betweene him and the Queene, and what an anſwere ſhe made him. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw him much incenſed, they thought good, to conceale what the meant to ſay, and milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (by little &amp; little) brake off theſe ſpeeches. But it chanced on the morrowe following, that as the Queene came from hearing Maſſe, <hi>Durin,</hi> brother to the damoſell of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> fell on his knee before her, and preſented her a Letter, which <hi>Oriana</hi> had written to her, as followeth.</p>

After the Queene had aduiſedly read, and re-read ouer this Letter, but not without teares: ſhee ſaid to <hi>Durin,</hi> that ſhee would ſpeake with the King, and afterwards giue him an anſwere. And as ſhee was enquiring of him, what entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Oriana</hi> and her company had in the <hi>Encloſed Iſle:</hi> the King came, whom ſhee withdrawing into her Cabinet, &amp; caſting her ſelfe downe at his feet, weeping bitterly, ſhee thus ſpake to him. Alas Sir, for the honour of God take compaſſion on your daughter, and read (if you pleaſe) this Letter which ſhe hath ſent me. The King ſeeing the Queen ſo drowned in teares, tooke her vp from the ground, and receiuing the Letter from her, read the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof: then to appeaſe the extreamitie of her paſſions, hee thus anſwered, Madame, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours will ſoone be here, that are ſent from thence, haue patience till I haue heard them ſpeake. They may (perhaps) giue me ſuch ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as the iniurie which I haue receiued will bee forgotten: And they may bring ſuch a meſſage, as I will rather conſent to mine owne ruine, and deſolation of all mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, than to peace. Much better doe I affect to die with honour, poore and diſinherited; than to liue amighty King, miſerably wretched &amp; faint-hearted, clowded with the teares of you and your daughter. Wherefore, ſpeake no more hereof to me, except you purpoſe to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me; And ſo leauing her, hee departed out of the chamber.</p>
                  <p>Afterward, ſhe called for <hi>Durin,</hi> and ſaid vnto him. Friend <hi>Durin,</hi> returne to my daughter <hi>Oriana,</hi> and tell her, that I can ſend her no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, vntill the Ambaſſadors ſhal be arriued here, for the King (till then) knowes not how to determine on his buſineſſe. But aſſure her, I will eſſay all poſſible meanes, to do what ſhe hath deſired me. And ſay, I entreate her, alwaies to fixe her owne honour before her eyes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, I ſhall deſire her death. Bid her remember, that a wiſe and diſcreet ſoule, is beſt diſcerned in aduerſitie, and not in the flattering times of proſperity. And ſeeing our Lord hath ſuffered her, to bee borne a Princeſſe, and the daughter of ſo great a King; reaſon doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that vertue ſhould bee more familier with her, than with a body of baſer condition, in all aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (whatſoeuer) that can happen to her. Alwaies committing the managing of her chiefeſt affaires to God: whom I hartily pray to bleſſe her, &amp; preſerue her in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sir, anſwered the Squire, I am ſeruant to <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who hath ſent me to you about ſuch a buſineſſe, as I will relate, if you pleaſe to heare mee.

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> (quoth the Squire) my Maſter, &amp; <hi>Brian de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaſte,</hi> being ſent from the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> are landed in your countrie, to acquaint you with ſome eſpeciall matters, from Lord <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> and other Knights that are in his company, But before they paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further, or come neare your Court, they ſend you word by mee (vnder your gracious fauor) that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7181:336"/>
they require ſafe conduct for their comming. Otherwiſe, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, to publiſh their meſſage in all parts of your Land, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kingdomes beſide, before they make returne to them that ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherefore Sir, aduiſe your ſelfe, and ſend them your intention.</p>
                  <p>Well knewe the King whereat the meſſage aymed, and therefore he thought it not conuenient, that they ſhould proclaime their cauſe thorough his kingdome, a matter not to be done, but to his high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. Conſidering, all Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours ought to haue ſecurity, as being a caſe ſacred and inuiolable, and the Prince that ſhould offer them iniurie, were farre vnworthy the name and office hee beares: wherefore very graciouſly, thus he anſwered the Squire. My friend, ſay to them that ſent you hither, they may ſafely come to my Court, and I will gladly heare their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to me. The Squire hauing this anſwere, returned preſently to his Maſter, who (with <hi>Brian de Monia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte,</hi> being aduertiſed of the Kings minde) forthwith went a ſhoare, &amp; iourneyed ſo expeditiouſly, that on the third day following, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom they preſented them-ſelues, as hee was newly riſen from dinner.</p>
                  <p>He knew them ſo ſoone as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them, being men whom he had often ſeen, wherefore he welcomed them graciouſly: and all preſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the King, to heare their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie, when <hi>Quedragant,</hi> ſetting his knee to the ground, beganne thus. Sir it is a very laudable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, &amp; worthie the higheſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations among Kings and Princes, patiently to heare and vnderſtand, ſuch matters as ſtrange Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours haue in charge to deliuer them, being wholly diſpoſſeſſed of paſſion: becauſe, if the Embaſſie fall out to their contentment, they will receiue the more ioy thereby, and the Ambaſſadours ſhall be the better fauoured and entertained. Contrariwiſe, if they ſpeake mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters diſpleaſing to them, yet ſo to palliate and conceale their anger: that their anſwere may come graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly from them, in regard of the condition and office they beare.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words he aroſe, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe by his fellow before the King, proceeded thus. Sir, I pray you pardon mee, that I haue vſed this induction to you, which I ſweare vpon my faith was not done, in any doubt of the aſſurance you pleaſed to grant vs: but in due and iuſt commendation, of the vertue of ſo good a Prince, that ſo freely gaue vs entrance into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, the occaſion of our comming to your Maieſtic, is, by command of the beſt Knight that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet was knowne, <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> and generally, on the behalfe of all them, that are with him in the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> who thus (by vs) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with their minds. Trauer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing ſtarnge &amp; far remote cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, in ſearch of aduentures, according as all other Knights errant vſe to doe, eſpecially to ſuccour the weak &amp; diſtreſſed, whan outrage (againſt all reaſon) is offered them: they were aduertiſed by many, that you Sir, being guided by a light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate will, rather then vpright iuſtice and equity, was deſirous (contrary to the counſell of all your beſt friends) to diſinherit (with the greateſt ſhame in the world) Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame <hi>Oriana,</hi> your eldeſt daughter, &amp; giue her as wife (againſt her will) to the Emperour <hi>Patin.</hi> So that, neither taking compaſſion on her,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7181:336"/>
nor her inceſſant teares &amp; moanes, much leſſe regarding the end of ſuch an enterpriſe, and manifeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of all your ſubiects: you vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently deliuered her to them, that had no reaſon to requeſt her of you.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſuch matters of fact and iniuſtice, are not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God, but to all ſuch as heare thereof: it pleaſed the hand of heauen, to make vs inſtruments of redreſſe in ſuch a deepe neceſity, and that the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who had the conduct of her and the other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſhould fall into our hands, and ſtanding on their defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, bee vanquiſhed, ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>aine, and others taken priſoners. Now Sir, for her and the Ladies, I muſt tell you, that (at this inſtant) they are in the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> with a good and ſufficient company of Knights, determined to honour them ſo much as they poſſible may. For their intent neuer was to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, or them: but to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine equitie, and keep them from force or violence, according as your ſelfe (ſometime) made them ſweare at <hi>Vindoliſore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let mee therefore entreate you, that preferring vertue and reaſon, before choller and paſſion, you would be pleaſed, to receiue home againe your daughter <hi>Oriana,</hi> and hereafter to entreate her, not as a ſtranger, but as a father ſhould his childe, without ſending her farre from you, or your countrie: where-of, if God be ſo pleaſed, ſhee is to be Lady and Queene after you. If you thinke your ſelfe iniured, and will not grant to their requeſt: that yet you would not deny her your gracious fauour, but accepting her into your Court, as ſhe was wont to bee; to take ſuch reuenge on them afterwards (if you thinke it meet) as you can. For thus much Sir, I muſt aſſure you, that if you purpoſe to aſſayle them; they will defend themſelues as beſt they may. Be therefore well aduiſed on your anſwere, for in your hands you haue both warre and peace.</p>
                  <p>The King, being mightily inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thus replyed. Gentlemen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vertue doth ſeldome keepe company, with temerarious Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor audacious anſwers, both the one and the other beeing farre inſufficient, to whet on or animate cowardly mindes: I will not holde you with any long delay, or vſe many words, when few may ſuffice. But my patience being greater to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, than it needs to be, let mee tell you, that this attempt done by them of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle:</hi> I know to bee executed more vpon preſumption, than any magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of courage, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that what height of honour you imagine to be wonne thereby: any man of good iudgement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, will rather check and fouly condemne it. For, it is a matter of no great difficultie, to put in diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or to ouercome ſuch perſons, as trauaile by Land or Sea without all dread or ſuſpition, eſpecially, when men repute themſelues to be among their friends. As for your propoſed remonſtrance, for recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling home my daughter <hi>Oriana,</hi> and neuer more to ſend her farre from mee: this is no matter, whereof I am not to yeelde any account to you, but to God only, who (next to himſelfe) hath conſtituted me So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne in this kingdome, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne both it and the people.

                  <p>Sir, ſaid <hi>Brian,</hi> wee haue no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commiſſion to you, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after any other buſineſſe; what elſe is to bee done, let each ſide conſider thereon as they think good. But God only knoweth the occaſion, that made vs enterpriſe what wee haue done, for the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of your vertuous daughter: and vpon that point wee reſt, and craue leaue for our departure. Go in Gods name, ſaid the King. Thus were the Ambaſſadours diſpacht, <hi>Grumedan</hi> bringing them aboue a mile out of the Citie, ſayde vnto them. Before God Gentlemen, I am much grieued at this new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, I alwaies did hope, to ſee you (one day) as welcome againe to this Court, as euer you haue been: but now I am verily perſwaded, that our long expected peace will come too late (except our Lord helpe it) conſidering the minde of <hi>Amadis.</hi> Nor did I imagine him to bee in the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> becauſe we heard newes, that hee was vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt foure yeares agoe: and now it amazeth mee not a little, that he ſhould be ſo ſuddenly found again, and giue ſuch ſuccour to Madame <hi>Oriana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Grumedan,</hi> anſwered <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> the King (it may be) will know in time, both what we are, and what ſeruices we haue done him: And if he attempt any thing againſt vs, hee will finde the iſſue to be more ſharp and ſower, than the entrance was pleaſing or delightſome. As for Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> you ſawe him not long ſince in this Court, when hee conquered the Crowne from the <hi>Romans,</hi> that maintained the beauty of the maides of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> to bee more excellent than the Ladies that came with him. Saint <hi>Mary!</hi> ſaid <hi>Grumedan,</hi> what doe you tell me? Is it poſſible, that <hi>Amadis</hi> was the Greek Knight? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, anſwered <hi>Brian,</hi> it was he, and none other. By my ſoule, ſaid <hi>Grumedan,</hi> I now well perceiue, that I am a man of very poore iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing I might then haue wel aſſured my ſelfe, that it was hard for any man to doe what he did; I may doubt whether I haue eyes &amp; vnderſtanding. But faire Sir, ſeeing you haue already done ſo much for me, let mee further entreate you to tell mee: who they were that lent aſſiſtance on my day of Combat? Who? anſwered <hi>Brian,</hi> ſmiling, why two of your very deareſt friends: <hi>Angriote d' Eſtrauaus,</hi> and <hi>Brunco de bonne Mer.</hi> In good ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (quoth <hi>Grumedan)</hi> if I had knowne them, I ſhould haue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted my victorie more certaine than I did: and am well content to confeſſe now, that the honour of the day is more iuſtly due to them, than to me, and all my life time, I am a friend and ſeruant to <hi>Amadis,</hi> and to you likewiſe, mine honour reſerued.</p>
                  <p>As thus they rode on deuiſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they met with <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> newly returned from hawking, with <hi>Ambor,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Angriote d' Eſtra: uaus,</hi> carrying a Spar-hawke on his fiſt: and comming ſomewhat neare them, <hi>Brian de Moniaſte,</hi> demanded what he was. This is (anſwered <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan)</hi> the young Gentleman <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian,</hi> of whom the wiſe <hi>Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> hath ſpoken ſo many maruailes. I haue heard of him, ſayd <hi>Brian,</hi> heretofore. I pray you cauſe him to ſtay a while, that wee may the better beholde him. Which <hi>Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> did, for, as hee was paſſing by them, hee called to him, ſaying. Come hither Sir, ſee heere the friends of the Greeke Knight, who
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7181:337"/>
(at your requeſt) pardoned the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Knights: at leaſt wiſe, ſend him ſome commendations, from your ſelfe. My Lord, anſwered <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian,</hi> I humbly entreate them to pardon me, I knew them not: but for my loue to that good Knight, I would gladly haue the meanes to doe him any ſeruice, and if they pleaſe to kiſſe his hand on my behalfe, they ſhall binde me to them all my life time.</p>
                  <p>Faire Sir, ſaide <hi>Brian,</hi> that office ſhall be mine, and I will doe it with a glad ſoule: albeit hee hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his name ſince you laſt ſaw him, for now hee is called <hi>Amadis de Gaule: Amadis de Gaule</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> ſurely I cannot think it, becauſe I heard that he was dead: whereat I conceiued no little grief, for the renowned proweſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be in him. It is he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſaid <hi>Quedragant.</hi> Then Sir I dare aſſure you. replied <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> I am not ſo forie for the loſſe of my hawke this day (though I loued her dearely) as I am ioyfull to heare what you haue tolde me: becauſe, if I may liue to grow great, I will begge ſo earneſtly of the Queene, that ſhe ſhall not deny mee to goe ſee him, and to receiue my Knight-hood from his hand, if hee ſhall pleaſe ſo much to honor me. Sweet youth, ſaid <hi>Brian,</hi> God bleſſe and proſper you.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>fter that <hi>Quedragant</hi> &amp; <hi>Brian</hi> were departed from the Court, King <hi>Liſuart</hi> found himſelfe wonderfully diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſeeing ſuch weightie occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to grow more and more vpon him: he intended on the morrow to call a Councell, only of <hi>Arban,</hi> King of <hi>Norwales, Grum den,</hi> and <hi>Guillan le Penſit;</hi> who being mette together, the King beganne in this manner. Honourable friends, you know what iniurie I haue receiued by the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> and what ſhame I ſhould do to my ſelfe, in ſuffering them to paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed. Neuertheleſſe, not to ſhunne the way which all Princes ſhould take, doing nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counſell and deliberation: I would firſt bee aduiſed by you, in what manner I ſhould ſhape my reuenge, that hereafter they may remain an example to ſuch as dare enter into the like attempts againſt mee. Full well you knowe, how dangerous it is to vſe delay in ſuch actions, and of what conſequence my occaſion is: therefore I pray you, let vs conſider together on ſome redreſſe, and euery man free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake his minde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arban</hi> King of <hi>Norwales,</hi> was the firſt that anſwered, ſpeaking thus. Sir, ſeeing you are reſolued to make warre againſt <hi>Amadis</hi> and thoſe of his league, accounting it vnmeete, to accept the offer made you by them: it is expedient to conſider,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7181:338"/>
that the managing of the matter may bee ſo ordered, as the glory muſt remaine to you. For although we holde it vndoubtedly, that vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie conſiſteth in the hand of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen onely, God giuing it when, where, and how hee pleaſeth, and commonly, agreeing with the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the cauſe: yet diligent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence is not to bee neglected, in all ſuch caſes, as are required, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any enterpriſe be attempted, or any contempt made of the enemie. It is good to imagine, that he may prooue able enough to finde you play ſufficient, if fortune looke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably on his cauſe: conſidering, that when men are too confident, either of their owne right, or truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their owne ſtrength: it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth their ruine and totall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, through ouer-bolde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, albeit the victorie were their due.</p>
                  <p>Fauour me Sir to tell you, that if you well conſider, with whom you haue to deale: mee thinkes, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantageable peace were more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for you, than a hazardous and doubtfull warre, falling out more ſtrangely then can bee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. You know <hi>Amadis,</hi> and the reſt (by whom hee is backt and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) to bee all good Knights, men of great ſpirit, and all of them nearely alyed to Kings and potent Princes, who will not faile them for any diſaſter, or death it ſelfe. You know alſo, on the other ſide, that the moſt part of your ſubjects, neuer liked or thought well of the deliberation (meerly made by your ſelfe) for marrying your daughter to the Emperour, the onely motiue and occaſion of this warre. And therefore, you may be well aſſured, that how ſoeuer they beare it with a ſmooth brow, and rankerous ſpleen inwardly: they can be eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, that all ſhould goe but bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on your ſide, by not following their liking; howbeit, I make no doubt, but that they will ſerue you in all loyalty.</p>
                  <p>You haue ſaid well, anſwered the King, but wee are not now to ſtand vpon theſe tearmes. I doe not craue your counſell, whether I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine peace or warre: but only would know of you, by what means I may be beſt reuenged. Sir (quoth hee) by my former ſpeeches, you may eaſily knowe that. Aſſemble your forces &amp; ſend to your friends for aſſiſtance: eſpecially to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe this caſe concerneth him, as nearely as you. Afterward, your Army beeing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, march on (without any dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) towardes them whom you meane to aſſault. But before you doe this, it were good (in mine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) to practice ſome meanes, whereby you may call home ſome that are farre off from your ſeruice, partly through diſcontentment, &amp; partly by wrongs offered. I vrge this motion, becauſe if they be not willing to ayde you; they ſhould not reſolue to offend you. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of your Land, it would fal out dangerous, if they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire and bend themſelues againſt you, if Fortune doe lowre that day vpon you. For, many times it comes to paſſe, that diſtaſtes and diſſents led by length of time, doe ſooneſt make their outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when his power (againſt whom the conſpiracy is meant) growes weake &amp; decayed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sir, this is one of the chiefeſt points, whereof you are maturely to conſider.</p>
                  <p>Truly, ſaid the King, I know that you haue ſpoken to the purpoſe, &amp; will do therein what I can. Sir, ſaid <hi>Grumedan, Amadis</hi> hath bin (here-tofore)
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7181:338"/>
ſo well accepted in your Court, as no man poſibly could be more: and I could heartily wiſh, that thoſe villaines which cauſed this ſo long ſeparation, had neuer been borne into the world. And although I am his friend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, ſo ſhall I bee no enemy to you, if you deſiſt from beeing his. Wherefore, according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice giuen you by King <hi>Arban:</hi> it were good, that (aboue all other things) you reconcile them to you that pertake with him, winning their hearts and willes by little and little: as eaſily you may doe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them good lookes and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous language. Then hauing the help of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other your allies, as the Kings of <hi>Ireland Suetia,</hi> I make no queſtion, but you may (with little eaſe) attaine to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, euen according to your owne minde.</p>
                  <p>But my good Lord, ſaid <hi>Guillan,</hi> before any matter at all be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it were good to know, if thoſe men may bee reſolued on, whom you haue named. Are you ſure that the Emperour will meddle in the cauſe? He is a man of very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der faith, and as ill affected of his owne people, as can be. Are you certaine alſo, that the King of <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> will doe as you ſay? If his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie were ſo pleaſed. Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours ſhould be ſent to them ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, to entreate their fauour in this caſe, ſhewing them apparantly: that if reuenge for ſuch a wrong were iuſtly inflicted, it would with-draw any from attempting the like. In good ſadneſſe, ſaide the King, you haue very well aduiſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you (Lord <hi>Guillan)</hi> doe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently vnderſtand the buſineſſe: I pray you take the charge vpon you to the Emperor, for I know no Knight more able to preuaile with him, then you are. Sir, ſaide <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> I was not borne but for your ſeruice, when, and where you ſhall pleaſe to commande mee. Make ready then (quoth the King) to morrow you ſhall haue Letters of credence only, and the reſt remaine to your owne report.</p>
                  <p>So they aroſe from Councell, and each man returned to his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, till the next morning: when the King ſending for <hi>Guillan,</hi> ſaide vnto him. Lord <hi>Guillan,</hi> according to our concluſion yeſter-day, you muſt depart towards the Emperor, and with as much expedition as may be. To him make knowne, how matters haue come to paſſe, that hauing deliuered my daughter to his Ambaſſadours: ſhee was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſurpriſed from them, and forcibly carried to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> his men all ſlaine, or taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whereof hee ought to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, this iniury redounding as much to him as me. If he offer aid, and will leuy an Army to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: ſay, that on my part ſhall be no defailance, in any thing my power can ſtretch vnto. If you find him willing to proceed effectually, returne againe with all poſſible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: that our enemies may haue no leaſure to fortifie themſelues, as I am certaine they intend to doe.</p>
                  <p>Sir, anſwered <hi>Guillan,</hi> God giue me grace to accompliſh your will in this, and any thing elſe you ſhall pleaſe to employ mee in. Worthy friend ſaid the King, there are your Letters of credence, and if it bee poſſible, ſet away to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning early, for one of my beſt Ships is made ready for you, and waites your comming in the hauen. Sir, replied <hi>Guillan,</hi> there ſhall bee no want of duty in me. And ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leaue, and giuing order for his further affaires, he went aboard,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7181:339"/>
and ſet away. The very ſame day <hi>Brandoynas</hi> alſo was diſpatched for <hi>Galuanes,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Mongaza,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> to make ready ſo many men as he could. <hi>Philipinell</hi> was ſent to <hi>Gaſquilan,,</hi> King of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> who ſometime came into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> to approue his manhood againſt <hi>Amadis.</hi> King <hi>Laſuart</hi> ſent him word, that if his ſpleene as yet continued: hee ſhould now haue better meanes then euer, becauſe the warre was intended againſt him.</p>
                  <p>So farre did theſe newes fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that they came to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of <hi>Archalaus</hi> the Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to his no little ioy and comfort; intending (by this occaſion) the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, of <hi>Amadis.</hi> And for his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier attaining thereto, he went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to King <hi>Aramyne:</hi> who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his ariuall, gaue him moſt royall entertainement, preſuming peremptorily, that hee would not come into his countrie, but vpon ſome very vrgent occaſion. Beeing priuately ſeated together, <hi>Archalaus</hi> thus began.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſome few dayes ſince, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued credible information, that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> and <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> (two of the deadlieſt enemies you haue) are fallen vpon ſuch a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell: as, without any hope of peace euer to come betweene them, they muſter men for a maine battell, out of which they cannot eſcape, but with the finall deſtruction of the one, or other, &amp; (perhaps) of them both together. And becauſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth expreſſely call you, as wel to reuenge your former loſſes in times paſt, as alſo to extend your limits, by peaceable making your ſelfe King of Great <hi>Brittaine:</hi> me thinkes you ſhould not delay the muſtering of your men, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning all your friends together, that while they cauill, &amp; maintaine their quarrell ſo farre off, you may take ſo apt an aduantage, and make an eaſie entrance into <hi>Brittaine.</hi> If they chance to meet, and fight the field; then, without giuing the leaſt leaſure to the conqueror, to breath or refreſh his followers: you may ſet vpon him ſo opportunately, and bid him ſo hot an vnexpected bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, as none of them can eſcape with life.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, to acquaint you with the cauſe of their enmity, you muſt vnderſtand, that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his eldeſt daughter for <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing giuen her as wife to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> (one of them, who in your laſt loſt battaile, termed himſelfe Knight of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and then wore (as you well remember) a golden helmet) with a great many more, met the <hi>Romans</hi> on the Sea, ſet vpon them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomming them, ſlew the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> a near kinſman to the Emperour. The reſt were taken priſoners, with the Ladies &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, whom they conueyed to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> where as yet they keepe them. Now indeede I cannot certainely reſolue you, what matter mooued them to begin this warre, but I am well aſſured, that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> in reuenge of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury, gathers as great an Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as hee can. And <hi>Amadis</hi> hath ſent into all parts for ſuccour, purpoſing to ſtand vpon his owne defence, if he ſhall be aſſailed.</p>
                  <p>During theſe buſie troubles, Sir, you haue an excellent occaſion (if you pleaſe) to ſhew them as ſubtill a ſleight as euer was done, ſetting vpon them as I haue directed you. And becauſe (at the very firſt ſight) you may diſcerne your victory to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7181:339"/>
be certaine: I will worke ſo much, that <hi>Barſinan,</hi> Lord of <hi>Sanſuegna,</hi> ſonne to him whom the King bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>London,</hi> and likewiſe all they of the linage of <hi>Dardan</hi> the <hi>Proude,</hi> whom <hi>Amadis</hi> foyled at <hi>Vindoliſore,</hi> ſhall come to your aide, with the King of the <hi>Profound Iſle.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, perſwade your ſelfe, that being aſſiſted with ſo great a number of good Knights: there is no doubt to be made, but you ſhall reach the height of your deſire.</p>
                  <p>My worthy good friend <hi>Archa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> anſwered the King <hi>Aranigne,</hi> you tell mee great matters, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I was fully determined, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more to tempt fortune, ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhewen me ſuch ſlender fauor in times paſt, yet me thinks it were a great folly, to foreſlowe ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as freely come to offer themſelues, for the augmentation of my honour and profit. For, if in ſuch caſes, attempts managed by reaſon, haue as happy iſſue as men can wiſh: the fruit of ſuch a labour is well gathered, when deſert holds vp the lappe to receiue it. But if it ſhould fall out otherwiſe, yet (at leaſt) that muſt be performed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men ſtand bound by vertue, for maintenance of their authority, which is not to be valued by paſſed misfortunes, as (when a happy houre preſents it ſelfe) they ſhould refuſe to embrace it, as declaring themſelues to be daſtardly minded, and voide of all courage and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie. Seeing then wee are ſo forward in tearms, let it ſuffice, that I faithfully credit you, and deſire you (while I am prouiding mine Army) to take order for the reſt, ſending to <hi>Barſinan</hi> and our other friends, for their effectuall ioyning with vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Archalans</hi> hauing heard this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, made no long ſtay with King <hi>Aranigne:</hi> but taking leaue of him, iournied ſo diligently, that hee ariued in the countrie of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuegna,</hi> where hee found <hi>Barſinan.</hi> To him he tolde all the paſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, ſetting before his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what an execrable iniurie King <hi>Liſuart</hi> had done to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuffering to bee burned aliue by a tower, from the toppe where-of (afterward) hee cauſed his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gandandell</hi> to bee throwne downe, whom <hi>Guillan le Penſif</hi> had taken priſoner. And doe you think (quoth he) that had it not been for this <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> but <hi>Barſinan</hi> your father, had peaceably beene King of Great <hi>Brittaine?</hi> But that villaine came, and after hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued <hi>Oriana</hi> from mee, cauſed all the reſt of my enterpriſe to bee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly voide. But now you haue time conuenient to bee reuenged, therfore, except you will ſhew your ſelfe dull &amp; baſe minded; delay no longer, conſidering, that King <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne</hi> is ready to aſſiſt you.</p>
                  <p>Eaſily did <hi>Barſinan</hi> beleeue all that hee had ſaid, and promiſed to appeare in field, ſo ſoone as any need required. So <hi>Archalaus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence, to the King of the <hi>Profound Iſle,</hi> and gaue to him the very ſame inſtructions. Hauing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained what he deſired, he returned homeward, and croſſing the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, aduiſed all the kindred of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> the <hi>Proude,</hi> to be in a readineſs, to depart away when they ſhould be commanded. But at this inſtant; our Hiſtory ſpeakes no more there-of: but returnes to the fortunes of <hi>Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Brian,</hi> being vnder ſaile for the <hi>Encloſed Iſle.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe for the <hi>Encloſed Iſle:</hi> but vpon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the windes began to blow ſo ſtearnely, and ſuch a violent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt aroſe, as the beſt man of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage among them, made little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of eſcaping, ſeeing their ſaile yardes and tacklings broken in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and with ſuch impetuous guſts of contrarie windes, as truſting nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtearne, or any hope elſe, but the mercy of God only, and the waues, they expected ſinking eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minute. So long they ran this diſaſterous fortune, that the dead darke night ouer-tooke them, with extreame thunders, and flaſhes of lightning, which was their beſt meanes for ſeeing one another: till day-breake appeared, the windes grew appeaſed, and the Sea (by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little) indifferently calmed.</p>
                  <p>Now they could plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that they were caſt farre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough out of their courſe, for they diſcouered the coaſt of <hi>Sobradiſa:</hi> and as they were preparing thither, they eſpied a goodly great Shippe ſayling towardes them, which they determined to call to, to knowe who was aboard her. Comming more neare, they beheld vpon the decke, diuerſe Ladies and Gentle-women, and ſome Knights among them, diſcourſing together: where-upon, before they would preſume any further, they put forth a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, commanding one of their Squires, to goe know of whence, &amp; what they were. The Squire perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his charge, and going aboard the Ship, humbly ſaluted ſuch as he ſaw there, ſaying. Lords and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, there are Gentlemen in yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhip, who (in curteſie) deſire to vnderſtand, what you are, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are bound. Honeſt friend anſwered one of them, ſay, that the Queene of <hi>Sobradiſa</hi> is here, and longs to be at the <hi>Encloſed Iſle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe newes Sir, anſwered the Squire, will be very welcome to two Knights, that ſent mee to you, who are alſo bound for the ſelfe ſame place. Honeſt Squire, ſayde the Queene, tell vs then their names, if you may do it. Indeed Madame (quoth hee) I ſtand charged to the contrary. But thus much I dare tell you, that they tooke ſhipping in Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> to returne to the Pallace of <hi>Apolidon;</hi> where they had been before now, if fortune had not hindred their voyage. But I am very certaine, that their ioy (for meeting with you) will make them forget all their paſſed dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: wherefore I will returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to them, and tell them what I haue heard of you. So ſaying, he went back to the Ship from whence hee came, and declared to <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant</hi> &amp; <hi>Brian</hi> his anſwere, where-of they were not a little ioyfull. And drawing nearer, ioyned their veſſell with the Queenes, and going aboard, humbly ſaluted her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:7181:340"/>
Here I muſt tell you, that ſhee many times (formerly) had ſeene them at <hi>London,</hi> and in diuerſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, which made her the ſooner take knowledge of them: and entertayning them with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable reſpect, ſhee ſpake thus vnto them. Before God, Gentle-men, next to <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> to whom I ſtand very much obliged, it were hard for mee to meet with more welcome men, and I pray you tell mee, what fortune hath conducted you hither: becauſe <hi>Tantiles</hi> Maſter of my houſholde, aſſured mee that hee ſawe you ſette ſaile for Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> about bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe for the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, anſwered <hi>Quedragant, Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> tolde you true, and wee haue beene with King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and vſed our beſt endeauour to make peace betweene him, and our friends in the <hi>Encloſed Iſle:</hi> but hee miſliking ſo faire a concluſion, wee are the more onward for tearmes of warre.</p>
                  <p>Then hee reported at large, what ſpeeches had paſt betweene King <hi>Liſuart</hi> and him, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they parted. But (quoth hee) we were no ſooner put to Sea, but ſo violent a tempeſt ouertooke vs, as we expected nothing but drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and by theſe meanes, haue wee runne ſo farre from our right courſe. In good faith, ſaide ſhe, wee haue had our part of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt too, and greatly feared the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our Shippe, conſidering what dangers ſhee hath endured. And let mee tell you, two whole daies are already paſt, ſince we ſet forth from <hi>Sobradiſa:</hi> expreſſely to goe ſee <hi>Amadis</hi> and Madame <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and all the good company there with them.

But for ought I can perceiue, hee greatly forgets him-ſelfe, whereat I much maruaile, and it ſeemes, that hee is wearied with his long continued good fortune: beginning warre ſo raſhly, with them that haue done him ſo many great ſeruices, whereof hee may repent him at leaſure. For Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> will finde ſo many ſure friends, and all ready at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> (it may be) will ſee himſelfe deceiued in his expectation.</p>
                  <p>As for my ſelfe (quoth ſhee) vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this onely, and no other cauſe, haue I left <hi>Tantiles</hi> behinde, with expreſſe charge, to leuy in my ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, twelue hundred able men for warre, and to bring them away with all poſſible ſpeed. But if it might ſo pleaſe you wee would be very glad of your company, ſeeing we are thus ſo well mette together. Madame, ſaide <hi>Brian,</hi> ſeeing your Ship is much crazed, may it pleaſe you to goe aboard ours, and yours ſhall follow, whereto all agreed. And ſo they ſet on, deuiſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, on many matters: till at length, they eſpied two men of warre vnder ſayle, which <hi>Tiron</hi> had purpoſely ſent forth, to diſappoint and ſurprize the Queen.</p>
                  <p>Now, concerning this <hi>Tiron,</hi> whereof I now make mention to you, hee was the ſonne to <hi>Abiſeos,</hi> whom <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Agraies</hi> conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded withall, in the citie of <hi>Sobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſa:</hi> according as you haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die heard, in the firſt booke of this Hiſtory. By whoſe death, and likewiſe of his two eldeſt ſonnes, <hi>Briolania</hi> remained peaceably Queene of the whole countrie: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of one Caſtle only, wherein, this <hi>Tiron</hi> (third ſonne to the ſaide <hi>Abiſeos)</hi> was ſaued by an ancient
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7181:341"/>
Knight, who had the charge of him, and therefore there nouriſhed him, till he came to able age of bearing Armes, and to receiue knighthood. Then hee began to worke wonders, ſo that hee was reputed, for one of the beſt and boldeſt Knights then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Which the aged Knight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, hee put him in minde to compaſſe the recouery of his loſt country againe, preſſing him ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunatly, to reuenge the death of his father, and brethren: that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluedly determined, to aduenture the taking of Queen <hi>Briolania,</hi> and afterward, to make him ſelf an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute King, if he could.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, hee being informed, that ſhee embarked her ſelfe for the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> and but with a ſmall company: made ready two Ships, &amp; with an hundred hardy Knights, lay hulling on the Sea before, to execute the full of his intent. The ſunne grew to declining, and night not farre off, wherefore <hi>Brian</hi> and <hi>Quedragant,</hi> doubting to be aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſtood on their guard, becauſe they ſaw the other make a pace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, by help of their Oares. Being come neare vnto them, they heard the voyce of a man, calling out aloud to them, in this manner. Knights, you that acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany Queen <hi>Briolania,</hi> tell her, that her Coſen <hi>Tiron</hi> is here, and would ſpeake with her: commanding you her people, not to ſtand vpon any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt vs, leaſt wee hew you in peeces, and beſtow no better fortune on her.</p>
                  <p>When the Queene heard theſe wordes, ſhee was ſurpriſed with a wonderfull feare, and trembled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, ſaying to <hi>Brian.</hi> Alas Sir, wee are all vndone, this is the greateſt enemy that I haue in the world: and beleeue, that he would neuer come in this manner, but to deale with vs as cruelly as hee can. Madame, anſwered <hi>Quedragant,</hi> feare not any thing, if he aſſault vs, hee will (perhaps be better welco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then hee lookes for. For my companion &amp; ten of your Knights, ſhall take charge for reſiſting one of their Ships: and I and the reſt will deale with <hi>Tiron,</hi> vnto whom he ſpake thus. Knight, thou that deſireſt to ſee the Queene: come hither aboard her Shippe, and ſhe will gladly heare thee, otherwiſe, not. Come aboard? quoth <hi>Tiron,</hi> why, that is my meaning; in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of her and thee, or any elſe whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>So turning inſtanſtly the prow of his Ship, &amp; ſiding the Queenes, the grappling irons were caſt forth, to faſten them together: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſigne to his other Shippe, to fight couragiouſly, the aſſault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne very ſharpe and dangerous. Wherein hee vſed but ſilly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, making ſmall account of the Queenes ſtrength, which he found greater than hee was aware of. And <hi>Tiron,</hi> ſcuffling ouer negligently in his owne quarrell, would needes ſtep into the Queenes ſhippe: but his tarrying there was longer then he looked for, for <hi>Quedragant</hi> mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there with him, found him ſuch tough play, as <hi>Tiron</hi> was beaten downe, and committed to ſafe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie, albeit his Knights did their vttermoſt endeauour to reſcue him. Neuertheleſſe, in the concluſion, not one of them all eſcaped in their reſſiſtance, but was either ſlaine, or taken priſoner. This ſo daunted their courages, that (by little and little) getting vp aloſt on the deck, they began to cut the cords of the grappling irons, which faſtened the two Ships together. But <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant</hi> perceiued it, and ſeeing fortune was onely for him, in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7181:341"/>
deſpight of <hi>Tirons</hi> Knights: he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred their Shippe, where hee made ſuch a maſſacre, as hee quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came maſter thereof.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while, <hi>Brian</hi> kept heade with them in the other Ship, and although hee was grieuouſly wounded, yet could they gaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt him: but, ſeeing their companions loſt, gaue ouer fight, and laboured to gette away by all meanes they could vſe, and ſo the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle</hi> were Lords of the victory. Hereupon, <hi>Quedragant</hi> appointed guards for the Ship which hee had conquered, then hee entred into that where Queene <hi>Briolania</hi> was, who (during all the fight) ſate cloſely in her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, more dead than aliue, onely through her extreame feare. But when ſhee ſaw <hi>Quedragant,</hi> her heart was cheered, &amp; then ſhe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned the ſucceſſe of her enemies.</p>
                  <p>Madame, quoth hee, the moſt part of them are ſlaine, drowned and fled, and the reſt (I hope) will giue you no ill language: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Tiron,</hi> whom hee commanded (by his guardes) to be brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as accordingly they did, and hee fearing ſome cruell death to be inflicted on him, fell downe at the Queenes feete, ſaying. Alas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, for the honour of God take pittie on mee, and without obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing my fooliſh enterpriſe, excuſe my youth. I am of your blood, and may hereafter do you ſome ſeruice, if it will pleaſe you to ſaue my life. <hi>Tiron</hi> ſaid ſhe, not for any loue wee beare you, but for ſome other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon mouing vs thereto: you ſhall not die now, nor till I ſhall be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aduiſed, how to deale with you. So he was ſent backe to his priſon, and <hi>Brian</hi> came ſore wounded with an arrow, which pierced quite tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his ſhield, and ſunne a great way into his arme. The Queen was ſo grieued therat, as nothing could more diſpleaſe her, fearing the harme to be farre worſe then it was indeed. Neuertheleſſe, concealing her owne thoughts, ſhe (being very skilfull in Chirurgery) ſaid, it was a matter of nothing, and doubted not, but within few dates, he ſhould be ſafe and ſound againe.</p>
                  <p>With her owne hands ſhee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly vnarmed him, and applied ſuch medicines to the hurts, as were moſt expedient. Afterwards, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſayle, they held on their courſe to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> where they ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, euen as <hi>Amadis</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knights were walking on the ſands. Seeing theſe Ships making in thither, they went on, to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſolued of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: when preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they knew the Squires of <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant</hi> &amp; <hi>Brian,</hi> as the were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming firſt to Land. Being minded, to queſtion ſome newes of their Maſters, they ſawe them entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the port: wherefore, euery one ſtroue, who ſhould bee formoſt to welcome them; but they were much amazed, to ſee the other Shippes which they brought with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brian</hi> perceiuing their doubt in this kinde, ſaid vnto them pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmiling. You know Gentlemen, when wee parted from this place, we went away with one Ship onely, and now you ſee how our ſtore is encreaſed, meerly by conqueſt, and with a greater booty than you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, wherein you are to haue no part or aduantage. For, ſeeing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath been ſo fauourable to vs, her bleſſings muſt remaine to vs: and not to you, that loyter here in idleneſſe, while we labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. Well Sir, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> it ſhall ſuffice vs, to partake in the pleaſure you haue had: prouided,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7181:342"/>
you muſt tell vs, if the booty be ſo great as you would make vs belieue. Nay, much greater ſaid <hi>Brian,</hi> &amp; to approue my words, is it not a faire conqueſt, to win a Queen, &amp; ſuch a one, as ſhe of <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> with many beautifull Ladies, and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men beſide, as you ſhall ſee imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately? By my faith, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> your booty cannot bee tearmed ſmall.</p>
                  <p>As thus they paſſed on their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant talke, the Queene and her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were landed, and euery man was ready and dutifull, to welcome them with all poſſible honour, and goodly Palfrayes, were preſently brought, wherupon they all moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo rode on to the Pallace of <hi>Apolidon.</hi> On the way, <hi>Amadis</hi> giuing gracious entertainement to <hi>Briolania,</hi> ſpake thus. Madme, it is to mee no little ioy, to ſee you in theſe parts ſafe &amp; well, accounting my ſelf more beholden to you then euer, that you would take ſo much paines, as come and ſee vs: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in ſuch a time of no meane tribulation, and when you may beſt comfort Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom you ſhall ſee ſo ouer-gone with griefe, as no one poſſible can ſuffer more. But I hope your preſence will be ſo pleaſing to her, as ſhe will learne to forget a great part of her melancholy.</p>
                  <p>My Lord (quoth ſhee) for this cauſe only haue I left my countrie, and God doth beſt knowe, what griefe I haue endured in your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, neuer hearing any tydings of you. Yet I receiued ſome comfort by the ariuall of <hi>Tantiles,</hi> whom I haue left at home in my countrey, to leauy men for warre, according as you haue ſent me worde by him: and I my ſelfe had taken the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, but for my earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee you and Madame <hi>Oriana.</hi> Neuertheleſſe, without the help of <hi>Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Brian,</hi> mine enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe was in danger to bee diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as at more leaſure I ſhall let you fully vnderſtand.</p>
                  <p>Here I muſt tell you, that <hi>Amadis</hi> (ſo ſoone as hee ſaw Queen <hi>Briola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> there ariued) ſent to aduertiſe the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> thereof, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate the acceptation of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which accordingly ſhee did, becauſe ſhee loued and eſteemed her extraordinarily, in ſo much, as ſhee ſaid to the Queene <hi>Sardamira.</hi> Madame, you ſhall ſee annon, one the moſt faire &amp; gracious Princeſſe that euer you beheld, and one that deſerues our very beſt entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore let me ſo much preuaile with you, that you <hi>Mabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> and <hi>Olinda,</hi> will goe welcome her at the Parke gate, where ſhee is to allight, and giue her all kinde &amp; gracious welcome. Hereupon they three (without any tarying) went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and as they opened the gate, <hi>Briolania</hi> came thither, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as you haue formerly heard: where <hi>Amadis</hi> tooke her from her horſe, and beholding them that ſtayed for her, he ſaid. I perceiue Madame, that wee muſt leaue you, for I ſee my Coſen <hi>Mabila,</hi> is come to depriue vs of your company.</p>
                  <p>Shee had vnderſtood before, that <hi>Oriana</hi> was retyred by her ſelfe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied with her women, and none elſe: wherefore (ſmiling) ſhe thus anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> Be you Sir then hence forth religiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for the harme you haue done with that piercing eye, you ſhould be ſure of puniſhment enough. As hee ſpake theſe wordes, hee would haue ſtept into the Parke: but <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:7181:342"/>
areſted him, ſaying. Coſen, our order forbids you, to paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further: therefore goe back, or elſe wee haue power to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate you. Marry God forbid ſaid hee, I had rather bid you and your company good night, than run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch an heynous danger. So, taking leaue of them, the gate was made faſt againe, and <hi>Briolania</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to <hi>Orianaes</hi> chamber, where ſhee attended her comming, with all her other Ladies and Gentle-women, and gaue her very worthy welcome: and being much affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her, ſhee was the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let her know how glad ſhee was of her ariuall there, ſaying. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, you haue taken extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie paines, to come and ſee me in ſo remote a countrie, and at a time of ſuch affliction: whereby I well perceiue, that good will and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo long time borne me, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought you hither, and cauſed your kinde voyage.</p>
                  <p>Madame, anſwered <hi>Briolania,</hi> ſo ſoone as I was aduertiſed of your eſtate, I could not forbeare, but come my ſelfe in perſon to ſee you, with whatſoeuer remaineth in my power to doe for you. For, ouer &amp; beſides the good I heartily wiſh you, it is generally knowne, by how many ſeuerall duties Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> hath bound me to him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch matters as concerne him, I account as much or more mine owne. And for this reaſon I haue leſt <hi>Tanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> (whom you wel know) behinde mee, to leauie Knights and bold ſouldiers in my countries, and very ſpeedily hee will bee here with them, according to the truſt I haue alwaies repoſed in him. In the meane while, ſo it may be no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to you, I will keep you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, till your affaires haue a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and ſucceſſefull ending.</p>
                  <p>Very graciouſly did <hi>Oriana</hi> thank her declaring, how ſhee expected the returne of <hi>Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who were gone to her father King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> to procure peace, if poſſibly it might be. Now although <hi>Briolania</hi> knew what anſwere they had receiued, yet would ſhee not ſpeake thereof: becauſe <hi>Graſinda</hi> came to them, whom <hi>Briolania</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neuer ſeen before, demanded of <hi>Oriana,</hi> what ſhe was. I promiſe you Madame (quoth ſhee) this is the only woman in the world, of a ſtranger, to whom Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtands moſt beholding: for, but by her meanes, you had neuer ſeene him here. then ſhee related, what ſuccour ſhee had giuen him, by the care and paines of Maſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> his honourable entertainements in her dominions, and finally, all that hath beene alreadie declared. And to the ende, ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> that you may come the better acquainted with her, and heare her report her owne curteſies: if you pleaſe, wee will ſup together, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company, but only wee three, and my Coſen <hi>Mabila.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oriana</hi> did this, not only to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight Queene <hi>Briolania,</hi> but her ſelfe alſo: who neuer could be ſatisfied, with hearing thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fortunes repeated, almoſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe times in a day, whereupon ſhe called to <hi>Mabila,</hi> ſaying. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, Queene <hi>Briolania</hi> findes her ſelfe not halfe well, beeing wearied with long trauelling on the Sea: giue order therefore, to couer for ſupper here in my chamber, where wee will admit none elſe with vs, but Madame <hi>Grafinda. Mabila</hi> gaue preſent enſtructions hereof to the reſt, ſo that all left the lodging, but onely the foure Ladies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who (very ſoone after) ſate downe at the table, and as they were
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7181:343"/>
in the midſt of their ſeruice: <hi>Oriana</hi> (minding nothing more, than to heare <hi>Graſinda</hi> talke of <hi>Amadis)</hi> ſaid vnto her as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Madame, no longer agoe then yer-while, I reported to Queene <hi>Briolania,</hi> the battaile between <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and the Monſter <hi>Endriagus:</hi> but ſhee will not beleeue me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you giue her further aſſurance thereof. Therefore I humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you, that you would make diſcourſe thereof to her, according as Maſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> affirmed it to you, and likewiſe, how it was your fortune (at firſt) to meet him in the fields. Then <hi>Graſinda,</hi> to pleaſe them all, declared, how comming from <hi>Sadina</hi> (the principall Citie of her Land) accompanied with diuerſe Knights, eſpecially <hi>Brandaſidel</hi> eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Amadis</hi> ryding along the Sea ſhore, ſhewing a countenance of much griefe and ſadneſſe. For, ſo ſoone as hee beheld vs, hee turned out of he way, euen as hee would haue auoided the combate from his profeſſed enemy. Which <hi>Branda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidell</hi> obſeruing, and bearing mee then ſome inward affection: See (quoth hee) I pray you, the man-hood of theſe knights, that tearme themſelues Knights errant, ſo ſoon as he ſaw one, fearing the ſight hee was glad to turne bridle. By God, let me neuer more put Armour on my backe, if I bring him not back againe to you, with more haſte then hee makes away, and then I will make him to ſerue as your ſlaue.</p>
                  <p>Then, though I laboured to my very vttermoſt, to turne him from this friuolous intention: yet would hee needs ride on till he ouertooke him, and then he would haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him to come backe. But <hi>Amadis,</hi> neither caring for him, nor his greateſt threatnings, entred the ſight with him: wherein <hi>Brandaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> found ſuch harſh entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as at length hee was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his owne appointed penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which was this, that the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed ſhould ride backwarde mounted on his horſe, and holde the tayle inſteed of a bridle. It did not a little pleaſe mee, to ſee him come riding in ſuch hanſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; ſo confounded with ſhame, that it was worſe than death to him, as well appeared by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Then I demaunded of him, what hee had done with the Knight, whom hee ſware and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to bring to me. But he not anſwering me one word, I ſent one of my women to <hi>Amadis,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him (in curteſie) to come ſpeake with mee, which hee refuſed not to doe.</p>
                  <p>In our conference together, hee breathed foorth many a vehement ſigh, which cauſed me inſtantly to imagine, that the power of loue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-awed him, and affecting ſome Lady, by whom (perhaps) hee ſawe himſelfe ſo ſlenderly regarded; as hee was inforced to be abſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting her know his purpoſed trauailes, and I iudged withall, that hee was a man of more note, than outwardly hee ſeemed to be. Here-upon, I ſo earneſtly importuned him, as hee vouchſafed to accept a lodging in my Caſtle, and there hee ſoiourned ſome few daies: during which time, keeping him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and obſeruing his youth and faire diſpoſition, it ſeemed to mee, that ſhee might well repute her ſelfe moſt happy, that could enioy him as a friend or husband.</p>
                  <p>Now, although before his ariual, I found my ſelfe no way enclined to any ſuch humor, beeing neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe newly widdowed: yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection then preuailed ſo farre with me, as I was neuer more amorous
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7181:343"/>
of a man, then of him. So that, without taking any reſt, either day or night, my thoughts continually trauailed to him, vrging me ſo farre: that I muſt needs diſcouer my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe to <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who ſeemed an honeſt and diſcreet Squire, as after-ward I well perceiued by his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres. For, without telling me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Maſters affaires, hee gaue mee plainely to vnderſtand, that he had ſo little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand ouer himſelfe, as all hope (on my behalfe) might well bee ſpared. And I beleeuing him, reſolued with my ſelfe, that it were better to quench the ſparks but newely kindling, then ſuffer them breake forth into a flame.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I practiſed to finde the meanes (but not without paine enough) to ſet a ſtay vpon my raſh affection, and bring it againe to the former byas: and ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe hee was to depart for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> accordingly as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hee had determined. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had an aſpiring intention, to compaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

You haue tolde me that oftentimes, anſwered <hi>Oriana:</hi> who receiued all theſe reportes to her owne aduantage, as being well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that this melancholy humor of <hi>Amadis</hi> had no other ground, but only by his ardent affection to her. So, inſtantly they went all to reſt, becauſe it grew to be very late.</p>

Whereupon, <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,</hi> beeing to ſpeake for himſelfe and his companion; began at large to rehearſe his ſpeeches to the King, and the anſwer thereon made him. Which (quoth <hi>Quedragant)</hi> was ſo ſhort, as wee can conceiue no otherwiſe, but that he will deale with vs as hardly as hee can: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, his prouiding of men for all partes, making full account to ſhew vs no mercy. And we haue no

great cauſe to be agreeued thereat, becauſe our honour and chiualrie will thereby bee more renowned, more then at any other time we can attaine vnto: for if we beare away the victory, it will bee ſpoken of through the world, to our fame, &amp; his reproach.</p>
                  <p>Now, as oftentimes (in the like attempts) men declare themſelues to bee of diuerſe opinions: ſo here it fell out, for ſome allowed of war, and others were more leaning to peace. But <hi>Agraies,</hi> who bare but little loue to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> for thoſe reaſons before alleadged, vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to ſpeak for them all, beganne thus. Honourable Lords, I know not how (with any honeſty) we can giue ouer our intention of warre, conſidering what iuſt occaſion wee haue, and beſide, our enemy is in ſome forwardneſſe to come againſt vs. Notwithſtanding, it is no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in vs ſo to ſuffer him; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to muſter our forces ſpeedily, and march directly into his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, to let him wel vnderſtand what wee are. For, if wee permit him to come ſeeke vs heere, beleeue it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, it will ſo puffe him vp with pride: that hee (who of his owne nature is preſumptuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) will thinke he hath wonne the day at the very firſt landing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we ſhall runne into our owne diſ-reputation many waies, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing occaſion to the ill-iudging world, not only to mſconſter the iuſtice of our cauſe; but alſo, to throwe ſome ſiniſter opinions on Madame <hi>Orianaes</hi> iniuries, for which wee are thus entred into Armes.</p>
                  <p>For my ſelfe, I ſweare to you vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mine honour, had not her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and inceſſant entreaties to me, not to ſpeake againſt peace been ſo vehement: I had neuer conſented that any Embaſſie ſhould haue bin ſent to Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> beeing ſo much abuſed as wee are. But, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our enemy makes ſuch manifeſt ſhew of his mallice towards vs: I am now diſcharged of my promiſe, and abſolutely reſolued, neuer to enter league of loue or friendſhip with him; vntill hee haue felt, how well wee can ſtand vpon our owne defence, beeing enabled by as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like powers, as any hee can bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. Therefore my Lords, I am on the minde, that wee ſhould conclude on warre, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further deferring, ſo ſoon as our ſupplies are come: to ſet away di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for <hi>London,</hi> and there bid him battaile, if hee dare come forth to reſiſt vs.</p>
                  <p>This reſolution was wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſing to <hi>Amadis,</hi> who (til then) was in a continuall perplexity, as fearing, that warre would be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and hee enforced to render backe his <hi>Oriana,</hi> than which, no greater miſery could befall him. Wherefore, ſeeing the greater part ioyned with <hi>Agraies;</hi> to aduantage farther this opinion, thus he ſpake. Noble Coſen, as yet I neuer noted any man in this company but hee was alwaies as forward to theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, as any one could be. If any man haue queſtioned thoſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencies, which commonly doe happen in warre: hee is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be taxed, as one that would exempt himſelf from the buſineſſe, but vſeth rather ſuch prouident ſpeeches, as in theſe caſes are fit and iuſt. And whereas you think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that wee ſhould enter into King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> countrie, rather then giue him the leaſt leaſure to ſeek vs here: that deliberation hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies dwelt on my thoughts, if the reſt of you my Lords and worthy friends, will haue it ſo. For by theſe

meanes (perceiuing vs to come ſo neare him) hee may ſuddenly alter his former opinion, and yeeld to that which wee haue requeſted. There was not a man in the whole aſſembly, but freely gaue his voice to this concluſion: And warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully agreed on, men were ſent forth, and ſcouts appointed to all places, as well to heare newes from Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> as alſo for muſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men together.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that Maſter <hi>Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi> was embarqued, he had ſo good a gale of wind, as (in few daies) he landed in <hi>Romania:</hi> where ſending for the chiefeſt lords of the countrie, hee gaue them to vnderſtand his charge, expreſſely commanding them to make ready a ſufficient number of horſe and foot, for paſſing thence to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Iſle,</hi> ſo ſoone as he ſhould be returned from the Emperour, to whom hee was going for the ſame cauſe. Which they promiſed effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to performe, and hee leaft a Nephew of his named <hi>Libeo,</hi> a young Knight and of good ſpirit, ſtill to ſolicet them in the buſineſſe: and hee ſet ſayle for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where hee ariued without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment. Being landed, he went to the Emperour, whom he found accompanied with many Princes &amp; great Lords, and doing him hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reuerence, hee preſented him a Letter from <hi>Amadis de Gaule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperour, who had known him a long time, welcomde him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry graciouſly, &amp; demanded of him, where hee had mette with <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> of whom hee had heard ſo many great ſpeeches? Sir anſwered Maſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> I deale plainly with you, I neuer knew his name to be <hi>Amadis,</hi> vntill we were ariued in the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> and then he declared it himſelfe vnto vs. For, before that time, hee called himſelfe the Greek Knight, as fearing to be knowne by his other borowed name of the greene Sword, after his departure from you. And that was in regarde of his promiſe to my Lady <hi>Graſinda,</hi> for conducting her to the Court of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> &amp; there to maintaine againſt all commers, that ſhe was a fairer woman, than the choiceſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in all that countrie.</p>
                  <p>Then hee related (at large) how all things had paſt, eſpecially, his Combate (about that cauſe) againſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who meerely in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption vndertooke the fight, but ſpedde according to their deſerts. And indeede Sir (quoth hee) they thought that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tended againſt a Greeke Knight, ſo that, before they entered the Combate, they made little account of him, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it publikely, that neuer Greek durſt be ſo bolde as to deale with a <hi>Roman,</hi> man to man, but eaſily ſhould vanquiſh him, as they had done many other before. But the ſucceſſe fell out contrary to their expectation: for they were foyled one after another, and (indeede) with no more then reſiſtance of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe. Beleeue me ſaide the

Emperour, I reioyce in all his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie fortunes, and credit it aſſuredly, that if I had meanes, whereby to doe him any pleaſure, hee ſhould well knowe that I am his friend to my vttermoſt power. Sir, anſwered Maſter <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> your gracious offer can neuer ſhewe it ſelfe in a more needfull ſeaſon, and now hee doth moſt humbly require it. Say you ſo? ſaid the Emperour, let me know how?</p>
                  <p>Then Maſter <hi>Eliſabet</hi> proceeded thus. Sir after hee had abated the <hi>Ramanes</hi> daring pride, he withdrew himſelfe to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> which is his owne by iuſt title: and there he found a great number of Knights ready bound for the Sea, in ſuccour of Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> eldeſt daughter to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> whom (againſt her will) he would haue married to the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> and quite diſ-inherited her, to aduance his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt daughter <hi>Leonara,</hi> contrary to all aduice and opinion, not only of the Princes and Lords of his land, but alſo of his ſubiects in generall. Whereof Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> beeing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, hee highly commended their enterpriſe, ſo that on the day enſuing, they put forth to Sea, and hulled about the ſtraites, for them that had the Princeſſe in charge. Manfully were they aſſayled, &amp; (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and fierce conflict) van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, taken priſoners, and the Ladies thus reſcued, conuayed to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> where now they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide at this preſent.</p>
                  <p>Neuertheleſſe, they ſent Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> as well to let him vnderſtand, vpon what occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had thus reſcued his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: as alſo to entreate her home acceptation againe, without ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her any more ſo farre from him, conſidering the great wrong hee did therein to him ſelfe. But, as they doubted, ſo it came to paſſe, for without any regard to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt offer: hee ſtood mainely on his owne ſtrength, and would haue that by force, which they tendered him freely. For this cauſe Sir, my Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> and all his worthy band of Knights with him, do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreate you, holding the prime place among Chriſtian Princes, &amp; being Gods deputie and miniſter, to maintaine right and iuſtice (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when ſuch a vertuous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe is ſo highly wronged) that you would be pleaſed, to ſend them ſome ſuccour; wherein you ſhall binde them all to you while they liue, or can bee imployed any way in your ſeruice, with their vttermoſt paines.</p>
                  <p>All this while, the Emperor len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an attentiue care to Maſter <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſabets</hi> wordes, ſate very penſiue: as conſidering, that hardly would this enterpriſe be ended, without a long and doubtfull warre. For hee well knew, that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was a Prince of vndauntable ſpirit, and the Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> was a man immeaſurably proude, &amp; too much opinionate of his owne fortune. On the other ſide, knowing what iuſt occaſion the Knights of the <hi>Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iſle</hi> had, to reſcue <hi>Oriana</hi> in ſo deep diſtreſſe, and how highly him ſelfe ſtood obliged to <hi>Amadis,</hi> not onely for the monſter <hi>Endriagus</hi> death, but alſo for taking ſuch pains as to come ſee him in <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and what bountifull offers hee had made him beſide; he reſolued to ſend him ſuccour with all ſpeed, ſpeaking thus to Maſter <hi>Eliſabet.</hi> My worthy good friend, Lord <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> ſhall haue of mee his owne deſire, and ſuch an Army will I ſend him, as both <hi>Patin</hi> and King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſhall well know, how dearly I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and eſteeme him.</p>

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:7181:345"/>
Theſe royall words were ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to all the Knights there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, eſpecially to <hi>Gaſtilles:</hi> as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently hee fell vpon his knees, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <p>Then <hi>Gandalin</hi> (without omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing) reuealed the whole buſineſſe, as you haue heard before diſcourſed.

So, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing each other very affectionately, they parted, but not without wette eyes. <hi>Norandels</hi> Ship lying ready for him, and hauing taken leaue of King <hi>Perion</hi> and his Queene: the windes and Seas were ſo fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, as in few dayes he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the port of <hi>Vindiliſore,</hi> where King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was preparing his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, for the <hi>Encloſed Iſle.</hi> No ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had <hi>Norandell</hi> ſet ſaile, but King <hi>Perion</hi> muſtered men from all parts, and made ſhipping likewiſe ready, for their paſſage to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> ſo ſpeedily as might be.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while, <hi>Laſinde,</hi> the Squire to <hi>Bruneo,</hi> beeing come to the Marqueſſe, diligently executed his commiſſion, and by pleaſing perſwaſions, compaſſed his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo with <hi>Branfill:</hi> who ſeeing his father ſomewhat ſlowe and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the buſineſſe caſt himſelfe at his feet, ſaying.

                  <p>Here you muſt likewiſe obſerue, that the good olde Gouernour <hi>Yſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> who was ſent to King <hi>Taffinor</hi> of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I promiſe you Sir vpon my faith, I will not fayle him in ſo ſerious a buſineſſe, but he ſhall haue all that hee can require. Then he called his ſonne <hi>Graſandor,</hi> to whom hee declared all that <hi>Yſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> had tolde him, and the cauſe of his comming, demanding of him, if hee would vndertake the voyage for the aide of <hi>Amadis,</hi> who had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him ſelfe Knight of the greene Sword.</p>
                  <p>My Lord (quoth he) the greateſt deſire I haue in this world, is, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the company of ſo good a Knight, and I deſire it of you moſt entirely.

For the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide,</hi> and <hi>Brandaiell de Reque</hi> had written to him, that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her to them, and that they were continually vpon their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting towards him.

Sir, quoth hee, King <hi>Liſuart</hi> (my Maſter) hath ſent this Letter to you; command that it may be read to you, and then you ſhall be further ſatisfied in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. then the Emperour tooke the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and although it contained ſome particular priuate credence: yet he would needes haue it publiquely read, and that hee (in like manner) ſhould deliuer what hee had to ſay. Sir, ſaid <hi>Guillan,</hi> my Maſter King <hi>Liſuart</hi> greets you thus, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of your perpetuall loue and alliance, hee was well content (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7181:347"/>
to the requeſt made to him by your Ambaſſadours) to giue you as wife, Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> his eldeſt daughter &amp; principall heare. And thereupon, after many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties debated among the Princes, Lords and Subiects of his Realme: hee deliuered her to their hands, who had power to receiue her on your behalfe. but it came to paſſe, that Lord <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> and diuerſe others his complices, well prouided with ſhipping: lay as ſcouts in the way, aſſayled them in their paſſage, and after a long fight the Prince <hi>Saluſte Quide</hi> was ſlame, and moſt of the reſt of your people, led as priſoners to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> where (as yet) they detaine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame <hi>Oriana,</hi> the Queen <hi>Sardamira,</hi> and ſame others that were in their company. Notwithſtanding, after-ward, to make amends for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed, they ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to his Maieſty, offring him diuerſe good conditions: which he would not accept before he vnderſtood your minde, becauſe the iniury concerneth you as much or rather more than him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commanded me to tell you, that if you meane to reuenge this wrong, hee will bring a good and ſufficient Army into the field: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that you (for your part) will doe the like. And ſo your powers being ioyned together, he and you ſhall eaſily drawe them to ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as ſhall bee beſt liking to your ſelues.</p>
                  <p>When the Emperour had heard this, neuer was man in greater chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and very apparantly he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it: for, like one improuident, and vnfurniſhed of all foreſight, he began to ſweare, and (euen) enter into a meere lunacy, ſaying to <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> You know what is done, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to your Maſter, and tell him: I ſhall neuer enioy any reſt, vntill I be ioyned with him, and with ſuch a power, as thoſe Rake-hells of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle</hi> ſhall well know, how highly they haue offended me. Sir, anſwered <hi>Guillan</hi> you cannot come ſo ſoone as you ſhall finde the King my Maſter and his Army readie. Haſte home then (anſwered the Emperour) and make no longer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying here.</p>
                  <p>Thus was <hi>Guillan</hi> conſtrained to get him gone, without (almoſt) the leaſure of receiuing any ſuſtenance: whereat hee was not a little offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, eſpecially for his ſlender en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement, and he made no long tarrying from Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> to make his complaint thereof to King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> Beeing embarqued on the Sea, he ſayled directly to <hi>Vindiliſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> where hee landed not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, finding the King there, expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his ariuall, to whom hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all that the Emperour had ſaid, and what ſmall diſcretion hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed, before ſo many Princes &amp; Lords. And beleeue it Sir (quoth he) vndoubtedly, that if they which come in his company, haue as ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der braines as hee: neuer were ſeene men more vnmeet for warre, nor worſe gouerned then they will bee.</p>
                  <p>If they will be aduiſed by mee, ſaid the King, I hope wee ſhall not be beaten for want of good gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: for they beeing mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, we ſhall both help them, and they vs. It ſhall ſuffice me, that they be ſpeedy in their comming; becauſe I haue this day receiued ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement, that the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Gaule, Scotland, Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> doe enter Armes for the ayde of <hi>Amadis.</hi> I heare alſo, that King <hi>Aranigne,</hi> with <hi>Archalaus</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinan,</hi> do muſter men from all parts:

but what their intent is I know not, and therefore I holde it conuent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that wee ſhould firſt bid our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy battaile, before hee win time to come vpon vs. Which wee may eaſily doe, if they proceede not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romanes:</hi> for <hi>Brandoynas</hi> is newly ariued from <hi>Ireland</hi> who aſſureth me, that hee left King <hi>Cil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadan</hi> muſtring his forces, and in forwardneſſe to ioyne with vs. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipinell</hi> likewiſe, is comming home from <hi>Suetia,</hi> and hath certified mee by his Letters, that King <hi>Gaſquilan</hi> will not faile to bee here within fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes, with ſuch a band of worthy Knights, as are ſoundly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in reſolution.</p>
                  <p>As for the reſt, leauied heere at home in mine owne countries, you may ſee (all-ready) more than fiue thouſand, trouping together in the next meddowe: ſo that before a moneth be expired, we ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ready for marching hence. But what of <hi>Galuanes?</hi> ſaid <hi>Guillan,</hi> is he for you, or no? No, anſwered the King, hee hath entreated mee by <hi>Brandonynas,</hi> that hee may (at this time) ſtand exempted: Deſiring rather, to redeliuer vp the Iſle of <hi>Mongoza</hi> into my hands, then to go againſt <hi>Amadis</hi> and his Nephew. And knowing that in other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hee may doe mee good ſeruice, I am content to holde him excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

And as they laboured for winning of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, the men appeared like Ants, very properly ſtealing abroad forth of their earth, where all ſummer they made their prouiſion for win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the meane while, the Ladies were (on all ſides) at their gazing windowes, beholding this militarie controuerſie; which ſerued as a pleaſing paſſe-time to them, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the intelligence <hi>Amadis</hi> had giuen them thereof the day before.</p>
                  <p>As thus they were pell mell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Mabila</hi> with a very gracious reſpect, came to <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſpeaking thus. By my faith Madame, there are many great Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, who haue not ſuch plenty of men at command, as you haue: I referre my ſelfe to this inſtant ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle before your eyes. What ſay you yourſelfe? Is it not true? How happy then were you, in making due conſideration hereof, and how much you can command in him, to whom this whole Army affordeth obedience? I am perſwaded that if King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and the Emperour (which neuer ſhal be your husband) did but beholde what you now doe: they would conſider twice on their enterpriſe, before they ventured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further forth of their countries. Wherefore it is no more then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that hence-forward you ſhould refraine your ſighes &amp; tears, and ſhew a much more cheerefull diſpoſition, then hitherto you haue done.</p>
                  <p>Deare Coſen, anſwered <hi>Orania,</hi> it is impoſſible for mee to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly humoured, when I conſider mine owne inſtant miſerie. For well you know, that if the King my fathers power, and this belonging to your kinſman, doe but once ioyne or meete together: it will prooue to the ruine of the one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or (perhaps) of both together. Which were an vnrecouerable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to me, as well for the dutie which nature commandeth in mee to my father, as alſo the affection I beare to <hi>Amadis.</hi> How then can I any way haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment? would God I were deade, rather than I ſhould liue to ſee ſuch mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences. With theſe words, the teares ſtreamed aboundantly from her faire eyes. Why how now Madame? ſaide <hi>Mabila,</hi> doe you thinke that our Lord hath forgotten you? I dare promiſe you, hee will no more leaue you now, then hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hee hath done, if you repoſe your truſt in him. For your inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is generally knowne, and that (againſt your will) this great a doe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7181:349"/>
hath beene begun: therefore, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer grieue your ſelfe ſo much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may fall out the worſe for you, and be offenſiue likewiſe to my noble Coſen, and all the other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Knights, who deſire nothing more than to doe you ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>All this while, King <hi>Perion</hi> (ſince his ariuall) had not ſeene the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Oriana;</hi> wherefore, after this pleaſant battaile was ended, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Agraies,</hi> if hee could compaſſe the meanes to ſpeak with her, becauſe hee would gladly doe her reuerence. <hi>Agraies</hi> made him anſwere, that hee would worke the way for him: and preſently went to the Princeſſe, acquainting her with King <hi>Perions</hi> deſire. Hee ſhall be moſt graciouſly welcome (quoth ſhe) whenſoeuer it pleaſeth him to come. But deare Coſen, what is your opinion of my misfortunes. Am not I the moſt vnhappy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the world, to ſee ſo many great Princes and good Knights troubled, and all about my buſineſs? Madame, ſaid hee, we are all yours, and there is not a man among vs, that will not gladly (&amp; with a good heart) be employed in your ſeruice, and all account their paines ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently rewarded, if you but vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to accept it. Alas Sir, anſwered ſhe, I know not how I ſhal any way be thankfull to you all, for this great grace: but I will entreate our Lord to requite it. Madame, replied <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> if you diſlike not what wee doe, &amp; would be a little more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully humorous then hitherto you haue been; you ſhould binde vs all in much more dutie to you.

                  <p>So <hi>Agraies</hi> tooke leaue of her, and went to ſeeke the King of <hi>Gaule</hi> and <hi>Graſſandor,</hi> to whom hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; that <hi>Oriana</hi> attended their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and that they ſhould be moſt kindly welcome. Wherefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further delaying, they went vnto her, accompanied with <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, Floreſtan,</hi> and diuerſe others. Entring into the Princeſſe cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhee attended on by the other Ladies and Gontlewomen, went to entertaine them: And then King <hi>Perion,</hi> who had not ſeene or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to her, ſince ſhee aboad with the Queene of <hi>Scots,</hi> demanded of her, whether ſhee knew him, or no. My Lord (quoth ſhe) although I neuer ſaw you more then once, yet I do well remember the requeſt you granted mee, when you made your ſonne <hi>Amadis</hi> Knight. It is true, anſwered the King, and ſeeing you were the cauſe of the firſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that euer he receiued: I hold it reaſonable that hee ſhould bee thankfull therefore to you, ſo long as he enioyeth life.</p>
                  <p>While thus they talked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Graſſandor</hi> conferred with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bila,</hi> whom hee found ſo diſcreetly wiſe, and endued with ſuch ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar graces: as (thence forward) he grew enamoured of her, ſo that he married her, as you ſhall read here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. In the meane ſpace, Queen <hi>Briolania</hi> diſcourſing with <hi>Quedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,</hi> ſhee ſaid vnto him. Sir, but for our former intelligence of your mornings battaile, neuer had wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men beene in the like terrour and amazement. How Madame? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Quedragant,</hi> was it more dreadfull, then the late attempt of your Coſen <hi>Tiron?</hi> No by my faith, ſaid ſhee, for then I expected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but death, and but for you, I had been in the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7181:350"/>
that euer could happen to any Lady or Gentlewoman: but thanks be to God, and your good ſuccor. I now haue time to be fully reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Madame, ſaide <hi>Brian,</hi> your beauty and vertue doe plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer, that you haue no power to take any ſuch reuenge as you ſpeak of: but rather ſpeakes pardon in the faireſt language, and preſumes of more loyalty in him hereafter, then precedent times haue warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him. Truely Sir (quoth ſhe) I could well like of ſo good an inclination in him, and if you think it meet, wee will ſend for him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, to vnderſtand how his minde is affected: aſſuring you, that it would be no little ioy to me, if I could kindly reconcile him; in regarde he is young, my very neare kinſman, and of better ſpirit (as I thinke) then euer was in his father, or other brethren. Madame, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Brian,</hi> you could neuer ſpeake more vertuouſly, then now you do: I pray you ſend for him, to the end (if hee ſtand ſo addicted) hee may promiſe fidelity to you, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſo many good Knights as now are here. It liketh me well, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, for hee is priſoner to you two, and none of mine, and therefore diſpoſe of him as you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>Inſtantly was <hi>Tiron</hi> ſent for, who being come before ſo great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, expected no other arreſt then death: and therefore was not a little amazed, when hee heard <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olania</hi> thus ſpeake to him. <hi>Tiron</hi> theſe two Gentlemen (whom you know well enough) haue entreated mee to ſhew you mercy, and I am well enclined thereto, neuer min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the treaſon of your deceaſed father againſt me: prouided, that you deliberate, and promiſe mee, hence-forward to follow vertue as zealouſly, as your life hither to hath beene lewde and wicked. Alſo to make amends for the wrong you haue done mee, and endeauour to become a loyall &amp; faithfull ſeruant: and doing ſo, I will not vſe you as a priſoner, but as my Coſen and nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt kinſman. Therefore tell mee preſently (without any diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) how you ſtand reſolued: for, being iſſued from the royall blood of a King, you ſhould highly ſhame your ſelfe, to deliuer now ſuch wordes, as hereafter ſhould not be effectually performed.</p>
                  <p>Alas Madame, quoth hee, if you pleaſe to take pitty on me, while I liue I will neuer more offend you: and therfore I moſt humbly entreat you, euen (for Gods ſake) to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue mee. As for my fathers tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, I cannot yeeld you any reaſon for them: conſidering I was then ſo young, as all remembrance of him is quite bereft me. But for mine owne particular, I proteſt and promis to you Madam that I wil be iuſt &amp; faithfull to you, if you pleaſe to forget my former errour towards you, which rather was the guilt of my youth, then any other willing ſinne. If you doe as you ſay, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, it will proue the better for you. What I promiſe Madame, replied <hi>Tiron,</hi> I ſolemnely ſweare vnto. Nor did he euer faile therein, and therfore it fell out to both their great honours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Briolania</hi> extending ſuch mercy to her enemy, and hee no leſſe man-hood to her, may ſerue for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to many; in beeing leſſe prompt and forwarde to reuenge, then their cruell nature doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them. And now returning to our former purpoſe, <hi>Tiron</hi> beeing thus reconciled to the Queene, and and ſhee deſirous to declare, what truſt ſhe would repoſe in him, vpon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7181:350"/>
this new agreement, ſaid vnto him. Coſen it is my minde, that you take charge and conduct of thoſe forces which <hi>Tantiles</hi> hath cauſed to come hither from my countries: you ſhal be their chiefe commander, and they as obedient to you, as to my ſelfe. <hi>Tiron</hi> refuſed not this hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Hereupon, the two Camps grew iealous of one another, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to whether ſide they inclined: for King <hi>Liſuart</hi> imagined they came in ayde of <hi>Amadis,</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> preſumed the like for King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> and this was their onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of their falling to fight, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as you ſhall heare hereafter.

fame and renowne. And being no way able to meet with you, he was enforced (being then wounded) to returne home againe, fruſtrated of his expectation. And hee had not now left his owne lande againe, but that hee was aduertiſed by King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> of your vndertaking this hardy enterpriſe. And continuing ſtill in his former deliberation, hee entreates you (in meere curteſie) that to morrowe you would breake three Lances with him: for if you delay it till the day of battaile, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall you approue your ſelues each againſt other, according to his honourable deſire.</p>

She lent ſuch liking to this perſwaſion, that at one time (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many other) <hi>Gaſquilan</hi> vſing his wonted opportunities, with goodly diſcourſe &amp; proteſtations, as louers in like afflictions can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily performe: ſhe as a Lady diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and quicke of apprehenſion, anſwered him in this manner.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, ſeeing Heauen hath endowed mee with ſuch riches as I now enioy; no dread of danger, or of death it ſelfe, can make mee falſifie the promiſe I made to my deceaſed father: which was, neuer to marrie, but vpon one eſpeciall condition. What was that? ſayde <hi>Gaſquilan.</hi> I ſolemnely ſwore (quoth ſhe) to him before hee died, neuer to ioyne in marriage, but with the beſt Knight in the world, if it lay in my power to winne him; and although he were neuer ſo poore, yet I would haue no other huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Hereupon I made diligent inquiſition, who might be this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man of men, and haue receiued credible intelligence, that <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> cannot be ſeconded: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you dare make hazard of your manhoode, and vanquiſh him, you ſhall enioy your earneſt deſire. This only occaſion incited <hi>Gaſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> to vndertake thoſe two voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which hee made into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> preſuming ſo much vpon his valour, that hee ſhould haue the vpper hand of <hi>Amadis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Trompet</hi> beeing come backe to <hi>Gaſquilan,</hi> declared vnto him the whole anſwer of his meſſage: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Gaſquilan</hi> was ſo ioyfull, that he deliuered theſe wordes ſo lowde, as all by might eaſily heare him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, <hi>Trompet,</hi> I would not now wiſh to be maſter of the faireſt Citie in <hi>Gaule,</hi> in exchange of this long looked for happineſſe: for I hope to make it apparantly known, that I am a little more worthie then hee. So, imagining the time too ouer-long, the next morning, by breake of day, hee put on a gray Armour, couered with golden Griffons, holding a bleeding hart in their tallons, as teſtimony of the torments he endured in loue. Then comming before the Emperor and King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> hee earneſtly entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to come ſee how he could abate the glory of <hi>Amadis.</hi> And if (quoth hee) I vn-horſe him not at the firſt encounter, I am content to beare no Armes for a whole year together. But the Emperour who had ſufficient experience of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> was of another minde, and therfore ordered the greater part of his power in forme of battaile, as well for his owne ſecurity: as doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome ſudden ſurpriſall, vnder the colour of this particuler Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; and the like did <hi>Agraies</hi> on the other ſide.</p>
                  <p>The two auantguards being thus each before other, <hi>Amadis</hi> hauing put on a green Armour, thickely powdred with Lions of gold (euen ſuch another as he wore when hee came to his <hi>Oriana</hi> at <hi>Mirefleure,</hi> at his returne from the poore Rocke, when hee ſlew the two Giants, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongomad</hi> and <hi>Baſigant</hi> his ſonne) called for <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and ſaide vnto him. <hi>Gandalin,</hi> ſeeing thou wilt not haue thy knighthood from a Kings hand: goe Arme thy ſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I enter into this Combate, I will perform what I haue promiſed thee. So <hi>Gandalin</hi> departed, and ſoon after returned againe to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> who attended there for him,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7181:355"/>
and taking him by the hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to King <hi>Perion,</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus. Sir, heere is <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who deſires to haue his order of knighthood. wherefore moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I deſire you, in regarde hee will needs receiue it of me; you would be pleaſed to gird on his ſword, that hee may remember (ſo long as hee liues) the honour you gaue him. With theſe wordes, hee preſented him one of thoſe Swordes, which Queen <hi>Menoreſſa</hi> had giuen him at <hi>Conſtintinople,</hi> and had remained in the cuſtody of <hi>Durin,</hi> brother to the Damoſell of <hi>Denmarke.</hi> Then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him the accolade, and putting on his right ſpurre: the King next came, and girded on his Sword, &amp; ſo he receiued this high honour, by the hands of the two beſt Knights in the world.

                  </p>
                  <p>This being thus done, <hi>Amadis</hi> went forth of his troupes, becauſe <hi>Gaſquilan</hi> was attending for him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the plaine, and each of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a mighty ſtrong launce placed in his reſt: gaue the ſpurre to their horſes, and met together with ſuch violence, that their ſtaues flew in ſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Hereupon, the Emperour miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting that hee would haue ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off his head; cauſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

Then it fell to them that could doe beſt on both ſides, for the vaun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>guards marched againſt each other, &amp; the great Ordenance played without any intermiſſion. In the meane ſpace, <hi>Amadis</hi> haſtened on the maine battaile, and the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarde, and cauſed <hi>Bruneo,</hi> to iſſue forth with three hundred horſe, to charge a troupe of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> who defended ſix great Culuerins, which King <hi>Liſuart</hi> had placed neer at hand, and did much harme to the foot-men. But hee carried himſelfe with ſuch vndaunted courage, that hauing put the enemy in route, he became Maſter of that Artillery.</p>
                  <p>By this time the two Armies had paced very neere, and beeing vpon the point of ſight, Drummes and Trumpets ſounded cheerfully, and the foot-men performing their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ſeruice, marched on with their Pikes croſſed, to reſiſt the horſe-mens entrance: while the Harquebuziers and Archers made two ſharpe charges, wherein <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant</hi> was wounded in the left arme. But comming all to ioyne, the noyſe exceeded admiration, to heare the breaking of Launces, Pikes and Halbardes, ſounding like a great tempeſt of haile, falling on a houſe couered with tile or ſmooth ſlate. There might you haue ſeene many braue men ouerthrowen on the ground, ſome deadly wounded, others wallowing in their blood, diſmembred of legges and armes: the fight continued long in this

dreadfull manner, before it could any way be diſcerned, whether ſide had the better or worſe: for <hi>Floran</hi> ruſhing in vpon the <hi>Gaules,</hi> made ſuch a ſlaughter among them, as he let not a ſtroake fall, but valued a life.</p>
                  <p>While this bloody fury endured, <hi>Amadis</hi> and his troupes, charged the Emperours vauntguard, and when it came to the Launces brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, <hi>Gandalin,</hi> who was one of the formoſt, met the brother to <hi>Arqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill,</hi> and brake their Launces each on other, but the <hi>Romane</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted. Now they entred pell mell, and they that had ſeen <hi>Agraies</hi> follow his buſineſſe, would haue thought him to bee one of the beſt Knights in the worlde: for, before hee loſt his Launce, hee vnhorſed foure of the Emperors beſt knights. And here was the fierce heat of the conflict, becauſe the Emperours Harquebuziers, who were conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Arquiſill</hi> thwarted the horſe-men of <hi>Amadis:</hi> and but for <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>Tiron,</hi> who came and acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted them with their light horſe, they had done them much more harme than they did. But they brake ſo violently vppon them, as they could no way charge them, but fell into diſorder; albeeit <hi>Arquiſill</hi> fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d meanes to rallie them againe in good manner.</p>

                  <p>Hereupon, the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who were halfe ſpent and tired, tooke heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and then began the <hi>Romanes</hi> to diſmay, falling into diſorder, and flying directly toward King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who followed the maine battalion: and but for <hi>Floyan,</hi> and ſome other of the nobler ſpirits, who maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the aſſault (holding out coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly euery way, while the foot-men returned againe to battaile) not a man had eſcaped aliue.

                  <p>Now began the Drummes and Trumpets to ſound chearefully on each ſide, and the noyſe was ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, as if they had heard the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens thunder: for ſome cryed <hi>Gaul, Gaule,</hi> others <hi>Spaine, Scotland, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Bohemia,</hi> and ſo euery man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling his owne countrie, as the vſually doe in ſuch warlike actions.

                  <p>During this conflict, <hi>Brian,</hi> who was followed by his <hi>Spaniards,</hi> met with <hi>Arban,</hi> King of <hi>Norwales,</hi> and they charged one another ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, as they little failed from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnhorſed. Then came King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> with <hi>Grumedan,</hi> who carried his Enſigne, and other Knights of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> ſeconded them, who brought <hi>Brian</hi> into ſuch a ſtraite: as if hee had not ſpeedily been ſupplied by <hi>Agraies</hi> &amp; <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> hee had been taken, but their ſuccour came ſo conueniently, as their enemies were glad to recoile. Neuertheleſſe K. <hi>Liſuart</hi> had ouer-thrown <hi>Dragonis,</hi> &amp; wold haue ſlain him: but that <hi>Agraies</hi> ſteping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cried out aloud. Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable King, turne thy face to me, for thou ſhalt die by the hand of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> who hates thee more, then any man liuing. Thus ſpeaking, he gaue him ſuch a powerfull ſtroke on the helmet, as made fire to ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle in his eyes, and leauing his ſword hanging at a chaine faſtened about his arme; caught him faſt by the middle, and ſo ſtrictly, as hee had almoſt borne him downe to the ground. But King <hi>Liſuart</hi> likewiſe got as faſt holde on him, and each ſtroue manfully againſt the other, who ſhould haue the beſt aduantage of his enemy, by cleane ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>As thus they contended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, King <hi>Perion</hi> chanced to ſpy them, and beeing followed by <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din, Floreſtan,</hi> and a great troupe of his people: drew neare to helpe <hi>Agraies,</hi> and to take King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> if hee could. Purſuing his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, hee met with <hi>Giontes, Grume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and a great many more, who charged him very fiercely. And here you may be well aſſured, that there was not only ſharpe aſſailing, but likewiſe as manfull defending: ſome beeing grieuouſly wounded, others ſlaine outright, and many troden to death among the horſes feet. For King <hi>Cildadan</hi> came freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in vpon them, with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his <hi>Iriſhmen,</hi> and <hi>Gaſtiles</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſo well accompanied, as heere now was the maine violence of the battaile, becauſe both the horſe and foot were mingled together. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> ſide fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d themſelues ſorely oppreſſed, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that <hi>Amadis, Laſinde, Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, Balays, Landin,</hi> and diuerſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their followers, charged them
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7181:357"/>
in the rere, and had driuen them to flight; but for <hi>Floyan,</hi> who ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred vppe the re-enforce of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> by him freſhly rallied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, this hotte reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance laſted not long, for <hi>Amadis</hi> meeting with <hi>Floyan,</hi> ſlew him in the Emperours preſence: who hoping to reuenge his death, ranne in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Amadis,</hi> who knowing him well enough, &amp; redoubling his ſtrength, only in the hatefull ſpleene he bore him, as the Emperour lifted vp his arme, with intent to ſmite him on the head: <hi>Amadis</hi> aymed at him ſo directly, that hitting iuſt in the ſhoulder ioynt, hee parted it quite from his body, and the griefe therof was ſo violent to him, that inſtantly hee fell downe dead to the ground. By meanes whereof, the <hi>Romanes</hi> growing into great terrour and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may, began to turne their backes, flying away ſo confuſedly, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Arban,</hi> or any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, had power to ſtay them, what-ſoeuer good wordes they ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                  <p>Now did King <hi>Liſuart</hi> apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue, that Fortune ſtood not fauourable for him and his that day, and the loſſe of the battaile could not bee auoided: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, deſiring rather to die with his ſword in his fiſt, than to ſaue life by a ſhamefull flight, hee would needes enter in among the preaſe, but King <hi>Arban</hi> ſtaying him, ſpake thus. Alas Sir, loſe not your life deſperately, and with your owne conſent: Will you fight alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a whole Armie? doe you not ſee the <hi>Romanes</hi> in a confuſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and the moſt parte of our owne men diſcomfited? Oh let it pleaſe you to retire, and ſaue the reſt, with whom wee may (at ſome other time) better deale with the enemy, then now we can doe. Wel knew King <hi>Liſuart</hi> that he ſpake no otherwiſe then true, wherefore, while his people retired, he &amp; ſuch as hee could beſt aſſure: remained ſtill vpon the rere, defending them-ſelues againſt all purſute.</p>
                  <p>Slender warrant of ſafety had this beene to him, or them, but for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> who foreſeeing what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content it would bee to <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> if the King her father ſhould be vnterly foyled: ſaid to King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion.</hi> My Lord, our enemies flie, I pray you (without arther hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our owne fortune) let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelues with the honour wee haue already this day receiued: for if wee purſue on after him, darke night will ouertake vs, and it may bee, like deſperate men in reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their great loſſe, wee may fall into no meane danger. Leaue them then to their owne ſhame, and let vs retreat our owne men, that are ouer ſpent and wearie. Be it ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered King <hi>Perion.</hi> How? ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grates,</hi> now that victory ſweetely preſents herſelfe vnto vs, ſhall wee willfully refuſe her? By God, deare Coſen, you are well worthie to be no better accounted of, then as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Knight errant. Would you (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Amadis)</hi> haue your men mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one another, for lack of others to fight withall? Is not the Sunne ſet, and night ſo neare, as if wee ſhould holde on any further in fight, wee ſhall not knowe our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies from our friends: I pray you Sir, let vs reſt thus ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Well knew <hi>Agraies,</hi> to what end <hi>Amadis</hi> made this excuſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without vrging any further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, in great choller hee turned bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and gallopt on the other ſide, becauſe <hi>Amadis</hi> had cauſed retreate to be ſounded.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7181:358"/>
in the ſame place where they had fought, as a ſignall of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, hoping the next day to finiſh finally what they had begunne.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He truce confirmed, as formerly hath been ſaid, King <hi>Liſuart</hi> gaue commande, that the Emperors body ſhold be brought, with the greateſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence that could be deuiſed, and ſo to be placed in his owne Tent. Now becauſe hee ſtood in ſome feare, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> would fight no more, becauſe their chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander was dead: hee reſolued to ſpeake vnto them, as well to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, as to vnderſtand how they were affected. Hereupon, the day following, hee ſent to entreat <hi>Arquiſill,</hi> that hee would conduct them in order of battaile, for their better apprehending what hee had to ſay vnto them. Whereunto <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſill</hi> gladly condiſcended, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aſſembled them in a goodly meadow, King <hi>Liſuart</hi> came vnto them, and placing himſelfe in the middle ſquadron, ſpake as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>Honorable and worthie friends, you haue ſeene and experimented in theſe two encounters, how For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath ſhowen herſelfe our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie enemy: ſo that in beſtowing her frownes on vs, ſhee triumphes in the death of my kinde brother, and your royall Maſter, beſides many other valiant Knights, who by effects (in ſeeking reuenge on his enemies) were willing to finde what they ſought for, becauſe it was the very faireſt experience they could make of their vertue, for gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the glory they haue aſpired vnto. And for their better attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereto, the hazard of their liues ſeemed as a matter of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto them: but that it was much more honourable, to die in defending themſelues valiantly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eſcape by a ſhamefull recoile. So that, to auoide falling into ſuch a high diſhonour, they rather gladly deſired, by expreſſing the very greateſt magnanimity of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to endure Fortune, then yeeld to feare. Nor doe I hereby vrge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny taxation againſt them that haue eſcaped with life, knowing well, how worthily they haue all carried themſelues: but rather to entreate them, that in preferring honour, before ſorrow, for the loſſe of your friends &amp; companions; you would eſſay (the truce being ended) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge their misfortune, fighting couragiouſly againſt them, who ſwell in heart too proudly of their victory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:7181:358"/>
I am verily perſwaded, that wee ought no leſſe expoſe our ſelues to hazards and dangers, then if wee had preuailed againſt them, as they haue done againſt vs; nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare any abatement of courage, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in aſſayling them, or defending our ſelues, if fortune ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue her diſfauour to vs. Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that if wee all die here, it is an immortall glory to vs, and a more honourable buriall then any man can wiſh for. For the whole earth in generall is the rightfull graue, wherein to interre the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men illuſtrious and famous, whoſe memories are not ſo well preſerued by priuate inſcriptions &amp; epitaphes: as by their owne legit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate renowne, which extendeth and publiſheth it ſelfe in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt nations, who doe more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly conſider in their ſoules, the height and aduancement of their courage, then the diſaſter which hath befallen them. For it hath bin vniuerſally obſerued, that negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the fitteſt attendant for ſhame, is much more irkeſome and diſtaſtefull to a man, that hath a found and entire minde: then any death whatſoeuer, happening to him by valour, with vnconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hope of publike glory.</p>
                  <p>All this confirmeth my beleefe (deare and worthie friends) that ſcorning to degenerate from your famous predeceſſors, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſo much: that the world ſhall witneſſe your great vertue and conſtancy, and that the death of your Prince, is not the ſtroke that ſtrikes you all dead. Wherefore I deſire you, to let mee vnderſtand how you are addicted, to the end, that according to your reſolution: I may ſet in order ſuch affaires, as are needfull for my ſelfe. Aſſuring you in the worde of a King, that were I ſure to dy a thouſand deaths: yet will I not depart from hence, till I ſee the end of mine enemies, or they of me.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words ſo exalted the harts of the hearers, that they anſwered as with a common conſent; they were now more willing to fight then euer, for which King <hi>Liſuart</hi> thanked them moſt hartily.

                  <p>The fame of the marriage of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> with the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> had ſpread it ſelfe in ſo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: that the good olde Hermit, who nouriſhed <hi>Eſplandian</hi> in his infant daies, had intelligence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, eſpecially of the Kings ſubiects diſlike, in compelling his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt her will, to vndergoe a buſineſſe ſo diſpleaſing to her, and laſtly, what ſuccour was ſent to <hi>Amadis</hi> in the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, two great Armies were met in field together.

conſcience of <hi>Oriana,</hi> how ſhe and <hi>Amadis</hi> had promiſed marriage ech to other, vnder which contracted couenant, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and therefore ſhe could not be giuen in marriage to any other but our Lord would be highly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therewith. For this cauſe, hee concluded to trauaile to the <hi>Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iſle,</hi> to obtaine leaue &amp; licence of her, to acquaint King <hi>Liſuart</hi> with ſo much as hee knew. Here-upon, ſo ouer-ſpent with yeares, as hee was, hee mounted on his Aſle, and accompanied onely with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good man, bequeathed him-ſelfe to trauaile, and ariued at the Pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> immediately after King <hi>Perions</hi> departure: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was not a little diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, fearing hee ſhould not execute his enterpriſe ſo ſpeedily, but that the two Armies would preuent him.</p>

But deare Madame, becauſe I receiued this ſecret in confeſſion: it is not lawfull for me to reueale it, without your owne good will and conſent.

But if you ſhould happen into his power, as heretofore you haue bin: yet you ought to preferre the feare of God, before any other reſpect whatſoeuer, although it extend to his diſpleaſure, which I hope well to moderate, if you will permit me to ſpeake with him. Alas father, ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> in you only lieth my remedy and comfort: doe therefore what ſhall pleaſe you, and enti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And becauſe the two Armies are neare to one another, and I feare their meeting, before I ſhall bee come to them: may it pleaſe you to let mee part hence this day, leaſt ſome inconuenience may happen by my negligence, and the fruite I expect by my labour, periſh not through ſlothfulneſſe. Father ſaid <hi>Oriana,</hi> no doubt but God will be your guide, and I earneſtly entreat you, that if you ſee young <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian:</hi> to preuaile ſo much by your endeauour, as to bring him hither at your returne. Then ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded dinner for him, and after hee had refreſhed himſelfe: hee mounted on his Aſſe, ryding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards King <hi>Liſuart.</hi> His a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged trauaile was not ſo ſpeedy, but that the two Armies had fought twice together, according as you haue already heard, and hee came thither on the day, before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond truce was finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>As hee paſſed by the Campe, he ſaw (on euery ſide) the interment of many ſlaughtered bodies, whereat hee was ſo grieued, that falling into teares, and lifting vp his eyes and hands to heauen, hee ſaid.

Paſſing on further, hee came neare to the Tent of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who quickly eſpied him, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately knew him: whereupon hee went to welcome him, for he held this man of holy life in high eſteem, and well conſidered, that (but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome great occaſion) he would not haue left his Hermitage; &amp; take ſo great iourney to him, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as hee embraced him, hee ſaid.

                  <p>Holy father, I know you haue not vndertaken ſo tedious a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and ill agreeing with your age, but vpon ſome vrgent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, wherein I humbly deſire you to reſolue me. You haue great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Sir, anſwered <hi>Naſcian,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſo of me, for vndoubtedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity of yeares, and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereunto it hath pleaſed our Lord to call mee, may well excuſe me from beeing ſeene among men of blood. Neuertheleſſe, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the harme that may enſue, I haue not feared the danger of my perſon, as hoping to performe a ſeruice acceptable to God, and wholeſome to your ſoule. Let me then tell you Sir, that being (ſome few daies ſince) in the Hermitage, whereunto happy chance was your guide, when you and I conferred together, concerning the moſt ſtrange nouriſhing of <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian:</hi> I vnderſtood the occaſion of this warre, attempted by you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Amadis</hi> and his friends. Yet am I well aſſured, that you cannot accompliſh what you would doe, namely, marrie my Ladie your daughter to the Emperour of <hi>Rome:</hi> by which enterpriſe, many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous miſchances haue already hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, not onely becauſe it is not agreeable, to the greateſt and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of your kingdome, as many
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7181:360"/>
times already hath beene told you: but for ſome other reaſon Sir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, concealed from you, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to mee, and againſt which (by Gods lawe) you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. Knowe then Sir, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame <hi>Oriana</hi> your daughter, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready vnited in marriage to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as heauen hath appointed, and ſtands well pleaſed to haue it ſo.</p>
                  <p>The King beeing much amazed, to heare the olde man ſpeake in this manner: coniectured immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, that weakeneſſe of braine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got this kinde of language, &amp; that hee was troubled in his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or elſe had beene miſinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of that which he ſpake, where-upon hee ſaid vnto him. How fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? my daughter was neuer mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to my knowledge, neither did I euer purpoſe to giue her to any other, then to the <hi>Romane</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to whome I promiſed her, accounting it for her honour and benefit. And God is my witneſſe, that I neuer intended to diſ-inherit her, as many haue inconſiderately immagined: but only to combine alliance with ſo great a Lord, by meanes whereof, he and I ſo vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, Chriſtian faith might be the more augmented. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my intention beeing iuſt, mee thinkes I ſhould not be therin bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>Sir, anſwered the Hermite, that which I haue tolde you, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome matters hidden from you, yet to mee apparant: I will preſently declare vnto you, for from none other then my ſelfe can you know them. Vnderſtand then, my Lord, that the ſelfe ſame day, when (by your command) I came to the Forreſt, where, for more delight of the Ladies then preſent with you, your Tents were erected for view of the ſporte (I knowe not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you remember it, or no:) I brought you young <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> who preſented you the Lioneſſe, that gaue him ſuck at the firſt: The ſame day, the Princſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> your daughter was confeſſed by me, &amp; tolde mee in her confeſſion, that ſhe had promiſed mariage to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis de Gaule,</hi> at ſuch time as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered her from the Enchanter <hi>Archalaus,</hi> to whom you had giuen her, a little before that the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell (by whom you were enchanted) had brought your ſtate and perſon into the greateſt danger that could bee poſſible, from which <hi>Galaor</hi> freed you. And beleeue it to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely, that our Lord himſelfe, gaue conſent to the mariage, for <hi>Eſplandian</hi> is the iſſue thereof, and of him, <hi>Vrganda</hi> the <hi>Vnknowen,</hi> foretolde many maruailes, as you your ſelfe doe very well know.</p>
                  <p>Now, in my poore iudgement, you ſhould not be diſpleaſed there-with, conſidering, that <hi>Amadis</hi> is the ſonne of a King, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (in all places) to be one of the beſt and moſt gracious Knights in all the world. I would aduiſe you Sir, that in ſhewing your ſelfe to be ſuch as you euer haue beene: you ſhould defend the honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of your daughter, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an end of this warre, call her home again to you, &amp; vſe her here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after as reaſon requireth. In ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our Lord will be well pleaſed with you, who elſe will (doubtleſſe) bee offended with you, for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ſo much blood, which you haue cauſed to be ſhedde vpon no occaſion.</p>
                  <p>When the King had all this while liſtned to this diſcourſe, he ſhewed himſelfe to be very penſiue, and at laſt ſaide. Good father, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that my daughter ſhould bee
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7181:360"/>
married to <hi>Amadis?</hi> Yes truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Naſcian,</hi> hee is her husband, and <hi>Eſplandian</hi> is your grandchilde. O God (quoth the King) how ill hath it been for mee, that I could not know this matter till now? vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my faith, many good Knights had yet beene liuing, which now (to my no little griefe) are dead. Alas father, why could not you ſooner haue reuealed this? I might not doe it, anſwered the Hermite, for it was tolde mee in confeſſion, and if now I haue made it knowne to you, thinke it is done by ſuch permiſſion, as I receiued from the Princeſſe your daughter, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, you had neuer heard it from mee. But ſhe is therewith well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, as well for the clearing of her ſoule: as alſo to take away all occaſion from you, of further ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning herein through ignorance.</p>
                  <p>At that very inſtant, meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in the King, preſented before the eyes of his ſoule, the ſeuerall ſeruices hee had receiued by <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and his k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ed, and ſuch they were, as hee had not then beene li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but only by them, hauing ſo many times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>olpen him in very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious affaires. Deſert in <hi>Amadis</hi> pleaded iuſtly for his daughter, and a greater gift, if hee could beſtow it on him; and ſo much the rather, becauſe the Emperor (to whom he had promiſed her) was dead, and beſide, <hi>Vrganda</hi> had tolde him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wonders, concerning <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>:</hi> but aboue all the reſt, that hee ſhould be the cauſe, of perpetuall peace between him and <hi>Amadis,</hi> as euen already (in a manner) hee ſaw performed, and hauing diſcourſed all this in his minde, thus hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Naſcian.</hi> Father, albeit I had ſet downe my reſt for death, &amp; all mine with me, or to haue the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand in this warre: yet ſeeing how matters haue happened, I will follow your counſell, and I entreat you moſt affectionately, to worke ſo well with <hi>Amadis:</hi> that hee may liſten to peace, which (for my part) I put into your hands, to the end, that you may hereafter teſtifie before God, with what dutie I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelfe in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wordes were ſo pleaſing to the good old Hermite, as, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for meere ioy, hee fell before the Kings feet, ſaying. O moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Prince, the Lord almighty quite you for this kindneſſe, and bleſſe you with long and proſperous life. The King taking him by the hand, &amp; raiſing him vp, ſaid. Father, I wil perform what I haue promiſed you, without any manner of reuocation. Neuertheleſſe, I would haue al men to know, that neither feare, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of courage, hath hereunto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained mee: but reaſon only, and in ſuch nature as you haue reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to mee. Wherefore, it ſhall be fitting for you, to go into King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ons</hi> Campe, before the truce bee fully ended, to the ende, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what you ſhall certifie me, I may ſtand vpon my guard. Sir, ſaid <hi>Naſcian,</hi> if God ſo pleaſe, I will neither eate nor drinke, till I haue ſpoken with <hi>Amadis,</hi> and let me entreate leaue for my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe occaſion now frankly offers herſelfe to me.</p>
                  <p>Hauing thus ſpoken, the King &amp; hee returned to the Knights, where they found <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> newly there ariued from Queene <hi>Briſena,</hi> who had ſent him from <hi>Vindiliſore</hi> to King <hi>Liſuart</hi> only to vnderſtand of his health, whom when <hi>Naſcian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, hee knew him preſently: yet wondred to ſee him of ſo taule ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; very neare ready to vndergo Armes, which made him (with meer ioy) runne and embrace him. But
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7181:361"/>
the young gentleman was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, to ſee the olde man ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull kinde to him, hauing whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgotten him, and therefore bluſhed ſtrangely: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſoone after, he both remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the Hermite and his hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and falling on his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, kiſſed his hand, when the olde man folding him in his armes, ſaid. Beloued childe of God, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the houre of thy birth, and praiſed bee the name of our Lord, for proſpering thee to ſuch eſtate wherein I now ſee thee.</p>
                  <p>During this diſcourſe, the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by were much amazed, to ſee this holy man vſe <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly, and the King himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but newly aduertiſed, that hee was grandfather to him: mooued with a fatherly affection, felt ſuch ioy in his ſoule, as neuer at any time hee receiued more. So that the hatred which he formerly bare to <hi>Amadis</hi> and his friends: became ſuddenly changed into amity extraordinary, and hee demanded of the youth, from whence he came. <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> well enſtructed by nature, kiſſing a packet of Letters in his hand, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſented them to the King, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering thus. Sir, the Queene my Miſtreſſe ſent mee to you, as there more at large you may be certified. Then the King opened the letters, wherein (among other matters) ſhee earneſtly entreated him: that by all meanes hee would liſten to peace, if hee might doe it with his honour. After hee had ouer-read the Letters, hee ſhewed them to <hi>Naſcian,</hi> ſaying, Beholde good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it ſeems that my Queen knows already, what is intended betweene you and me. Sir, ſaid the Hermite, ſhee counſelleth you wiſely, and if God be ſo pleaſed, that which ſhee ſo earneſtly deſireth, ſhall bee put in execution, before this yong gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman returnes to her againe. Wherefore, let mee craue of your Maieſty, to let him goe along with mee in companie, to the end, that during my trauaile, I may conuerſe with him the more eaſily. Let it be ſo then, anſwered the King, for it is my will, that hee ſhall not leaue you, ſo long as you would haue him with you. The Hermite moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thanked the King, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mounted on his Aſſe, as <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> did on his horſe, attended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Sergill</hi> his companion, who had come along thither with him.</p>
                  <p>So they departed thence, taking the way towards King <hi>Perion,</hi> and all that while, the good olde man conferred with <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> euen till they were ariued at the watch. There they were ſtayed, to knowe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came, and what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: but when they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that <hi>Naſcian</hi> came to ſpeake with Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> they conducted them both to his Tent, and there preſented them vnto him. Here you muſt conſider, that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before ſeene the reuerend olde man, and therefore knew not what he ſhould thinke, or what buſineſſe hee might haue with ſuch a perſon. Looking likewiſe on <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> he had as little knowledge of him: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit hee had formerly ſpoken to him, on the ſame day, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the <hi>Romanes,</hi> on the behalfe of faire <hi>Graſinda,</hi> &amp; when he (being then very young) begged the liues of the two Knights, that elſe had been ſlaine by <hi>Amadis.</hi> But <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragant,</hi> who had taken better no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him, when hee met him at his laſt returne from Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> went and embraced him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Faire Sir, you deſired me (and <hi>Brian</hi> alſo) not long ſince, to doe your commendations to the Greek
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7181:361"/>
Knight; which wee accordingly performed, and here he is himſelfe, to iuſtifie that wee failed not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wordes gaue aſſured teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to <hi>Amadis,</hi> that hee to whom <hi>Quedragant</hi> ſpake, was his ſonne, which made him feele inwardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable ioy. And then the young Gentleman came and did him reuerence, not as a ſonne to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beeing yet ignorant of him: but as to the onely Knight of the world, &amp; by whom he had hope to haue his knighthood, ſo conceu ed in him, on the very ſame day hee combated the Emperours Knights. Notwithſtanding, the differences happening between the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> and them of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> raiſed a wounderfull doubt in him, that he ſhould not attaine to his intention. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him, demanded if King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> had granted leaue for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him. My Lord, quoth he, this good olde father <hi>Naſcian,</hi> will acquaint you with the reaſon of his comming to you.</p>
                  <p>Obſerue here, that <hi>Amadis</hi> had often heard of this Hermite, who was reputed generally, for a moſt holy man of life: wherefore, going to him, hee ſaid. Father, I pray you pardon mee, for I knew you not at your entrance: but now I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand more of you, and the honour that is due to you by deſert. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (replied the Hermit) be giuen to God only, I am his poore hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruant, who (in his feare) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to ſpeake alone with you in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, if it ſhall pleaſe you but to heare me. Yes on my faith, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis.</hi> And ſo, taking him by the hand, they went aſide by themſelues, and <hi>Naſcian</hi> began in this manner with him.</p>
                  <p>Sonne, before you vnderſtand the cauſe, which hath mooued mee to come ſee you, I would ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, the great obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherein you are indebted to our Lord: to the ende, that you may henceforth encline your ſelfe, to do ſuch things, as are beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him. I make no doubt, but am well aſſured, you haue often heard, how in the very firſt daies of your life, you were forſaken of all friends, and giuen ouer to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Sea, in a matter of ſmall defence, and without any other guarde but God: by whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, you fell into their hands, who afterwardes gaue you nouriſhment, euen vntil you came to be a Knight, and the moſt compleate knowne at this day. For our Lord hath indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d you with ſtrength, to gaine the maiſtery of many Giants, Monſters, Tyrants, and moſt cruell beaſts, whereby your renowne hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it ſelfe, into all partes of the worlde. Now, ſeeing he hath enriched you with ſo many great graces, mee thinkes it is no more then reaſon: that you ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for your ſoueraign Lord, and labour in thankefulneſs to him, by humbling your ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, for otherwiſe, all the fauours hee hath beſtowen vpon you, will turne but to your ſhame and diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>Sonne, you ſee how olde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit I am, nature (almoſt) decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mee: Notwithſtanding, I haue not feared, to vndertake ſo long a iourney to you, becauſe I heard (euen in mine owne poore Hermitage) the diſcord betweene you and King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> with whom I haue lately ſpoken, and found him to be ſuch a man, as a good Prince, and miniſter of God ought to bee, and ready (if nothing keep you to the contrary) to liſten to peace,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7181:362"/>
which (me thinkes) you ought not to refuſe, as well for the quiet of your conſcience, as for the ſafety of your perſon. And to the end, that you may make no diſguiſing of your affections: let me aſſure you, that I know more of your moſt intimate affaires, then you imagine I doe, for Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> (vnder the ſeal of confeſſion) hath tolde mee a chiefe ſecret, concerning you both.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard him ſpeake ſo plainely, hee knew well enough, that he ſpake nothing but the truth, wherefore hee thus anſwered. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if I could ſerue my God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his graces and mercies beſtowed on mee; I might well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme my ſelfe the moſt happie Knight in the worlde. But, beeing a grieuous ſinner, as I am, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (too often) mine owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure before his glory: I muſt needs faile, as other men doe, to my no little griefe. Yet I hope (knowing mine owne defects) to behaue my ſelfe better then heretofore I haue done. Humbly beſeeching you, good father, not to feare, or defer in telling me, what you beſt thinke I ought to doe, that may bee moſt acceptable to him, for I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in obey you, to my vttermoſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Ah my good ſonne (quoth he) you do enough in taking this whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome way: whereby I hope to bee your guide, not only for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of your countrie, but alſo for the good of many ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Then he recounted to him, how hee had trauelled to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> where hee had conuerſed with <hi>Oriana,</hi> and by her conſent, was ſent to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with all hee had in charge: eſpecially, the troth-plight marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of them both, the iſſue where-of, was <hi>Eſplandian.</hi> And beleeue me childe, quoth the Hermite, the King hath heerein carried himſelfe ſo vertuouſly, and takes all in ſuch good part; that if you fall not off, I hope to vnite a perpetuall alliance betweene you.</p>
                  <p>Now you may diuine, whether <hi>Amadis</hi> heard theſe tydings gladly, or no: but I dare aſſure you, they were ſo welcome to him, as hee had no power to diſſemble his inward ioy, but preſently returned this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the Hermite. If it ſhall pleaſe the King to accept me as his ſonne, I promiſe you (good father) that hee ſhall finde me ſo tractable to him, as I will be diligent in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him any ſeruice. There remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no more then, replied the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, but that you both may ſpeake together: therefore aduiſe with your ſelfe, both how and when it may moſt conueniently bee done. Let me tell you, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I would haue you firſt, go to King <hi>Perion</hi> my father, and tell him the cauſe of your comming to me: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe your owne opinion, that king <hi>Liſuart</hi> will now accept thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, which laſtly were made to him in Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> (on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe) by <hi>Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Brian de Moniaſte,</hi> concerning the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> if they might be once more tendered to him. Say moreouer, you are well aſſured, that hee ſhall finde him reaſonable, and a Prince of peace, euen as any other what-ſoeuer in the world: And you may tell him, that you haue ſpoken with me, but I haue referred all to his diſpoſition. For the honour of God, ſaid the good olde man, I pray you (without any longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying) to let me be brought where hee is. Father, replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> my ſelfe therein will ſerue as a guide to you, and for ſo good an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>Vpon theſe tearmes, they went
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7181:362"/>
inſtantly to King <hi>Perion,</hi> who being aduertiſed of <hi>Naſcians</hi> comming, came to welcome him: but behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Eſplandian</hi> with him, he could not gueſſe who hee ſhould be, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee appeared to be a very good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie creature, as any he had euer loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on in his life, wherefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of the Hermite, whether he were his ſon, or no? Sir (quoth hee) hee is partly mine, as beeing a foſter father to him in his younger yeares, and our Lord beſtowed him on me (almoſt) miraculouſly. It is very true, anſwered the King, if this be hee, to whom the Lioneſſe gaue ſucke at his beginning, as I haue often heard, and of whom, <hi>Vrganda</hi> the <hi>Vnknowen</hi> hath foretolde many wounders: and among the reſt, that he ſhal be the cauſe of planting peace and amity between King <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> and my ſonne <hi>Amadis,</hi> which I pray God indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him with grace to doe. And beleeue mee, ſeeing ſuch faire fruit is to fal from his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, hee well deſerues to be both beloued and eſteemed. In truth anſwered the Hermite, this is hee of whom you ſpeake, and when you haue further knowledge of him, you will affect him more then you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, as at better leaſure, I ſhal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after tell you.</p>
                  <p>Then hee called <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> and commanded him to doe reuerence to the King: when the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle man, ſetting his knee to the ground, would haue kiſſed the Kings hand, but hee tooke him in his armes, ſaying. Gentle Sir, you are ſo faire and vertuouſly quallifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: that ſuch as ſee you, or haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of you, doth both loue and highly eſteeme you. And I am perſwaded, you will proue ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie a man, that Knighthood were very deſertfully beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you. <hi>Eſplandian</hi> hearing himſelfe ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, began to grow ſomewhat baſhfull thereat: and perceiuing the King to bluſh likewiſe, deſired to know of the Hermite, if he could tell whoſe ſonne hee was. Sir, ſaid <hi>Naſcian</hi> to the King, this young man (as yet) knoweth not any thing concerning his owne demand, and as for my ſelfe, I am very certaine, that hee hath neither father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from whom (as yet) hee hath receiued any great fauours. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, our Lord hath hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued him, and gaue him me (at the firſt) to loue and inſtruct him, as mine owne childe.</p>
                  <p>At theſe wordes, the King began to conceiue, that hee would not conferre any further with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo many by-ſtanders, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tooke him aſide: but the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite changed his diſcourſe, ſaying. I beſeech you Sir to beleeue, that conſidering the condition whereto I haue been long time called, and ſo many aged yeares already ouer-gone me: I would not haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my Cell, to bee ſeene among warres and contentions, had it not been, that my ſlacknes in ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a buſineſſe, might haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured much euill, wherewith our Lord would haue been highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. And his diſpleaſure would not only haue extended it ſelfe to you, &amp; the people aſſembled in both theſe Campes: but alſo to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vnskilfull in the diſcords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you and King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> with whom I haue already conferred, &amp; ſo well perſwaded him to peace, as hee is ready both to liſten there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and to entertaine it, according as I haue imparted to Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> your ſonne, who wholly referreth all to you. Therefore I deſire you Sir, that preferring the good and tranquile eſtate of ſo many people, before priuate ſpleens and paſſions:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7181:363"/>
not to diſdaine what is freely offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you, and which you ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtriue to purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>Father, replied King <hi>Perion,</hi> God is my witneſſe, what griefe I haue endured, for matters that are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die paſt, with the loſſe of ſo many worthie men, and how gladly I would haue gone another way, if King <hi>Liſuart</hi> would haue liſtened thereto. But hee alwaies carried ſo high a hand, as, notwithſtanding all remonſtrances made to him by our Ambaſſadours, eſpecially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarde of Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom hee ſought to diſinherite: he made no account of vs at all, preſuming ſo much vpon himſelfe, that by the ayde of the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperour, hee would ouer-run the whole worlde. By this meanes hee made refuſall, not only to admit this difference to iuſtice; but likewiſe contemned all hearing thereof. Neuertheleſſe, if hee will yet ſubmit to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: I dare repoſe ſuch truſt in my followers, as they will bee ordered by mine aduice. I haue euermore deſcanted on this diſcourſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from no other occaſion, but whereto hee ſtands bound by right of nature, and to his owne blood. So that, if hee will yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale the princeſſe his daughter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his former gracious fauour, and not marrie her to any other perſon, not onely to her, and his owne people, but to all them that know or heare thereof: wee will deliuer her to him, and continue his kinde friends, if hee bee as deſirous as wee.</p>
                  <p>Sir, anſwered the good old man, if God bee ſo pleaſed, all this will come to paſſe. Therefore, if you thinke it conuenient, elect two Knights on your behalfe, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the differences, where-about ſo many harmes haue alreadie hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſhall likewiſe nominate two other for him, and I ſtanding in the midſt between them will labour to ende all ſtrife and contention. Bee it ſo, quoth the King. Sir, ſaid <hi>Naſcian,</hi> I will not ſleep, before (I hope) to ſpeed, with ſuch ſucceſſe, as the effects ſhall be anſwerable to your owne deſire.</p>
                  <p>Inſtantly hee tooke leaue of him and the reſt, returning whence he came, to finiſh what he had begun. And preſently King <hi>Perion</hi> ſommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the chiefe of his Armie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſpeaking to them in this maner. Lords, &amp; endeared friends, as we are bound to put our goods and perſons in danger, not onely for the defence of our honour, but alſo to maintaine equity &amp; iuſtice: ſo are wee likewiſe obliged, to ſet aſide all hatred and paſſion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile our ſelues with our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: when (of himſelfe) hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers vs peace. For, although it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gaine-ſaied, but that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of warre may goe on, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence to God: yetnotwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in the end, if through raſh opinion, fantiſie and want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we eſtrange our ſelues from reaſon; that which (at the firſt) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared honeſt, conuerts it ſelfe into iniuſtice. And doe not thinke, that I vſe theſe ſpeaches to you without cauſe. <hi>Naſcian,</hi> a holy Hermite (well knowen to the moſt part of you) came lately to mee, as you ſawe, to practiſe peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and our enemie: where-to King <hi>Liſuart</hi> is willing to yeeld, if you miſlike not. Neuertheleſſe, I would not giue him any reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till firſt I heard your delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>For, to mee it ſeemeth very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that as you haue been made partakers of toyle and trauaile, ſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7181:363" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhould you alſo be of eaſe and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. And therefore I pray you, that without any diſſimulation, you would all aduiſe for the beſt, and God will therin further your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. For my ſelfe according to the opinion of olde <hi>Naſcian,</hi> I holde it very meet, that wee ſhould make choyce of two Knights amongſt vs, and giue them ample power, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine with two other (appointed by King <hi>Liſuart)</hi> of all differences, whereby this warre receiued origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Albeit, I deſire not to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited in this caſe; but rather will allowe of ſuch aduiſe, as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue fitteſt for the good of all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Hereupon, <hi>Angriote d' Eſtreuaus</hi> firſt preſented himſelfe, of whom the King required his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Sir, ſaid hee, you haue beene choſen chiefe of this enterpriſe, as well for the dignity of a king ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in you; as for the fauour and eſteeme generally helde of you, whereby you may reſolue on the buſineſſe of this warre, as it ſhall ſeeme beſt vnto your ſelfe. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſeeing it is your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that I ſhall firſt ſpeake my minde: I like it well (vnder cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection) that if peace be preſented vs by our enemy, wee ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. For, as it falles out, it is to our no meane aduantage, hauing not onely the better of him alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but Madame <hi>Oriana</hi> alſo in our owne power, for whoſe cauſe wee firſt entred into the field. Now, for the naming two choyce men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, to accord (as you ſay) all differences: I know none more meet for ſuch a buſineſſe, then the Lords <hi>Quedragant,</hi> &amp; <hi>Brian de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaſte.</hi> They (at the firſt) vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went this charge, when they were ſent into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> to excuſe vs to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> for that which we had done, in reſcuing his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the <hi>Romanes:</hi> and I am peſwaded, they will vndertake the ſame charge againe, if they were thereto entreated. Now becauſe this aduiſe found generall allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>Brian</hi> and <hi>Quedragant</hi> yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded preſently thereto: whereat king <hi>Perion</hi> was highly pleaſed, hoping the warre ſo hotly begun, would by theſe meanes be calmely ended.</p>

Father, ſaide the King, hee dealeth moſt wiſely therein, to the ende that none of them ſhould receiue diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And for my part, I meane to doe the like, as you ſhall preſently ſee performed.

                  <p>My Lord, ſaid the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> if peace may bee treated with your enemie, I would aduiſe you not to refuſe it: conſidering the moſt of your people are wounded, others ſicke and crazed, and a long turce is now very needfull, if a re-enforcement bee thought expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, after a ſufficient time of reſt.

                  <p>Such was their reſolution, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> quickely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Naſcian,</hi> to whom hee declared all that was agreed vpon; praying him moſt affectionately, to finiſh the buſineſſe hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.

                     <p>How King <hi>Arauigne,</hi> being aduertiſed of the loſſe, which King <hi>Liſuart</hi> had ſuſtained, and the diſlodging of his Campe; determined to giue him battaile.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue already heard the enterpriſe of King <hi>Arauigne,</hi> who, after his powers were vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, ceaſed not trauailing ouer the mountains: but yet ſo couertly, as neither king <hi>Perion</hi> or <hi>Liſuart</hi> could attaine to any certaine knowledge there-of. For he kept himſelfe very cloſe, watching but opportunity, to ſet on the firſt of the Campes that ſhould be broken. For this cauſe immediately after king <hi>Liſuart</hi> was diſlodged, and gone directly to the Citie of <hi>Lubania:</hi> the Scoutes of <hi>Archalaus</hi> his Campe, who were on the toppe of all the mountaine, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the Armies retyring, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he gaue intelligence to king <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauigne.</hi> Who imagining them to bee the whole ſtrength, intended to ſet forward, and rather to aſſaile them, then the forces of <hi>Amadis,</hi> as beeing perſwaded, that if hee brought his attempt to effect, king <hi>Perion</hi> would not afterwarde care for contending with him, about the kingdome of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> but that eaſily hee might enioy it in peace.</p>
                  <p>Theſe beeing his endes, and to compaſſe them, hee concluded ſtill to lie cloſe, vntill the night enſuing: when he would then giue both the Alarme and battaile together, as being the readieſt way to ſurpriſe them. Then hee commanded his Nephew <hi>Eſclanor,</hi> a man skilfull in feates of warre, as any other poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could be; to take twenty knights with him, and following the traine of the enemy in the cloſeſt manner, truely to diſcouer, where they would campe the night enſuing.</p>
                  <p>Now, you muſt heere obſerue with me, that King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſuſpitious, what king <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigne</hi> intended to doe, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſundry aduertiſements, that hee marched in the countrie with a great power, and yet could not heare which was hee went. Some of the countrie gaue him notice, that hee kept himſelfe ambuſhed in the mountaines, and becauſe hee would prouide againſt any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience,: he called king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> and all the Captaines, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with his minde, deſiring them to take order, that their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould keepe cloſe together, without any forraging, or ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one from another, but followe ſtill the Artillery in frame of battail, as formerly had beene appointed them. And although ſome were of the minde, to ſend aduertiſement to K. <hi>Perion,</hi> what they had heard co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning K. <hi>Arauigne,</hi> that he might the better ſtand vpon his own gard, and ſuccour them if they ſhould be diſtreſſed: yet King <hi>Liſuart</hi> had a heart ſo high and magnanimous,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7181:365"/>
as he would by no meanes conſent thereto, affecting rather to hazard his life, then loſe the leaſt iot of his reputation. Only he ſent <hi>Philipinel,</hi> accompanied with twenty bolde Knights, to diſcouer and runne tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the countrie, commanding them expreſly, to coaſt along the mountaines, and let him hourely vnderſtand, what they could heare of the enemy. So pacing on about foure miles, he encamped, and gaue it out by man to man, that a little reſt muſt now ſerue, becauſe they would march all night to <hi>Lubania.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not farre had <hi>Philipinell</hi> trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but he diſcouered <hi>Eſclanor</hi> and his twenty Knights: wherewith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately hee acquainted king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> and that (without all doubt) the ſtrength of <hi>Arauignes</hi> Armie was hid among the Rocks. At that very inſtant king <hi>Liſuart</hi> diſlodged, to gaine entrance into the Citie: for there hee purpoſed to expect ſuccour, if hee ſhould be preſſed thereto, ſtealing on by little and little from the mountaine, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching on vpon the plaine. Which when <hi>Eſclanor</hi> noted, he ſent to bid king <hi>Aranigne,</hi> that hee ſhould put on (with all haſte) by the the moſt ſecret paſſages: but the way was ſo ſtraite and narrow, as they could not march but two together at the the moſt. By which meanes, before they could attaine to king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> hee and his were very neare to the Citie: whereat <hi>Arauigne</hi> began to deſpaire, fearing to faile vtterly in his enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>By this time alſo, <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and <hi>Sergill</hi> (whom the Hermite had ſent to king <hi>Liſuart)</hi> finding his Campe diſlodged: made ſuch ſpeed, that they ſawe the men (both horſe and foot) deſcending downe the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Then they preſently coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, that this was the Armie of king <hi>Arauigne,</hi> whereof they heard the Queene <hi>Briſania</hi> ſpeake, before they parted from her. Wherefore, fearing this power to be ouer great, for that of king <hi>Liſuart</hi> (who had beene almoſt vtterly ouerthrone in the precedent battailes) they grew to great diſmay, ſo that <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian</hi> ſaid to <hi>Sergill.</hi> Brother, I pray you that wee may returne to Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> and let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what wee haue ſeene. <hi>Sergill</hi> was very willing, and returning the ſame way they came, they rode ſo dilligently: that by the breake of day, they alighted in king <hi>Perions</hi> Campe; where hee had newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued intelligence, that king <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigne</hi> and his people marched tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the countrie, and therefore kept his Armie (for the moſt part) all that night in order of battaile.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and <hi>Sergill,</hi> going to the Tent of <hi>Amadis,</hi> found there the Hermite <hi>Naſcian:</hi> who was not a little amazed, to ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned, &amp; demanded of them, whither they went. Father, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> it is very needeful, that I ſhould ſpeake with Lord <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> to let him know ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that do greatly concerne king <hi>Liſuart</hi> and his troupes. Now <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> had but withdrawne himſelfe a while, only for a little refreſhing, becauſe all the night hee had been in Armes: notwithſtanding, when hee heard what the young Gentle-man had ſaide, hee called him to him, demanding of him the eſtate of the matter. My Lord (quoth he) king <hi>Arauigne</hi> hath beſieged the King my Maſter, neare vnto the city of <hi>Lubania,</hi> &amp; with ſuch a power: as if you ſend him not ſuccour, &amp; that ſpeedily, I thinke you ſhall neuer ſee him while you liue, but either taken or ſlaine, and all that are with him. Wherefore I pray you doe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7181:365"/>
ſo much for him, as you are wont to do for many others, who (it may bee) are not in ſuch deepe diſtreſſe as hee.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Amadis</hi> heard theſe news; remembrance of diſpleaſing his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic <hi>Oriana,</hi> if her father ſhould be diſcomfited, and by his moſt dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemy in the world, through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of aſſiſtance from him: enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo his ſoule, that, without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering ſo much as a worde, hee went to king <hi>Perton,</hi> ſpeaking thus. My Lord, for ought I heare, king <hi>Arauigne</hi> hath turned his backe on vs, to fight with king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and is already ſo neare him, that it is a great aduenture, but hee will bidde him battaile. Whereat I ſhall not be a little diſpleaſed, knowing well that they of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> haue loſt ſo many of their men againſt vs, as they are not able now to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a freſh force.

                  <p>Sonne anſwered King <hi>Perion,</hi> doe what you think beſt, and if you goe before, I will follow and backe you: if by miſchance you ſhould be preuented. <hi>Amadis</hi> moſt humbly thanked him, and parting thence, met with <hi>Floreſtan, Quedragant, Garuate,</hi> and <hi>Gaſtilles,</hi> whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his enterpriſe, where-to they gaue good allowance. Here-upon, they forthwith ſet their men in order, marching directly for <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania:</hi> fully reſolued, to fight with king <hi>Arauigne</hi> and his men, if they might meet them in the field.</p>

                     <p>How King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> was aſſaulted by King <hi>Arauigne,</hi> brought into great danger: And of the ſuccour giuen him by <hi>Amadis</hi> in his neceſsity.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue heretofore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry amply declared, how King <hi>Liſuart</hi> had intelligence by his vant courers, that the Armie of King <hi>Arauigne</hi> purſued him: by meanes whereof hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged, hoping to gaine the Citie of <hi>Lubania</hi> before the fight. For he knew well enough, that he had not ſtrength ſufficient to ſtand againſt ſo great an hoſte of men, and freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come into the field: but he was ſuddenly ſet vpon, and followed ſo hotly, as hee had ſmall meanes of helping himſelfe. The two Camps began to skirmiſh together, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing fierce aſſaults eace againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill darke night ouer-tooke them: wherefore, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to remaine encamped near one to another, in expectation of the morning, to beginne againe in better manner, then before they had done.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Liſuart</hi> (by no meanes) would retire, as fearing to affright his followers, and wholy diſharten them: and therefore making a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of neceſſity, ſo ſoone as the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7181:366"/>
night was ſpent, he ordered his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile ſo well as hee could, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to die among his men, rather then blemiſh his honor in the leaſt degree. <hi>Barſinan,</hi> who led the vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarde for king <hi>Arauigne,</hi> firſt gaue the onſet with his troupes: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to handy blowes, many were laide on the earth with the great Ordenance, which plaied vpon then without ceaſing. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, at length they entred fight pell mell, and <hi>Griſall,</hi> who was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne bearer to <hi>Archalaus,</hi> was ouer-throwne in this firſt encounter by <hi>Norandell,</hi> albeit <hi>Archalaus</hi> labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his vtmoſt to releeue him. But king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> accompanied with many of his chiefeſt men, began to breake through the preaſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Barſinan</hi> had beene inſtantly foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but for the re-enforce, which king <hi>Arauigne</hi> ſent by the Duke of <hi>Briſtoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now might you haue ſeen many Launces ſhiuering in the ayre, and both horſe &amp; foot weltring in their blood on the ground, a ſight moſt pitifull to beholde. For king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> (playing at double, or quit) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the reſt of his Armie, came vpon the flankes of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the firſt hee met withall, was the brother to <hi>Aluinas</hi> (whom <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſlew at the Fountaine of <hi>Oliues,</hi> where the three Damoſels were guarded by the Dwarſſe) who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee vnhorſed ſo lubberly, that hee brake his necke, by his horſes fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon him. Purſuing on his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Archalaus</hi> eſpied him, who knew him very perfectly, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on ſo faſt, that hee ſhewed him to <hi>Barſinan,</hi> ſaying. You haue no other worke to doe, but inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reuenge your fathers ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death, for that is hee, which made him ſo ſuffer. Then <hi>Barſinan</hi> called to him ten of his Knights, with whom hee came, and ſet vpon King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and ouerthrewe him to the ground, where hee was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed (on all ſides) by <hi>Archalaus</hi> and a great many more, who labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their very vttermoſt, as hoping to take him. But <hi>Philipinell,</hi> with them that had (the day before) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the Armie of <hi>Arauigne,</hi> came and ſuccoured him: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their lot had fallen ſoule, but for king <hi>Cildadan, Arquiſill, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randell,</hi> and <hi>Brandoryas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now grew the fight fiercer and fiercer, for theſe foure ruſhed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the croudes ſo boiſterouſly, that they bare downe horſe &amp; man before them: and notwithſtanding al reſiſtance the enemy could make, they remounted the King vpon <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randells</hi> horſe, for he had alighted, that the King might haue him. Then taking a Sworde in both his hands, (which he found by good fortune) hee performed therewith ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie deeds of Armes: as in meere deſpite of <hi>Barſinan</hi> and his followers, hee horſed himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, wherein <hi>Brandoyuas</hi> was no meane help to him. <hi>Archalaus</hi> then wel perceiued, that they muſt needs haue the worſt, except king <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigne</hi> came vppe with his troupes: wherefore hee ſent a young Squire of his, and bad him goe tell him, that hee was much amazed, why he ſhould leaue him thus in ſo ſerious a buſineſſe. The Squire ranne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and performed his charge: but <hi>Archalaus</hi> anſwered him, that he thus delayed, hoping to draw King <hi>Liſuart</hi> and his men, further off from the Cittie, that hee might be the more eaſily encompaſſed at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>But now hee marched on with his ſquadron, which furiouſly brake in vpon King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> forces, who were then ſo wearied, and few in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7181:366"/>
number: as they were repelled to retire, euen within the gate of the City, where they ſaued themſelues, by the meanes of king <hi>Cildadan, Arban, Grumedan, Norandell, Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Arquiſill</hi> and others, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the traine. Now, if theſe worthie men declared (thus reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) their greatneſſe of ſpirit, you muſt conceiue, that king <hi>Liſuart</hi> as plainely witneſſed, that hee forgot not his honour in ſuch a neceſſity: for neuer was any Knight ſeene, that more forwardely aduentured his perſon to perill, then he did, nor with more allacrity of courage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to reuenge his owne death, if ſuch ſhould be his fatall diſaſter.</p>
                  <p>And as hee was in this extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>Grumedan,</hi> who carried the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, and King <hi>Arban,</hi> were beaten downe before his face, and taken priſoners, whereat he became moſt impatient: and with all his force, would needs enter into the throng, to ſuccour them. But ſome of his (beeing more diſcreetly aduiſed) kept him backe, and finding meanes to get him into the Citie, and then ſhut vp the gates. So king <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigne</hi> remained maſter of the field, not without great loſſe of his men, which yet were but few, in regarde of them belonging to king <hi>Liſuart:</hi> who found then by experience, what diſmall harme hee had endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by giuing ouer-much credit to the perſawſions of <hi>Brocadan</hi> &amp; <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandell,</hi> by whoſe treacherous meanes, hee had baniſhed <hi>Amadis</hi> from his Court, and many other worthie Knights, for which he now intirely grieued: And not without good cauſe, conſidering what ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hope he had, to free himſelfe from the danger which round had engirt him.</p>
                  <p>By this time, king <hi>Arauigne,</hi> was withdrawne into the middeſt of his troupes, to take counſell; whether they ſhould (now inſtantly) aſſault the Citie, or deferre it till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Now, as in ſuch affaires, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions are diuerſe, ſo ſome gaue aduice to refreſh their people, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready much wearied. Others ſpake to the contrarie, alleadging, that they ſhould not permit their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thus to rampire in themſelues, or let them take heart: but liuely, and without any delay, to followe vpon them, to encreaſe their feare, and weaken their courage. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon king <hi>Arauigne</hi> commanded <hi>Barſinan,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Briſtoy,</hi> to leade their troupes vp one ſide of the Citie, while he and his gaue the aſſault on the other, and that either ſide ſhould ſtriue for ſooneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. Then Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounded the aſſault, and men (on all ſides) ran to the wals, where they found king <hi>Liſuart</hi> &amp; his men, with the inhabitants of the Citie, that gaue them two or three ſtout repulſes, with Harquebuze ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All which diſcouraged not King <hi>Arauigne</hi> a iot, but rather did whette him on more and more, and had not darke night preuented them; king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart</hi> had beene ſhrewdly enforced, and the Cittie ſurpriſed. But the obſcurity was ſo great, as they could not diſcerne one another: in regard whereof king <hi>Arauigne</hi> cauſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate to be ſounded, hoping to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin againe at the breake of day, or elſe, that they within the Citie, ſhould yeeld to his mercy.</p>

                     <p>How <hi>Amadis</hi> came to the ſuccour of King <hi>Liſuart:</hi> And of the valiant ouerthnow of King <hi>Arauigne.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the precedent chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue heard, how the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sergill,</hi> hauing diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Armie of <hi>Arauigne,</hi> and doubting that king <hi>Liſuart</hi> was not ſtrong enough to fight with him: made a ſhort returne to <hi>Amadis,</hi> entreating his ſuccour, whereto he willingly yeelded. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, hee could not proceed on ſo ſpeedily (albeit hee trauelled night and day) but King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into great perill of his perſon, as euer before had happened to him: which danger thus befell him, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by meanes of vnhappy guides, that conducted <hi>Amadis</hi> and his troupes, wandring (about mid-night) farre out of the way, without knowing where they were, which much diſpleaſed <hi>Amadis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon he demanded of them, if they were farre from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, or no. The guides anſwered, that in their opinion (conſidering how farre they had alreade gone) they could not bee neare: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee commanded <hi>Gandalin,</hi> to ride ſo farre on either ſide, as hee might reach ſome matter of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery. Then he got vp on the higheſt part of all, to try, if hee could ſee the fire in king <hi>Arauignes</hi> Campe, beeing led all the way by one of the guides: and far they had not gone, but <hi>Gandalin</hi> deſcried the enemies fires in their Camp, which he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the guide, demanding of him, if now hee could giue them better direction, without any more ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein he warranted him, &amp; therefore bad him boldly followe him.</p>
                  <p>Returning backe to <hi>Amadis,</hi> they declared what they had ſeene: to his no little contentment, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to take king <hi>Arauigne</hi> nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Moreouer, he was partly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous, to let King <hi>Liſuart</hi> perceiue, how willing hee was (yet) to doe him ſeruice, notwithſtanding all his former hatred to him, and therefore rode on hard all the night. Yet could hee not ariue there ſo ſoone, but King <hi>Arauigne</hi> had begunne the aſſault againe, ſo ſharpe and hotly, as gaue great danger to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Citie, becauſe the enemies were become maſters of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part: by meanes whereof they entred in by ſuch numbers, as king <hi>Liſuart</hi> was compelled to betake himſelfe to a very little ſtreet or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, being followed by ſome of his chiefeſt Knights, and there he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to liue or die, rather then hee would yeeld himſelfe a priſoner to his proud foe.</p>
                  <p>Here began extreamitie to ſhew it ſelfe apparantly, for, like men deſpairing of any helpe or remidy, they declared ſuch manly deeds of Armes; as the Duke of <hi>Briſtoye</hi> &amp; <hi>Barſinan,</hi> were much impeached in their hopes. On the other ſide, King <hi>Cildadan, Arquiſill, Flamian,</hi> and <hi>Norandell,</hi> who ſeemed to keep ſure the neareſt Cantons, founde <hi>Arauigne</hi> (that held them beſieged) ſuch hotte worke: as, but for ſixe Knights of the <hi>Iſle Sagittarie,</hi> hee had neuer gone any further. For,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7181:367"/>
the women and children of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, were aloſt in the windowes, hurling downe boyling Lead, Oyle and water, as much perplexed him and them in their paſſage. Now did <hi>Norandell,</hi> and ſuch as were with him, fully perſwade them-ſelues, there to end their liues: yet not as cowards and recreants, but like true borne, bolde and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Knights. And hereupon, king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> ſtepping to one of them of the <hi>Sagittarte Iſle,</hi> ran his Sword vp to the hilts in his bodie, that downe he fell dead to the ground.</p>
                  <p>The ſight heereof was ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the other fiue, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to retire, and king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> with them of his troupe, purſued them very ſtoutly: till king <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uignes</hi> forces came vppe to releeue them, and there the day had beene vtterly loſt, but for the freſh ſupply of <hi>Amadis,</hi> who was not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at his ariuall, to ſee the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie haue ſuch aduantage of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> whom hee greatly feared to be either ſlaine, or taken. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vowing a mercileſſe reuenge, he commanded all his horſemen to alight, and entring in vpon them pell mell, to cry aloud, <hi>Gaule, Gaule.</hi> When the other heard ſuch a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tumultuous noyſe, and found themſelues ſo ſharpely charged in the rere: they plainely perceiued, that their attempt had failed, and all their hues to be in very great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. So that King <hi>Arauigne,</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcouraged, fied with <hi>Archalaus</hi> into a houſe, hoping there to ſtrengthen themſelues, and rather to die there, then yeeld to mercy. But they had not long ſtaied there, before King <hi>Liſuart</hi> came thither, and ſet vpon them ſo ſternely: that after ſome ſlender reſiſtance, they yeelded themſelues to be priſoners.</p>
                  <p>At the very ſame inſtant, <hi>Amadis</hi> met with the other fiue Knights of the <hi>Iſle Sagittarie,</hi> who fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his people very boldly: but hee making againſt them, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Floreſtan</hi> and <hi>Angriote,</hi> at length ſurpriſed them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to ſafe cuſtodie. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on further, they met with <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinan</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Briſtoye,</hi> figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting manfully: yet they no ſooner ſaw <hi>Amadis,</hi> but they threw them-ſelues at his feete, defiring mercie, which hee would not denie them, and ſo committed them to <hi>Flore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan.</hi> Now becauſe a great parte of King <hi>Arauignes</hi> Armie, had ſaued themſelues by flight into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring mountaines, and he found no further reſiſtance in the Citie: hee returned forth of the ſame gate whereat hee entred, and meeting with <hi>Gandalin,</hi> ſaid. Go I pray thee, and will <hi>Quedragant</hi> to retreate our people: for I would not be known to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and I meane to ſtay for him halfe a mile hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gandalin</hi> rode away preſently, &amp; finding <hi>Quedragant,</hi> did his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to him; who without any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger delay, cauſed retreat to bee ſounded, rallying all his troupes together. As thus they retired, king <hi>Liſuart</hi> could not preſume, how, or whence hee had receiued this high fauour, and therefore demanded of <hi>Guillan le Penſif,</hi> if hee knewe any thing in the caſe. Before God Sir (quoth he) he muſt needs be a deafe man that could not hear <hi>Gaul, Gaul,</hi> cried ſo many times this day; which may well aſſure you, that <hi>Amaedis,</hi> and no other, hath done you this vnexpected kindneſſe. I pray thee, ſaid the King, doe ſo much for me, as to finde and ſtay him, if it bee poſſible, that I may haue ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him.</p>
                  <p>So departed <hi>Guillan,</hi> who knew before, that <hi>Amadis</hi> was already
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7181:368"/>
gone, wherfore, galloping the ſame way which he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: at laſt he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertook him, &amp; deliuered the Kings meſſage to him, aduiſing him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe againe with him. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> perceiuing, that hee could not honeſtly gaine-ſay him, rode backe with him to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and alighting from his horſe, did him moſt humble reuerence: but the King imbracing him, declared ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſignes of great loue to him. At which inſtant, King <hi>Cildadan</hi> came to them, and many other Knights, with <hi>Floreſtan</hi> and <hi>Angrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> who were ſo louingly welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be bettered. And as he was ſpeaking vnto them, <hi>Brandoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uas</hi> came to tell him, that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Citie, made ſuch ſlaughter of king <hi>Arauignes</hi> people, as they would not admit any one man to mercie. But beleeue it Sir (quoth hee) it wery good to ceaſe this cruelty: for if their leaders haue not deſerued death, their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in ſeruice ſhould not bee worſe entreated. Sir ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> giue order quickly to ſtay this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and content your ſelfe with the victory gotten againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then the King called <hi>Norandell,</hi> and gaue him charge to command a retreate, that ſhedding of blood might be ſpared, and the reſt to be taken priſoners.</p>
                  <p>At that very time, an Eſquire ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued there from king <hi>Perion,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe <hi>Amadis,</hi> that he was hard at hand, with the reſt of the Armie, to giue him ſuccour, if neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required. Not now, anſwered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> thankes be to heauen. And therefore Sir (quoth hee, to King <hi>Liſuart)</hi> you may well giue vs leaue to depart: to the end, that without any further trauaile, king <hi>Perion</hi> may ſend vs home againe. Before God, replied the King, although you haue been hitherto alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible, yet ſhall you now bee ſo farre conſtrained by me, as to abide here for his comming hither: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee muſt needs partake in the ioy, which wee haue receiued by your meanes and ſuccour. Then, looking vpon king <hi>Cildadan,</hi> hee ſaid. Helpe mee (I pray you) with your entreatie, and trie whether your requeſt can more preuaile with him, then mine. Beleeue me, Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> anſwered king <hi>Cilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> you may not deny the King: conſidering he mooues the matter to you ſo earneſtly. Nor will I, ſaid hee, if my companions thinke it conuenient. What ſay you to it Lord <hi>Quedragant?</hi> you ought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the King, quoth hee, and ſeeing you haue done ſo much for him, doe more for him yet, if it bee in your power.</p>
                  <p>So was <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtayed there, and in this time of conference, king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> and <hi>Grumedan,</hi> returned from their impriſonement, hauing eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thence, with their hands bound hehinde them with ſtrong cordes: for their guardes, ſeeing what ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie <hi>Amadis</hi> had brought with him, betooke themſelues to flight, and ſo left them at their owne liberty. When king <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſaw them, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was man in greater ioy: becauſe hee was formerly perſwaded, that either they were ſlaine, or eiſe worſe wounded then they were, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with open armes he went and embraced them. And while he was buſied in theſe kindneſſes, they eſpied (a farre off) the Armie of king <hi>Perion</hi> come marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, which <hi>Grumedan</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> ſaying. Sir, as I imagine, here is ſome new ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour comming to you: but if the firſt of Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> had tarried ſo
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7181:368"/>
long, wee might haue ſhut the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doore after the Steed was gone, according to the ancient Adage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grumedan</hi> (anſwered king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> ſmiling) I know very wel, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer conteſts with you, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the honour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> ſhall finde worke enough to doe: but much more, to defende himſelfe, if extreamity ſhould que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the caſe by weapons. Sir, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> Lord <hi>Grumedan</hi> hath reaſon to wiſh mee well, for he hath neither friend or kinſman, that ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him more dutie and obedient ſeruice, then I doe, and for ſuch a one (I am certaine) he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and eſteeme me.</p>
                  <p>By this time, king <hi>Perion</hi> drew nearer and nearer, and thereupon, king <hi>Liſuart</hi> made forth to meete him, whereof <hi>Amadis</hi> aduertiſed him by <hi>Durin:</hi> wherefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his men to march a ſlowe pace, and taking <hi>Gaſtiles, Graſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, Brian de Moniaſte,</hi> and <hi>Tiron,</hi> with him, left <hi>Agraies</hi> to conduct the troupes, becauſe king <hi>Perion</hi> wel knew the ill-will he bare to king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and feared leaſt diſcourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous language might paſſe between them at their meeting, whereby the purpoſed peace ſhould bee quite made fruſtrate. So the two Kings went to meete each other, giuing the ſpurre to their horſes, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced together very louingly, king <hi>Perion</hi> ſpeaking thus to king <hi>Liſuart.</hi> My Lord and brother, me thinkes your Armour is much impaired, ſince you departed from the camp: albeit, I am well aſſured, it lay not ruſting in your Armourie, while the fight laſted betweene your men and mine. And for ought I haue heard, they that brought it thus out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, haue receiued a payment beyond their expectation, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to their liking.</p>
                  <p>So they haue, anſwered king <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> thankes be giuen therefore to God, and the good helpe that you <hi>Amadis,</hi> and theſe other Knights brought mee, in ſo vrgent a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as I am ſure you haue heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. In good faith, ſaid king <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> I haue all my lifetime deſired, that my children might bee yours in peace and true amity. I hope, replied king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> that ſo they ſhall be before wee parte, and our kindneſſe neuer to faile, eſpecially on my behalfe. But ſeeing Prince <hi>Agraies</hi> not to be one among them: hee enquired expreſly for him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnderſtood his hatred towards him, and deſirous to reconcile him, and make him his friend, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it might be. Whereupon, king <hi>Perion</hi> made anſwere, that hee ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behinde, as a conduct to the reſt of the Armie which followed. I pray you Sir, ſaid king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> that hee may bee ſent for, becauſe I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, not to parte from this place, before I haue both ſeene and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him. My Lord anſwered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> then I my ſelfe will goe for him. It is well aduiſed (quoth king <hi>Liſuart)</hi> becauſe hee will doe more for you, then any other whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Amadis</hi> rode directly to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> whom hee met not farre off, and tolde him what you haue heard already: earneſtly entreating him, that, forgetting all diſcontentment, hee would goe with him, and giue king <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſo good lookes as could be. My Lord and Coſen, ſaid <hi>Agraies,</hi> you know, that my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or diſliking laſteth vpon your pleaſure, and I heartily deſire, that the ſuccour which you haue giuen him, of whom you ſpeake, may be better acknowledged, then all the better acknowledged, then all the former haue been. And further I aſſure you, I am content to requit
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7181:369"/>
all the wrongs done to you, mee, and many more, meerely offered in deſpite of you, and without any occaſion at all.</p>
                  <p>Then they rode on together to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who, ſo ſoone as he ſaw <hi>Agraies,</hi> left all the reſt, going to embrace him, ſaying. Coſen, doe you thinke, this embracing as dangerous to me, as that was which you gaue mee, on the day of our laſt being together? Before God Sir, replied <hi>Agraies,</hi> I hope to find this much better then the other, for I was neuer (to my knowledge) in the like danger. We will talke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſaid the King, at better leaſure. But now you ſee the king my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tarries for vs, let vs goe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to <hi>Lubania,</hi> where I will make you all the beſt entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I can. So they returnd to king <hi>Perion,</hi> and tooke the way towards the Citie.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Liſuart</hi> had receiued diuers wounds in his bodie, but the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions hauing ſeene them, gaue him hope of ſpeedy recouery: yet hee kept his bed ten daies together, beeing often viſited by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Lords of his owne country, as alſo the other: who, to delight him, had almoſt no other talke, but of the tricks and ſtratagems of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> by meanes whereof, hee compaſſed his purpoſes; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when hee carried the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana</hi> away priſoner, and (after-warde) King <hi>Perion, Amadis.,</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> by the ſubtiltie of <hi>Dinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi> alſo, in what ſorte hee eſcaped from <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Norandell,</hi> faining himſelfe to bee <hi>Branfiles,</hi> Coſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>germaine to <hi>Grumedan.</hi> But moſt of all, his proiect plotted (by the helpe of <hi>Arauigne)</hi> againſt them all: which ſurely had preuailed, but that <hi>Amadis</hi> was the onely hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>Such accidents, anſwered king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> doe often come to paſſe, by ſuch wicked wretches as hee is, who dare endanger themſelues in doing euill, and therein make their moſt delight: finding the entrance ſweete and eaſie, onely by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Diuell, who depriues them of all apprehenſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what diſhonour may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to them, beſide miſery of life, which makes death much more welcome to them, then life can be. As <hi>Arauigue</hi> himſelfe hath now ſome cauſe to confeſſe, being in the power of his chiefeſt enemies: and may well ſerue as an example to all other, that are to be taxed with the like vice.</p>
                  <p>As hee ended theſe wordes, the good olde Hermite <hi>Naſcian,</hi> came to them, who had ſoftly followed after king <hi>Perion,</hi> and finding the Princes in ſuch peaceable quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: praiſed God for it, and the good aduice of young <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> cauſing <hi>Amadis</hi> to depart ſo ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, when hee came to the reſcue of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> as king <hi>Perion</hi> made knowen before them all. In troth, ſaide king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> I would gladly know, who gaue the youth ſo good counſell. Sir, replied <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> my father <hi>Naſcian</hi> ſent mee to you, to tell you, what hee had conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with king <hi>Perion:</hi> but I could not finde you in the Campe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Sergill</hi> &amp; I, paſſing on further, diſcouered the Armie of king <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigne,</hi> as they deſcended downe the mountaine. Then I called to mind, what I heard the Queene my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe ſay, at my parting from her, that hee was your enemy, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what afterwards happened to you, I made haſte to aduertiſe Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> to the end hee might giue you ſuccour, as he did. Before God ſweet youth (ſaide king <hi>Liſuart)</hi> I

ſhall not (while I liue) forgette ſo great a bleſſing happening to mee: And folding <hi>Eſplandian</hi> in his arms, ſweetly kiſſed him on the cheeke.</p>
                  <p>At that time, king <hi>Gaſquilan</hi> was brought thither, in a Litter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſoftly followed, as beeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſit on horſebacke, by reaſon of the ſhrewd fall hee had, when he would needes trie his manhood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Amadis,</hi> on the firſt day when the two battailes met. Into a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued chamber hee was conducted, by ſome of the chiefe in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, eſpecially <hi>Amadis,</hi> who came &amp; ſaluted him, ſaying. Sir, I would gladly ſee you in farre better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, than now you are: but by the grace of heauen, your health may bee as ſoone reſtored, as your harme happened. <hi>Gaſquilan</hi> than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him with all his heart, yet did not know him, becauſe hee had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſeen him vnarmed: which king <hi>Arban</hi> obſeruing, ſaid. Sir, I think you knowe not the Knight that tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with you, yet you haue often heretofore heard of him: this is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis de Gaule,</hi> againſt whom (ſome few dayes ſince) you made your proofe.</p>
                  <p>Much amazed was <hi>Gaſquilan,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his countenance (as hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined) more meete to court faire Ladies, then to endure the harde toyles of knighthood: and if hee had not made the triall which hee did, hee ſhould hardly haue giuen credit to the renowne euery where noyſed of him, whereupon he thus replied. I ſweare to you, Lord <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> vpon my faith, that you are the Knight I haue moſt deſired to ſee, ſince I began to beare Armes, not for any good will I bare you: but to fight with you, euen to the death, if this miſhap had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen mee, as now it is too well knowne. For, if fortune had ſo much fauoured me, as to haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mee, what you haue gotten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me: beſide the glory, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the only moſt happy knight in the world, I ſhould haue wonne the loue of one, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I affect much better then my ſelfe, and by whoſe command, I came twice to ſee you in this countrie, with ſuch miſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture, as I haue cauſe to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all the dayes of my life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue loſt (by you) all hope of euer enioying her. Sir, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> your honour had beene but ſlenderly augmented, by ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming mee, after ſuch plenty of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie actions, by you performed. And as for her, whom you hold as loſt through mine occaſion, if ſhe be a woman of good iudgement, as doubtleſſe ſhee is: it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but ſhe muſt needs loue you anſwerable to your merit, and as one of the beſt Knights this day b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Theſe gracious wordes, ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied King <hi>Gaſquilan,</hi> as hee extended foorth his armes to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him: and inſtantly they were made friends, <hi>Amadis</hi> keeping him daily company, ſo long as hee ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned in the Citie of <hi>Lubania,</hi> where <hi>Arquiſill</hi> alſo yeelded him-ſelfe priſoner, to fulfill the promiſe hee had formerly made.

                  <p>When <hi>Arquiſill</hi> heard theſe wordes, hee was moſt ioyfull: well knowing the conſpiracies of them of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make election of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherein they would very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed, without the fauour of Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> and therefore, hee ſaid.

And ſo much the rather, in ſeeking thus my further aduancement, which comming ſo to paſſe: you ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe both of it and me, as holding all of you onely, and none other.

                  <p>Proceeding on to further ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they entred into a lodging, where <hi>Gandalin</hi> had the charge of <hi>Archalaus</hi> and King <hi>Arauigne,</hi>

                     </gap>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them laid vpon a bedde, wondrous melancholie: wherefore <hi>Amadis</hi> demanded of them, whereon they thought? What art thou (quoth <hi>Archalaus)</hi> that wouldeſt know our thoughts? How? ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> doſt thou not knowe <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> whom thou haſt threatned ſo many times? I am hee that ſpeakes to thee. When <hi>Archalaus</hi> heard him, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to note him better than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and remembring that he had formerly ſeene him, thus anſwered. Beleeue mee, I thinke thou ſpeakeſt truth, and although length of time hath partly taken thee out of my knowledge: yet I am perſwaded, thou art the ſame man that I had in my priſon at <hi>Valderin,</hi> where thy youth &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexion could ſo much commande mee, that the pittie I then tooke on thee, hath brought me now into ſuch diſtreſſe, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines me to craue mercy of thee. Mercy? ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> I knowe not how thou canſt expect that from mee, conſidering thou couldſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſtowe it on thy ſelfe: for, if ſuch had beene thy power, long agoe thou wouldſt haue ended a world of cruelties, that haue beene thy continuall exerciſe. Neuertheleſſe, if thou couldeſt repent, and (with an honeſt ſoule) promiſe me neuer to vſe the like againe; I could find in mine heart to pardon thee.</p>
                  <p>Truſt mee, anſwered <hi>Archalaus,</hi> it is a worke very hard for me to do, almoſt impoſible, for there I knew continually how to conquer, and euermore tooke ſuch delight in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill; as now I cannot eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict my ſelfe to goodneſſe. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, which is a bridle ſharp and rigorous, to metamorphoſe all bad cuſtomes into vertue: happily will conſtraine my older yeares (ſeeing the eſtate wherein I am) to follow thoſe courſes, which my youth &amp; liberty then diſd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

All my Caſtles (quoth hee) and other goods, by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I purſued a great part of thoſe vices, for which thou iuſtly doeſt reprooue me.

to free thy ſoule from thy bodies thraldome, hauing ſo long a time engaged them both to the Diuell.</p>
                  <p>So hee turned his face, to goe from him: but <hi>Archalaus</hi> called him againe, and pointing to <hi>Arauigne,</hi> ſaid. I pray thee <hi>Amadis,</hi> looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon this wretched King, who (not long ſince) was neere hand to bee one of the greateſt Princes in the world: but in a moment, the ſame fortune which (befoore) ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable lookes, hath beaten him downe, and wholly wrought his ruine. An obſeruation not vnmeet for thee, for thou, and all other, that aſpire vnto the higheſt degree of happineſſe, art ſubiect to the like disfauours. And becauſe to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh and pardon, are moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to noble and magnanimous mindes: beſtowe on vs now ſuch entertainement, as thou wouldeſt wiſh to receiue from vs, wee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the place, as now thou doeſt, and from which thou canſt not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies warrant thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>More account did <hi>Amadis</hi> make of theſe good words, than of him that ſpake them, and well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the end whereat hee aimed, although hee would make no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſhew thereof: but, without any further conteſtation, left him, departing thence to his owne lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, to diſpatch <hi>Ardan</hi> the dwarffe to <hi>Oriana,</hi> that ſhee might knowe the warres finiſhing, as alſo what-ſoeuer had paſſed between the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Lords in the two Camps.

So departed the Dwarffe, who trauailed day and night, vntill he ariued at the Pallace of <hi>Apolidon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee preſently ſent worde to the Princeſſe, byone of her wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that hee would ſpeake with her from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis.</hi> Shee no ſooner heard of his ariuall, but fearing ſome vnhappy fortune; became ſo afflicted in mind, that ſhe trembled exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: knowing, that victory could not fauour either of the Campes, but it would procure ſorrow and griefe to her all her lifetime. Then <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> entred her chamber, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declared by his looks, that ſhe had no cauſe of ſadneſſe, or melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Neuertheleſſe, ſo ſoone as ſhe ſaw him (not hauing ſo much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, as to let him deliuer his meſſage) with teares in her eyes, ſhe ſaid vnto him.

                  <p>Then he reported to her, all that which you haue heard already, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, in what great danger King <hi>Liſuart</hi> was, when <hi>Amadis</hi> came with his happy ſuccour.

O moſt mercifull God, bleſſed for euer be thy diuine bounty, ſhouring downe thus thy pitie vpon thy poore ſeruant, and that happy childe, who hath beene the occaſion of this great goodnes. Oh, let thy mercy yet further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that all thoſe eſpeciall predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the wiſe <hi>Vrganda</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of him, may not faile in him.

                  <p>Afterward, ſhee demaunded of <hi>Ardan,</hi> if he came thither about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other buſineſſe.

And although hee was greatly perplexed in minde, ſeeing his reputation much impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by thoſe disfouours receiued from fortune, notwithſtanding the agreement hee had made with <hi>Amadis:</hi> yet neuertheleſſe (like a wiſe and iudicious Prince) hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his griefe, ſhewing much
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7181:372"/>
better outwarde carriage, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe willingly hee would haue done. And his owne knowledge was no meane incitation thereto, by hourely preſſing his conſcience, with a ſenſible apprehenſion, that hee had beene the onely cauſe, of ſhedding (ouer-prodigally) ſo much Chriſtian blood: vnder an vniuſt colour of reuenge, which he preferred before all counſell and aduice, giuen him by the Princes and Lords of his Land, wherewith our Lord being iuſtly offended, had ſcourg'd him with there rods, not to make him murmur or gruge againſt him, but rather to thank him, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting no heauier vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on him</p>
                  <p>In meditation of theſe matters, hee went to the Queenes lodgings, and ſhe being before aduertiſed by <hi>Brandoynas,</hi> of all that had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his voyage; welcommed him moſt graciouſly, and looking vpon young <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed next to the King: folding him in her armes, &amp; ſweetly kiſſing him, thus ſhe ſpake. My worthie ſonne, bleſſed bee the houre of thy birth, hauing (in thy young dayes) done ſuch ſeruice to the King: as, but by thy good aduiſe (as I haue vnderſtood) he had neuer ſeene his owne kingdome any more. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, anſwered the King, I hope, ſeeing hee hath begun ſo well: not any one houre ſhall paſſe him, but will encreaſe in him both will and power, of proceeding on better &amp; better. For I aſſure you, that beſide the right of nature, which iuſtly incites mee to wiſh him well: no day can paſſe ouer my head, but I muſt needs confeſſe a perticuliar af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him, for the great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe I enioy by him.</p>
                  <p>While thus the King and Queen conferred together, concerning <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plandian,</hi> the other Princes and Lords were kindely entertained by the Ladies &amp; Gentlewomen: who beeing curious in inquiry, how the fights had beene performed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Kings people, and them belonging to <hi>Amadis,</hi> were a long while without any other language. But when they heard of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed marriages, &amp; that they muſt likewiſe goe to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle:</hi> this raiſed much more pleaſure in them, then the recitall of colde feares and Alarums, whereon they wholly conferred before. For now, one made full account, to try the <hi>Arch</hi> of loyall louers; others the <hi>Defended</hi> chamber, and the other ſingularities in the <hi>Iſle,</hi> and in theſe delightes they ſpent the whole day.</p>
                  <p>But the houre of reſt beeing come, the King withdrew into the Queenes chamber, where being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by themſelues, hee began in this maner. Madame, if you found your ſelfe much amazed, when you heard the matters concerning your daughter and <hi>Amadis:</hi> beleeue no leſſe of me, when I heard the firſt newes thereof. And by that which I knew afterwarde, both you and I were farre off from our reckonning. For, perſwade your ſelfe, it is no little diſturbance to my minde, that I could not know theſe things, before the ſcandall was diſcouered, and nothing euer touched mee ſo nearely, eſpecially, the loſſe of ſo many worthie Knights, who had now beene liuing, and periſhed in theſe vnhappy wars, which breeds in me ſuch remorſe of conſcience, as you, or any other, will hardly credit: but matters already paſt, are ouer-late to bee remedied. Wherefore, I purpoſe now, that what yet remaineth to be done, ſhall bee performed with our very vttermoſt honour. Forgetting the offence of our daughter, who made choyce
<pb facs="tcp:7181:373" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a husband at her owne pleaſure: yet one that well deſerues her, &amp; a better. For I neuer ſaw any Knight errant, that could winne himſelfe ſo many friends, or haue ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Kings, Princes, and potent Lords at his comande: whereby it plainely appeareth, that Fortune is dipoſed to preferre him, before any other.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe at my parting from <hi>Lubania,</hi> I promiſed, to bring you with mee to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> there to conſummate the mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her and him: I pray you giue order for all things, which you thinke requiſite in ſuch caſes. Alſo, for the conduct thither of your daughter <hi>Leonora,</hi> whom (vpon his owne requeſt) I haue giuen as wife to the new Emperour. Very ioyfull was the Queene, to ſee the King ſo well diſpoſed: eſpecially towardes her daughter <hi>Oriana,</hi> which was the thing ſhee moſt deſired. In regard whereof, and to maintaine him in this good minde, ſhe ſaide.

Let me intreate you my Lord, to yeeld her ſome reaſon, how and from whence your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enſueth: and ſo hee left them together. <hi>Graſandor</hi> finding oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to fauour him, and that now he might freely vtter his minde to her: between hope and feare, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and conſtraint, thus hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
                  <p>Madame, it ſeemes to mee, that Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> findes the ſame paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in mee, as him ſelfe ſuffered, when loue allured him (at the firſt) to like Madame <hi>Oriana.</hi> And to ſpeake no more then truth, when I thinke to impart my oppreſſions to you, the three principall organes of my life, are in moſt ſtrange and vnuſuall diſtemper: namely, mine eyes, my heart, and my tongue. For ſo ſoone as mine eyes can but ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e a ſight of you: they incite ſpeech, onely to tell you the cauſe of my griefe; but all in vaine. Then my tongue, hoping to ſupply that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: openeth my mouth, but feare preuailing, quickly cloſeth it vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. If then my heart be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy martyrdome, I leaue to your owne iudgement, ſpeaking (as it doth) by continuall fighing. And finding it ſelfe vn-furniſhed of all helping meanes: checks mine eyes, for bringing home the firſt tydings of your bright beauty. Then they, in excuſing their errour: promiſe to performe the tongues office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is dumbe in your preſence, and by outward appearance (ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelfe pitifull) would begge of you mercy and remedy.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Graſandor</hi> continued theſe complaints, <hi>Amadis</hi> (not knowing how he ſhould raiſe the ſiege, the Emperor ſtill talking with <hi>Oriana:)</hi> ſaw Queene <hi>Briolania</hi> enter the chamber, whom hee going to kiſſe, called the Emperour, ſaying. My Lord, you haue not yet ſeen all the beauties in this goodly beauty, as here Queene <hi>Briolania</hi> may teſtifie to you. Before God (quoth hee) you ſay very true. So leauing <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> to ſalute the Queene: ſhe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo faire in his eye, and her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour ſo gracious, that hee vſed theſe wordes to her. I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Madame, that <hi>Apolidon,</hi> in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſingularities of this place, left them in ſuch rich perfection, only for the honour of excelling Ladies. For I can repute them no other then immortall, and make men tractable, to abide (heere all their life time) among ſuch rauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beauties.</p>
                  <p>Now did <hi>Amadis</hi> ſteppe into the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7181:374"/>
Emperours place, ſo ſoone as hee was gone from <hi>Oriana,</hi> feigning to doe him a great fauour, in helping him to conferre with Queene <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olania.</hi> But he had a quite contrary meaning, and did it to no other end, but that the reſt of his friends ſhould talke with their Ladies, while hee might be alone with her whom hee moſt deſired. For hee had not conuerſed familiarly with the Princeſſe, ſince her ariuall in the <hi>Encloſed Iſle:</hi> wherefore, finding time and place ſufficiently commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, he beganne with her in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Madame, I haue thought all my life time hitherto, that no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity remained in mee for acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of thoſe great and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fauours, which (ſo long a while) I haue receiued by your meanes only. And laſt of all, in being the cauſe that aged <hi>Naſcian</hi> reuealed to the King your father, what right wee had each in other: whereby your ſonne and mine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came knowen to him, and peace confirmed, between them of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and vs. As for my ſelfe, I ſhall ſtand much more obliged to you now, then euer heretofore: And therefore, aduiſedly conſider what elſe remaineth for me to doe, for I aſſure you, I ſhall take no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle delight, in doing whatſoeuer you commande me.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Oriana</hi> heard him deliuer ſuch ſpeeches, hauing before her eyes, what dutie euery woman of honour and diſcretion, oweth to her husband; ſhee thus anſwered. My Lord, in my poore opinion, you doe both your ſelfe and me wrong, and therefore I pray you, ſpeake to me henceforward, as to your hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble wife &amp; ſeruant: and not after thoſe kind of phraſes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was no other then your friend. Furthermore, let mee humbly entreat you to tell me, in what condition you left the King my father, and how I am now eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of him? Madame, ſaid <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> if outward lookes may be true euidences, I neuer ſaw man declare more contentment, then he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red when we were together. Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it I coniecture (conſidering his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitable danger in our laſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he hoped to recouer you from vs by meer force) his thoughts are otherwiſe quite different. Yet hee diſſembles it ſo wiſely as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly can bee, euen to hurle ſhame vpon himſelfe, and excuſing what hath paſt betweene you and mee: fully reſolued (as hee ſaith) to bee more cheerefully diſpoſed, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hitherto he hath been. Where-upon hee is returned backe to <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diliſore,</hi> to fetch the Queene and your ſiſter <hi>Leonora,</hi> whom he hath promiſed in marriage to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oriana</hi> was not a little glad of theſe newes, ſaying. My Lord, theſe are matters of no meane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, eſpecially, that I haue reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered my fathers grace againe: for, next to you, I loue him aboue any man liuing, notwithſtanding, all the hard ſufferings (as well you know) hee hath put me to. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I pray you tell mee, what is your opinion of <hi>Eſplandian?</hi> By my faath Madame, quoth hee, by his carriage and behauiour, he plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares himſelfe to bee yours: And if good <hi>Naſcian</hi> could haue preuailed, hee had brought him hither to you. But the King would needs haue him goe with him, to pleaſe the Queene, becauſe ſhee knowes him not yet to bee her Grand-childe.</p>
                  <p>So, breaking off this diſcourſe, King <hi>Perion,</hi> who had all this while entertained <hi>Graſinda</hi> with talke:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7181:374"/>
tooke leaue of her and the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, becauſe it drew neare ſupper time. Wherefore, withdrawing thence into his owne lodging, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> followed him: &amp; there, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth at a windowe, till the tables were furniſhed, hee thus ſpake. Seeing ſonne it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, that you haue ended all troubles, with ſo great honour: let the whole glory be aſcribed to him, and while you liue, acknowledge thankfulneſſe to your friends, who to help you in ſo ſerious a buſineſs, haue made no ſpare of their liues and goods, which bindes you the more to loue and honour them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pencing their kindneſſe ſo much as in you lieth. Conſidering, that without their aſſiſtance, it is moſt certaine, you had beene in great danger, not only of your liues loſſe, but alſo of your honour, which I account a thouſand times dearer. And becauſe it is no more then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that, like as they haue beene pertakers of all paines and perils, ſo they ought to be of pleaſure and contentment, which you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by their meanes: let it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be no meane part of your care, to reſpect them in eſpecial manner, by diſtributing ſuch booty among them, as is in your hands, the Kings <hi>Aranigne, Barſinan,</hi> &amp; others being your priſoners.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, ſuch as you knowe affected to thoſe Ladies, which keepe companie with the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana:</hi> let them haue equal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tment with your ſelfe, by eſpouſing them, to whom their fancies are enclined. For which cauſe, I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into your power, your ſiſter <hi>Melitia,</hi> to giue her to him whom you thinke worthieſt of her. You haue likewiſe your Coſen <hi>Mabila,</hi> and the Queen <hi>Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Aſſuring you, that the greateſt comfort I can haue in mine aged yeares, is, to ſee your brethren <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan</hi> married, that before I depart this life, I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in iſſue from you all. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider hereof I pray you aduiſedly; &amp; further what I haue ſaid, to your vttermoſt power. My Lord anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amadis,</hi> I will doe all that lies in me, to pleaſe both you &amp; them. It is enough, quoth the King. And ſo all things beeing aptly ordered, they ſate downe to ſupper.</p>
                  <p>In the morning, a ſudden ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was ſent to all the chiefe Knights, for an immediate meeting: and when they were aſſembled, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> entred into theſe ſpeeches. Honourable Gentlemen &amp; friends, the great and labourious trauaile, which you haue endured in theſe late warres: doth very well deſerue, that now you ſhould giue eaſe and reſpite to your ſpirits, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the deare debt, wherein I ſtand engaged to you, to eſſay my vttermoſt meanes, to let you enioy thoſe beatitudes, which (I know) are pleaſing to euery man among you. For, as by your moſt gracious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, afforded in my very nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt extreamity, I haue attained to that, which I eſteemed aboue all things elſe in the world, namely, the peaceable enioying of my long loued <hi>Oriana:</hi> Euen ſo, I beſeech you (with all my heart) that each man would inſtantly declare, if hee ſtand affected to any Ladie or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman heere, for I aſſure you, on the faith of a Knight, to preuaile ſo farre as I can with them, that they ſhall not eaſily deny, what I
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7181:375"/>
entreat on their friends behalfe.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, you know that king <hi>Aranigne, Barſidan,</hi> and many other beſide, are our priſoners, defying thoſe gracefull vertues, whereto the order of knighthood truely tyed them, and exerciſing (ſo much as in them lay) all cruelties and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. In regarde whereof, they are not worthie of any ranſome, but iuſtly puniſhable, for the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſneſſe of their treaſons: and therefore I thinke it fit, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould be vſed, for diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their eſtates &amp; goods among<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>you. As for my ſelfe, I deny any part or portion belonging to mee, holding my ſelfe ſufficiently ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if I can compaſſe any means, of doing you any perticular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>When they that were not mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected to their Ladies, heard him vſe theſe wordes, and knewe what power he had to forward them that way: you may well imagine, that they did not lende any deaffe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>are to ſuch a pleaſing motion, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, <hi>Agraies,</hi> who earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him, to giue his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable furtherance, for his marriage with the faire <hi>Olinda, Bruneo</hi> with <hi>Melicia, Graſandor</hi> with <hi>Mabila,</hi> and <hi>Quedragant,</hi> who neuer loued till then, declared his affection to <hi>Graſinda,</hi> ſaying. I now ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtand, that youth and time haue (heretofore) been contrary to my quiet, hauing then no other care, but for the managing of my Horſe and Armes: but at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, yeares and reaſon conſtraines mee to another kinde of condition, ſo that if it like Madame <hi>Graſinda,</hi> to accept me as her husband, I ſhal account my happineſſe equall to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans, of what condition ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be.</p>
                  <p>Before God, ſaid <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> I was once determined, to returne into <hi>Aliemaine,</hi> ſo ſoon as the buſineſſe concerning my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> was ended, as well to ſee my mother, as many other mine endeared friends. Neuertheleſſe, I know not with what eie I obſerued the Queen <hi>Sardamira,</hi> but this I am well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if I could compaſſe the meanes to marrie her; I ſhould ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily forget mine intended voyage, and all things elſe whatſoeuer. But others, more free from loues impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſubiection, hauing their mindes wholly addicted to follow Armes: ſpake in a quite contrary language, deſiring <hi>Amadis,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them in the conqueſt of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uignes</hi> kingdome, the countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Barſinan,</hi> or any where elſe. And we requeſt (quoth they) no other part of booty, but the means of winning renowne, honour and Chiualrie.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, <hi>Amadis</hi> returned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anſwere. Seeing you are of this diſpoſition: with the good liking of the company, I will make a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diuiſion. On <hi>Quedragant,</hi> I beſtowe the countrie of <hi>Sanſuega,</hi> for his larger portion in marrying with <hi>Graſinda.</hi> To you <hi>Bruneo,</hi> I giue the kingdom of <hi>Arauigne,</hi> with my ſiſter <hi>Melicia.</hi> And as for my brother <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> I will worke ſo with the Emperour: that hee ſhall giue him the countrie of <hi>Calabria,</hi> with the Queen <hi>Sardamira,</hi> whom hee ſo dearely affecteth. As for my Lord <hi>Agraies,</hi> and <hi>Graſandor,</hi> they are (thankes bee to God) rich and mighty enough, by means of their fathers, &amp; will content themſelues (as I thinke) to enioy thoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that affect them. What elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, ſhall be diſtributed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, according to the merit of euery man, ſo ſoon as King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſhall be heere ariued. Which they

all liked well, and ſo we leaue them returning to their lodgings: atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the time, when they ſhould goe and conuerſe with their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, according to their wonted cuſtome.</p>

                     <p>How <hi>Bruneo de bonno Mer</hi> and <hi>Branfill,</hi> were appointed to iourney into <hi>Gaule,</hi> to fetch the Queene <hi>Elyſena</hi> and <hi>Galaor,</hi> and of thoſe aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that happened to them in their returning back againe.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome fewe dayes after that K. <hi>Perion,</hi> and the other Knights were come to the <hi>encloſed Iſle; Agraies, Brunco,</hi> and they that had hope of ſpeedie marriage, fearing leaſt the abſence of the Queene <hi>Elyſena</hi> and <hi>Galaor,</hi> might cauſe a further deferring of that long deſired day: Came and humbly requeſted King <hi>Perion,</hi> that he would ſend for them, whereto he preſently yeelded. Whereupon <hi>Bruneo</hi> made firſt tender of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, ſaying. Sir, I humbly intreate you, that none other then my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and I may haue this charge, for otherwiſe you ſhall doe vs wrong. Well then anſwered the King, ſmyling to himſelfe, if I ſhould graunt your owne requeſt: I am perſwaded, you would more gladly keepe company with <hi>Melicia,</hi> then vndertake ſo long a iourney from her. In good faith Sir, replied <hi>Bruneo.</hi> to be alwayes neere her, is the only happineſſe I can deſire: notwithſtanding, I am willing to goe for the Queene, and <hi>Galaor</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my earneſt affection to doe them ſeruice. By my faith, ſaid <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griote,</hi> you muſt not performe this voyage, without my companie. Why then (quoth the King) goe you all three, and heauen grant, that you may finde my ſonne in better eſtate, then when I left him. Sir, anſwered <hi>Yſanio,</hi> ſome few daies ſince, certaine Merchants comming from <hi>Gaule,</hi> gaue mee credible aſſurance that hee was well recouered, becauſe they had ſeene him; complayning only that his countenance was (as yet) pale and Wan, by reaſon of his long ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe newes were highly pleaſing to the King, and all the companie, in regard whereof, <hi>Bruneo,</hi> and his two other friends, tooke ſhipping the next morning, and ſayled with ſuch proſperous Windes: that in few dayes after, they landed where the Queene then lay, of whom they were moſt gratiouſly entertayned, eſpecially by <hi>Galaor,</hi> becauſe hee longed to heare tidings from his brother and other friends. And as hee embraced them, with the tears trickling downe his cheekes, hee ſaid. By my faith, my good Lords, misfortune hath ſo long kept mee companie, that, conſidering what iniurie ſhe hath done mee (in with-holding me all this while from you and the exerciſe of Armes) it hath beene (well neere) a Thouſand deaths to me. My Lord quoth <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi> wee haue brought you ſuch newes, as will make a ſufficient ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, for all the anguiſh you haue endured.</p>
                  <p>So, hee declared before the Queene, the encounter, and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes betweene the Kings, <hi>Perion,</hi> and <hi>Liſuart,</hi> what great dangers
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7181:376"/>
and perils they were in, by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den onſet of King <hi>Arauigne</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalaus:</hi> And laſt of all, the league of loue and amity, combined on both ſides, and the ſeuerall marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages conſulted and agreed vpon. hereat <hi>Galaor</hi> was ſomewhat ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, hauing neuer heard any thing of ſuch attempts, and anſwered <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> thus. Is it poſſible, that my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord king <hi>Liſuart</hi> ſhould be in ſuch extreamity, and I not neare him? Vpon my ſoule, I muſt now confeſſe, that Fortune loued mee much better then euer ſhe did: For had I not beene ſicke, whatſoeuer dutie I owe to the King my father, I ſhould haue made no ſpare of my life, to ſuccor the other. Yet it had fallen out worſe for mee, if in the time of my ſickneſſe, I had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any certaine tydings of this matter: vndoubtedly it had beene my death, to faile him in a neceſſity ſo vrgent. It is much better ſaide <hi>Bruneo,</hi> that all things are paſt in ſo good order.</p>
                  <p>Then taking him by the hand, thus he proceeded. I receiued charge from my Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> to doe his re-commendations to you, and to deſire you, that you would cheere vp and recreate your ſpirits, in the beſt manner you can deuiſe: for he is minded (if you thinke it ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient) to haue you ioyned in marriage with Queen <hi>Briolania,</hi> ſo ſoone as you ſhall be ariued there. And wee were expreſſely ſent from king <hi>Perion,</hi> to conduct the Queen to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> where he atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her comming, with a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly traine of Knights, Ladies and Gentlewomen. Son (quoth ſhe to <hi>Galaor)</hi> we will part hence this next enſuing weeke, in the meane while, take order for ſhipping, and all things needefull for our voyage. And therefore preſently ſent for ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who hauing vnderſtood his pleaſure, made immediate proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of the very beſt Ship the King had, and went aboarde the ſixt day following.</p>
                  <p>Not farre had they ſailed from the coaſt of <hi>Gaule,</hi> but they deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a veſſell on the Sea, well fitted with the winde, and making nimble ſpeed, the Pilot or Maſter ſtriking ſaile, ſo ſoone as hee eſpyed the Queenes ſhippe. Whereupon, the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> thinking them to be Courſaires, or Pirates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forthwith armed themſelues, and to vnderſtand the truth, ſent one of their Squires in a Squiffe towardes them, to demand of whence they were, and whither they intended. The Squire drawing neare vnto them, called out aloude vnto them, ſaying. Hoe, aboard there, they in the Shippe here not farre off from you, in kindneſſe ſent to knowe what you are, and whither you are bound? My friend, quoth a knight ſtanding on the Decke, there is a Ladie of honour in this veſſell, whoſe voyage tendeth to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Iſle.</hi> Beleeue mee Sir, replied the Squire, then ſhee hath met with company, if ſhe be ſo pleaſed: for they that ſent mee to you, are ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thither, and you may ſafely come aboard them. Which words being ended, he returned to them he came from.</p>
                  <p>In the meane ſpace, that knight that was aboue, went downe to the Ladie, and acquainted her with the Squires meſſage: by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhee ſent one in a Frigate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently away, to vnderſtand the truth, and whether (vpon the Squires words) ſhee might ſafely come to them, or no: and ſo went nearer to the Queenes Ship, where <hi>Angri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote</hi> being firſt of all ſeene, the other Knight ſpake thus vnto him. Sir,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7181:376"/>
a Squire of yours, (not long ſince) came to vs, to know what wee were and whither our trauaile intended. Wee gaue him anſwere, that wee were bound directly for the <hi>Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iſle,</hi> and thither (hee ſaid) was likewiſe your intention, now Sir, becauſe wee haue in charge, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſte of great eſteeme; we pray you giue vs ſome aſſurance of your companie. Knight, anſwered <hi>Angriote,</hi> if you pleaſe to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord of vs, the Ladie you talke of ſhall finde a Queene heere, who wil gladly welcome her into her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and giue her as gracious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, as ſhee can deſire to haue.

                  <p>So taking leaue, hee returned to the other veſſell, which preſently came and ioyned with the Queens.

                  <p>Madame, anſwered the Queen of <hi>Dacia,</hi> I remember, that certaine Knights (not long ſince) trauayling through our countrie, tolde the late king my husband, that <hi>Amadis</hi> had ſuccoured <hi>Oriana,</hi> daughter to King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> who was conſtrained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent to the Emperour of <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Amadis</hi> reſcued her from the <hi>Romaines,</hi> and conuayed her to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle</hi> (euen in deſpight of their vttermoſt mallice) where yet ſhee abideth well accompanied: which giues me hope, that ſeeing ſhee hath tried the rigour of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, ſhe will like wiſe take pitty on my iniuries, ſo that (by her meanes) I may finde mercy accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my expectation. By my faith Madame, ſaid <hi>Angriote,</hi> if the Queene bee ſo pleaſed, you ſhall paſſe hence no further: for I am readie to goe with you, and will make no ſpare of my perion, in your ſeruice. The like anſwered <hi>Bruneo</hi>

                  <p>Hereupon, they entred into the Queene of <hi>Daciaes</hi> Ship, and taking farewell of the reſt, commanded the Mariners to ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

When King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> ſawe <hi>Galaor</hi> in ſo good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the graue olde man was ſo wonderfully ioyfull, that (ſmiling) hee ſaid to him.

But <hi>Galaor,</hi> who was none of the hindemoſt, beholding the Queene <hi>Briolania:</hi> left all the reſt, and went to her, &amp; kiſſing her, ſhe bluſhed ſo ſweetly, that <hi>Amadis</hi> perceiuing it, ſaid.

                  <p>Oh my faire ſtarres, quoth ſhee, what friendly conducts haue you beene to mee? Neuer could I wiſh for better tidings, becauſe I haue heard you much eſteemed, by ſuch as haue ſpoken of you to my late king and husband, and how helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full you haue beene to <hi>Amadis,</hi> in behalfe of the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana:</hi> which encreaſeth my hope now better then euer, that I ſhall bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuenged on the traytor, who hath ſo highly wronged mee. Madam, ſaid <hi>Angriote,</hi> wee will doe for you what wee can, without ſpare of any thing in our power. Humbly did the queene returne thankes both to him and the reſt, and from that time forwarde, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelfe more ſprightly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then before ſhe had done. And within ſome ſhort while after, they diſcouered the coaſt of <hi>Dacia,</hi> where as they purpoſed, ſo they tooke landing.</p>
                  <p>Now did <hi>Angriote</hi> thinke it moſt conuenient, that the queene ſhould keepe ſtill aboord the ſhip, vntill they perceiued how the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres proceeded, and that they (being guided by the two knights which attended on the queene) ſhould ride directly to the beſieged Citie, where gayning meanes of entrance, the two Princes might bee acquainted with their tidings. Hereupon, they committed her to heauens protection, and rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

keeping the moſt couert paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they could, till darke night ouer-tooke them, &amp; hoping to eſcape the watch, fell into the ambuſh of ten knights, fiue of which being ſlaine the other fiue fled to the Campe, to raiſe the Allarme.</p>
                  <p>In the interim time, <hi>Angriote</hi> and his conſorts ſtill rode on, euen vntill they came cloſe to the walles of the Citie: where the guides cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Sentinell, and being well knowne to the Watch, a Poſterne was ſuddenly opened for them, whereat they entred, and quicklie were conducted to the two Princes lodgings, Sonnes to the murdered king. They vnderſtanding the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their ariuall, and that the queene their mother, was returned in health and proſperous ſucceſſe: firſt gaue thankes to heauen, and then welcommed them in ſuch good manner, as their preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and diſtreſſe could affoord. Yet let me tell you, they came but to a very ſorry ſupper, for there was a great dearth of victualls in the Cittie, through the ſeuere beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the enemie, &amp; our knights were ſo hungrie (not hauing eaten any thing all that Day, that they needed no ſauce to whet on their apetite.

                  <p>All this while, the Duke and his Armie kept themſelues in forme of battaile, remaining quiet till the breake of Day: but then the other fiue knights of the watche, which had eſcaped from the reſt, brought ſuch dreadfull tidings, as they veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded themſelues, that ſome freſh ſuccour was comming to the Cittie. When it was faire day, each went to his charge, and the kings Sonnes, with the knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> called a counſell of the principall Captaines and commanders: Wherein was concluded, that one part of their people, ſhould bee ready to iſſue foorth the night following, at the changing of the Watch, as well to make an eſſay of ſudden ſurpriſing the enemie: as alſo, to get foorth (during the Allarm) the yonger of the two Princes, with <hi>Bruneo</hi> and a guide only, for conducting them to the neereſt neighbouring towns, and villages, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Hereupon, about the dead of night, <hi>Angriote</hi> and <hi>Branfill</hi> the chiefe vndertakers of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe) came to the place where they found their men ready to march.

For, ſo ſoone as each man had put a white croſſe vpon his breſt, to know one another in the horrid darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: they went out ſecretly at a falſe Port, marching on faire and ſoftly, without the leaſt noyſe, and ſeazing on the Scouts, ſlew them, before the watch could vnderſtand any thing.

By which happy meanes, they of the Cittie, (following their good fortune) ran in vpon the reſt, whom they found in their Tents

and Cabanes, and of them alſo they made ſuch a maſſacre; as the clamour came to the Dukes eares, and he preſently mounted on horſe-backe, with ſuch few followers as he could get to him.</p>
                  <p>Now was the Allarme, re-enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the noyſe of Drums and Trumpets ſo great, beſide the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry of the Souldiers, the impetuous murmur of the windes and raine: as the very boldeſt ſpirit became much daunted, becauſe there was neither Tent nor Pauillion, but they were all ouerthrowne, &amp; rampled in the mire.

                  <p>There lay the Knight ſhaking &amp; quaking, while <hi>Bruneo</hi> (diuerſe times) couruetted his horſe ouer him, euen as if hee meant to tread him in peeces: as indeede hee had done, but that he cryed out to him for mercy. Ariſe then, ſaid <hi>Bruneo,</hi> and ſee if thy companion be dead, or no.

Then looking about, hee ſawe that the young Prince &amp; his guide were fled: but they returned againe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fight of the victory, and being come to him, hee ſaid to the Kings ſonne. My Lord, heere I preſent you two priſoners, aduiſe with your ſelfe, whether I ſhall pardon them, or put them to death before your face, for more terrour to the reſt, that followe the treacherous Duke their Maſter. Sir Knight, replyed the Prince, they ſhould not pay pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for this offence, I pray you ſend them backe to the Campe, where, if they will become ours, I will cauſe them to be as well reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as lies in my power to doe.</p>
                  <p>This aduiſe was wel liked by <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi> and much did hee commend the wiſedome and good minde of the young Prince, wherfore, vpon receipt of their fidelity, they rode together to the Citie <hi>Aumenta,</hi> where they were no ſooner ariued, but the inhabitants knew both the guide, &amp; their young Lord. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, in a very ſmall time, all the people aſſembled about him, to kiſſe his hand, and offred him the very vttermoſt of their power: whereof <hi>Bruneo</hi> being very ioyfull, ſpake vnto them in this manner.</p>
                  <p>worthy Citizens, the loue which you haue ſhewen to this young Prince, your true and lawfull Lord, bindeth him to you in endeared af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſo long as hee ſhall liue: and the truſt which he repoſeth in you, ſhould binde you to loue and honour him. You ſee hee is but young, and hath ſmall meanes to expell the enemy out of your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and that enemie (as you all well knowe) murdered by treaſon, your late good and royall King. Since when, vſurping on the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hee hath beſieged the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Cittie, and keepeth his ſtrength (as yet) ſo near about it: that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your ayde, it is in danger of vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpoyle and ruine, with all the noble Citizens and good Knights abyding therein. Wherefore, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Lords and Citizens, now that occaſion ſo louingly offers herſelfe, by returne of the Queene your roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ali Miſtreſſe, who hath brought with her three Knights of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Iſle,</hi> whereof I am one: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude among your ſelues to reuenge ſuch iniuries as you haue receiued by the traytor, and doe ſo much, that your legittimate Lords may be re-ſeated in their rights. And this I dare aſſure you, if you will follow me: that I ſhall haue the meanes, to ſurpriſe both him and his Army, yea, vtterly to ouerthrowe them; only by the helpe of my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who are alreadie within the Cittie, and they will not faile to iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue foorth, ſo ſoone as I ſhall giue them the ſignall.</p>
                  <p>As thus hee continued on his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7181:380"/>
there ariued two peaſants, who came in great haſt from the camp to aduertiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this citie, for certaine: That the beſieged knights and Cittizens, had made a fallie forth (in the night) vpon the Watch, whom they had ſlaine, as alſo a great number more, before they could bee any way ſuccoured. Moreouer, that the Duke himſelfe was beaten downe from his horſe, taken, &amp; led away priſoner into the Cittie, by two ſtrange knights, as the report went. Hereof, ſaid theſe fellows, there neede no doubt to be made, becauſe we were in the camp when the Allarm was giuen, where we were conſtrayned to abide, by reaſon of the turbulent night, which hindered vs from ſelling our victualls. But wee were neuer in ſuch a feare, and not without great reaſon: conſidering that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were (and yet are) ſo mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrified, as they ranne away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly, ſtriuing who ſhall get him-ſelfe firſt fartheſt off. So helpe mee God, ſaid <hi>Bruneo,</hi> theſe are happy newes. Now beſtirre your ſelues, my friends, let vs forth-with part hence, and purſue them in the rere, that wee may the ſooner ſend them packing.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words euery man cryed, to Armes: but <hi>Bruneo</hi> (vpon better aduice) deferred this haſt vntill the euening, to the end they might come vpon them vnprouided: in the meane while they went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſome ſuſtentation, that they might the better march away in the night. His ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uice was geeerally allowed, and they all reſolued, to liue and die with him. Hereupon, the houre for their departing being come, they were all marſhalled in order, and each battalion, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, marching on in good order to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Campe: and about break of day, they came neere it within a quarter of a league. Then <hi>Bruneo</hi> by fiering of a Beacon, gaue a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to them of the Cittie, aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them thereby what hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But the Dukes watch percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, preſently ſent intelligence to their Captaines, who doubting ſome immediat danger, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the precedent night and great loſſe: cauſed their bagge, and baggage cloſely to bee truſſed vp, and rayſed their ſiedge ſo ſpeedily, as they were gone three leagues off, before any knowledg could be had of them, or where they were.</p>
                  <p>But, ſo ſoone as theſe newes came to <hi>Angriote</hi> and <hi>Bruneo,</hi> they and their people mounted on horſe-backe to follow them: finding them very conueniently, driuing all their luggage before them: then they beganne to skirmiſh each a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other, and although the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers kept themſelues behind with the greater part of the Horſe: yet were they ſo ſharpely charged by them of the Cittie, that they fell from their ranckes, and ranne into great diſorder. By meanes wherof very many loſt their liues, a great number were taken priſoners, and more had receiued much greater damage, but that they rallied them-ſelues together againe, and kept in a faſt combination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Angriote</hi> well obſeruing this, and calling to minde, that the purſuite of a deſperat enemie, cauſeth (often times) the loſſe of a battaile already wonne: commanded retreate to bee ſounded, and the rather, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe darke night approached. So, returning backe to the Cittie, each man betooke himſelfe to reſt till the next morning, concluding then, to goe viſit the Queene, who (as you haue already heard) remained ſtill aboard her Shippe, in expectation
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7181:380"/>
of tydings from the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> and of her ſonnes. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, they came thither to her, finding her ſo oppreſſed with melancholy, as no woman poſſibly could be more. But when ſhe ſaw them in ſo good diſpoſition, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding alſo the ſurpriſall of her enemie, and diſſipation (moſt rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous) of his Campe: her ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came extraordinarily ioyfull, as tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in the very higheſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe the world could yeeld her. And the Princes, her ſonnes, with the three Knights, came neare vnto her, to kiſſe her hand: which ſhee would not ſuffer, but embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them very graciouſly, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no meane thankfulneſſe for her happy fortune.</p>
                  <p>Afterwarde, they conuayed her into a rich Litter, purpoſely brought for her iourney, and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her to the Pallace in moſt royall manner: where ſhee was no ſooner alighted, but ſhe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Duke to be brought before her, as (accordingly it was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And albeit ſhee had reſolued with her thoughts, not to execute any reuenge vpon him, but (euen in meere pittie) to forget and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue all: yet conſidering what ſhamefull wrongs ſhe had ſuffered, and the murder of the King her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſo freſh in her ſoule; ſhee commanded him preſently to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the Knights of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Iſle</hi> were not therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and therefore, in moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and modeſt manner, tolde her: that they neuer tooke any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to mercy, to whom (after-warde) they vſed any moleſtation. Wherefore, they deſired her, to containe her purpoſe till their departure: and then, to doe what ſhee thought fitte, and as her Councell ſhould beſt aduiſe her, requiring alſo fauour for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
                  <p>Shee fearefull to offend ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable &amp; high deſeruing friends, returned this anſwere. Nay my Lords, thinke not, but I will doe whatſoeuer you commande mee: yet notwithſtanding, you muſt needes grant me, to ſtay heere with mee eight or tenne daies more. In which time, I hope to compaſſe the Coronation of my ſonne, and then to ſend him along with you to Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> if you will but honour me ſo much, as to bee his conuoy thither. Madame, quoth they, wee are all herewith heartily contented. Hereupon ſhe ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to one of the Maſters of the houſhold, giuing him charge, to ſee all things fitting in readineſſe, as were belonging to ſuch a ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and in him there wanted not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dilligence.</p>
                  <p>The day of triumph being come, the young King, accompanied with the Princes of his blood, the Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> &amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of noble Perſonages more: rode maieſtically to the Cathedrall Church, where they heard ſolemne and diuine ſeruice. Afterward, he was conducted to a goodly Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moſt magnificently adorned, and there by ſound of Trumpets, and voyce of the Heralds, he was openly proclaimed King: he throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much golde and ſiluer among the people, crying three ſeuerall times, Largeſſe, Largeſſe, Largeſſe, giuen by the moſt mighty and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Prince, <hi>Garinter,</hi> king of <hi>Dacia.</hi>

and nights together, the people ceaſed not, from making Bonfires, and other ſignes of ioyfull trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing. As alſo the Nobility of the Court, had Maskes, Tourneies, Dances, and ſuch like paſtimes: which had continued much longer, if <hi>Angriote</hi> and his companions would haue ſtayed there. But they earneſtly importuned the Queene, to licence their departure, which (much againſt her minde) ſhe was enforced to grant, and before their embarquing, thus ſhe ſpake to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Noble Gentlemen, although it is impoſſible for me, in any dutie to requite what you haue done for mee, without any merite at all on mine owne behalfe: yet is ſo falles out at this ſeaſon, that (running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a farther debt) I am to ſolicite you with a ſecond requeſt, and wherein, I deſire you, not to deny mee. You know very well, that I neuer ſawe Lord <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> for whoſe ſake you did partly (as I imagine) vndertake this long voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which hath fallen out moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to mee, and to your endleſſe honour for euer. Now, I haue not any thing more deare in eſteeme, then the new created King my ſon, who (as I haue already tolde you) I deſire to ſend to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> to liue among ſo many good knights as are there: vntill he come to yeares fit for knighthood, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that a nouell kind of breeding there, will highly aduantage him, and that then, Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> will deale ſo honourably with him, as to beſtow knighthood on him with his owne hand. Wherefore, once more I entreate you, to take him with you, and deliuer him to Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> as a preſent from me.</p>
                  <p>Madame, anſwered <hi>Bruneo,</hi> I faithfully promiſe you, that (with all my heart) I will performe it; and further I dare aſſure, that hee will be very welcome thither.

                  <p>Now was <hi>Eſplandian</hi> iuſt equall in age with the yong king of <hi>Dacia,</hi> and this very day grew in ſuch friendly acquaintance with him: as they made themſelues vowed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions together: neuer (thence forward) to ſunder companie. But more eſpecially, after they receiued the order of knight-hood, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their voyage to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where <hi>Eſplandian</hi> became amorous of the faire <hi>Leonerina,</hi> whoſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous companie hee enioyed, by the meanes of his companion <hi>Talan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> Sonne to <hi>Galaor,</hi> and <hi>Manely le Sage,</hi> Sonne to King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> whom they begot on the two Nie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to <hi>Vrganda</hi> the <hi>Vnknowen,</hi> in the time of their impriſonment: As our hiſtorie more amplie relateth

in the fift Booke, wherefore at this time we will ſpeake no more there-of, but returne to our firſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>After the ariuall of king <hi>Liſuart</hi> in this manner, the Lords, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, being walking together in the garden of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> viewing the rare and moſt artificiall pictures: they heard (without the pallace) a wonderfull noyſe and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of people, and therefore ſent immediatly to know the reaſon thereof. Newes came to them for certaine, that on the Sea there was a fire ſo dreadfull, as neuer had the like beene ſeene before, and it made directly towards the Port: where-upon, the knights ſent for their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, mounting on them preſently, and the Ladies vp into the higheſt Turrets, the better to behold this meruaile. All of them did viſiblie diſcerne on the Sea, a flaming Rock ſo impetiouſly driuen by the winds and waues, as if it were continually in danger of drowning. And that which moſt augmented their feare, was, a ſudden alteration of this fire, into the ſhape of a moſt horrible and hiddeous ſerpent, which in more then ſupernaturall manner, extended forth his wings ſo farre, as a very good Archer was not able to ſhoote.</p>
                  <p>If this gaue them iuſt cauſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, that which followed did no leſſe, for it came directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, with his head ſo highly exalted, as the head or ſcuttle of a Shippe-maſt, deliuering ſuch thick black ſmoake out at his noſthrills, as made the ſight of it to be loſt many times together: then ſuddenly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine was it heard to hiſſe and make a noyſe, as neuer could the like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueliſh terror be talked of: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people taking it to bee ſome diuine iudgement, and a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſent from heauen, for a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious affliction vpon them all, fled vp into the higheſt part of the Iſle: and the like did moſt part of the knights, though much againſt their mindes, becauſe their Horſes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at the horrid ſight of this monſter, beganne to ſnoare, and fling about, and foaming vpon the bits in their mouthes, ranne vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mountaines, their Maſters being vnable to ſtay them. Yet in the end, ſuch as preferred honour before loſſe of life, got themſelues diſmounted, returning back to the Sea ſhoare, to make reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this monſter, if it ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to come on land.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner were they returned thither but they ſaw the Serpent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance his wings, as if hee meant to flie away: and inſtantly from vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them launched foorth a ſmall Frigot, couered with cloath of Gold, hauing two dwarfes in it ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing with Oares, conducting a very beautifull Damoſell, and two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquires attending on her. Sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King <hi>Liſuart</hi> called to mind how terribly <hi>Vrganda</hi> affrighted him, when firſt ſhee came to him in the Cittie of <hi>Fenuſa,</hi> aſſuring them all that doubtleſſe this was ſhee and none other. Sir, anſwered <hi>Amadis</hi> I beganne to imagine as much, ſo ſoone as I diſcouered the Friggot: although (before) I knew not what to thinke, but was verily perſwaded, ſome Diuell was come to worke vs miſchiefe.</p>
                  <p>Scarſely had hee concluded theſe words, but <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſhewed her ſelfe to them all: whereupon, their former great feare, was conuerted into as exceeding ioy, and ſo much the rather, becauſe in her owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar ſhape ſhee came on Land, which ſeldome before ſhee vſed to doe. For at all other times, when
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7181:382"/>
ſhe would bee ſeene in any ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies: ſhee came in the likenes of an aged woman or Beldame, or as a childe, a beaſt, a bird, or any ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude beſt pleaſing to hir ſelfe. Then King <hi>Liſuart</hi> &amp; <hi>Amadis</hi> went on to welcome her, and ſo did the Emperour, whom ſhee had neuer ſeene before: Neuertheleſſe, ſhee ſhaped her courſe to him, before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the other, and ſpoke to him in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Sir, neuer in all my life time haue I beene in any place, that was honoured with your royall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, till now: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I know you ſo well, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to doe any gratefull ſeruice to you and your Empreſſe, as alwaies hath been my ſtudious inclination, and as your ſelues hereafter ſhall perceiue. For by my meanes, the firſt fruite proceeding from your generation, ſhall be preſerued from diuerſe dangers; wherefore I wiſh you to remember my words. And although my abyding is farre from the limittes of your Empire: yet can I (when pleaſeth mee) be with you in <hi>Rome,</hi> in leſſe ſpace then the compaſſe of a naturall day. Lady, ſaid the Emperour, farre be it from me, to refuſe your gracious kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, much leſſe, to miſpriſe your happy remembrance: Aſſuring you, I holde this for the greateſt good that can happen vnto mee, and I hope that you will keepe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with me. I will not faile anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Vrganda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then looking about, and ſeeing <hi>Amadis</hi> neare her, kiſſing him, ſhe ſaid. Although (my Lord) you haue beene ſo highly fauoured by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as to teach the height of your affectionate deſires: yet giue not too much credite to her wanton ſmyles. For, although you ſeeme to bee now aboue all ſtormie tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, beeing in the peacefull poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of your long loued <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom you preferre before al things elſe whatſoeuer: yet let me tell yee, you will finde more ſerious buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hereafter to bee performed, then (as yet) you haue gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough. Becauſe blame will more nearely choake you, by loſſe of the reputation wherein you now are; then if you had neuer attained ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. But as I haue beene alwayes yours in your paſſed fortunes, ſo credit me. I will continue in them that are to come. Madame, quoth hee, conſidering the manifolde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours I haue receiued from you, and what true ſignes of loue you haue alwaies ſhewen me: you may well perſwade your ſelf, that while any breath remaineth in this body, you haue intire power of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me, and that my deſires are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your obedience. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch trauailes, as are deſtined and ordained to me: you know my wonted patience to endure them, and my vndoubted hope in you, will enable mee with ſufficient ſtrength to withſtand all encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, beeing guided by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and good counſell.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Liſuart</hi> then came to her, ſaying. Madame, if you be ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, let vs goe on to the Pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> where the Ladies doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your comming: for they are already aduertiſed of your ariuall, and there we may much better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre together. With all my heart, quoth ſhee, and calling the two young Squires forth of the Frigate, placing the one on her right hand, and the other on her left, ſhe went on with the King and troupe: then calling <hi>Eſplandian</hi> to her, thus ſhee ſpake. I promiſe you (faire youth) I haue had better remembrance of you, then you can imagine: And
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7181:383"/>
beholde I haue brought hither theſe two Gentlemen, to keepe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with you, becauſe you will ſtand in much need of their helpe, when you ſhall bee in the greateſt heate of all your buſineſſe. Wherefore, hence forwarde, I pray you to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them, euen as deare as your ſefe.</p>
                  <p>Then, perceiuing the Ladies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to meet them, ſhee gaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer talking, to doe them reuerence: and as ſhee kiſſed each after other, comming to <hi>Oriana,</hi> ſhee ſpake out ſo loude as all might heare her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me Madame, neuer was I bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed, then being in ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie: for hardly can (elſewhere) be found ſuch ſtore of bright beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, enriched with all rarietie of choyce perfections. Madame, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Queene <hi>Briſena,</hi> no doubt but your words would be very true, if all here were ſuch as you ſpeake of. So taking her by the hand, ſhe conducted her into her chamber, where the Knights left them, that they might conuerſe more priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ragonis</hi> was not with <hi>Amadis,</hi> when he made partition of king <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uignes</hi> countries, and them belonging to the other priſoners: but followed a Damoſell, that guided him from the Monaſtarie of <hi>Lubania,</hi> to fight with <hi>Angriffort,</hi> Lord of the <hi>Deep Gulffe,</hi> who kept her father in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to compell him ſurrender vp a Caſtle, belonging to him. And the Combate was wonderfull between them, for <hi>Angriffort</hi> was the moſt hardy and valiant Knight, then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in all that countrie. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Dragonis</hi> had the victory, and made him promiſe, to meete him at the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> within twentie daies next enſuing, &amp; there to craue mercy of the Princeſſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Dragonis</hi> that we ſpeake of, was young, actiuely diſpoſed, and an excellent warriour: as hee well declared in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Mongoza,</hi> when King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> came thither to aſſault <hi>Galuanes.</hi> For the more part of his confederates beeing defeated and fled: he kept a narrow paſſage, with very few men, and performed there ſuch deedes of Chiualrie, as hee became famous thereby all his life time after.

I haue beene lately aduertiſed by a Squire, that ſince our parting for <hi>Lubania,</hi> the King of the <hi>Profounde Iſland</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grieuouſly wounded before) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Sea, ſome fewe dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſayling homeward from reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of his health. In which reſpect his kingdome ſhall become yours, and likewiſe you ſhall enioy in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage the beautifull <hi>Eſtoilletta,</hi> by you long time beloued: meerely as due deſert, ſhe being a faire, wiſe, and vertuous Princeſſe, deſcended from Kings by eyther ſide, and as deerely eſteemed by <hi>Oriana,</hi> as any that I know, mee thinkes that (for your own conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tment) no better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction can be made you: Then to enioy her whom you loue, and eſteeme as choyſely as your ſelfe.</p>

                     <hi>Dragonis</hi> being not a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to heare <hi>Amadis</hi> ſpeake in this manner: knew not (at the firſt) what anſwere to make.

Son and my beſt friend (quoth hee) I grant it with all my heart, what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it bee. Then I entreate you ſir ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> command Madam <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> your daughter, before wee ſit downe to dinner, to make proofe of the <hi>Arch</hi> of loyall Louers, as alſo of the <hi>Defended</hi> Chamber: Whereto ſhe would not (as yet) by any means liſten, by all entreaties made vnto her. Howbeit, I haue ſuch confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in her loyaltie, and likewiſe in her excelling beautie: that ſhee will obtaine the honor of the place, whereinto (for more then a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares) neyther Lady, or Gentlewoman could bee ſo happy as to enter. And hereof I doe ſo much the rather aſſure my ſelfe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing often times ſeene the ſtatue of <hi>Grimaneſa,</hi> which is portrayed in hir chiefe and moſt eminent perfection neuertheleſſe, I am verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhee neuer was equall to your daughter. And therefore by her meanes, wee may all enter this day into <hi>Apolidons</hi> Chamber, and there finiſh the ſolemnitie of this feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall.</p>
                  <p>Sonne anſwered King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> theſe are matters not appertaining to me, and it is to bee doubted, that ſuch an enterpriſe as this is, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome trouble or moleſtation, in ſo worthy an aſſembly as heere are met together. For we ſee many times, deſire to compaſſe a caſe of importance, may dimme both the eyes and vnderſtanding of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempter, and that in ſuch ſort, as he may miſtake one thing for another, and ſo runne riot from all courſe of reaſon, whereby he ſeemed (at firſt) to make his entrance. My Lord, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> I ſtill containe my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinion, and that the ſucceſſe, will be anſwerable to my deſire: free from all harme or offence, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the content of all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. Well, quoth the King, your will ſhall be fulfilled. So hee called <hi>Oriana,</hi> whom the kings <hi>Perion,</hi> and <hi>Cildadan</hi> (Bride-like) guyded by eyther hand, and thus hee ſpake to her. Daughter your husband hath requeſted a boone of mee, which I haue granted, although I greatly doubt, that very hardly (in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) it will bee accompliſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his hope; neuertheleſſe, you know that I haue alwayes kept my word, and therefore aduiſe your ſelfe, in doing that you ſhall bee enioyned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oriana</hi> being not a little ioyfull to heare the King her father ſpeake ſo familliarly; performing very
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7181:384"/>
great reuerence to him, thus reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. My gracious Lord and father, commande what you pleaſe, I am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to obey you. Then daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (quoth the King) before you ſit downe as a Bride at the table, you muſt eſſay the aduenture, of the <hi>Arch</hi> of loyall louers, and likewiſe that of the <hi>Defended Chamber;</hi> this is the boone I haue granted to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis.</hi> When theſe wordes wher heard by the other Ladies, a ſecret murmur ran ſuddenly among them; ſome for the loue they bare to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> fearing leaſt ſhee ſhould not finiſh ſo high an enterpriſe, and to her honour: others more addicted to ſelfe conceit, made promiſe to them of going beyond her. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, this ſtriuing had but a ſmall continuance, becauſe the King had a hand in the busineſſe, and he well knowing, that <hi>Olinda</hi> and <hi>Melicia,</hi> were deſirous to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie his daughter in her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; entreated them thereto very earneſtly.</p>
                  <p>But theire choyce friends, and new married husbands, were of a quite contrarie minde, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to alter them from this humor, fearing their falling into danger, of looſing that, which they were not able to winne themſelues: and therefore, they deſired no ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but were ſatisfied with enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their long expectation. By the faith I beare to God, ſaid the King, you can no way miſlike their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, but rather ſhould high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowe thereof: becauſe, for ought I can perceiue, they couet to make teſtimonie of their loyalty, by better meanes then you your ſelues are able to iudge of, and it is my minde, that they ſhall make their proofe, before my daughter <hi>Oriana</hi> do attempt it.</p>
                  <p>This pleaſed <hi>Amadis</hi> extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, knowing wel that they could not enter into the <hi>Defended Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> before her: and this disfauour to them, would be the higher aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of her honour. So <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia</hi> and <hi>Olinda,</hi> went on towardes the <hi>Arch</hi> of loyall louers, vnder which they paſſed without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment. Then the Brazen Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue began to ſound ſo melodiouſly, as euery one tooke great delight to heare it; but eſpecially <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Bruneo</hi> aboue all the reſt. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on further, the two ladies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Garden, where they beheld the Statues of <hi>Apolidon</hi> and <hi>Grimaneſa.</hi> As they were buſily loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on them, they eſpied <hi>Orania</hi> almoſt vnder the <hi>Arch,</hi> looking behinde her, if <hi>Amadis</hi> followed her: and inſtantly, ſuch an amiable bluſh mounted vppe into her face, that with her owne naturall pale complexion, made her appeare moſt ſweetly beautifull.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was ſhe iuſt vnder the vault of the Arch, but the Image ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, much more harmonious &amp; pleaſing, then euer before had been heard by any: caſting forth of his Trumpet, Gilliflowers, Pinkes, Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Colonbines, Pauuces, and a thouſand other kinde of flowers, the moſt oderiferous that euer were ſmelt. Then entring into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Melicia</hi> and <hi>Olinda</hi> called her, to ſhew her the figures of <hi>Apolidon</hi> and <hi>Grimaneſa:</hi> but ſhe was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die come to the Iaſper piller, where ſhee found all their names newly engrauen, but could not gheſſe how, or by what meanes. Herupon ſhe called them to ſee what ſhee had done, and thence they returned to the Images, which they found to be ſo ingeniouſly framed, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanted, but life it ſelfe, and ſpeech: eſpecially that of <hi>Grima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſa,</hi> which ſeemed ſo exceeding

faire, as <hi>Oriana</hi> grew diſtruſtfull, of her entrance into the <hi>Defended Chamber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this doubt had no long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, for ſhee going neare to the <hi>Venus</hi> made of Agate (only to take water of the fountaine) the Statua put forth her right hand, preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her the Apple, while, ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the moſt excellent pearle, hanging in her eare, ſhe made the like tender of it with the other hand. Now, albeit her two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions loued her very ſingularly, yet could they not preuaile ouer their owne paſſions: but (behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this extraordinary fauour) ſome ſecret ſparks of enuy took fire againſt her: yet ſhe beeing willing to leaue nothing vnperfected, went to the <hi>Dedalus,</hi> in the midſt where-of (as I haue alreadie tolde you) was the Coloſſus of Braſſe, holding the Lanterne, where the diuine fire was kept by the Serpents, who looking on <hi>Oriana,</hi> beganne faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly to moue their tailes, and bow downe their heads, in ſigne of humiliation.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinderance, ſhee paſſed on to the midſt of the Labirinth, &amp; there beheld (at her owne pleaſure) the theft of <hi>Prometheas,</hi> which in the preſence of the three Ladies, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed away, and neuer was after-warde ſeene by any one, nor the Serpents neither. Wherefore the Ladies returned backe againe, to the place where the Knights, and other of the company attended for them. If now their amorous friends were in the maine height of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; iudge you faire Ladies, that haue made proofe of loues ſweeteſt fauours. For mine owne parte. I would gladly make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that they all felt ſuch a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of happineſſe, as I could herti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh to my ſelfe. Now liſten what followeth, and (perhaps) you ſhall heare matters, no leſſe pleaſing and delightfull.</p>
                  <p>The Ladies hauing ended theſe aduentures, ás you haue lately heard, <hi>Graſinda,</hi> beeing much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that ſhee had not followed on with them: concluded in her ſelfe, to approue that of the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Chamber,</hi> before any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thereupon, comming to <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſpake thus. My Lord, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my beauty cannot ſatisfie mine owne deſire: yet it is not ſo diſtruſtfull of it ſelfe, but it dare eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay the aduenture of the ſtaires, or aſcending to the <hi>Defended Chamber.</hi> For if that be likewiſe ended, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome of my paines imploiment; all my life time (afterward) will be but irkeſome and tedious to mee. Therefore, let come what can or may, if I obtaine entrance, my minde will bee ſatisfied: but if I meete with repulſe, others haue had the like fortune before mee. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to me, that defect of beauty ſhould no way be your hinderance, much leſſe any want of good will: ſo that, if you like to beleeue mee, you may paſſe them before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who (by this meanes) may well be releeued by you, and ſpare their labor in attempting entrance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Graſinda</hi> imagining that <hi>Amadis</hi> ſpake as hee thought, deferred no further, but bleſſing herſelfe with the ſigne of the croſſe: went on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the firſt degree, which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſhee aſcended. But when ſhe came to that of Marble, ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed backe ſo rudely, that ſhee lay along vpon the ground, vnable to mooue either hand or foote. Which <hi>Quedragant</hi> beholding, ran to her, and lifted her vp gently in his armes: not without much pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7181:385"/>
her eſtate, albeit hee was well aſſured that his infirmitie would turne to nothing. Neuertheleſſe, ſuch was his deare affection to her, as hee moſt miſdoubted her owne danger by conceit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agraies,</hi> who all this while ſtood talking with <hi>Olinda,</hi> ſpake thus vnto her. Faire beautie, though madam <hi>Graſinda</hi> hath had ſuch ill ſucceſſe: yet you may reuenge her wrong, &amp; therefore neuer feare, but proceede on boldly. So, kiſſing her, he tooke her by the hand, and conducting her very neere to the ſteppe of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: ſhe paſſed it as eaſily as <hi>Graſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> had done before her. But as the one was beaten backe, weening to get ouer the marble ſtaire, ſo the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther found no better fortune, but was ſuddenly ſurpriſed by the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of her hayre, and throwne to the ground very diſgracefully. By meanes whereof, <hi>Melicia</hi> aduanced her ſelfe, and, euen as if her heart and feete had flown together, ſhee paſſed ouer the two formoſt ſtaires: whereby they which obſerued it, were verily perſwaded, that this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture was only dedicated to her, and to none other.</p>
                  <p>Now beganne <hi>Oriana</hi> to grow very ſuſpitious, which laſted but a little while: for very ſoone after, ſhe was worſe repulſed then any of the former, and ſo ſhaken, that <hi>Bruneo,</hi> thinking her verely to be dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to greeue very extremely. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, they that were well acquainted with the ſight of ſuch accidents, did nothing elſe but laugh: knowing for a certaine, that theſe feares were but ſignes of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance. There remayned now no more of the foure Ladies, to gaine (by proofe) the ſupremacy of beautie, for entrance into the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Chamber,</hi> but only <hi>Oriana:</hi> And ſhee ſtanding ſomewhat neere to <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſmiling, thus hee ſpoke to her. Madam, I know well enough that this honor is only due to you, and many times I haue aſſured your of it: therfore, purſue you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate promiſe, and ſtand in dread of no danger whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words, he left the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and ſhe, proceeding unto the ſtayres, paſſed them all without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficultie, but when ſhee drew neere to the doores entrance, ſhee ſeemed to feele an infinite number of armes and handes, which very ſtrongly and mainely reſiſted her. Neuertheleſſe, ſhee was not a iote diſcouraged, but defended her ſelfe vertuouſly turning euery way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſiſtance; and in meere deſpight of any impeachment, made free her paſſage, yet much out of breath. But when ſhee coulde no longer ſuſtaine her ſelfe, the hand which firſt fauoured <hi>Amadis</hi> (as you haue already heard in the beginning of the ſecond Booke) drew her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly in. Then an infinite of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine voyces were heard, ſinging ſo loud as they were eaſilie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. <hi>Bleſsed bee the ariuall of that only and excellent Lady, none the like ſince</hi> Grimaneſa, <hi>and yet goeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond her in all beauties, in regard whereof, ſhe is worthie of the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Knight, that euer bare armes this hundred yeares, and more; with whom ſhe may here henceforward, li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Inſtantly the chamber doore flew open, and <hi>Oriana</hi> entred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into ſo highlie ſatisfied, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of the whole world could not more content her.

But the maſter of the houſhould came to king <hi>Perion,</hi> and told him, that their meate was neere ſpoyling: Wherefore, he tooke <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> by the hand, and led her into the great dining Hale, where a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Feaſt was ready for them: there they ſate downe at each Table, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the maſter of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies called them by name, and were ſerued with the moſt exquiſite cheare, that could bee poſſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner were the tables with-drawne, but they fell to dauncing, and ſo ſpent out the day, till they couered for ſupper, which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, maſques, and mummeries came in, continuing ſo long among the Ladies: till the Queenes of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and <hi>Gaule</hi> withdrew the new married couples. <hi>Amadis</hi> had prepared his lodging in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Chamber,</hi> where he meant to reſt with his long loued <hi>Ortana:</hi> the like preparation was made for the Empreſſe, and the other brides.

that this meeting ſhould bee here in this place; after the paſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, wherein ſo many famous and worthie men haue periſhed on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. And, God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if it, had lien in my power to helpe it, how gladly I would haue imployed my very vttermoſt paines.

                  <p>Now Madame let mee tell you, how this Prophecie hath taken his full effect, for if you heedfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it, <hi>Amadis</hi> your Lord &amp; huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band (more ſtrong and inuincible then any Lyon) came forth of that <hi>Iſle,</hi> which by great reaſon might be tearmed doubtfull: and furiouſly aſſailed the <hi>Romaines</hi> that had you in guarde.

                  <p>Whereupon, arming himſelfe with the Armes of the dead knight, and taking vp his Shield, he entred into the barke.

For thy ſelfe, I pray thee giue buriall to that dead knights body, in recompence of his Armes which I haue taken from him. Scarcely had he ended theſe words, but a luſtie gale of winde filled the Sailes, and (in a moment) they were ſo farre off from Land, as <hi>Amadis</hi> could not heare the huntſmans anſwere.

Ladie to take no truce with her teares: earneſtly entreated her, to relate, whither ſhe intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him, and alſo the occaſion of her mourning: whereto gladly ſhe yeelded, beginning in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Vnderſtand Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> that at ſuch time as the Queen your mother departed from <hi>Gaule,</hi> trauailing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> according as the King your father had ſent for her: ſhe ſent a Lackey to my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in little <hi>Brittaine,</hi> where hee was gouernour of your lands, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that both he and I ſhould meete her at the Pallace of <hi>Apoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where the marriages of you &amp; my Lords your brethren were to be ſolemniſed. My husband ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not a little hereat, and my ſelfe much more: ſuddenly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a good Ship, wherein wee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued our ſelues, with my ſonne, whom you ſawe dead on the ſands, and alſo my daughter, hoping to beſtowe her on Madame <hi>Melicia</hi> your ſiſter. But night comming on vs, the waues and windes were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly tempeſtuouſly mooued: ſo that by their extreame violence, the ſailes, rudder, and tacklings of our Shippe, were all ſplit in ſunder. Our Pilot alſo was ſo diſtracted in minde, as all knowledge of his Compaſſe or Quadrant vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him, wherby it came to paſſe, that our Ship remayning at mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the waues and weather: we were driuen vpon the <hi>Red Iſland</hi> (vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnknowne to any of vs) where the Giant <hi>Balan</hi> abydeth, of whom you haue heretofore heard, &amp; there we landed.</p>
                  <p>At that very inſtant, we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, &amp; ſeazed on by the Guards of the Port, and forcibly brought before the Giant: who preſently demanded of vs, if wee had euer a Knight in our companie. My hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band made anſwere, that both hee and his ſonne had (long ſince) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone that order. It behooueth then, ſaide the Giant, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, you fight with mee one after an other, and if you can holde out but an houre only, you and yours ſhall goe free: but otherwiſe, you muſt remaine my priſoners, and therfore make choyce of which you thinke fitteſt for you. And one thing I will acquaint you withall before hand, that performing your manhoode (as true Knights ought to doe) you ſhall finde ſo much the more loue &amp; courteſie in me: but if (through faintneſſe of courage) you faile in any the leaſt point, whereto the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Chiualrie bindeth you; I will vſe yee like villaines and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and lay you where neither Sunne or Moone can be ſeene, and ſo you ſhall remaine ten yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>My husband hearing theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and obſeruing the high ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Giant; could warrant no aſſurance of himſelfe. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, knowing what it was to faile any way: forgetting all feare, hee replied. Baſely are they bred (quoth he) and ill is Armes beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them, that through dread of danger, ſhall refuſe to fight for their owne liberty. Nowitſtanding, what aſſurance ſhall we haue of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, if wee maintaine an houres fight againſt you, according as you haue propoſed. Nothing elſe, ſaid the Giant, but my worde onely, which neuer was, or euer ſhall bee broken, for any good or ill that can befall mee. For rather will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, not onely to mine owne death, but likewiſe, to my ſonnes, and kinred, and ſeruants beſide, as alreadie I haue made them to ſwear and promiſe.

my husband, cauſe our horſes to bee reſtored vs, and the Armes belonging to my ſonne and mee; and then begin the combate when thou pleaſeſt.</p>
                  <p>The Giant commanded them to be deliuered. But my ſonne, too raſh and ill aduiſed, deſired of his father, that he might begin the firſt fight: which being granted him, he was ſo ill intreated by the Giant, that euen in the firſt encounter, he ouerthrew him ſo mainely, and his horſe vpon him, that both their neckes were broken in the fall. Whereat my husband beeing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, &amp; thinking to reuenge the loſſe of his ſonne: ran againſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> and brake his Lance manfully on his Shield, yet the Giant ſtirred no more at the ſhock, then if his bodie had beene a huge and ſtrong Tower. But as my husband perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his carrire, hee tooke him by the arme, and (in deſpight of all hee could doe to the contrarie) lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him out of his ſaddle, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him into his Caſtle, without any more harme done to him, but ſhutting him vp in a chamber, and I and my daughter with him.</p>
                  <p>Pondering there on our great misfortune, hauing loſt the life of my ſonne; my husband, daughter, and my ſelfe impriſoned, and our ſeruants no way able now to ſted vs: I fell into ſad complaints, and ſpake ſo loude (as it ſeemed) that the Giant heard me. All good king <hi>Perion,</hi> ſaid I, if thou or any of thy ſonnes were heere, I am ſure our wrongs would bee quickly reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: but I knowe you are all too farre hence. When the Giant had heard my wordes, and the Kings name: hee demanded of me, what knowledge I had of him, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was the father to one named <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> or no? I anſwered him, hee was, and that you &amp; your brethren knew mee for ſuch a one, as had dedicated her whole life to your ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Muſing a while to himſelfe, at laſt hee tolde mee, hee was ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſee you, that if I could co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the meanes, of bringing you to him, and that you would fight with him for our libertie: he would allow this ſmall Barke, and this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner, becauſe hee would reuenge the death of his father <hi>Mandafabul,</hi> whom you ſlew cowardely (as hee ſaid) in the battaile betweene the Kings <hi>Cildadan</hi> and <hi>Liſuart,</hi> at ſuch time as you cald your ſelf, the <hi>Bright Obſcure.</hi> Moreouer, that you tooke him vnprouided, as he carried away the King of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> priſoner in his Ship. And that you might haue the more occaſion of going with me, and by an vrgent motiue to commiſeration: hee permitted me, to beare the dead bodie of my ſonne along with me, according as you ſawe at our meeting. But firſt of all I demaunded of him, that if it were my good hap to finde you: what ſecurity you ſhould haue, of wrong or iniurie from any, but him-ſelfe only? My faith and worde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone (quoth he) which I will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſo long as breath is in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, not only againſt him, but any other Knight whatſoeuer, that would come hither with me in this ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Thus (Lord <hi>Amadis)</hi> perceiuing the offers he made me, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity I was in: I was ſo bolde to vndertake what you haue heard, truſting in the mercy of heauen, and your goodneſſe, which neuer was denied to any, that deſired your helpe. For I am verily perſwaded, that you will eaſily ouercome this Diuell, that maintaines ſo wicked a cuſtome in his countrie. Deare

friend anſwered, <hi>Amadis,</hi> I am very ſorry for the death of your ſon: what elſe remaineth to be done, I will die but you ſhall haue reaſon.</p>
                  <p>So they ſayled on three dayes &amp; three nights, together, and on the fourth,, diſcouering a ſmall Iſland, in the midſt whereof ſtood a Caſtle ſomewhat farre off: which made him demand of the Mariner, if hee knew the name of it, and to whom it appertayned.

Hereupon, the Mariner ſtrooke in cloſe to the foote of a Rocke, from whence they beheld a Gentleman, deſcending, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neere to them, faluted <hi>Amadis</hi> dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, of whence and what he was.

                  <p>The Gentleman requeſted to know his name. <hi>Balan</hi> anſwered <hi>Amadis.</hi> Well Sir, quoth the other, and what courſe doe you meane to take therein?

I can eaſilie beleeue, that you came hither with ſuch animation, but I am wonderfully affraide, that before you returne backe (if you purpoſe to goe on any further) a great part of the heate, which I now ſee in you, will bee more calmely qualified. Therefore ſir, I woulde aduiſe yee, to turne ſome other way for, if the Lord of the Iſle, from whence you now came, who is (as I vnderſtand, and haue many times heard) <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> and his two brethren, <hi>Don Galaor</hi> and <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> (accounted amongſt the very beſt Knights in the World this day li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing) had met together, and gone about ſuch a fond enterpriſe, as you haue now vndertaken: they were ſure to be much rather reprehended then allowed for wiſe and diſcreete men. And becauſe you are (in mine opinion) one of King <hi>Liſuarts</hi> knights, to whom my Maſter King <hi>Cildadan,</hi> is an intimate friend: I would perſwade you to beleeue me, otherwiſe, worſe will befall you, and you muſt needs prooue a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of your ſelfe, being aduiſed, and will not auoid it.</p>
                  <p>I know not what may happen, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> but I haue heard all my life hitherto, that it is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, proper and peculiar to them, that couet the ſupream place of honour and renowne, to attempt occaſions of moſt danger, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie. Not that they intend to bee, ſo highly eſteemed: But to ſhunne diſcouraging in ſo braue an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.

Wherefore, the taxation, which was ſuch a blemiſh to his renowne (not by any fault in himſelfe, but only vpon accident) is now cleerely acquitted. But know you this for truth? ſaid the Knight. Yes verily, quoth <hi>Amadis:</hi> And ſo related the whole buſineſſe to him, according as you haue heard it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Then the knight lifting vp his eyes and hands to heauen, ſaid. Bleſſed be the name of God, who hath permitted my good King and Maſter, to enioy the right which is due vnto him. Sir Knight, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> haue you at any time ſeene <hi>Balan.</hi> Yes, that I haue, anſwered he. I pray you replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> to certifie mee what you know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him. That will I very glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaid the knight, and (perhaps) in better manner then any man elſe you could light vpon.</p>
                  <p>Vnderſtand then ſir, that hee is Sonne to the fierce Giant <hi>Mandaffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull,</hi> the ſame man, that <hi>Amadis</hi> (when hee tearmed himſelfe the <hi>Bright Obſcure)</hi> ſlew, and on the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, when the king my Maſter, and he of <hi>Great Brittaine,</hi> fought a hundred, againſt a hundred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in periſhed many other Giants, all neighbours to this countrie, and kinſemen to <hi>Balan,</hi> whom you now enquire for. By the death of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he became and yet remayneth Lord of the <hi>Red Iſland,</hi> where hee maketh his aboade at this inſtant, it being one of the moſt fertill <hi>Iſlands</hi> in all the Eaſterne Sea, and of the greateſt reuenues, by meanes of the frequent reſort of ſtrange Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that land there at all times, of whom hee exacts an infinite tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. Now ſir, you are to obſerue beſide, that if his father was valiant, and not meanely experienced in Armes: His ſonne exceedeth him in all things, only crueltie excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For, looke how much the one was a Tyrant, and moſt inhumane: the other is ſo much the more mild, peaceable and gracious, ſo that it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7181:391"/>
appeareth (almoſt) a miracle in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſee men iſſued of one &amp; the ſame linage, to be ſo different in their qualities.</p>
                  <p>In this point, I muſt tell you a generall opinion, that this faire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour became hereditarie to him, only by vertue of his mother, who was one of the moſt modeſt, benigne and affable Ladies, then to be ſeene, farre differing herein from the other Gianteſſe, wife to <hi>Famongomad,</hi> and her owne ſiſter, ſhee beeing the moſt foule, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſluttiſh and vnhanſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that euer was ſeen of her kind. Whereby may bee collected, that two ſuch contrarie complexions, ſeldome haue power to agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being deriued from ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant nature. Notwithſtanding, the reaſon hereof (in my poore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) may be thus rendred: that vertue moſt commonly is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with beauty and comely fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but is a meer ſtranger to vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deformity, and baſe diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, I am further to tell you, that it is more then twenty yeares ſince I was appointed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the Iſle where you found me: therefore I can ſpeake to you the more vnderſtandingly, as a man moſt frequent, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any thing you can demand of me. For ſince the yongeſt years of the King my maiſter, I neuer went out of this Climate, by reaſon of the faithfull truſt repoſed in me, eſpecially in thoſe daies, when the rich golden Sunne ſhone not ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly on him, as in later times it hath done. For by his proweſſe and other high deſeruings, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the daughter to King <hi>Abies</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was ſlaine by <hi>Amadis,</hi> when hee entitled himſelfe, by the name of the gentleman of the Sea, or the like kinde of appellation.</p>
                  <p>Beleeue mee Sir, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> you haue done me a great pleaſure, ſo well to acquaint mee with the conditions of <hi>Balan,</hi> whom I could wiſh (for mine owne benefit) to be of another kinde of Character, then you haue now deſcribed him to me. For if hee had beene indued with ſuch plenty of vices, as you haue giuen him to mee in vertues: hee cannot expect (when time ſhall ſerue for our meeting) any hope in his owne ability of ſtrength. And let mee tell you, till this inſtant, I neuer ſtood in feare of his vtter-moſt power: albeit I cannot now well reſolue what to thinke of my ſelfe, in a caſe of ſuch ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety. Neuertheleſſe, come what can, more precious to mee is mine honour, then my life. And let mee further entreate you to tell mee, if hee be married, and whence he had his wife? In good faith (quoth the Knight) neuer man had better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in marriage, then he, enioying one of the moſt virtuous Ladies that can be: ſhe being daughter to <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalack,</hi> Lord of the Rocke of <hi>Galta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> by whom he hath a ſonne, aged (as I imagine) about fifteen yeares.</p>
                  <p>Very ſorrie was <hi>Amadis</hi> when he vnderſtoode for a certaintie, what alliance was between <hi>Balan &amp; Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalack,</hi> whom he loued dearely, for the nouriſhing which his brother <hi>Galaor</hi> had of him, in the time of his infancie: and he could wel haue wiſhed, that this combate might haue been againſt ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, although it ſhould fall out more doubtfull and dangerous to him. But if it were againſt his owne brother, hee could not now denie it, in regarde of his promiſe paſſed to <hi>Darioletta.</hi> And ſo long they held on diſcourſe, that darke night ouer-tooke them, yet they ſayled on mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſtill, till ſomewhat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

next morning; they diſcouered the Iſland with the red Tower, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the whole countrey had her name: becauſe in the midſt thereof was a goodly Caſtle builded, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with great Towers, and ſuch walles as were of no meane maruell to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Then the Knight ſeeing <hi>Amadis</hi> take ſome delight in beholding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaid. Sir, this Caſtle which you ſee yonder, was not built as this day, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> more then an hundred ſince: but as you now ſee it, ſo doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hiſtories ſpeake of it, that he who firſt founded it was named <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> ſonne to that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi> who brought the <hi>Sangreal</hi> into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> at ſuch time as the whole land conſiſted of Paganes. But by his meanes, the moſt part of the people conuerted to the faith of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> not without ſuffering many incurſions of hoſtile enemies, that dayly came in vpon them, &amp; grieuouſly moleſted them from time to time.</p>
                  <p>To preuent this annoyance, this Tower was thus erected, in manner as you now beholde it, but after-wards (as all things haue their chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with the alteration of times:) if fell into the hands of Giants, who tooke great paines to re-people the Iſle with worſhippers of Idols, &amp; excluded all them that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the true God. Neuertheleſſe, our Lord prouided ſo wel for them, that (in deſpite of their enemies) they ſtill continued heere, though not in ſo great a number, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying ſuch libertie as formerly they had: yet partly by paying great taxations and tributes, and other of leſſe ability, by continuall ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to the Giants, vntill ſuch time as <hi>Balan</hi> came to bee Lord thereof, who (as I haue alreadie tolde you) is debonnaire, vertuous and of Catholique religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee is very naturally beloued of all his ſubiects.</p>
                  <p>Now, although the Knight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared all theſe good qualities, and many more in the Giant, to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis:</hi> yet all were but as fuell to fire, enflaming him ſo forwardly, that hee entreated him to goe before, and to let the Giant vnderſtand, that a Knight of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle</hi> was come thither with a Ladie, whoſe ſonne he had ſlaine and kept her husband, daughter &amp; ſeruants priſoners. And if by combating with him, and vanquiſhing him, they might be deliuered, hee reque, ſted ſecurity againſt all men, but himſelfe; otherwiſe let him not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to come neare the Port, becauſe the challenger held it as his refuge.</p>
                  <p>The Knight forthwith entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a small Skiffe, leauing <hi>Amadis</hi> and his company at the hauen, in expectation of his returne. So ſoon as he came near the Giant, he knew him, as one who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had many times ſeene, and demanded of him, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee went. Lord <hi>Balan,</hi> quoth hee, I came hither with a Knight, whom I left at the Porte, who tels mee, that he came embarqued from the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> and his comming is purpoſely to fight with you. At theſe wordes the Giant ſtarted, &amp; began to imagine, that this was one of thoſe men, whom <hi>Darioletta</hi> had before ſpoken of, &amp; ſuddenly ſaid to the Knight. Is there not a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with him of ſome indifferent yeares. There is, anſwered the Knight. On my life, quoth hee, it is <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> or one of his brethren, whoſe fame is ſo great throughout the world. I know not that replied the Knight, but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beheld a Gentleman of more goodly forme, nor leſſe fearfull,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7181:392"/>
by his words, for if you ſend for him hither by me, and giue him warrant againſt all men, but your ſelfe, hee will quickly be heere, to end his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. He ſhall be welcome, ſaid <hi>Balan,</hi> and you know my vſe and cuſtome to all men, aſſure him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mine honor, that hee ſhall haue no wrong or iniurie done him by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of mine: but if hee gaine the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand of me, he ſhall enioy what he can demand of me any way.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words the Knight tooke his leaue of <hi>Balan,</hi> and entred into his boate againe, to goe find <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> to whom hee declared all that the Giant had ſaid. Whereupon, ſetting thence from the port, and comming to aſcend the Rock, they went on towards <hi>Balans</hi> Caſtle, where he ſate before the gate vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſaluting <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Dario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta,</hi> he demanded of her, if this Knight was one of them, whom ſhe had promiſed to bring with hir. But <hi>Amadis,</hi> taking the anſwer from her (as fearing to bee diſcouered) told him. That hee was not come thither to tell his name, but to let him feele the keen edge of his ſword if he did not make a liberal amends, for the wrongs which the Lady had receiued, and the reſt of her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Knight, replyed the Giant (in a kinde of ſcornefull manner) I feele ſuch a feare inſtantly poſſeſſe mee, as conſtraines me to offer you ſuch a courteſie, which as yet I neuer did to any other: knowing, that you are deceiud by hir which brought you hither, ignorant who I am, and what I can doe. Therfore I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſuffer you ſeeke after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures in other ſtrange countries and not (for this time) make you liable to the cuſtome of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> being much diſpleaſed, to heare in what ſlender eſteeme the Giant held him; chollerickly retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this anſwere. Grant pitty or pardon to ſuch as thou haſt power ouer, and not to me, that haue thus farre aduentured by Sea, only to deale with thee: and that I will ſoundly let thee know, before the ſonne can circle this Rocke, if thou doeſt not conſent to aboliſh, and giue ouer the damnable cuſtome, which heere thou maintaineſt both againſt God and man, and which (in reaſon) thou oughteſt not to gaine-ſay. Moreouer, I would intreate thee (in kindneſſe) to doe it, for the good I wiſh to thy ſelfe, and in fauor of ſome of thy neereſt friends whoſe welfare, I as dearely account of, as mine owne. Let me therefore aduiſe thee, to yeelde this Lady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe of her wrongs, before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint compells it, and we proceed on in further trouble.</p>
                  <p>This requeſt, (quoth the Giant) exceedeth reaſon, and neuer ſhall it be granted by me: Beſide: let me tell thee, but that I am ſomewhat deſirous to approue, how your knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> can maitaine the Armes they beare; I would not vouchſafe to put on any myſelfe. And becauſe thou art on foote, and lackeſt a Horſe to doe thee ſeruice: I will ſend thee one of the very beſt in my Stable, with Launce and Armour, if thou ſtandſt in neede. For I haue great ſtore of ſuch as I haue conquered, as well from ſome of thy companions, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who thought their manhood as good as thine. So help me God ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> thou dealeſt like a good and worthie Knight, the horſe I will not refuſe, neither the launce but as for any Armour or Shield. I will haue none other then thoſe (at this time) which belonged to the knight ſlain by thee on no occaſion, whoſe innocence giues mee both

ſtrength and courage, to reuenge the Wrongs done to him and the reſt.</p>
                  <p>He is dead and gone, anſwered the Giant. So leauing him, <hi>Dario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta</hi> and the knight, hee went into his Caſtle from whence ſoone after, came forth a ſquire, who preſented a uery goodly courſer, and a ſtrong Launce to <hi>Amadis:</hi> and inſtantly, vpon the toppe of the <hi>Redde Tower,</hi> a noyſe of Trumpets ſounded moſt cheerefully, which cauſed <hi>Amadis</hi> to demand the reaſon thereof, Sir Knight, ſaid the Squire, <hi>Balan</hi> my maſter is now ready to come forth, therfore ſtand vpon your guard, if you will be well aduiſed.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely had hee ended theſe words, but all they within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as well men as women, came vpon the walles, and battlements, to behold the iſſue of this combat: and preſently came forth <hi>Balan,</hi> mounted on the like courſer as hee had ſent to <hi>Amadis,</hi> armed with a moſt bright Armour, and bearing an huge ſhield beyond meaſure. As he approached neere to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, who ſate readily prepared to encounter him, hee ſpake ſo loude as euery one might heare him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, Knight of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> thine ouer-weening hath too farre blinded thine vnderſtanding, and I am ſo much mooued thereat, that I cannot chuſe but pittie thee, for refuſing my kinde offer when I tendred it to thee.

                  <p>Claſping downe their Beauers, and couching their Launces, they ranne each againſt other with ſuch ſwiftneſſe, as if lightning had carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. <hi>Amadis</hi> met <hi>Balan</hi> ſo ſtrongly, that hee pierced both his ſhield and coate of Male, directly vpon the ſtomacke bone, which was ſo painefull to him, that he fell downe on the ground, when as hee had charged <hi>Amadis,</hi> and ran his Launce ſo farre into the horſes head (the paine he felt much qualifying the vigour of the blow) that the horſe fell downe dead, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vnder him. But he quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered himſelfe, and drawing forth his Sword, marched towards <hi>Balan,</hi> who yet was ſo terrified with his fall as hee could hardly ſtand on his feete. Notwithſtanding feare of death, and ſhame to bee vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, made him cheere vp his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſtand vpon the maineſt manly defence of himſelfe. Then they beganne to hack and hew one another, that whoſoeuer had heard and not ſeene them: would rather haue thought the noyſe to bee ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers one an anuile, then ſwords on Armour.</p>
                  <p>As the Giant lifted vp his ſword with all his force, thinking to beate downe <hi>Amadis</hi> with the blow: his Shielde glaunced aſide, whereof <hi>Amadis</hi> taking aduantage, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Balan</hi> ſo openly diſcouered wounded him in the right arme, juſt on the elbow ioynt, the griefe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made him almoſt ſenceleſſe, and retyring back two or three paces, reeled like a drunken man, When the knight of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of the <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

his thoughts, bleſſing himſelfe, with the ſigne of the Croſſe, he ſaid to the Lady. Where could you meet with ſuch a diuell as performeth things impoſſible for any mortall man to doe. Ah Sir Knight, quoth ſhe, if the world hade a few more ſuch men as he, the pride of wicked wretches would not be ſo inſolent, as it is in many places.</p>
                  <p>In this meane while, <hi>Amadis</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Giant hot &amp; fiercely, and hee ſo weakened more and more, by loſing the benefit of his right arme: that hee was compelled to take his ſword into his left hand, but his enemy gaue him ſuch a ſtroake (in the meane ſpace) on the toppe of his Helmet, as made the ſight or fore part turne directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde. Which fell out very ill for <hi>Balan,</hi> for being thus bereft of ſight, hee ſtroue extreamely to recouer it againe: but not without much paine and difficulty, thorough his right armes diſabling, from whence the blood ſtill ſtreamed aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> hoping for a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall concluſion of his buſie trouble, lifted vppe his ſworde for another ſtroake: but the Giant had firſt re-ſeated his Helmet, and ſeeing the blowe comming, defended it with his Shield ſo well as hee could, and the ſword of <hi>Amadis</hi> entred ſo far into it, that it was impoſſible for him to get it out againe.</p>
                  <p>Now beganne they to hale and tugge one another ſo violently, that the thongs or leathers of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour brake in ſunder, and both the ſword and ſhield was wholly in the power of <hi>Amadis,</hi> which prooued farre more troubleſome to him then before; for it was ſo exceeding hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, as hee could ſcarſely ſtirre it from the ground. By meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Giant had more eaſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirre himſelfe, charging <hi>Amadis</hi> at his owne pleaſure: but it was with his left hand onely, and much the better for <hi>Amadis,</hi> for if <hi>Balan</hi> could haue commanded his other arme, <hi>Amadis</hi> had died without all doubt hauing neither ſword nor ſhield, wherewith to defend himſelfe. But neceſſitie (the quicke conceiuing mother of inuention) enſtructed him ſuddenly with a new kinde of remedie, in manner following.</p>
                  <p>Hee had his owne Shield ſtill hanging behinde him in a Bauld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, which did mightily hinder his ſtrength, in recouering his Sword out of <hi>Balans</hi> Shield: wherefore, hee rent it violently from his owne neck, and threwe mainly aſtainſt the ſhinnes of <hi>Balan,</hi> who felt the throw very painefully. Afterward, taking his Sworde (newly recouered by both his hands, from out of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants Shield, and by ſetting his right foot manfully on it) it plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to euery eye, that he won it not eaſily, becauſe (in the interim) <hi>Balan</hi> charged him ſeuerely, &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly wounded him in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on his bodie. But hauing reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the beſt part of his defence, his heart and courage became ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the more chearfull and forward, in following his enemie at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages, to play ſtill vpon him, as occaſion ſerued, and therein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed all care and diligence. And indeed, the paine of the Giants ſtomacke, by the puſh of the Lance, with the ouer liberal expence of his blood, ſo extreamely encreaſed his paine and torment: that breath fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and in a ſwone he fell on the ground.</p>
                  <p>When they in the Caſtle beheld this, and verily ſuppoſing him to be dead; crying out with one voyce to <hi>Amadis:</hi> Ah traytour, in an ill houre haſt thou ſlaine the beſt Knight in the world. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,

all their lamentations <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> would not bee ſtayed, but ſtepping vpon the Giant; rent the Helmet from his Head, and perceiuing him to bee yet liuing, ſpake out loude enough to him, ſaying. Yeeld thy ſelfe <hi>Balan,</hi> if thou wilt not loſe thy head: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, hee ſtirred neither hand nor foot for all theſe wordes. Then the Knight, who was Gouernour of the <hi>Infanta Iſland,</hi> fearing leaſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> would vſe <hi>Balan</hi> as he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him: came neare vnto him, &amp; demanded, whether the Giant were dead, or no.

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, beleeue it vndoubtedly, more harme will happen to you, then you can eaſily imagine: for the people within the Caſtle are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in Armes, and will be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on you to their vttermoſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

                  <p>During this time of ſo ſharpe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayling, ſome of them belonging to the Caſtle, had carried <hi>Balan</hi> home into his bed, while the reſt oppreſſed <hi>Amadis</hi> very deſperately. Which was no little affliction to the Knight of the <hi>Infanta Iſland,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe worde and warrant, hee had come thither: whereupon hee called <hi>Brauor,</hi> and thus hee ſpake to him. Before God <hi>Brauor,</hi> thou haſt vndertaken a buſines, little to thine honour. Doeſt thou not know, that thy father was alwaies a man honeſt and vertuous of his worde? And wilt thou degenerate, in breaking both his faith &amp; promiſe. By me he gaue aſſurance to the Knight, and by ſolemne proteſtations, that hee ſhould not be offended by any, but himſelfe only. Neuertheleſſe, thou ſuffereſt him to bee wronged moſt vilely, although thy father bee yet liuing, and will hardly allowe this thy diſcurteous dealing. Beleeue me as thou liſt, for it thou ſtand in doubt of <hi>Balans</hi> death, take order, that the Knight may bee ſecurely kept this night, without any iniury or diſgrace done vnto him: And to morrow, thou ſhalt better ſee the diſpoſition of thy father, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne thy ſelfe thereto accordingly, for I dare aſſure thee, that hee is in

no perill of life. True it is, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my requeſt firſt propounded for him, and the Knights affection to <hi>Gandalacke</hi> thy grandfather (as him-ſelfe aſſured me) he had ſmitten off his head: therfore follow my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and better will befall thee, then thou art aware of.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Darioletta</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Amadis</hi> to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged on all ſids, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any meanes of ayd or ſuccour: ſhe began to grieue and lament very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in her weeping vſed theſe words. Wretched and vnfortunate woman that I am, muſt the only beſt knight in the world loſe his life, and by mine occaſion. How dare I (hereafter) appeare in the preſence of the King his Father, the Queene, or any other of his friends, knowing what harm I haue procured to him? Miſerable woman, and much more miſerable then I am able to tearme my ſelfe. If I was once the meanes of ſauing his life, by inuenting that ſtrange kind of cradle, wherein hee was committed to the rude Seas mercy: how farre vnkinde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie am I now to him, in cauſing the end of his dayes, when I moſt expected and hoped for helpe by him? Alas! how miſguided were my ſences from reaſon and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, at the time when I met him on the Sea ſhoare, and would not ſuffer him ſo much as turne back to the Caſtle of <hi>Apoliaon,</hi> to take his leaue of madam <hi>Oriana,</hi> and from whence hee might haue brought ſome other Knights with him, by whom (in this extreamity) he ſhould haue beene well ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Who therfore deſerues iuſtly to be puniſhed, but only my ſelfe, hated and deſpiſed of all good luck, and performing the part of a light headed and indeſcreete Woman, truſting ouer much to mine owne raſh opinion.</p>
                  <p>All this while did <hi>Amadis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde <hi>Dariolettaes</hi> ſadde complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and how often times ſhee
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7181:394"/>
heaued vp her hands to heauen, as requiring comfort onely from thence, yet could he not vnderſtand any one word ſhe ſpake, but enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this benefit of ſeeing her, by light of fire, made by them that watched him, and for their better wearing away the cloudie night, which alſo gaue him ſome feeling of her wofull condition, and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted him in ſoule, as hee reſolued to die, or get out of the rocky caue, becauſe the nights obſcuritie woulde therein more auaile him, then day light could doe, or delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time till the morning. Beſide, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the doubtfull iſſue of his preſent eſtate, it appeared plainlie to him, that hee could not eſcape thence, without eyther death, or taking: being ouer wearied with weight of his Armes, want of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reſt, and extreamitie of hunger, all of theſe beeing no meane ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to any hopefull expectation. Only his beſt helpe in this neceſſity was, that he ſaw his guardes begin to nodde and ſleepe, and therefore ſo ſoftly as he could, and by little and little) hee offered to ſteale out of the Caue, hoping ſo to compaſſe his peace.</p>
                  <p>Well was this obſerued by the Knight of the <hi>Infanta Iſland,</hi> who conſidering what danger he might fall into, what ſpeeches had paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Brauor</hi> and the Gyants wife, all tending to his good and ſafetie: ranne preſently to him, and ſtayed him, euen againſt his will, as it were, ſaying Sir Knight, I pray you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frend me ſo much, as but to heare me, before you aduenture any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereat <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtood ſtill, to liſten what he would ſay, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared to him, how hee had conditioned a truce with <hi>Brauor</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hope of the Giants recouerie; who already appeared to be out of perill, and told him (beſide) what you haue formerly heard. <hi>Amadis</hi> hereat was very ioyfull, beleeuing him to be an honeſt and kinde man, that would bring him ſo good news and that no dread of death could cauſe him to inuent them, where-upon he thus anſwered. Courteous Knight, for this time, I both credit, and will follow your counſell, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to you by mine order of knight-hood, wherein already I haue ſpent ten yeares ſeruice: that I had much rather be hewn in peeces, then the Lady (for whom I haue contended with <hi>Balan)</hi> ſhould not be fully ſatisfied in her demaunde. Both you and ſhee, replied the Knight, ſhall haue all that you can deſire. For I know <hi>Balan</hi> to be ſuch a man, as makes more account of his worde, then hee doth of his life.</p>
                  <p>During this time, the Gyant lay on his bedde, not able to vtter a worde, but panted extraordinarily as one that endured a ſtrange kinde of perplexitie in his ſtomack; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his breath began greatly to faile him, and ſtill (one while after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) he ſhewed with his left hand, and poynted to the place where hee was moſt payned. Which his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons perceiuing, (who durſt not as yet take off his garments, as fearing much to ſtirre him) they aduentured to obſerue the place whereto he ſigned, and found (by preſent apparance) that hee had great reaſon ſo to doe, for more then the palme of a hands breadth, round vpon the ſtomacke, the fleſh and bones were quaſhed, and meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken, as it were whereupon, they applyed immediatly ſo many oyles, vnguents, and other helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full remedies: that, before breake of day, ſpeech came to him againe, and hee demanded, what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7181:395"/>
of the Knight and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
                  <p>Then the truth of all was tolde him, for none of them durſt tell a lie in his hearing: which made him to call for his ſonne <hi>Brauor,</hi> and all the reſt, that kept <hi>Amadis</hi> ſo ſharpely beſieged, and beeing come before him, he began in this manner to his ſonne. Infamous villaine, durſt thou preſume to falſifie my worde, in any thing that I had promiſed. Slaue, as thou art, what honour, or what aduantage could redound to thee, by ſo baſe a deed as thou haſt done? was it in thy power to recall my life, if death had pleaded poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it? Or how canſt thou excuſe this treaſon, in purſuing that villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie which thou haſt ſo impudently begunne, againſt a worthy Knight, who had not entred vpon my land, but vnder the aſſurance of my worde? Didſt thou euer know hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, that for any thing hapning to me, I was any way falſe or iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in my promiſe? Haue I not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore iuſtly kept my word, to my power, as valuing it farre aboue thee, or the deare eſteeme of mine owne life? By the faith I beare to God, but that nature ſomewhat ſpeakes for thee: thou ſhouldeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly bee hanged ouer my Caſtle wall, as an example to all ſuch vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines as thou art, enemies to truth and vertue. Take him, take the wretch, binde him hand and foote, and ſo bear him to the Knight: then tell him from mee, thus I haue ſent the traytour, that not only abuſed him, but mee much more, and ſay, I entreate him, to take ſuch ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on him, for vs both, as hee hath worthily deſerued.</p>
                  <p>Not any man among them, durſt euer contradict what hee had cammanded: wherfore <hi>Brauor,</hi> was preſently ſeaſed on, ſtrictly bound, and ſo carried thence to <hi>Amadis.</hi> But his mother, fearing leaſt ſuch ſeuerity might be fall him, as <hi>Balan</hi> had vrged, and knowing alſo, what wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Knight had receiued: departed ſecretly out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ranne after her ſonne. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, ſhe was not ſo ſwift of foot, but <hi>Brauor</hi> was preſented to <hi>Amadis</hi> before ſhee came, and in ſuch manner as the Giant had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Whereof (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) <hi>Amadis</hi> made ſmall account, but pardoned him honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and vntied his bonds himſelfe, euen as the good Ladie came to him, whom ſhe preſently knew: for hee had taken off his Helmet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ouer burdenous to him, but ſhee could not imagine, how he would deale with her ſonne <hi>Brauor,</hi> wherefore ſhee threw her ſelfe at his feet, and weeping, ſaid. Alas, Lord <hi>Amadis,</hi> doe you not know me? Now, albeit he very wel remembred her, and that ſhee was the ſiſter to <hi>Gandalack:</hi> yet (for a while) he would not let her perciue ſo much, but ſomewhat fiercely, anſwered. Ladie, I know not who, or what you are, and deſire neuer to come among ſuch bad and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked people, as I haue mette withall in this place. Alas Sir, ſaid ſhee, if you thinke it meet that I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale your name, I am well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to doe it: neuertheleſſe, I know you to bee Lord <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> brother to <hi>Galaor,</hi> whom I ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect, as in honour of him, and for his ſake, I humbly entreate you to pittie and pardon my ſonne.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wordes moued his noble heart to ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion, as he could no longer diſſemble his diſpleaſure: but taking the Lady gently from the ground, he thus ſpake to her. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, my brother &amp; my ſelfe haue receiued ſuch benefits &amp; curteſies
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7181:395"/>
from <hi>Gandalack</hi> your Father, as I would hazard my perſon to any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, yea euen to my very lateſt gaſpe to doe him the beſt ſeruice conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in my power, or any of his friends, for his ſake. But as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your Sonne, theſe men here preſent know right well, that I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him before you could come to begge it of me: nay more, I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound him with mine owne hands, before your arriuall, without deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any other reuenge on him, but only on ſuch as maintaine wicked and vnlawfull cuſtomes. Among whom I name your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>usband as the chiefeſt man, whoſe knowledge of my name I care not for: becauſe he may hold himſelfe well aſſured, that I will neuer depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Iſle, vntil he haue ſatisfied the lady that came hither with me. And therfore, if he be ſo iuſt and true of his word, as he would haue it appeare by open publication: let him meete mee in place conuenient for vs both, and then he ſhall know, whether he was carried away from mee by right or wrong, after I had obtained the maſtery ouer him.</p>
                  <p>Againe ſhe fell vpon her knees, ſaying, beleeue me ſir, hee will doe you reaſon, in any thing you can demand of him, as you may well perceiue, that hee was vtterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, in that which his people haue done contrary to his worde. For then hee had neither ſence nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which may well ſerue in his excuſe. Wherefore I ſweare to you vpon my faith, that if you pleaſe to goe along with me to him (becauſe he cannot by any meanes come to you) before you part one from another, I doubt not but you will bee reconciled louing friends. Madam, anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> I haue not any ſuſption of you: But I greatly doubt the condition of Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly little gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but carried away only by furie and crueltie. It is true Sir, (quoth ſhee) and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I know his goodneſſe to bee ſuch, as you may well cred it him on mine aſſurance. Your word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hen (anſwered <hi>Amadis)</hi> ſhall be my war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, And ſo I will goe along with you.</p>
                  <p>So lacing on his helmet, faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſhield about his neck, and graſping his Sword faſt in his fiſt: he entred the Caſtle, with the wife to <hi>Balan,</hi> who quickly had aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of their arriuall, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requeſted the knights preſence in his chamber. No ſooner were they entred, but the Giant rayſed himſelfe on his bed ſo well as hee could, ſaying, that he was moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily welcome. <hi>Balan,</hi> anſwered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> I know not how thou mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, but I haue iuſt occaſion to complaine of the villanie offered me by thy men: being come (vpon thy words warrant) to combat with thee, and vrge reaſon for thy wrong to the Lady that conducted me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And albeit I had the better of thee, yet cowardly they aſſaulted me: although I thinke it was not done by thy command, being then in diſpoſition not to doe it. But be it howſoeuer, ſeeing thy Iuſtice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thine owne Sonne, I acquit both thee and them alſo: but not in the caſe of right appertayning to the Lady, for, death it ſelfe cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me from my duty in her behalfe which makes mee the more louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derſie thee to giue her content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Otherwiſe, I muſt bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned, to finiſh vpon thy Bodie, that which I haue already begunne: a matter much diſpleaſing to mee, for <hi>Gandalacks</hi> ſake, whom I dearely affect &amp; eſteem, &amp; to whom (as I am enformed) thou art nearely allied
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7181:396"/>
in ſome nature of affinity.</p>
                  <p>Knight replyed <hi>Balan,</hi> although my extreamity of griefe is ſuch, to ſee my ſelfe vanquiſhed by one Knight only, as death would be a thouſand times more welcome to me: yet both theſe are of no value at all with me, in regard of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour acted by my ſonne and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. And did my ſtrength ſo much fauour me, as but to execute mine owne determinations, thou ſhouldeſt ſufficiently perceiue, how farre the power of my word exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. For the inſtant, I could doe no leſſe, or yeeld thee any better te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of my truth: then deliuer him into thy power, that began ſo foule and iniurious an offence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he is of no meane eſteem both to me and his mother. But ſeeing this ſubmiſſion cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent thee; command what elſe thou wouldeſt haue, and it ſhall be granted. For matters paſt betweene thee and me (anſwered <hi>Amadis)</hi> I am ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied: but not in the wrongs that concerne the Lady. I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (replied the Giant) to ſuffer any ſuch condemnation as thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt beſt, whereby to pleaſe both her and thee: with this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the vnrecouerable life of her ſonne ſtands out of my reach, and therefore muſt needes bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by ſome thing, remayning in my power</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all then, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> my will is, that thou deliuer her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, her daughter, and all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants out of thy priſons.

my Lord, anſwered <hi>Landin,</hi> you are not ignorant, that my Coſen <hi>Eliſeo</hi> and my ſelfe, were not long ſince diſcharged thence, with mine vnckle <hi>Don Quedragant,</hi> and <hi>Bruneo de bonne Mer,</hi> to goe to King <hi>Cil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadan</hi> for ayde of men: becauſe the Nephew to King <hi>Arauigne,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the ouerthrowe of his Vncle, had taken poſſeſſion of his kingdome, and gaue vs (at our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance) a very ſharpe battaile. Now although the victory fell to vs, and the enemies loſſe prooued to bee great: yet many men of worth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed on our ſide, and wee were ſent for the leuie of freſh forces. And becauſe good water grew ſcant with vs in our trauaile, the firſt place wee came to, was the Iſle of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta;</hi> where it was tolde vs, that but lately before, a Knight paſſed thence with a Lady, and went pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to fight with <hi>Balan</hi> the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.

misfortune conſidered) to ſee him-ſelfe and his brother at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſuch a man, from whom he aſſured himſelfe of mercie: and therefore with teares in his eyes, thus hee began. For the honor of God, and true Nobilitie, I beſeech you Lord <hi>Landin,</hi> not to deale with vs as we haue iuſtly deſerued: but by declaring your goodneſſe and gentle breeding, referre the baſe liues of me and my brother, vnto your wonted mercy and pitty. <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon</hi> (anſwered <hi>Landin)</hi> I neuer thought you to be ſuch men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene brought vp vnder ſo good a Prince, as is the King your Maſter, and among ſo many worthy Knights, as ordinarilie doe attend on him: among which number (God is my Iudge) I alwayes eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med you, and not to bee any ſuch men as I haue found yee. Alas ſir (quoth <hi>Galifon)</hi> deſire of rule and commanding, hath won mee this due deſert, as it hath done many more, as idle headed and improui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as my ſelfe.

                  <p>Moſt humbly did <hi>Galifon</hi> and his brother ſhew themſelues thankeful; and becauſe it grew to be late, they ſupped together with ſuch meane cheere, as both the time and place could afforde them.

                  <p>So, without any farther delay, they weighed Anchors, and hauing the winde proſperous for them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all that night, till (about breake of day) they deſcried the Iſland.

had finiſhed (to his high honour) a combate ſo perillous, beeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore inured to ſuch happy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes as this: but for my more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge, where I may find him, for otherwiſe, I am not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any reſt, either by day or night, ſo ſtrictly am I bound by my vow.</p>
                  <p>I am verily perſwaded, anſwered the Gouernour, that many other haue ſeene extraordinarie actions of Armes, and (doubtleſſe) perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with no meane honour: but if they knew as well as I, his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable valor in this haughty attempt, and reſolution in the execution, I thinke in (my poore opinion) they would confeſſe it to exceed all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer preſidents whatſoeuer. Honor be attributed to heauen, ſaid <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanaor,</hi> for this bleſſed fauour. And now there remaines no more to compleate my contentment, but onely to ſtay no where till I haue found him: may it therefore pleaſe you, to lend mee ſome one skilfull Mariner of yours, to be my helpe in this negotiation. With all my hart ſaid the Gouernour, and victualls alſo for your veſſell, if you are in ſuch neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Then the Gouernour of the Iſle called for one of his chiefeſt Pilots, and preſenting him to <hi>Graſandor,</hi> ſaid. This man came from thence but yeſterday, and very well knowes how to conduct you thither. I thanke you Sir, replyed <hi>Graſandor.</hi> So after ſome little time of reſt, his deſire ſtil prouoking, him to ſee the man he ſought for the went aboard, and (without any ſiniſter fortune) landed the next morning in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland of the <hi>Red Tower;</hi> enquiring there of <hi>Balans</hi> people, if <hi>Amadis</hi> were there as yet, or no. You ſhall find him aboue at the Caſtle, quoth they, and (if you pleaſe) wee will conduct you thither.</p>
                  <p>So they aſcended vp the Rocke, &amp; as they ſet foot within the Caſtle gate: <hi>Graſandor</hi> eſpied <hi>Amadis,</hi> to whom he ran. and caught him faſt in his armes. My deareſt friend (quoth <hi>Amadis)</hi> what fortune hath conducted you hither? How fares Madame <hi>Oriana,</hi> and all the other Ladies in her companie? Truſt me Sir, anſwered <hi>Graſandor,</hi> all are in good health, conſidering their griefe for your ſo ſudden parting from them: And by their aduice, I put my ſelfe vppon your queſt, with ſolemne vow, not to giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer till I found you; otherwiſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame <hi>Oriana</hi> could not haue liued three dayes, ſuch was her extreame ſorrow for your abſence. Yet ſhe conſidered very wel, that you would not haue parted ſo peremptorily, if ſome earneſt occaſion had not enforced it. My returne, ſaide <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> ſhall bee ſooner (perhaps) then ſhee expects. That will be no diſcontent to mee anſwered <hi>Graſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor:</hi> onely let vs ſtay heere ſixe or eight dayes, becauſe the Seas haue beene ſomewhat offenſiue to mee. With right good will, replyed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> for I would alſo haue my wounds thoroughly cured, before I did aduenture on any trauaile.</p>

                     <p>How <hi>Amadis</hi> being in the Iſland of the <hi>Red Tower,</hi> conferring with <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandor;</hi> eſpied a ſmall Foiſt on the Sea, which put into the Port, hauing people in her, that told them tidings of the Armie, which was gone for <hi>Sanſuegua,</hi> and to the Iſles of <hi>Landes,</hi> or the <hi>Profound Iſle.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon a day, as <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Graſandor</hi> walked together in priuat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence, concerning the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> being on the verie higheſt hill, or Rock of the <hi>Red Iſland:</hi> they deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a farre off on the Sea, a Foiſt of no great bigneſſe, making towards the Land. Hereupon, they began to deſcend, to know what perſons were in her, and no ſooner were they downe the Rocke; but one of their Squires (whom they had ſent before for news) returning backe, told them: that the veſſell was in the hauen, and it was a Maſter of the houſholde to <hi>Madaſima,</hi> for by that name hee had ſtiled him-ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely had he finiſhed this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but <hi>Nalfon,</hi> who was the man we now ſpeake off; came to meete them, and <hi>Amadis</hi> knew him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly: demanding of him, whether he went, and what newes hee could tell them. <hi>Nalfon,</hi> who likewiſe knew him perfectly, humbly ſaluted him, wondring not a little to ſee him in thoſe parts, where <hi>Balan</hi> commanded, and knowing alſo his hatred to him, becauſe hee was the man that ſlew his Father. Wherfore after ſome few courteſies paſſing betweene them, <hi>Nalfon</hi> ſaid. Truſt me my Lord, I would neuer haue enquired for you in this countrie, neither can I well imagine, what aduenture ſhould draw you hither. My honeſt friend, anſwered <hi>Amadis</hi> it was the will of Heauen to haue it ſo, and for what reaſon, I ſhall haue better leiſure to tell you: but firſt acquaint me, in what eſtate you left my brother <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Galuanes,</hi> as alſo if you met with <hi>Dragonis?</hi> My Lord, quoth <hi>Nalfon,</hi> they neuer were in better condition, and I ſhall tell you ſome things, that will content you.</p>
                  <p>Know then Sir, that after <hi>Galaor,</hi> and <hi>Dragonis</hi> were diſlodged from <hi>Sobradiſa,</hi> with their Armie: My Lord and Maſter <hi>Galuanes,</hi> well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Souldiers, which he had leuied in the Iſle of <hi>Monga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> came to ioyne with them, at a place commonly called, the Rocke of the <hi>Damoſell Enchantreſſe,</hi> which is on a Promentary farre in the Sea, I know not if euer you heard anie ſpeech thereof, or no. Yes that I haue replied <hi>Amadis, Garnate</hi> of the <hi>Dreadfull Dale</hi> heretofore told mee of it, how he being ſicke ſayled by this coaſt: but in regard of his great infirmitie then, hee could not make any proofe, of that which gladly he would haue done. Wherfore, I pray you diſcourſe (at large) what you know thereof, becauſe I haue beene credibly enformed, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Knights of name, haue bin loſt in that paſſage. On my Faith ſir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Nalfon,</hi> not anything I know ſhall be concealed from you, and then he thus began.</p>
                  <p>The common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ame is, that this Rock was ſo called by reaſon of a Damoſell there dwelling, who was (in her time) very curious in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all magicall Sciences, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7181:401"/>
grew ſo expert in them, that ſhee wrought wonderfull things, and farre beyond the power of nature. Among the reſt, ſhee erected there the moſt ſumptuous building that euer was ſeene, and afterward, ſhe preuailed ſo powerfully by her skil: that ſhe drew thither (were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo farre off) all Ships paſſing to <hi>Ireland, Norway, Sobradiſa,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Lands,</hi> or the <hi>Profound Iſle;</hi> they not hauing any power or meanes (what windes ſoeuer blew) to helpe themſelues, but (by meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint) were brought to take lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not farre from her abyding, whence they could not be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, except ſhee pleaſed. There ſhe ſtayed them, and compulſiuely kept them, taking of their marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes or goods, whatſoeuer liked her beſt: eſpecially errant Knights, if they had any aboard, and them ſhe would make (afterward) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate one with another, euen to death many times, and therein ſhe tooke very great delight.</p>
                  <p>But as it often happeneth, that ſuc as deceiue others, come (in the end) to bee deceiued themſelues: ſo ſhee of whom I ſpeake, hauing heaped together infinite treaſures, and by ſuch meanes as I haue rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thinking ſtill to liue by her Artes, and contrarie to the courſe of nature, as if ſhe had power and command ouer the Starres; was taken tardy in her owne ſtrength. For the awefull arme of Heauen, no longer ſuffering the miſchiefe, which (vndeſeruedly) ſhee had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed vpon many; did darken her vnderſtanding in ſuch ſort, that ſhe who was wont to abuſe the very beſt aduiſed, found her ſelfe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached, by one merely ignorant in ſuch skill, not thorow any ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity or ſubtiltie of ſpirit remayning in him, but plainely, as I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto you.</p>
                  <p>It came to paſſe, that among the number of Knights there by her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the man whom my inſtant report concerneth, borne in the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, ſhe became ſo conquered by loue, and ſo farre ſtrayed from her former liberty, only by the outward behauiour of this Knight, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Herein ſhee conceiued ſuch extraordinarie liking, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But he beeing diſcreete and well aduiſed, conſidered with himſelfe; that time would betray him in his amorous warfare, and the edge of her diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment might cut off all thoſe ſweet embraces.</p>
                  <p>Obſeruing well this ſudden lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned leſſon, hee contended with his owne humours, to ſhew her bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfaction then euer bee had done: to the end, that ſhe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his loue addicted more to her, then any other reſpect hee had of himſelfe, might ſo increaſe her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, as to hit the marke hee moſt aimed at. Perceiuing her flame to wexe fiercer and fiercer, and all in a ſettled perſwaſion of his fidelity; he earneſtly importuned her, that as his loue was no way alterable to he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: he might receiue the ſelfe ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from her, of no deceit on<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her ſide, but that they both ballanced an equall and true affection, as by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7181:402"/>
many ſolemne vowes and proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe had often ſwore vnto him. And as a teſtimony of of her loyall meaning in this caſe, he deſired no more of her, but his entire freedom, and to enioy the like libertie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, as when he was (conſtrained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) brought into that Iſle: whereto (at length) ſhe yeelded, and hence enſued her vtter ouerthrow.</p>
                  <p>For heere Sir I muſt tell you, that this proiect in the Knight, was to no other end, but only to be vtterly quitted of her, as well foreſeeing the mutabilitie and inconſtancy of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Being (on a day) deuiſing with her, on the higheſt peece of all the Rock, embracing and kiſſing hir as he was wont to doe, perceiuing place and oportunitie fit for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: hee thruſt her ſuddainlie backward from off the Rock, ſo that in falling downeward vpon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall crags and clifts, her body was quite torne in peeces, before it could get buriall in the Waues, which (at the length) ſwallowed them vp all. This being done, and the Knight nothing ſorie for it: he compaſſed the meanes to conuaie into his Shippe, whatſoeuer hee could carrie away from the Iſle, and with ſo many people as were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſet away from thence home to hi owne countrie.</p>
                  <p>Here I may not omit to tell you, that he was conſtrayned to leaue an enchanted treaſure behinde him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining yet (as is affirmed fathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) in one of the chambers of the great Pallace: no way able to bee ceazd on, by ſuch as ſince then haue landed there, not only to winne it by conqueſt, but alſo are debarred from entring the place where it is encloſed. And as yet, Serpents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire thither in winter, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue there likewiſe all ſummer, and hide themſelus there in very ſtrange manner. Moreouer, as I haue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly heard, the doores belonging to this Chamber, are continually faſt cloſed, and a ſharpe Sword (to forbid entrance) thwarting the way hauing on the one ſide certaine let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as red as blood, and thoſe on the other ſide as white as Snowe. Theſe ſtrange charracters are ſaide to ſignifie and declare the name of him, by whom (vndoubtedly) this aduenture is to be ended. And hee muſt draw out the Sword, there thruſt in vp to the hilts, and barring the paſſage between both the doors For then they will open of them-ſelues, as by common rumor it is reported in many places.</p>
                  <p>Very penſiue was <hi>Amadis,</hi> all the time as <hi>Nolfon</hi> had declared theſe newes, one while concluding with his thoughtes (whatſoeuer might enſue thereon) to trauaile thither, and eſſay the finiſhing of the enchantment, wherein ſo many worthy Knights had fayled. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly againe his opinion altered, being preſſed with an earneſt deſire of returning backe to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle.</hi> Notwithſtanding, he reſolued in the end, ſeeing hee was now ſo forward on the way, to paſſe on ſomewhat farther, yet hee made no noted or inſtant appearance thereof but ſeeming careleſſe and negligent of that which had been ſaid, falling into another kinde of conferrence, demanded of <hi>Nolfon,</hi> what way <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor</hi> and his Army tooke afterward? My Lord (quoth hee) after hee had ſtayed ſome few dayes in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, very neere vnto the Rock: he ſet ſayle directly for the <hi>Profound Iſle,</hi> as hoping to enter it by way of ſuprizall. But they of the country hauing ſome ſuſpition; before wee could come thither, had betaken themſelues to Armes, and awayted for vs vpon the ſhoare, where they
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7181:402"/>
found vs worke enough to doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we could compaſſe any means of landing. For one of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oſens to the late King, conducted the people, and had ſo animated them againſt vs; as you neuer ſawe men fight more courageouſly, nor with better iudgement.</p>
                  <p>But the valour of the Lords, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor, Galuanes,</hi> and <hi>Dragonis</hi> (they hauing leapt into the water vp to the chinne, and fighting with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantable reſolution) did ſo hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and embolden on our men in following them: that our enemies were enforced to retire, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all they could doe, wee entred in vpon them; but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great ſlaughter of our men, &amp; a wonderfull butchery of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie ſide, wee purſuing them ſtill into the Citie, where their chiefe and principall Captaine, was ſoon numbred among the dead. Then did we beleauger them on all ſides, which droue them to ſuch aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as (ſeeing themſelues deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a guide and leader) ſoone after they required a parlee, which accordingly was granted them.</p>
                  <p>For the effecting of this buſines, foure were delegated among them, who came to Prince <hi>Galaor</hi> and our other Captaines; with whom they ſo capitulated, that they yeelded themſelues. Prouided that their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie and goods might remaine intire vnto them: which was affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them willingly. And the very ſame day we entred into the Citie, where (before the weeke was fully expired) <hi>Dragonis</hi> was crowned King. Afterwarde, hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their homage, and oath of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all alleageance, as wel of the Lords, Knights and Gentlemen, as of the Commons in generall: Prince <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laor,</hi> and <hi>Galuanes</hi> my Maſteer, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that their departure thence would not be ſo ſoone as they had intended; diſpatched me towardes the Queen <hi>Briolania,</hi> as alſo to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſima,</hi> to acquaint them with all the good newes which I haue told you.</p>
                  <p>But heard you nothing (quoth <hi>Amadas)</hi> of <hi>Quedragant</hi> and <hi>Brunco?</hi> My Lord replied <hi>Nolfon,</hi> before I diſlodged from the Campe, ſome eſcaping from the Iſles of <hi>Landes,</hi> and from the Citie of <hi>Ara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Let it ſuffice then, that after the two knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle</hi> were aboard their Shippe, and ready to weigh Anchors: <hi>Amadis</hi> deſired <hi>Nolſon</hi> to furniſh him with a guide, that could conduct him to the Iſland of the <hi>Damoſell Enchantreſſe,</hi> becauſe he had a minde to ſee it. With all my heart anſwered <hi>Nolfon</hi> and I my ſelfe will beare you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie thither, if ſo you pleaſe to permit me. And one thing I can aſſure yee, that now is the beſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all the yeare, for ſeeing the ſingularities of the place: the ſtearn froſts and colds being already with-drawne, whereby horrible and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous creatures retire themſelues into their hoales, dennes, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerns in the Earth. It ſhall ſuffice me replied <hi>Amadis,</hi> to haue but one of your skillfull Mariners, and not to hinder you, in an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo ſerious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nolſon</hi> herein fulfilled his mind, deliuering him a Pilate of expert iudgement, and ſo, commending him to God: ſayled on to the Iſland of <hi>Mongaza,</hi> and <hi>Amadis</hi> with <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandor,</hi> directly to the Rock of the <hi>Damoſell Enchauntreſſe.</hi> So aptlie did the winds fit their purpoſe, that (within ſix dayes) they did diſcerne it, and ſaw it ſo high, that it ſeemed to them to be aboue the Cloudes. comming into the Port, there they found a Barque lying at Anchor, all alone, and no one to haue care of it: whereby they immagined, that they to whom it belonged, were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended vp the Rock, and feared no diſaſter of the veſſell. Then <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> being deſirous to attemp the aduenture by himſelfe; ſpake thus to <hi>Graſandor.</hi> My deare friend and companion, let me in treate you to attend mee heere till to morrow morning, by which time I may bee returned, or perhaps ſooner: And if my fortune ſtand faire, from aloft
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7181:403"/>
I will giue you ſome ſigne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to finde me. But if within three daies you heare no tydings of me: then aſſure your ſelfe, that mine enterpriſe hath ſucceded ill, &amp; then proceede in the reſt as you ſhall ſee occaſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Graſandor</hi> ſeeming ſomewhat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, thus anſwered. How? my Lord, do you think I haue not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enough, to endure what tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile ſoeuer can bee in this place, eſpecially, being in your company? where it would much more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, if I had but as little as the value of amity. I promiſe you dear friend, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> neuer any ſuch opinion of you, did once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into my minde, hauing knowen you in ſo many worthie actions; as deſeruedly beſtowes the eſteeme on you, to bee one of the beſt Knights in the worlde.

                  <p>So hee commanded a planke to be laide for landing, and they two only went aſhore (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This done, they beganne to mount the Rocke, by a little tracke ſomewhat rough and vneaſie, ſcrambling vp by little and little: till they came to an Hermitage, wherein ſtoode a Statue of Braſſe crowned, holding in both hands (iuſt before the breſt) a Table of Copper guilded, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were engrauen certaine Greeke Letters and Characters, eaſie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them to reade that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the language. And yet it was aboue two hundred yeares, ſince they had beene engrauen by the <hi>Damoſell Enchantreſſe:</hi> who was in her time, the moſt expert in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke Artes, that euer had beene ſince, and daughter to one named <hi>Finctor,</hi> of the Cittie of <hi>Arges,</hi> in the countrie of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now were our Knights ſo weary, and out of breath, as they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to goe no further: wherefore they ſate downe on a ſeate of ſtone, to obſerue the Statue more adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly. It appeared to them an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable peece of Arte, eſpecially the Table and Characters: which <hi>Amadis</hi> began to reade, as well hee could, although his ſtay in <hi>Greece</hi> was not long, when he conquered the Monſter <hi>Endriagus;</hi> and the writing on the Table, was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>The inſcription on the Table.
<q>
                        <p>At ſuch time as the Great Iſland ſhal flouriſh, and therein ſhall be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the flower of Chiualrie and of beauty, and the land gouerned by a moſt potent and magnanimious Prince: Then ſhall hee come from thence, to whom the Sword and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Treaſures are deſtined, and not (tell then) ſhall they come to any mans power.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Full well did <hi>Amadis</hi> perceiue, that this aduenture was not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for him, but perſwaded him-ſelfe, that it was reſerued for his ſonne <hi>Eſplandian</hi> onely, who was borne the faireſt and goodlieſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon liuing: neuertheleſſe, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it to himſelfe, and asked <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandor</hi> whether hee vnderſtood the inſcription, or no? No truely, quoth hee, for I neuer was in place where the language was ſpoken. Vpon my faith anſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> this is ſome very ancient Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: And then he tolde him all that it contained. I know not, replied <hi>Graſandor,</hi> wherefore it ſhould bee thus predicted, except it aymed only at your ſelfe: you being ſon to the moſt worthy Prince, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer girded ſword by his ſide, and

the very choyſeſt Lady for beautie of her time, as euidently may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, by the other eſpeciall beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties remayning in her. Therefore, let vs boldly aſcend vp higher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhall bee as much blame to you in forbearing to trie it, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in any other that ſhall dare to attempt it. Nor ſpeake I this without iuſt occaſion; becauſe my hope is, to ſee that by your meanes, which no man elſe in theſe dayes is worthie to ſee, <hi>Amadis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ſmile, perceiuing with what zeale <hi>Graſandor</hi> ſpake, and ſaid Seeing it muſt be ſo, let vs goe on then and vp to the Pallace, before darke night preuent vs in our deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                  <p>From the hermitage thus they parted, and followed ſtill the track that guided them: but with ſuch difficultie and daunger, as they had many downe ſlidings, and very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous falles. Yet worſe then all this befell them, for day light fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and they were enforced (by the nights extreame darkeneſſe) to ſtay vpon a little plaine till morning: where they lay downe ſo vneaſilie, as they could not take a iote of reſt. And therfore they fell into diſcours of the painefull vſurie Fortune now paid them, for the former pleaſures (borrowed of their friends) in the <hi>Encloſed Iſle.</hi> All which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> were it not for feare of <hi>Orianaes</hi> diſtaſte, and ſuſpition of the griefe wherein now ſhe may bee: happen to mee what may, I would goe ſee the Campe of <hi>Bruneo</hi> &amp; <hi>Agraies,</hi> before I returned to her.</p>
                  <p>Hereat <hi>Graſandor</hi> began to ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſaid. By my faith Sir, you will make her die with meere doubt fearing whether you be aliue or no. And ſo much the rather, becauſe I promiſed and ſwore to her, to bring you back againe with mee, ſo ſoone as I could finde you. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let me aduiſe you, and herein ſomewhat ouer-rule you, to obey her, rather then your owne raſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Afterward, according as we ſhall learne by others informations, we may either goe to them, or ſend ſome ſupplie, if neede require. I think (quoth <hi>Amadis)</hi> we may doe much better, at our parting hence, to ſhape our courſe for the Iſland of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> from whence I will ſend a Gentleman to <hi>Balan,</hi> reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his aſſiſtance for them: which I am ſure hee will performe in the beſt manner, and ſo we may (in the meane while) ſet on to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> to prepare entertainment for him, againſt he comes t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus our two Knights ſpent out the moſt part of the night, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times napping and nodding, and other whiles waking, till day appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: when vp they roſe, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp the Rocke againe, till they came to the entrance of a greater plaine, where they beheld huge ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of very antient buildings. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtill on, they came to an Arch of Marble, whereon ſtood a Statue of Alablaſter, being made for a Woman, and ſo ingeniouſly wrought, that nothing wanted but life it ſelfe. In her right hand, ſhee held a Pen, as if ſhee were readilie wrighting, and in her left hand, a role of Parchment, with Greeke let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereon, contayning theſe words.</p>
                  <p>The Inſcription on the Role.

                  <p>Behold, quoth <hi>Amadis,</hi> excellent knowledge deliuered in very fewe words, for if euery man vnderſtood

rightly, what graces heauen hath beſtowed vpon him: many would more addict themſelues to vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions, then they doe, and ſhunne thoſe vices which leade to perdition. So paſſing on farther they entred into a baſe Court, full of fragments of Collumnes, as well <hi>Ionick</hi> and <hi>Tuſcane,</hi> as <hi>Dorick.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, of many ancient <hi>Medalls,</hi> and perſonages ſo artificially carued, as it was impoſſible to looke on better.

                  <p>As he turned from one ſide to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, he came into a very goodly hall, ſo richly painted, as it was moſt wonderfull to behold, and looking about it: they perceiued an entrance into a faſt lookt vp chamber, hauing two doores of bright ſhining ſtone, in the midſt of which doores was a Sword ſo transfixed, as it paſſed quite thorow vp to the Croſſe.

For this prediction was ſet downe by her, who was not to be ſeconded by any (of her time) for moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intelligence in all Magicall Sciences.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hereby <hi>Amadis</hi> tooke occaſion to marke theſe red letters more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly, then formerly he had done, and called to minde, that <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had the verie like vpon his bodie: wherfore he reſolued aſſuredly that only he muſt end this meruaile, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, he demanded of <hi>Graſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> what was his opinion in this caſe? So helpe me God, quoth he, I vnderſtand well enough the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the white Letters: but for the redde, I am able to ſay iuſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Nor I (anſwered <hi>Amadis)</hi> albeit I imagine, that both you and I haue ſeene the verie like, vpon ſomebody that wee know. You ſay verie true, replied <hi>Graſandor</hi> for your ſonne as I haue heard, brought the like into the World with him from his mothers wombe, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in mine opinion, they are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame. Notwithſtanding, if you had not quickned my memorie, I ſhould neuer haue thought on it. And therefore make no complaint of your Fortune, if you faile in this enterpriſe: becauſe, for ought I can perceiue, you haue begot him, that muſt carrie this honor from you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> muſing to himſelfe while ſuddenly ſtarting ſaid. I am of your minde, for ſo haue I gathered, by the Table on the Image of Braſſe.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7181:405"/>
Return we then back againe, quoth <hi>Graſandor,</hi> and leaue the reſt to bee ended by him, to whom the deſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies haue made their promiſe. So we muſt bee inforced to doe, ſaide <hi>Amadis,</hi> albeit I am ſomewhat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that I may not carrie away his ſword with mee. By my faith, replied <hi>Graſandor,</hi> if you ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to get it, your hinderance may be more then you imagine; and yet it may fal out, not to proue ſo good a ſword as your owne. Moreouer, when I conſider how you obtained it: neuer could any Knight attaine to a fairer fortune, nor more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a man, than yours was then. This hee ſpake, in regard that <hi>Amadis</hi> wonne it, by approouing himſelfe to bee the moſt loyall and perfect louer, that euer loued: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as in the Second booke of this Hiſtorie, hath been oftentimes declared vnto yee.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, they returned backe by the ſame way they came, and paſſing againe among the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: <hi>Amadis</hi> ſtayed there a while, better to beholde them. The more hee looked on them, the more hee commended their rare perfections, both in moldings, friezes, &amp; chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, lying among the ruines of thoſe famous buildings. And no way could hee turne his eye, but he beheld many fractures of ſingular carued parſonages, the very muſcles obſerued to the life, and ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiue where occaſion required it: that (in his opinion) it reliſhed more of ſome diuinitie, then to be performed by the skill of man in workemanſhip.</p>
                  <p>As hee continued in theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, a knight armed with a white Armour, and holding his ſworde ready drawen, came to them, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly ſaluting them, as they did the like to him. Then he demanded of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether they were of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Iſle,</hi> or no? We are, anſwered <hi>Graſandor:</hi> but why doe you moue that queſtion? Becauſe (quoth the other) I found a Batque beneath, and men therein, who tolde mee, that two Knights belonging to the Pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> were aſcended vp this Rocke: but they concealed their names from mee, as I did mine from them. Nor deſire I any thing elſe, but peace and friend-ſhippe with them, beeing caſually come hither in purſuite of a knight, who (by trompery) is eſcaped from mee, with a Damoſell forcibly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by him. Friend, ſaid <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandor,</hi> in courteſie let me entreate you to take off your Helmet, or to tell vs your name. If you will ſwear to me, replied the Knight, whether you know my Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> or no, and that you will doe the like to mee: I am well contented, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you ſpeake but in vaine. By my faith, quoth <hi>Graſandor,</hi> we are two of the beſt friends hee hath, and therefore you may well be knowen to vs.</p>
                  <p>So the Knight diſarmed his head, ſaying: You may now knowe mee well enough, if you be ſuch as you haue ſworne your ſelues to mee. Hardly had hee concluded his wordes, but <hi>Amadis</hi> ran and caught him in his armes, ſaying. Brother <hi>Gandalin,</hi> is it poſſible that fortune ſhould cauſe vs to meet in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Much amazed was <hi>Gandalin,</hi> to ſee himſelfe thus embraced, and by a man vnknowne to him, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to coniecture who he ſhould be: wherefore <hi>Graſandor</hi> ſuddenly ſaid. Why how now <hi>Gandalin?</hi> Haue you forgotten your Lord <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis? Amadis?</hi> anſwered <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> may it bee poſſible? Then fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on his knee; whether he would or no, hee kiſſed his hand, before
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7181:405"/>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> could any way preuent him: but then demanded of him, how and by what meanes he came thither? Beleeue me my Lords, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Gandalin,</hi> your equalls in loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of affection, would gladly know as much concerning you, as you now demand of me, you being as farre from them, as this place is from their abyding. Neuertheleſſe, to giue you content, I will declare the whole truth vnto you.</p>
                  <p>Know then, that being with <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> and others, who are yet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the countries of <hi>Arauigne</hi> &amp; <hi>Sanſuegua,</hi> returning from a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell battayle, which the Kings Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew gaue vs at our entrance, and wherein many worthy men loſt their liues: one day (among other) a Damoſell belonging to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Norway,</hi> attired all in black, came into the Tent of <hi>Agraies,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him on her knees (in no mean plenty of teares) to giue her reſcue in a wrong done vnto her. <hi>Agraies</hi> cauſing her to riſe, and ſit downe by him, demanded the cauſe of her ſad complaint, and hee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe it ſo much as lay in him to doe. Alas Sir (quoth ſhe) you haue good reaſon to helpe mee, becauſe I am both a ſubiect and ſeruant to the King, who is father to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame <hi>Olinda</hi> your wife: for whoſe ſake and honour, I deſire you to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt mee with one of your Knights, for recouery backe of my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom the Lorde of the great Tower on the Sea ſhoare, hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly taken from mee, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to onely emboldened, becauſe I would not giue him her in mariage.

                  <p>Damoſell, anſwered <hi>Agraies,</hi> why doth not your King do you iuſtice, as (in right) to him belongeth? My Lord, quoth ſhe, he is ſo ouerſpent in yeares, and decayed in bodie, as hee is not able to gouerne himſelf, or any other: neither doth hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come forth of his bedde, only through his extreamitie of age and ſickneſſe. The man then you ſpeaks of, replyed <hi>Agraies,</hi> is his abyding farre from hence? No Sir (quoth ſhee) in leſſe ſpace then a day and a halfe, the winde ſitting conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, wee may by Sea eaſily ſayle thither. Then I made tender of my ſeruice, as willing to goe along with the Lady. But my Lord <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies</hi> would not conſent thereto: except I made him faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, of returning backe againe to him, after I ſhould haue combated the Knight, without attempting any further, if (with honour) I might ſafely doe it.</p>
                  <p>My promiſe made to that effect, and I ſufficiently furniſhed, I went aboard with the Damoſell, in a Barque which ſhee had purpoſely brought with her: and the Sea was ſo calme and fauourable to vs, that on the morrow (about mid-day) we tooke landing, and the Lady con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted mee thither where her daughter was detayned.

Tell thy maſter that hee muſt quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer a Damoſell, which hee forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hath taken from her which is in my companie, or yeelde mee a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he will not: otherwiſe, not a man ſhall iſſue forth, but he dies the death.

                  <p>I withdrew ſomewhat off, and tarried not long, but they of the Tower opened the gates, and forth came a Knight well mounted, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing on a yellow colourd Armour, and at the length of a carriere, hee called to me, ſaying. Knight, thou that (without any diſcretion) thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt mee that knowes thee not, ſay, what doeſt thou demand of mee? I anſwered, that I neither did or would threaten nor defie him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I vnderſtood the cauſe, why hee kept the daughter of the Lady here preſent with me) from her. Well, ſaid he, admit it were ſo, what is that to thee? I hope (quoth I) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge her wrong, and to make thee reſtore her againe, whether thou wilt or no. We ſhall ſoone try that, ſaid the other: And ſo giuing his horſe the ſpurre, hee came running mainly againſt me, as I did the like to him, couching our Launces ſo conueniently, that the ſhiuers of them flew vp into the ayre very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly.</p>
                  <p>Setting hand to our ſwordes, a tough battaile began betweene vs, which continued (almoſt) to the euening: but in the end, the right being on my ſide, the victory fell to mee, hauing him downe vnder my foot, and my ſword ready to ſmite off his head. But he calling for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, prayed me to ſaue his life, &amp; he would do whatſoeuer I would haue him. Why then ſaid I, deliuer this Lady her daughter againe, and ſweare neuer to take maide or wife contary to their owne liking: which faithfully he vowed to doe. Here-upon pretending to goe fetch the Damoſell forth, hee went into the Tower, and here he ſtayed not long but I ſaw him embarqued on the Sea, armed as I left him, and the Damoſell with him, hee calling out thus aloude to mee Knight, wonder not that I haue broken my word with thee, for the power of Loue hath thereto compelled mee, being not able to liue one houre, without her whom I thus carrie away with me. And ſeeing it is out of mine owne abilitie, either to conquer or gouerne my ſelfe: I pray thee, finde no fault with this that I haue done. And becauſe neither thou, nor her Mother, ſhall hope hereafter to ſee her any more: behold, I will now conuey her to ſuch a place, where thou ſhalt neuer heare any tidings of her.</p>
                  <p>Speaking theſe words, he rowed away, and the Damoſel wrung, and wreſted her hands, whereat I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſuch griefe, that death was much more pleaſing to mee then Life. For the mother beganne to make ſuch ſtrange Lamentations, tearing both her hayre and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; caſting in my teeth, that ſhe had receiued more wrong by mee then from the Knight himſelfe. For (quoth ſhe) while my daughter was in the Tower, there alwayes was hope of recouering her againe: but now, all expectation is vtterly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, being carried to a place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, and whereof you are the

ſuch, and ſo vnfayned is my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis,</hi> who had many thouſand times felt himſelfe in the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, began to take compaſſion on him: Neuertheleſſe, thus hee anſwered. Although what you haue ſaid, is in ſome meaſure excuſable: yet the Knight that hath purſued in ſearch of you, may not faile in his promiſe made to the Ladie, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe hee deſerues to bee repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended before all worthie perſons: I know it well ſir, replied the knight and am likewiſe contented to put my ſelfe into his power, prouided that he will bee ſo kinde vnto me as carry me back againe to the Ladie, and there pleade my cauſe for mee, that ſhe will be pleaſed to ſuffer me enioy her daughters as my wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now ſhe hath made choiſe of me before any other. Is that true? quoth <hi>Amadis</hi> to the Damoſell. Yes ſir, ſaid ſhee, albeit heretofore hee detayned me againſt my will neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe obſeruing the truth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of his affection, I am now fully minded to forget all former vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences, both pardoning, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to accept him in marriage. Beleeue me ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> I am very glad of it, and <hi>Gandalin,</hi> if you will follow mine aduice, worke with the Mother ſo much as you can, that this happy wedding may bee effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. I ſhall Sir (quoth hee) with all my heart, and reioyce to ſee ſo good a concluſion.</p>
                  <p>So they went on, to returne to the Sea ſhoare: but the night pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting them, they were enforced to ſtay in the Hermitage, diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the next morning downe to their men, who awaited their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the Barque. As <hi>Gandalin</hi> tooke his leaue, <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Graſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> intreated him, to recommend them to <hi>Agraies,</hi> and their other friends there: aduiſing him and them alſo, to returne ſpeedily to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> where they ſhould heare other tidings. Thus <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> ſayled thence to the Lady mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where, hauing deliuered both her daughter and the Knight: hee laboured the matter ſo effectually, that (notwithſtanding all former ſpleene) the mother quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her Daughters minde. <hi>Gandalin</hi> was not a little amazed hereat, but remembring, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens conſtancie was as certaine, as the continuall turning tides of the Ocean: hee could not chuſe but ſmile, and leauing them to their further affaires, went aboarde the Barque, returning to <hi>Agrates,</hi> who was highly pleaſed with <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalins</hi> good ſucceſſe, as alſo his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate meeting with <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Graſandor</hi> in ſo ſtrange a manner.</p>
                  <p>But now wee muſt change our purpoſe, to them that were bound for the <hi>Encloſed Iſle.</hi> with an earneſt deſire to ſee their wiues, whom they had left in no meane melancholie, only for their abſence. <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Graſandor,</hi> departing from the <hi>Iſland</hi> of the <hi>Damoſell Enchantreſſe,</hi> found the Seas and Windes ſo fauourable that (without any impeachment whatſoeuer) they entred the port of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle.</hi> As they mounted vp the Rock, and came to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, which <hi>Amadis</hi> had cauſed to bee builded: they ſaw before the Gate, a Damoſell attired all in mourning, and two Squires with her, holding their Pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They ſaluted her very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, as ſhe did the like to them, and then they entred into the Church to performe their Oriſons: in the meane while, the Damoſell enquired of one of the Monks there ſtanding, what they were. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man anſwered her, that the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7181:407"/>

                  <p>When the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Alas, Lord <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis</hi> are not you he, who knowes how to giue remedie to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Beleeue it Sir, quoth ſhee, my knees ſhall neuer part from this earth, nor mine armes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your legges (except thereto you forcibly conſtraine me) till you grant what I am to demand of you. <hi>Amadis</hi> perceiuing both her impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie and obſtinacie, knew not wel what to ſay, fearing to ſtand obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his promiſe, for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of ſome ſuch matter, which well he might repent at leaſure: as indeed hee did. Neuertheleſſe, he was ſo moued to compaſſion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her teares flowe forth ſo inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly: that hee granted what ſhee deſired, requiring that hee might know her name.

                  <p>Sir Knight, I pray you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that Lord <hi>Amadis</hi> hath made this promiſe to me, who am the wife to <hi>Archalaus</hi> the Enchanter, and him hee keepeth in priſon, beeing the greateſt enemy hee hath in the world. But if Heauen were ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, this hatred may conuert it ſelfe into the greater amity, by ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py meanes as may bee wrought. Much offended was <hi>Amadis,</hi> to ſee himſelfe deceiued by the ſubtilty of this woman, and gladly hee would haue reuoked his promiſe ſworne vnto her: notwithſtanding, hee could not blame the woman, who had iuſt reaſon to imploy her vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt paines, for the benefit of her husband, as euery good wife elſe ought to doe, and thus hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her. By the faith I beare to God (Ladie) you haue made too large a requeſt to me, for in deſpite of any perill that can come to me, I would not conſent to ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but only in regarde of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe I haue made yee, and it is the firſt that euer I granted to Ladie or
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7181:408"/>
Damoſell, whereof I repented my ſelfe afterward.</p>
                  <p>With theſe words, hee and <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandor</hi> mounted on / horſebacke, commanding the wife of <hi>Archalaus,</hi> to follow him to the Pallace of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollidon:</hi> but before they could get thither, <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Mabila</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of their arriuall. What pleaſure they conceiued, by this their ſo long expected comming, it is impoſſible for me to expreſſe: yet ſuch it was, that not only they, but all the Ladies and Gentlewomen went to attend their entrance into the Parke. At their meeting, there needes no other queſtion to bee made, but the like kiſſes and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces paſſed betweene them, euen as yong married couples vſe to doe, vpon the very day of their choiſeſt delighting, to yeelde the truer te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of their Faiths firmneſſe. And theſe ſweete ceremonies vſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to their Chambers, where (no doubt) but they paid ſound ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearges, for their ſo long abſence from their ſweete Miſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow morning, being at Maſſe, the wife of <hi>Archalaus</hi> came againe, and fell before the feete of <hi>Amadis,</hi> intreating him to performe his promiſe, which hee had ſworne to on her husbands behalfe, and which (accordingly) hee yeelded vnto. Afterwarde, before he would ſit downe at the Table, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the traine of Ladies, hee went to ſee him in his Cage, where he found his head and beard to bee as white as Snow, extending down ſo farre as his girdle. Vnfaſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hee appeard to be in euery part, great, crooked, and ſomewhat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but his lookes fiery and much to bee feared. Wherfore, ſo ſoone as the Ladies beheld him, they were greatly affraid of him: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Princeſſe <hi>Oriana,</hi> who formerly had made proofe of his mallice, when hee carried her away, and when <hi>Amadis</hi> came to her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py reſcue, as hath beene declared in the firſt Booke of this our famous Hiſtorie.</p>
                  <p>Now although <hi>Archalaus</hi> ſaw his wife among the reſt: yet he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make no account thereof, which cauſed <hi>Amadis</hi> to aske him, whether he knew her: or no? Yes, (quoth he) I know her. Art thou pleaſed (ſaid <hi>Amadis)</hi> at her coming hither? Sufficiently ſaid he, if it be about my buſineſſe, otherwiſe, I take no care at all. For conſidering the condition wherein I haue liued, euer ſince I fell into thy handes (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolued to ſuffer patiently, any harme whatſoeuer can happen to me) my heart is ſetled, and my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion confirmed (in meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of thee) to liue thus, and no otherwiſe, till I die. But liſten mee ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> if for her ſake, I ſhould ſet thee at libertie: wouldſt thou accept it ſo thankfully, as to extend the like to me, if my caſe were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to thine now? Yes, quoth he, if thou didſt ſend for her on thine owne inſtigation, but if by her wit and cunning ſhe hath preſumed on this enterpriſe, and wone ſome promiſe from thee againſt thy liking I neither can or ought render any thankes to thee therefore, becauſe good workes done perforce, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly (of themſelues) doe loſe their merit, and therefore I pray thee to tell me the truth of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amadis</hi> did then declare vnto him, how hee mette with her at the Monaſterie, in what manner ſhee had deceiued him, and gotten his deliuerance. Howſoeuer things haue paſt, ſaid <hi>Archalaus;</hi> I will plainely tell thee my minde. If thou hadſt taken pittie on me in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania,</hi> when I my ſelfe deſired mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7181:408"/>
of thee: aſſure thy ſoule, that all the remainder of my life, I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued thy bounden and perfect friend. But at this inſtant, thou being conſtrained to releaſe me, without any deſire of mine, or ſute made on mine owne behalfe for it, but in meer performance of thy promiſe: ſo will I receiue this freedome (if thou wilt let me enioy it) and with as much content as thou deſerueſt. Otherwiſe, thou mighteſt imagine mee dull, and of very ſilly courage, if, in ſteed of ſo good occaſion, as I haue to hate thee, I ſhoulde ſhewe my ſelfe thankefull for ſo many iniuries as thou haſt done mee.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt highly pleaſed me, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Amadis,</hi> in not diſguiſing thy venemous malice towards mee, and I deſerue no blame for thy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance: for I was reſolued, a long while, to kept thee thus mued vp, as thinking it very reaſonable, to make theee ſuffer the paine iuſtly due to thee, rather then by releaſing thee, thou ſhouldeſt torment good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as heretofore thou haſt done. Neuertheleſſe, ſince I promiſed thy freedome to thy wife, I will ſend thee hence, and cauſe thee to bee conuayed to ſome place of ſafety: deſiring thee (ſo much as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for mee to doe) that although, neither in will nor word, thou canſt finde in thy heart to pardon me; yet thou wouldeſt not treacherouſly beguile me. At leaſtwiſe, doe not hereafter vſe thy wonted cruelties, to ſuch as neuer did offer thee any diſpleaſure: which the rather thou oughteſt to doe, for his ſake, that hath beſtowed this inſtant fauour on thee, &amp; gaue thee releaſe, when thou didſt leaſt looke for it. I know well enough replied <hi>Archalaus,</hi> that in any thing concerning thee, I ſhal exerciſethe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Wonderfully were all the Ladies amazed, to heare the olde villaine ſpeake ſo ſawcily to <hi>Amadis,</hi> and much they did reproue him for it, but tolde them: It was naturally his humour to be obſtinate, &amp; they muſt endure it ſo wel as they could; but for the reſt hee would be ſure to keep promiſe with them.</p>
                  <p>So they departed out of the Chamber, leauing the wife of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalaus</hi> there to keepe him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie till the next morning, and then <hi>Amadis</hi> ſent for <hi>Yſanio,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, to releaſe <hi>Archalaus</hi> out of his iron Cage, to giue him horſe and Armour, and guide both him and his, farre from the limittes of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> and with ſuch ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as his wife might receiue no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment. <hi>Yſanio</hi> performed his charge, bringing him and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſo farre as his Caſtle of <hi>Valde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine:</hi> where, taking leaue of him, <hi>Archalaus</hi> returned him many thankes, ſaying. Sir, tell <hi>Amadis</hi> from me, it belongs only to cruell and ſauage beaſts, to be mewed vp in Cages of iron, as I all this while haue beene, and not to Knights, ſuch as hee knowes I am. But bid him beware of mee, I hope very ſpeedily to be reuenged on him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in deſpight of that olde whore <hi>Vrganda</hi> the <hi>Vnknowne,</hi> in whom he repoſeth too much truſt. I rather thinke anſwered <hi>Yſanio,</hi> that I muſt take paines againe to keep you faſt, ſo long as already I haue done in your Cage.</p>
                  <p>With theſe words they parted, <hi>Yſanio</hi> and his traine returning the ſame way they came, euen till they ariued at the <hi>Encloſed Iſle:</hi> and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7181:409"/>
(ſooner after) came <hi>Darioletta,</hi> with her companie, being all moſt kindly entertayned. But now wee muſt alter our preſent diſcourſe, to tell you what <hi>Balan</hi> did, after that <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Graſandor</hi> had left him, in the Iſland of the <hi>Red Tower.</hi>

                  <p>About fifteene dayes, or three weekes, after the two Knights of the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> were diſlodged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Red Tower;</hi> the Giant <hi>Balan,</hi> finding his wounds almoſt cured, and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to walke about his Chamber, forthwith gaue order, that <hi>Dariolet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes</hi> Shippe ſhould be made readie, becauſe ſhee and all her companie might ſafely ſayle to the <hi>Encloſed Iſle,</hi> with <hi>Brauor</hi> his Sonne. Manie goodly Iewells and gifts he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them, and being earlie embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued on a Munday morning, they ſet ſayle and away, and landed as you haue already heard. The Giant being returned to his Caſtle, gaue preſently charge, to leuy and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter men in all parts of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the ſuccour of <hi>Agraies,</hi> who ſtill held the Citty of <hi>Arauigne</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiged, and long he delayed not, but all things were prepared, his ſhips well munited, and put forth to Sea.</p>
                  <p>So furtherous was both the wind and weather, that on the tenth day following, they landed where the Armie of the <hi>Encloſed Iſles</hi> Knights were encamped. No ſooner were <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Galuanes Agrates,</hi> and the reſt aduertiſed thereof, and that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> himſelfe was come on ſhoare: but they mounted on horſe-backe, to goe meete and welcome him, with a worthie troupe attending on them, for they knew before, all that had paſſed between <hi>Amadis</hi> &amp; him. As they came neere they embraced each other, and the firſt that ſtept to <hi>Balan,</hi> was <hi>Galuanes,</hi> of whom the Giant (not knowing him) deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if hee were <hi>Galaor,</hi> the brother to <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom he was very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſee? No ſir (quoth hee) I am <hi>Galuanes</hi> your friend and kinſ-man, if ſo you pleaſe to accept mee. Ha, my Lord and Couſin ſaid <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> I had not beene ſo tardy from your company, and my deare Coſin <hi>Madaſima</hi> alſo, but for your friend-ſhippe with him, who then was my moſt deadly enemie: yet now wee are become ſo good friends, that I loue you ſo much the more, and for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>Cloſe by him was <hi>Galaor,</hi> who preſenting himſelfe to <hi>Balan,</hi> bad him moſt louingly welcome. The Giant vnderſtanding what and who he was, did him very humble reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſaying. My Lord, I ſtand ſo engaged to your Noble brother, as no Gentleman in the world can bee more his, then I am, and yours like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And ſurely wonder muſt now ceaſe in mee, concerning the fame and renowne publiſhed of you both becauſe I neuer ſaw any man more truely reſemble him then (in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) you effectually doe. But to ſpeake truely, there is no other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene yee: but that you are ſomewhat taller, and Lord <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> a little more corpulent. By this time they were come to the Campe and his lodging appointed in the Tent of <hi>Galuanes:</hi> which was ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly beautifull, and farre more rich then any of the reſt.</p>

and, becauſe it waxed ſomewhat late, being alſo a priuate night of ſupper, all bad him good reſt except <hi>Galaor</hi> and <hi>Galuanes,</hi> who ſtayed ſtill to keepe him company.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow morning, <hi>Balan</hi> being deſirous to round the Cittie, to obſerue the beſt ſtrength thereof, and which place was fitteſt for breach, or entrance: <hi>Galaor</hi> and hee walked very early together, ſo couertly as they could. But when <hi>Balan</hi> had well conſidered the Bulwarkes all about, the platformes and Rampires, within the depth of the ditches, and (aboue all elſe) what number of men were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, with their ſtore of victuals, and neceſſary munition; it appeared a Citty to him, very hardly to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced. But then <hi>Galaor</hi> told him, that the moſt part of the Souldiers were bandied againſt the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and the inhabitants againſt them: Whereby (quoth hee) this diſcord is ſufficient for their ruine vtterly. Conſidering withall, that (as wee haue receiued aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) their hearts are ſo deiected, as they dare make no more ſallies forth vpon vs, in regard of the great loſſes they haue had already. More-ouer, our men are reſolued to die in the aſſault, or they will enter: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, wee will not permit them to haue ſo much head, fearing their loſſe, and reſpecting our hope (day by day) of their ſurrender, the reaſons before alleaged conſidered, and our detayning their King here priſoner with vs alſo. Beleeue mee Sir, ſaid <hi>Balan,</hi> you ſtand vpon very great apparances, neuertheleſſe, if my aduiſe were worthy to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I would giue them no longer time of reſpite: But attempt our fortune to morrow morning, and ſee what lookes they will ſet vpon vs, in a bolde ſudden and ſprightlie aſſault.</p>
                  <p>So long laſted this diſcourſe, as it brought them to the Campe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies,</hi> where meeting with <hi>Enill</hi> he ſaluted <hi>Balan,</hi> ſaying. My Lord, the Prince <hi>Agraies,</hi> entreates you, (being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n this forwardneſſe) that you would ſee the King <hi>Arauigne,</hi> here priſoner in my Tent: becauſe hee is deſirous to ſpeake with you, as hee hath made knowne to the Prince. I am well contented an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Balan,</hi> for (perhaps) this comming of mine, may promiſe ſome good agreement with him. So they went all three to the King <hi>Arauigne,</hi> whom they found atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with his guard: But ſo ſoone as <hi>Balan,</hi> ſaw him, he ſet his knee to the ground, and kiſſed his hand. The King tooke him vp, ſaying: he was moſt heartily welcome. And becauſe they would conferre pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately on their affaires, the others left them alone, and departed thence.</p>
                  <p>Then King <hi>Arauigne</hi> demanded of him, what hee conceiued of his hard Fortune? And breathing forth a ſigh, ſufficient to haue broken a bigger heart: hee ſtood along while ſilent, as being vnable to deliuer a word, till at laſt, thus he ſpake. Ah my deare friend <hi>Balan,</hi> if your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mandafabull</hi> were now liuing, how Irkeſome would my miſhap be to him? And to ſpeake truely, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are mightilie altered ſince his death. For, it is not fully a yeare, ſince I ſtood vpon no meane tearms of being the very greateſt King in all the Weſt: but now, I am bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the pooreſt and moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man in all the World. How Sir? replied <hi>Balan,</hi> it ſeemes you diſtruſt the mercy of the almighty in whoſe power it is, to diſpoſe of you as beſt liketh him. If Fortune haue once frowned on you, is her wheele ſo

                  <p>Walking on along with him, hee beganne thus againe. I knowe very well Sir, that hardly can you expreſſe conſtancie or courage, in ſuch caſes of ſo ſharpe affliction, and vneaſie to bee endured, as your impriſonement is. Yet I can deſire no better experience therein, then the like misfortune hath miniſtred to mee, in permitting mee to bee vanquiſhed by the ſame man, that was the worker of your downefall. Notwithſtanding, let mee take it ill or well, bee pleaſed or offended at my foyle: I ſee no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but only to arme my ſelfe with patience, and ſooner to forget the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iurie I haue receiued, then my ſelfe. For the reſt, I am of opinion that it is poſſible, to treate on ſome good agreement betweene you and theſe Princes: who (I am perſwaded) will therein liſten to you, if ſuch a motion proceede from your ſelfe. How can that be done (quoth the King) except in forgoing all, which they pretend to haue conquered from me: and I had rather die, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the name of an impriſoned King, then to liue a begger at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>
                  <p>If after death, ſaide <hi>Balan,</hi> life were eaſie to bee recalled backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I ſhould ioyne with you in this opinion: but hauing nothing dearer to vs in this worlde, wee ſhould preſerue it ſo long as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for vs. My worthy friend <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> replied the the King, doe with mee what you pleaſe, into your hands I commit my ſelfe, my life, my goods, &amp; honour: beſeeching you intirely, to remember my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in ſuch nature, as I make no doubt but you will. Now becauſe they ſaw <hi>Enill</hi> comming in to them: they altred their diſcourſe, and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> taking leaue of him, went to finde <hi>Galuanes</hi> and <hi>Galaor,</hi> who ſtaied his returne in the Tent of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There hee declared, what ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had paſt between him and the King <hi>Arauigne.</hi> And in my minde, quoth he, conſidering the humor wherein I left him, I thinke it were good to make him ſome offer, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him ſome countrie of his own for a place of retirement, where hee may weare out the remainder of his dayes: and be contented to reſigne vp all the reſt. The whole company was well pleaſed heere-with, and highly allowed the aduiſe of <hi>Balan:</hi> for to ſpeake vnpartially, hee was one of the wiſeſt men, and as ſound in iudgement, as any where elſe was to be found. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they entreated him, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate this matter with <hi>Arauigne,</hi> committing all to his diſcretion: becauſe indeede, they themſelues were halfe tyred, and grew wearie of the warre.</p>
                  <p>On the next morning, hee went to the King <hi>Arauigne,</hi> and (among diuerſe others remonſtrances) told him, how at his requeſt, and only by his meanes, hee had ſo well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed with the Princes of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: that they were all contented, to leaue him parte of the Iſles of <hi>Landes,</hi> in full and intire ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Which liked him well, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it was much better for him, to continue King of a little, then to be Lord of nothing. Hereupon the City was ſurrendred, and certaine Shippes and victuals were giuen him, for his retreate into the Iſle of <hi>Liconia:</hi> And the very ſame day,

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7181:412"/>
him. Not a little amazed was the Queene, when ſhee heard of this ſtrange and vnexpected accident, which made her fall downe into a trance: but her Ladies and Gentle-women being at hande, cut her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and quickly recouered life in hir againe. Then ſending for King <hi>Arban,</hi> and <hi>Cendill de Ganote,</hi> ſhee told them all that the Kings Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer had imparted to hir. But they fearing further to offend her ſeemed to make ſmal account of it, perſwading her, that the Forreſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long and large, and very thickly ſet with huge Woodes: hee might there looſe himſelfe for a while, yet afterwardes returne well enough home. No, neuer, ſaid the Queen. His horſe to be found, and no news of him? what anſwere you to that? Madam, quoth King <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ban,</hi> it appeares very likely, that the trees and buſhes ſtanding ſo thick, as no meane hinderance to his ſport, hee therefore left his horſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words did ſomewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Queene, but yet her opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went quite contrary to his ſaying, and therefore, making a ſhew of ſome other buſineſſe, they returned to their lodgings, to Arme them-ſelues, and aduiſing other Knights (there preſent) to follow them, they entred into queſt of the King. But all was in vaine, for they could heare no tidings of him: ſo remayned the Queene in ſadnes till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when <hi>Grumedan</hi> and <hi>Giontes</hi> (being returned from their voyage) came to ſee her. She demanded of them, if they had met with the king? No truely Madam, quoth they, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did wee know of his loſſe, till ſome of the Citty acquainted them therewith, but we intend to follow in the ſearch of him. On my faith, ſaid ſhe, I finde my ſelfe in ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of minde, as I muſt needes goe with you: for abiding heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, I ſhall die with extreamity of ſorrow. But if eyther wee can finde him, or heare any news of him, it will ſhorten my griefe: otherwiſe, it will be ſome eaſe to mee, to endure any toyle or trauell whatſoeuer, rather then deſolately continue here.</p>
                  <p>So ſhe ſent for two Palfrayes her ſelfe mounting vpon the one, and the wife to <hi>Brandoynas</hi> on the other riding on in queſt of the King, with the two knights. From place to place they trauailed, but they could heare no news at all, and on the third day following, they met with King <hi>Arban</hi> very penſiue, and his Horſe ſo wearie, as hardly was hee able to goe. Then the Queene aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, if hee had heard any thing of the King? Madam, quoth hee, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as much as when I left you, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſtand in doubt, that he is ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by ſome treaſon, and carried out of this countrie. Long agoe it is ſince I foreſaw and ſuſpected this accident, and if he would haue been ruled by mee, this had neuer happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him. I euermore diſſwaded him, yea, with teares, and entire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, neuer to wander ſo alone in doubtfull and deceiuing Forreſts where infinite vnlooked for daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers lie hid; but hee would neuer like my aduiſe.</p>
                  <p>As hee would haue proceeded on further, the Queene fell downe in a ſwound from her Horſe: But <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan</hi> ſuddenly alighting, tooke her vp in his Armes, and ſpeech ſoone after came to hir againe, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering a very vehement ſigh, ſhee ſaid.

Here-upon, hauing planted Gariſons in all needefull places, they ſayled thence with ſo faire a winde: that they landed at the Pallace of <hi>Apoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the very ſame day as <hi>Brandoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> arriued there.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Amadis</hi> was comforting <hi>Oria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> by reaſon of the news formerly receiued; the comming of theſe Knightes was made known to him: but hee being loath to leaue the Princeſſe alone, intreated <hi>Graſandor</hi> to goe meete them, and acquaint them with the occaſion of his ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behinde, which accordingly he performed, finding them in good forwardneſſe on the way. Then he declared to them, what hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in charge from <hi>Amadis,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring them to excuſe him, if this day did not alow them to ſee him: but early the next morning hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7181:413"/>
to viſite them. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the affaires they came about, required ſome ſpeed &amp; dilligence, they entred into Councell, and <hi>Brandoynas</hi> was called before them all: where amply he declared, what he could ſay concerning the Kings loſſe, and in what dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hee had left the Quene. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny opinions paſſed among them, but at length it was reſolued: that they all ſhould purſue the queſt of him, both by Sea and Land, hoping Fortune would be no leſſe fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them herein, then heereto-fore ſhee had beene in the like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely had they concluded on this deliberation, but one of their Squires came and tolde them, that a Ladie was come forth of the great Serpent, and (in their opinion) it was <hi>Vrgania</hi> the <hi>Vnknowen.</hi> If it be ſhee ſaid <hi>Amadis,</hi> then the caſe will goe well with vs. So they all ſet forwarde, and met her (almoſt) at the Parkes entrance, mounted on a goodly Palfrey, which her two Dwarffes led by the bridle reines. The firſt ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, was <hi>Galaor,</hi> whom ſhee kindly ſaluted, and all the reſt, and being in the midſt among them, ſhe thus began. How now Lords? did not I lately tell you, that I ſhould finde you heere againe aſſembled in this place, about ſome buſineſſe then vnknowne to you? You did Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, anſwered <hi>Galaor,</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it very well, ſo doth Madame <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> likewiſe, who wil not be a little ioyfull for your ariuall. And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to comfort her (quoth ſhee) is the cauſe of my now comming.</p>
                  <p>So they entred into the Pallace, and being diſmounted from horſe-backe, they conducted her to the chamber of the Princeſſe; who ſo ſoone as ſhee ſawe her, ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e and fell at her feet, and weeping inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, ſaid. Alas madame, you that knowe future accidents, as well as them preſent, why did you not take order, for the King my fathers miſ-fortune, hee beeing your ſo deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed friend? I may well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelfe, that when you fayle him, his caſe is vtterly voide of any remedie.</p>
                  <p>Madame, anſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> I pray you doe not thus diſcomfort your ſelfe. Know you not, that the more men are mounted to high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the more ſubject they are to as great tribulations? Although wee are all made of one and the ſame ſubſtance, all obliged to vices and paſſions, yea equall alike to death: yet the omnipotent Lord of all, hath made vs diuerſe, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying the goods of this world. To ſome hee giues authority; others are ſubiect to ſeruility and vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. Some are made poore and very miſerable, others enioy aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and proſperity, and all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne good pleaſure. So worthy Madame, comparing the great bleſſing, you now enioy, with ſuch ſorrowes and vexations as you haue ſuſtained, put all your preſent af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ictions into one ſeale, and your paſſed fortunes into another, and they will no way be anſwerable in weight. As for the King your father, I knewe (long agoe) this which hath happened to him, and yet notwithſtanding, I could not help it. For ſo it was appointed by diuine pre-ſcience, who (in time) will alſo permit: that he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home againe into his owne countrey, with as much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as euer heretofore hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed.</p>
                  <p>Then conuerting her ſpeeches to <hi>Amadis,</hi> &amp; others there preſent, thus ſhee proceeded. When I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7181:414"/>
laſt from his companie, I did then aſſure yee, that at ſuch time as <hi>Eſplandian</hi> ſhould receiue his order of Knight-hood, I would meete you againe in this place, for this cauſe, to keepe promiſe both with you, and him, and to diſcharge you of a labour you are entring into: I am come hither as you ſee. And this I tell you, that if all the men this day liuing, and ſo many more as ſhall come hereafter, doe attempt the queſt of king <hi>Liſuart,</hi> and to deliuer him out of the place where hee is: they looſe all their paines. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let mee aduiſe you to deſiſt from the promiſe you haue made each to other. Requeſting you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, that you will all be my gueſts in the great Serpent, with <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Telanque, Manelie,</hi> the King of <hi>Dacia,</hi> and <hi>Ambor,</hi> Sonne to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griote,</hi> preſently giuing order for your Horſes, for the houre now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites vs.</p>
                  <p>They not daring to denie her, did as ſhee commanded, and giuing good reſt to <hi>Oriana,</hi> accompanied her to the Sea ſide: where they found a Barque ready, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied them to the place where the great Serpent lay. Entring therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they left their horſes in the great Hall, where taking <hi>Eſplandian</hi> and his companions with her, ſhee led them into a Chappell, to performe their watch and prayer, according to the ancient cuſtome, before any man might be made a Knight. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſhe returned againe to the reſt, and bad them ſit downe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which they found ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them, and in moſt royall manner. The tables being with-drawne, ſhe ſent them to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with them that watched in the Chappell. Then ſhee and her two kinſewomen, <hi>Soliſa</hi> and her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, followed them, <hi>Vrganda</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Habbit or Coate of Male, very black, <hi>Saliſa</hi> an Helmet, of the ſame colour, and the third a ſhield anſwerable thereto.</p>
                  <p>Now, albeit (at the beginning) all other Knightes were armed with white Armour: yet would ſhee needs haue him to differ from them in this manner. So ſoone as ſhee was entred the Chappell, ſhee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Eſplandian</hi> to her, ſaying. Moſt happy yong Gentleman, ſee what accoutraments I haue brought for you, as teſtimonies of the power, wherewith your heart will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee enueloped, partaking (in ſome meaſure) with the naturall diſpoſition of the king your grand-father. Moreouer, it is to put you in minde, that as other (when they are made Knights) receiue this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor with white Armour, and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poliſhed, in ſigne of ioy and cheerefulneſſe: ſo theſe thus black and vnſightly, are beſtowed on you by deſtinie, to remember you (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times) of thoſe ſorrows and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, wherein all your friends are at this preſent. So they three armed him from head to foote, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Sword excepted, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Amadis</hi> his opinion therein. By my faith Madam, quoth he, if he had a Sword, hee were in caſe (me thinkes) both to defend himſelfe, and to aſſayle any other.</p>
                  <p>You know anſwered <hi>Vrganda,</hi> as well, or better then any other in this troup, where one hath been kept for him aboue two hundred years paſt and you haue ſeene it in the Rock of the <hi>Damoſell Enchauntreſſe</hi> who left it there (by apointment of the fates) only for him. And therefore hee muſt needes goe thither to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it, for I dare aſſure you, hee will performe ſuch actions of arms, as ſhall eclipſe the bright fames of many that haue ſhined moſt cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7181:414"/>
in all partes of the worlde. As ſhee ſpake theſe wordes, foure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Damoſells came in, each one bringing furniture for a horſe, and an Armour as white as ſnow, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a blacke croſſe in the midſt thereof, and theſe foure other Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſells armed him therewith. All this while, was <hi>Eſplandian</hi> on his knees, before the Altar deuoutly imploring the aſſiſtance of heauen, to giue him grace and meanes, wherby to accompliſh thoſe things deſtined to him: as well for the deliuerance of King <hi>Liſuart,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other enterpriſe whatſoeuer, wherein hee coueted not his owne priuate glory.</p>
                  <p>Thus remained the Knights all night in prayer, euen vntill the next morning, when a miſhapen ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured Dwarffe, beeing mounted on the very height of the ſerpent, winding a Cornet with ſuch loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as the whole Iſland returned the Eccho therof from all parts: &amp; the Ladies ranne vp to the Towers in the Pallace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> to ſee and obſerue whence this noyſe came. Then went <hi>Vrganda</hi> from the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, with them that had watched all night whom ſhe conducted vp near to the Dwarffe: And inwardly came ſixe other Damoſels, attired all in blacke, each bearing a Trumpet of golde in her hand: and <hi>Vrganda</hi> calling <hi>Balan</hi> to her, ſaide. Friend <hi>Balan</hi> euen as nature hath prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you before all other of your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, making you an enemy to vice, to follow reaſon and vertue, ſo will I aduaunce you (for the loue I know <hi>Amadis</hi> beares you, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery other Knight in this company) and doe you ſuch an honour this day, as all that haue beene before you, or are liuing at this preſent, could not, nor can attaine to the like. And this it is, that <hi>Eſplandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> (who ſhall be eſteemed the beſt Knight in the worlde) muſt haue his order of Knighthood from your hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Balan</hi> fearing to diſpleaſe <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and the reſt, excuſed himſelfe very honourably: but they all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing with him, hee tooke <hi>Eſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> by the hand, and asked him if hee would bee a Knight? Yes Sir, quoth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ee, if you pleaſe to beſtow ſuch honour on mee. Then <hi>Balan</hi> gaue him the accolade, and after-warde, buckled on his right ſpurre, ſaying: I pray God (faire Gentle-man) to make thee ſuch a man, as generall hope is conceiued of thee.
