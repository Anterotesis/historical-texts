            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DEdications are grown things of so nice
a Nature, That it is almost impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for me to pay your Lordship those
Acknowledgments I owe you, And not
(from those who cannot Iudge of the Sentiments
I have of your Lordships Favours) incurre the
Censure either of a fawner or a flatterer. Both
which ought to be as hateful to an Ingenuous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
as Ingratitude. None of these would I be guilty
of, and yet in letting the World know how Good
and how Generous a Patron I have, (in spight of
Malice) I am sure I am honest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56030:3"/>My Lord,</p>
            <p>Never was Poetry under so great an oppression
as now, as full of Phanaticism's as Religion,
where every one pretends to the Spirit of Wit,
sets up a Doctrine of his own, and hates a Poet
worse then a Quaker does a Priest.</p>
            <p>To examine how much goes to the making up
one of those dreadful things that resolve our disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
It is for the most part, a very little <hi>French</hi>

and no sence.</p>

            <p>At night he never fails to Appear in the
With-drawing room, where he picks out some that
have as little to do there as himself, who mustring
up all their puny Forces damn as possitively, as if
like <hi>Muggleton</hi> it were their gift, when indeed
they have as little right to Wit, as a Iourney man
Taylor can have to Prophecy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56030:3"/>Wit, which was the mistress of former Ages, is
become the Scandal of ours; Either the Old Satyr

and decryes all Poetry, but the old; or else the
young affected Fool that is impudent beyond Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,

Censuring the present; tho he misplace his wit as
he generally does his Courage, and ever makes use
of it on the wrong occasion.</p>

own it with gratitude) I have tasted of it much
above my Merit, or what even Vanity might
prompt me to expect; Though in doing this, I shall
at best but appear an humble debtor, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
honestly what he owes, though to keep up
his Credit he must be forc'd to borrow more; For
my Genius alwayes led me to seek an interest in
your Lordship; and I never see you, but I am

                  <p>Why; When the Master of a Family shall be absent any
considerable time from his home or Mansion, he ought rationally,
gravely, wisely, and Philosophically, to revolve within his mind
all the concurrent Circumstances, that may during the Interval
conspire to the Conjunction of those misfortunes, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
accidents, that may intervene upon the said absence, and the
interruption of his Oeconomical inspection, into the remissness,
negligences, frailties, and huge and perillous Errours, which his
Substitutes, Servants, or Trustees, may be capable of, or liable
aud obnoxious unto, which may arise from the imperfection
and corruptness of ingenerated Natures, or the taint and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of corrupted Education, whereby the Fountain-head of
Man's Disposition becomes muddy, and all the Streams of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

Philosophical <hi>Pater Familias,</hi> to find his House laid waste,
his Wife murdered, his Daughters deflowred, his Sons hang'd:

                  <speaker>Lucia.</speaker>
                  <p>WAS ever such a Trick play'd, for us to run away
from our Governesses, where our careful Fathers
had placed us, to follow a couple of young Gentlemen, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they said they lov'd us, I think 'twas a very noble Enterprize?
I am afraid the good fortune we shall get by it, will very hardly
recompence the reputation we have lost by it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clar.</speaker>
                  <p>Our greatest satisfaction is, that they are Men of fashion
and credit, and for my part I long ago resolv'd not to Marry any
other, nor such a one neither, till I had a perfect confirmation
of his Love; and 'twas an assurance of <hi>Octavian</hi>'s that brought me
hither.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lucia.</speaker>
                  <p>I must confess, I had no less a sence of the Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Leander.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Clar.</speaker>
                  <p>But seems it not wonderful, that the Circumstances of our
Fortune should be so near ally'd, and our selves so much Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
Besides, if I mistake not, I see something in <hi>Leander,</hi> so
much resembling a Brother of mine, of the same Name, that did
not the time since I saw him make me fearful, I should be often apt
to call him so.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lucia.</speaker>
                  <p>I have a Brother too, whose Name's <hi>Octavian,</hi> bred in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and just as my Father took his Voyage, return'd home; not
knowing where to find me, I believe is the reason I have not seen
him yet: But if I deceive not my self, there is something in your
<hi>Octavian,</hi> that extreamly refreshes my memory of him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clar.</speaker>
                  <p>I wish we might be so happy, as we are inclin'd to hope;
but there's a strange blind side in our Natures, which always
makes us apt to believe what we most earnestly desire.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lucia.</speaker>
                  <p>The worst at last, is but to be forsaken by our Fathers;
and for my part, I had rather lose an old Father than a young
Lover, when I may with reputation keep him, and secure my self
against the Imposition of fatherly Authority.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clar.</speaker>
                  <p>How insufferable it is to be sacrificed to the Arms of a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous
Blockhead, that has no other sense than to eat and drink
when 'tis provided for him, rise in the morning, and go to Bed at
night, and with much ado be perswaded to keep himself clean.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lucia.</speaker>
                  <p>A thing of meer Flesh and Blood, and that of the worst
sort too, with a squinting meager hang-Dog Countenance, that
looks as if he always wanted Physick for the Worms.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clar.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet such their silly Parents are generally most indulgent
to, like Apes, never so well pleas'd, as when th'are fondling with
their ugly Issue.</p>

                  <speaker>Clar.</speaker>
                  <p>Parents think they do their Daughters the greatest kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the World, when they get them Fools for their Husbands,
and yet are very apt to take it ill, if they make the right use of
them.</p>

                  <speaker>Lucia.</speaker>
                  <p>I'de no more be bound to spend my days in Marriage to a

because the Creature was gentle.</p>

                  <p>Dame Fortune, like most others of the Female Sex,
(I speak all this with respect to your Ladiship) is generally
most Indulgent to the nimble melted Block-Heads, Men of
Wit are not for her turn, even too thoughtful when they should be
Active; why who beleives any man of wit to have so much as
Courage. No Ladies, if y'ave any Friends that hope to raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
advise them to be as much fools as they can, and they'l near
want Patrons: And for honesty, if your Ladiships think fit to
