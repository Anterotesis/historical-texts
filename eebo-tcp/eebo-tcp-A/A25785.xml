            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account of the PROCEEDINGS at White-Hall, Guild-Hall, <hi>In the City of London,</hi> AND AT The TOWER: Together With its SURRENDER upon the Surpriſing News of the KING's Secret Departure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on the 11th. of <hi>December</hi> 1688.</head>
            <p>THE Surprizing News of the King's ſecret Departure, together with that of the Queen, and divers others, having cauſed no Little Conſternation in the Court, the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and other Proteſtant Lords, thought it highly neceſſary to conſult what was to be done in ſo great an Emergency, eſpecially upon Notice, That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> advanced with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: So that after having debated this great Affair, it was thought ſit to turn out and remove all <hi>Popiſh</hi> Officers, and thoſe that had Places of Truſt, with other Regulations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> with the Sheriffs attending yeſterday about Four of the Clock in the Afternoon, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That the Court of Aldermen ſhould Sit this Day, and the Common-Councel were ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to meet in the uſual manner at <hi>Guildhall;</hi> when about Ten in the morning a great many of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal came thither, to deviſe and conſult what was moſt material to be done. All Things in order for their Reception being prepared in the Matted Gallery, amongſt whom were their Graces the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York:</hi> The Biſhops of <hi>Ely, St. Aſph Wincheſter, &amp;c.</hi> The Lords <hi>Thanet, Shandois, Bartlet, Middleſex, Burlington, Carliſle, Mogrove,</hi> and other Noble Lords: Whither they ſent for Sir — <hi>Skelion,</hi> Lieutenant of the Tower, to give an Account of his Charge; when as it was further thought convenient, that he ſhould ſurrender that important place in Truſt of the City to the Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> thereby to leſſen the Fears of the People; and all <hi>Popiſh</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Officers ordered to be diſmiſſed and turned out. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen being in the Council Chamber the greateſt part of the Time, theſe Noble Lords were in Conſult about this weighty Affair, as alſo the Lieutenancy of the City attended in the adjacent Chamber: So that about Four of the Clock in the Afternoon, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal taking their Leave, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen came into the Mayor's Court, where the Common-Councel were Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in their uſual Order and Formalities: And being ſeated, proceeded to give them an Account to what End they had been Summoned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after ſome Time the Court withdrew, and in the mean while the Gentlemen of the Common Councel refreſhed themſelves, when being Re-ſeated, and the Court again ſitting, ſeveral Things were propoſed as the beſt Expedients in this Juncture of Affairs, for the firmer Settlement and good Order of this great City, and for the ſure Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> with which they generally concurred with joyful Acclamations. There was likewiſe propoſed an Addreſs to be made to His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>ORANGE,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly approved with the like Acclamations, Perſons were nominated to attend His Highneſs with all Expreſſions and Demonſtrations of Joy, in the Name and on the Behalf of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the Day the Multitude were gathered together, and proceeded from place to place, pulling down and burning <hi>Popiſh</hi> Chappels and Maſs Houſes, carrying the Images and Croſſes in Triumph.</p>
            <p>It was obſerved, That moſt of the King's Soldiers, upon being asked the Queſtion, Declared for the Prince of <hi>ORANGE,</hi> and His Highneſs is ſhortly expected in <hi>London.</hi>
