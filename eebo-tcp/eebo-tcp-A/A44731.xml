         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To</hi> the Renowned City of <hi>London. To the Right Honourable, Honourable, and all others,</hi> Who owe their firſt Birth or wellbeing to ſo Noble a Metropolis.</head>
            <p>IT was a notable Character, which <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> (that famous Regiſter of Time, who had lived here many years) did give of <hi>London</hi> about fifteen hundred years agoe, <hi>Londinum copiâ Negotiatorum, &amp; Comeatu maximè celebre,</hi> London a moſt renowned Mart for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Marchants, and Commerce. If She deſerved ſuch a Character in thoſe dayes, what would She merit now? who being compared to what ſhe was then, may be ſaid, in point of magnitude, to be as a large Volume in Folio, to a Book <hi>in Decimo Sexto:</hi> And, in point of <hi>Trade,</hi> as in an Eaſt Indy <hi>Carack,</hi> to a Quinbourough <hi>Oyſter ketch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have read of ſome, who have bin enamor'd of <hi>Cities,</hi> as others uſe to be of <hi>Miſtreſſes:</hi> ſo <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, was ſtruck with the love of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> when among other expreſsions he ſaid, <hi>That ſhe was a fair Lady, fit to be ſeen only on Holidayes;</hi> So a French Baron was ſo taken with the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> (which is known to be none of the <hi>neateſt)</hi> that he ſaid, <hi>Could he live ever in</hi> Paris, <hi>he would quit his right to</hi> Paradiſe. And it is ſtoried of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> that having got <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement he put upon Her, was, <hi>that he had heard ſo much of Her rare beauty, that He came from ſo far off to Court Her;</hi> but anſwer was made, that it was the Cuſtom of <hi>Thrace,</hi> to Court fair Ladies, not with <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> and <hi>Drums,</hi> but with <hi>Dulcimers,</hi> and other melodious Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>I may well affirm, that <hi>London</hi> is not inferior to any of theſe, as will appear in a <hi>Parallel</hi> hereunto annexed: And having breath'd Air, and (lept in her boſom, now near upon forty years (except the times that I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad upon forren Employments,) it is no wonder, if I be <hi>habitually</hi> in love with Her; nor have I bin wanting to expreſs it many times by dedicating unto Her the great <hi>French</hi> Dictionary refin'd, and enrich'd with divers Additionals; Then in giving Her ſome warnings by the ſad deſtiny of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> in an Epitome that goes of <hi>Joſephus;</hi> I ſhewed my ſelf alſo very ſenſible of Her caſe at that time, when I addreſsd unto Her <hi>Englands Teares,</hi> and <hi>Mercurius Acheronticus.</hi> nor is it long ſince, that I made publick love to <hi>Venice,</hi> and Courted <hi>Naples</hi> alſo, and I came off with no ill ſucceſs; I hope to do the like here.</p>
            <p>

I know others have treated already of the ſame Subject, and given a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible account of the City of <hi>London,</hi> but Gold may be often told over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fouling the ſingers. I have read near upon a dozen ſeveral Survayes of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> with other Cities, and I alwayes found new Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; But it is now above thirty foure years agoe, (which are near upon five Ages in the Law) ſince any thing was written of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> her collateral Siſter; which tract of time, aſſords variety of accidents, which the Reader ſhall find in this new Account: wherein as I have bin care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to pretermit any thing thats <hi>Material,</hi> ſo my ſpecial Caution hath bin not to thruſt in any frivolous pedantick things, or <hi>Superfluities,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto my nature hath bin alwayes averſe; Moreover, I promiſe the Reader, that he ſhall meet with many other Obſervations here, which were never yet drawn off the Preſse, or expoſed to publick light until now.</p>
            <p>I will conclude my Epiſtle with this Queſtion, If it was eſteemed an honour among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to be born in <hi>Athens;</hi> If among the <hi>Italians,</hi> to be a <hi>Roman;</hi> If among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be a <hi>Toledano:</hi> why ſhould it be leſſe honour for an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> to be born in <hi>London?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My hearty prayers to Heaven are, for the incolumity, and welfare of this Great City, for the averſion of all Judgements, and that ſhe may ſtill flouriſh with affluence of all Earthly felicity; by which prayer I ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

            <head>SOME <hi>ADVERTISEMENTS</hi> TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THey who make reſearches into <hi>Antiquity,</hi> may be ſaid to paſſe often through many <hi>dark Lobbies,</hi> and duſky places, before they come to <hi>Aula lucis,</hi> the Great Hall of light; They muſt repair to old <hi>Archives,</hi> and peruſe many mouldred and moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten Records, and ſo bring light as it were out of darkneſs, to inform the <hi>preſent</hi> World, what the <hi>former</hi> did, and make us ſee truth through our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> eyes. Now, though we commonly term <hi>Them</hi> that went before us our <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> yet if we have reſpect to the extent of <hi>Time,</hi> and the <hi>Age</hi> of the World, <hi>We</hi> who live now, may be called the more <hi>Ancient;</hi> For <hi>They</hi> lived; ſome of them in the <hi>Non-age,</hi> ſome in the <hi>Youth,</hi> ſome in the <hi>Adoleſcence,</hi> ſome in the <hi>virility</hi> of the World, And <hi>We</hi> who now crawl up and down the earth, may be ſaid to live in the declining and <hi>doting old decrepit Age:</hi> Therefore if relation be had to true <hi>longaevity, We</hi> may be rather called the <hi>Older:</hi> Inſomuch, that a Child born to day, as he is part of the Univerſe, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Time, may be ſaid to be more ancient then <hi>Adam,</hi> which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the meaning of that common ſaying among us, <hi>The youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother is the ancienter Gentleman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, it is deſired, that the <hi>diſcerning</hi> Reader be advertized, that Hiſtorians and <hi>Antiquaries,</hi> may well be compared to <hi>Architects,</hi> who in rearing up a Fabrick, although the <hi>Idaea,</hi> and deſign of the work, with the ſite, the contrivement of rooms, the contignation of parts and Symmetry, be wholly in themſelves; yet in point of <hi>Subſtance,</hi> they fetch their <hi>Materials</hi> from elſe where; ſo the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> and <hi>Antiquary,</hi> though the method, the ſtyle, and compilement be his, yet he hath his matter from others, either from Manuſcripts, or printed Records, except theſe modern paſſages that are <hi>Synchronical</hi> with himſelf. Furthermore, an <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> may be compared to one walking in a Garden, and making a poſie of Flowers, which he culs and plucks from divers beds and banks; now, though the Flowers be none of his, yet the choyce of them, and twiſting them together, to give the fuller fragrancy, and not to thruſt in any unſavory vegetal, is ſolely his own work.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and my Lord <hi>Harbert</hi>'s <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, though the compoſition, and digeſting be theirs, whereby they <hi>denominate</hi> the Books, yet, under favour, touching the main <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients,</hi> they took them from others, who had written the life of

thoſe Kings before: So, concerning this preſent <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> although the trace, and form of the Structure be mine own; yet, I am ſo much the Child of modeſty, as to acknowledge to have fetch'd moſt of my <hi>Materials</hi> from others, who preceded me in the ſame Subject; as from Mr. <hi>Stow,</hi> and thoſe induſtrious perſons, who have made Additionals unto him: yet, as I gave a hint before in my Epiſtle Dedicatory, there be divers things inſerted here, which are not found there, nor any where elſe; beſides thoſe modern Occurrences which have happened ſince, and are contemporary with my ſelf.</p>

            <head>Of the Foundation, and firſt Riſe of the City of <hi>LONDON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is as difficult a task to finde out the Original of ſome Nations and <hi>Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> as it is to finde out the Spring of the <hi>myſterious</hi> River of <hi>Nile;</hi> which tumbling down with a horrid noiſe of Cataracts through ſo many huge Rocks, above two thouſand miles, comes punctually every Summer <hi>ſolſtice,</hi> to viſit the <hi>gran Cairo;</hi> and then takes her leave of Her, as <hi>punctually</hi> the <hi>Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Equinox</hi> next following, having firſt impregnared the hot womb of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with a wonderful <hi>prolificall</hi> vertue, for the generation of ſo many ſpecies of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalls, and Vegetalls.</p>
            <p>But to finde out the <hi>Original</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> 'tis not ſo hard a matter; yet, there are variety of Opinions hereof, which we will briefly examine; <hi>Piolomy, Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Antonine,</hi> call her ſometimes <hi>Londinium,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Longidinium. Ammianus Marſellinus,</hi> calls her <hi>Lundinum,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Augusta,</hi> which is, <hi>the ſtately and magnificent City.</hi> There are ſome who call Her <hi>Troia nova,</hi> or <hi>Troynovant;</hi> which appellation, <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, in that famous long Letter he writ to Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> about the <hi>Scots Nation,</hi> ſeemes to aſſert: Others call her <hi>Caer Lud,</hi> other <hi>Dinas Belin;</hi> But that Opinion which quadrats moſt with truth, is, that her firſt Founders, and Godfathers, were the ancient Britains, (whom we now call Welſh) who by confeſſion of all Antiquaries, both domeſtick and forraign, were the <hi>Aborigenes,</hi> and firſt Inhabitants of this Countrey, being contemporary, and as it were <hi>concreated</hi> with the <hi>Iland</hi> her ſelf; There are three denominations, which are derived from the Britans, viz. <hi>Llhogdin; Llhwndian,</hi> and <hi>Llhandian,</hi> which we ſhall endeavour to explane; Touching the firſt, the <hi>Britans</hi> call a ſhip <hi>Llhong,</hi> and <hi>Dinan</hi> a Town. Inſomuch, that <hi>Llongdin</hi> is no other then <hi>Shipton,</hi> or <hi>a Town of Ships;</hi> And I have read of many Cities, who derive their names from Ships, as <hi>Nanpactum, Nauplia, Naua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia Auguſti, Nauctathmos;</hi> But none of theſe hath more right to aſſume the Title of <hi>Shipton,</hi> or <hi>Llhongdin</hi> (according to the Britiſh) as the City of <hi>London</hi> hath, in regard that ſhe is ſituated, upon the gentle aſcent, or flank of a Hill hard by a dainty <hi>Navigable River,</hi> which ſwelling at certain ſet houres with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean Tides, ſhe is able by her deep, and ſafe Channel to entertain the greateſt bottoms and Ships, that can ride on Neptunes back, which makes Her ſo famous a Mart, thoſe Ships bringing in all the rich Commodities that the VVorld can afford; whereunto alludes old <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> in the Rimes of thoſe dayes, which I thought worthy to inſert here for the Antiquity of the Dialect.</p>

            <p>Touching the ſecond <hi>Britiſh</hi> appellation <hi>Llhwndian, Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> do mention that the ancient <hi>Britans</hi> called thoſe Woods or Groves, which they had barrocadoed and fenc'd about with Trees caſt down, and plaſh'd, to prevent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95174:9"/>
all inrodes and aſſaults, they call'd ſuch a place I ſay <hi>Llhwn,</hi> which is equivalent to a <hi>fenc'd Town,</hi> or dwelling, as the Poet ſings of them.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>—Their Houſes were the Thicks,</l>
               <l>And buſhy queaches hollow Caves, and Hardles made of ſticks.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And 'tis more then probable, that in that place, where St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church now ſtands, there was a <hi>Wood</hi> or Grove at firſt, in regard there was a <hi>Fane</hi> or <hi>Temple</hi> erected there to the honour of <hi>Diana;</hi> for Hiſtorians obſerve, that whereas <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Vulcan</hi> were uſed to have their Temples in the <hi>Suburbs, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> within the City, the Goddeſs <hi>Diana</hi> was uſed to have her Temples ſet up in <hi>Woods,</hi> which might make the Britains denominate that place <hi>Llhwndian,</hi> which is as much as <hi>Diana's Grove or Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this derivation carrieth a great ſemblance of truth with it, ſo the third, viz. <hi>Llhandian</hi> carrieth as much, if not a greater veriſimilitude, and weighs moſt with me; The <hi>Brittains</hi> to this day, call a Church or Temple <hi>Llhan,</hi> whereof there be a great number in <hi>Wales</hi> to this day, as <hi>Llhangorſe, Llhanſawel, Llhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilo &amp;c.</hi> which ſignifieth the <hi>Churches</hi> of ſuch <hi>places;</hi> And whereas by the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and conſentient opinion of all Antiquaries, there was a Pagan Temple, or Fane erected to <hi>Diana,</hi> in that place where now St. <hi>Paul's</hi> ſtands, there being yet there a place called <hi>Camera Dianae,</hi> where Oxe heads and bones are daily found, which were uſed to be offered her as victims and ſacrifices, I ſay, 'tis more then probable, that the <hi>Britains</hi> were induc'd thereby to call the place <hi>Nhandian,</hi> which is the <hi>Temple of Diana;</hi> and ſo in <hi>tract</hi> of time, the word was <hi>contracted,</hi> and came to be called <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, who was the firſt <hi>Founder</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> is no where preciſely found. But whoſoever firſt founded her, they ſhewed much prudence in the choyce of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation; For the happy and fortunate Eſtate of the City, hath given good proof, that built ſhe was in a good houre, when ſome propitious Starre was then the aſcendent, and marked for long life and continuance, and that ſhe is for anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity very honourable; <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> giveth us to underſtand, that ſhe was called an <hi>ancient</hi> City in his time, which is above twelve hundred years agoe; <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> doth ſeem to do the like three hundred years before, who gives her this Character, <hi>Londinum copiâ Negotiatorum, &amp; commeatu valdè celebre</hi> for multitude of Merchants, and commerce, <hi>London</hi> is very renowned: This only was wanting to the glory thereof, that ſhe had not the name of <hi>Free City,</hi> nor of Colony; Neither indeed had it ſtood with the Roman intereſt, if any City flouriſhing with Trade, ſhould have enjoyed the right of a <hi>Free City;</hi> And therefore it was, as may be well ſuppoſed, that they ordain'd her to be a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecture,</hi> for ſo they term'd Towns where <hi>Marts</hi> were kept, and Juſtice admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, yet ſo that they had no Magiſtrates of their own, but rulers were ſent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year to govern them, and for to execute Law in publick matters, namely of Tax, Tribute, Tolls, Cuſtoms, Warfare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the <hi>Senate of Rome;</hi> Hence it commeth, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> the Panegyriſt, and <hi>Marcellinus</hi> aforeſaid, call her only a <hi>Town;</hi> But although ſhe was not lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the raign of <hi>Nero,</hi> when the <hi>Britains</hi> had conſpired to recover, and reſume their liberty, under the Conduct of <hi>Baeodicia,</hi> the <hi>Londoners</hi> could not with all their vveepings hold <hi>Suetonius Paulinus,</hi> but that after he had leavied a power of the Citizens to ayd him, he would needes diſlodge, and remove from thence, leaving the City naked to the Enemy, who forth with ſurprized and ſlew ſome few, whom either weakneſs of Sex, feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of age, or ſweetneſs of the place had detained there: Neither had ſhe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained leſſe loſſe, and miſery, at the hands of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> if ſhe had not ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and beyond all expectation by Gods providence bin relieved; For when C.

Neither is it probable, ſhe was yet wall'd about; But a little after our Stories report, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, at the inſtance of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Helena,</hi> did firſt fence her about with a Wall made of rough ſtone, and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Bricks, which took up in compaſſe, above three miles, ſo that it incloſed the Model of the City almoſt four-ſquare, but not equal on every ſide, conſidering, that from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>VVeſt,</hi> ſhe is far longer then from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North.</hi> That part of this Wall which ſtood on the <hi>Thames</hi> ſide, is by the continual flowing, and waſhings of the River fallen down and decayed; yet there appear'd certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains thereof in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds time, as <hi>Fitzſtephen,</hi> who then liv'd doth teſtifie. The reſt now ſtanding, is ſtronger towards the <hi>North,</hi> which not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years ſince, was reedified by the meanes of <hi>Joceline,</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London;</hi> But towards <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>VVeſt,</hi> although the <hi>Barons</hi> in old time, during their Warres, repaired and renewed it with the ruynes of the <hi>Jewes</hi> houſes then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, yet it grew quickly, all thorow, out of decay; For <hi>Londoners</hi> like to thoſe old <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> laughed at ſtrong walled Towns, as <hi>Cot-houſes for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> thinking their own Cities ſufficiently fenc'd, when they are fortified with <hi>bones,</hi> and not with <hi>ſtones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Wall giveth entrance at ſeven principal double Gates; for I willingly omit the ſmaller, which as they have bin lately repaired, ſo they have alſo new names given them;</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſide there be two, to wit, <hi>Ludgate</hi> of King <hi>Lud</hi> a <hi>Britain,</hi> or <hi>Flud-gate,</hi> as <hi>Leland</hi> is of opinion, of a little flud running beneath it, like as the Gate <hi>Fluentana</hi> in Rome, built again from the foundation; This Gate was made a free Priſon, <hi>Anno 1378, Bremer</hi> being Major, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd 1382. by a Common Councel in the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> where 'twas ordained, that all Freemen of <hi>London</hi> ſhould for debts, treſpaſſes, accounts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, be impriſoned in <hi>Ludgate,</hi> where at firſt for lodging and water, they did not pay anything. We go next to <hi>Newgate,</hi> the faireſt of all the Gates ſo call'd from the newneſs thereof, whereas before it was call'd <hi>Chamberlane Gate,</hi> which now is the publick Gaol or Priſon for Criminalls; and alſo for civil actions, for the Country of <hi>Middleſex.</hi> And it hath bin ſo many Ages, as appears by Records in King <hi>Johns</hi> time; as alſo in King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who (as an old Authour teſtifieth) ſent a Command to the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> to repair the Goal of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the North ſide are four Gates, viz. <hi>Alderſgate,</hi> or <hi>Olderſgate</hi> from the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95174:10"/>
antiquity thereof, or as others would have it from <hi>Aldrich</hi> a <hi>Saxon;</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is <hi>Cripplegate</hi> of a Spitle of Cripples ſometimes adjoyning thereunto: The third is <hi>Mooregate,</hi> call'd ſo of a <hi>Moory</hi> ground hard by, which is now draind up, and made fair and firm, and turn'd into a field &amp; delightful walks. Which Gate was firſt built by <hi>Falconer</hi> Lord Mayor, in the year of our Lord 1414. Then <hi>Biſhopſgate</hi> of a Biſhop the Benefactor; which Gate the <hi>Dutch</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, or <hi>Hans</hi> of the <hi>Styliard</hi> were bound by Covenant both to repair, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend at all times of danger and extremity.</p>
            <p>On the Eaſt ſide there is <hi>Aldgate,</hi> ſo named from the oldneſſe, or <hi>Elbegate</hi> as others terme it, which hath bin oft re-edified; It is thought, that two Gates more ſtood, beſides the Bridge gate, by the Thames ſide, namely <hi>Belinſgate,</hi> now a Wharfe or a Key for the <hi>Scots</hi> Trade; and <hi>Douregate</hi> or the Watergate, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd <hi>Dowgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be ſome <hi>Poſterns</hi> beſides that may go for Gates, as that of <hi>Chriſts Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital,</hi> which was made in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth; Another was made out of the wall lately into Moorfields. But the <hi>Poſtern</hi> by the <hi>Tower</hi> ſhews that it hath bin very ancient, and an arch'd Gate of much truſt; for in times paſt there was alwaies a perſon of quality who was <hi>Cuſtos</hi> of that <hi>Posterne.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Rivers ſide, there are alſo many water gates for the better ſecurity of the City.</p>
            <p>Where the wall endeth towards the River, there were two ſtrong Forts or Baſtions, of which the one Eaſtward remaineth yet, uſually called the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> called in the old Britiſh <hi>Bringwin,</hi> or <hi>Tourgwin,</hi> which in Engliſh is, the White Tower; a moſt famous and goodly Cittadel encompaſſed about with thick and ſtrong Walls, full of lofty, and ſtately Turrets, fenc'd about with a broad and a deep ditch, furniſh'd alſo with an Armory or Magazine of Warlick munition, with other buildings beſides, ſo that it reſembleth a Town of it ſelf; and one may well ſuppoſe, that thoſe two Caſtles which <hi>Fitz-ſtephens</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth to have bin on the <hi>Eaſt ſide</hi> of this City, went both to the making of this one: The other Fort was on the <hi>Weſt ſide</hi> of this City, where <hi>Fleet</hi> a little riveret ran, whence <hi>Fleetſtreet</hi> took its name, and in time, it was able to bear Veſſels, as appears in ſome Parliament Rolls, which Riveret diſchargeth it ſelf into the <hi>Thames. Fitz Stephen</hi> calls this the <hi>Palatin</hi> Tower or Caſtle; And they write, that in the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, it was conſumed by fire, out of the ruines whereof a great part of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, was newly built; And alſo on the very plot of ground where it ſtood, <hi>Robert Kilwarby</hi> ArchBiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> founded a Religious Houſe for the <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryars, whence we call the place <hi>Black-fryars;</hi> whereby a man may eaſily gueſs of what bigneſs it was; howbeit, in that place, ſtood in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond <hi>(Gervaſe</hi> of <hi>Tilbury</hi> in his Book call'd <hi>Otia Imperialia</hi> is my Author) two Forts or Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, the one whereof belong'd to <hi>Bainard,</hi> the other to the <hi>Baron of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fichet</hi> by right of ſucceſſion, but nothing remaineth of them to this day; yet ſome think that <hi>Pembroke</hi> Houſe was a piece of them, which we term <hi>Bainards Caſtle,</hi> of <hi>Bainard</hi> a noble man of <hi>Dunmow,</hi> whoſe poſſeſſion ſometimes it was, &amp; whoſe Succeſſors the <hi>Fitz Waters</hi> were in right of inheritance, who were <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign-bearers</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> (as ſhall be told hereafter) and among them <hi>Robert Fitz water,</hi> had licence of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, to ſell the Site of <hi>Bainards</hi> Caſtle to the forenamed ArchBiſhop <hi>Kilwarby.</hi> Neither was this City at that time <hi>wall'd</hi> only, but alſo when the <hi>Flamins</hi> or Pagan Prieſts were taken away, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion eſtabliſhed under that good Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was inſtall'd in their room, for it appeareth at the Councel of <hi>Arles,</hi> which in the year of grace 314 was held under the ſaid <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, the <hi>Biſhop of London</hi> was preſent; for he ſubſcribed, as it is to be ſeen in the firſt Tome of the Councel in this manner. <hi>Reſtitutus, Biſhop in the City of London

out of the Province of great Britain;</hi> Which <hi>Reſtitutus</hi> and his Succeſſors, had their Seat and reſidence as ſome affirm, as Saint <hi>Peters in Cornhil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From that time, <hi>London</hi> flouriſhed in ſuch honour, that ſhe began to be call'd <hi>Auguſta,</hi> and by that name was famous under the Emperour <hi>Valentinian;</hi> For <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> in his 27 Book writeth thus, <hi>And going forward to London an ancient Town which poſterity call'd Auguſta:</hi> and in the 28 Book, He went from <hi>Auguſta,</hi> which men of old time call'd <hi>London;</hi> Whence it came that after <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> time, there was a <hi>Mint</hi> appointed therein; For we read in thoſe Pieces of Money, which he cauſed to be ſtamp'd in honour of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and in others; this was the Inſcription, <hi>P. Lon. S.</hi> that is <hi>Pecunia Londino ſignata,</hi> Mony ſtamp'd in London. He who had the charge and overſeeing thereof under the <hi>Comes of Sacrarum largitionum,</hi> is in the Book of <hi>Notice</hi> term'd, <hi>Praepoſitus the ſaurorum Auguſtenſium</hi> in Britannia, that is, Provoſt of the Treaſury of <hi>Auguſta</hi> or London, in Britany. For this name <hi>Auguſta</hi> was a name full of Dignity and Majeſty; And both Founders and Repairers of Cities, when they hoped or wiſh'd, that ſuch Cities would become flouriſhing and powerful, gave them ſignificant names of good fortune; But among the moſt auſpicious names that be, none is more magnificent, none more auſpicate and glorious than <hi>Auguſta.</hi> For, this of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the moſt gracious &amp; mighty Emperour <hi>Octavianus</hi> took unto himſelf, not without the judgment of the beſt learned. Sirnamed he was, ſaith <hi>Dio, Augustus</hi> as one of great Majeſty above the nature of man: for what things be moſt honourable and ſacred, are called <hi>Auguſta:</hi> Neither had <hi>London</hi> this name for ſo high an honour, without the Licence of the Roman Emperours; In regard that names could not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon Cities without authority, as <hi>Virgil</hi> notes in that verſe of his;</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Urbem appellabant, permiſſo nomine,</hi> Aceſtam. </l>
            <l>The City, by permiſſion, <hi>Aceſta</hi> they did name.</l>
            <p>But as continuance of time has outworne this ſo honorable a name of <hi>Auguſta:</hi> ſo it hath confirm'd that other moſt ancient name <hi>Londinum.</hi> Whiles it enjoy'd the ſoreſaid name <hi>Auguſta</hi> it ſcaped fair from deſtruction by a rebellious rout of Ranſakers; But <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the father of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour did cut them in pieces whiles they were encombred with their ſpoils &amp; entred, as <hi>Marcia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaith, with exceeding great joy in triumphant manner into the City diſtreſſed before, &amp; overwhelm'd with grievous calamities; And marching with his Army from thence, he by his valour and proweſſe, ſo freed <hi>Britain</hi> from thoſe intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calamities and dangers wherewith ſhe was beſet, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> as witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>Symmachus,</hi> honored him among other ancient Worthies, and men of high renown with the Statue of a man of Arms. Not long after, when the Romans Empire in <hi>Britain</hi> was come to an end, in that publick deſtiny, and fatal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the whole State, it fell unto the <hi>Engliſh Saxons,</hi> but in what ſort, it is not well agreed on among Authors; It is moſt probable that <hi>Vortigern</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem himſelf, being taken priſoner, delivered it for his ranſome unto <hi>Hengiſt</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> conſidering that it did belong unto the <hi>Eaſt Saxons,</hi> whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey alſo, as Writers do record, <hi>Vortigern</hi> upon that condition made over unto <hi>Hengiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At which time the ſtate of the Church went alſo to wrack, and endured ſore affliction; the Paſtors were either ſlain, or forc'd to fly, their flocks worried, and havock made of all, as well Church goods as others. <hi>Theon</hi> the laſt Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> of the Britiſh blood, was fain to hide the holy Relique of Saints for a memorial, as my Author ſaith, and not for any ſuperſtition. But although thoſe daies of the <hi>Engliſh Saxons</hi> were ſuch, that a man might truly ſay, <hi>Mars</hi> then brandiſhed and ſhook his weapons, yet was <hi>London</hi> nevertheleſſe, as <hi>Bede</hi> teſtifieth, a Town of Trade, and traffique, frequented by many Nations reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95174:11"/>
thither by Sea and Land; But afterwards when a more gracious gale of peace breath'd favourably upon this wearied Iſland, and the Engliſh <hi>Saxons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to profeſſe Chriſtianity, it alſo began to flouriſh afreſh; for <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> under whom <hi>Sebert</hi> raign'd in this tract, as it were his Vaſſal, and by courteſie, fouuded here a Church, and did conſecrate it to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which being ſoon reedified and repaired, became at laſt moſt ſtately and magnificent, it was endowed by degrees with fair revenues; &amp; livings, wherewith were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> a <hi>Dean,</hi> a <hi>Chanter,</hi> a <hi>Chancellour,</hi> a <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> five <hi>Archdeacons,</hi> thirty <hi>Prebendaries,</hi> and divers other Incumbents and Officers, who might have a hanſome ſubſiſtence thereby.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eaſt</hi> part of this Church ſeems to be the newer, and more curiouſly wrought, having under it a very fair large arch'd Vault, which alſo is Saint <hi>Faiths</hi> Church; It was built out of the ruines of that Caſtle Palatine (ſpoken of before) by <hi>Mauritius</hi> the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> about the year of our Lord 1086, whereas it had been formerly conſum'd by a wofull accidental fire, whereof <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Mamesbury</hi> wrireth thus; <hi>The beauty whereof is ſo magnificent, that it deſerves to be numbred in the rank of the moſt excellent Edifices, ſo large as that arch'd Uavlt underneath, and the Church above it of ſuch capacity that it may ſeem ſufficient to receive any multitudes of people whatſoever.</hi> Becauſe therefore Biſhop <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice-</hi>carried a mind beyond all meaſure in this project, he tranſmitted the coſt and charge of ſo laborious a piece of work unto thoſe that came after: In the end, when B. <hi>Richard</hi> his Succeſſor had made over all the Revenues belonging unto the Biſhoprick to the building of this Cathedrall Church; ſuſtaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his family otherwiſe in the mean while, he ſeemed in a manner to have done juſt nothing, notwithſtanding that he ſpent his whole ſubſtance thereabout, and yet ſmall effects came thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Weſt</hi> part, as alſo the <hi>Croſs Iſle;</hi> are very ſpacious, high built, and goodly to be ſeen by reaſon of ſuch huge Columns, and are marvellouſly beautified with an arch'd roof of ſtone. Where theſe four parts croſſe one another &amp; meet in one, there ariſeth up a mighty large &amp; lofty <hi>Tower,</hi> upon which ſtood a ſpire Steeple, cover'd with lead, mounting up to a wonderful altitude; for it was no leſs than five hundred, and five and thirty foot high from the ground, which in the year 1087, was ſet on fire by lightning, and burnt with a great part of the City, but being rebuilt, was afterwards fi'rd again with lightening about an hnndred and fifty years ago, and was not perfectly repair'd ever ſince.</p>
            <p>The meaſure and proportion of this ſtately ſtructure, ſhall be here ſet down out of an old authentick Writer, who ſaith, that Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church containeth in length 690 foot, the breadth thereof is 130 foot, the height of the Weſt arch'd roof from the ground carrieth 102 foot, and the new fabrique from the ground is 88 foot high, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The ground belonging to this great Temple, in nature of a Coemitery or Church yard was of vaſt expanſion, for, it reach'd <hi>North,</hi> as far as St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> market place; <hi>Weſt,</hi> almoſt as far as <hi>Ludgate;</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> near to <hi>Baynards Caſtle:</hi> Now, as they ſay, that <hi>Rome was not built in a day,</hi> no more was this great and glorious Sanctuary, but a long tract of time, and ſome Ages paſs'd before it came to be entirely compleated, and made a perfect <hi>Croſſe,</hi> which is the exact ſhape of it. Nor did there want many advantages, according to the Genius of thoſe times, to advance the work: for perſons of good rank, beſides pecuniary Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, did labour themſelves therein, in their own perſons, thinking to do God Almighty good ſervice, to have a hand in rearing up his Temple; Beſides, Ic was an ordinary thing, for the ghoſtly Father to lay penances upon ſome peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries, as Mafons, Carpenters, Bricklayers, Playſterers, and others to work ſo many daies <hi>gratis</hi> in the building, before they could get an abſolution; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that it may be ſaid, that as <hi>Pauls</hi> Church was partly <hi>built</hi> by the <hi>ſinnes</hi> of the people, ſo it is now <hi>deſtroyed by the ſins of the people.</hi>

            <head>Of freſh water Rivers, Aqueducts, Conduits, and Fountains that belong to the City of <hi>LONDON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS, the principal thing that conduceth to the health of humane bodies, is the blood that runneth through their Veins, ſo the chiefeſt thing that tends to the welfare of a City, is to have Springs and Conduits of freſh water run within her: therefore we will proceed now, to give an account of thoſe ancient and preſent Rivers, Brooks, Boorns, Pools, Wells, Conduits, and Aqueducts, which ſerve to refreſh the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In former Ages, until the Conquerors time, and long after; the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was watred (beſides the River of <hi>Thames</hi> on the South part) with the River of <hi>Wells,</hi> as it was then call'd, and on the <hi>Weſt</hi> with water call'd <hi>Wallbrook,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the midſt of the City, to pay Tribute unto the Thames. There was another water or boorn, which run within the City through <hi>Langborn</hi> Ward, watring the Eaſt part; In the Weſt Suburbs was alſo another great Water call'd <hi>Oldborn,</hi> which had its fall into the River of Wells. Then were there 3. princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Fountains or Wells in the other Suburbs, to wit, Holy Well, Clements Well, and Clarks Well; Near unto this laſt named Fountain, were divers other Wells, viz. <hi>Fags well, Skinners well, Tode well, Loders well,</hi> and <hi>Rad well.</hi> All which Wells having the fall of their over-flowings into the ſaid River, much encreaſed the ſtream, and in that place, gave it the name of Well: In Weſt-Smithfield, there was a Pool in Records, called <hi>Horſe pool,</hi> and another in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Giles</hi> without Cripplegate; Beſides which, they had in every ſtreet, and lane of the City, divers fair Wells, and freſh Springs, after which manner, the city was then ſerved with ſweet and freſh waters, which being ſince decayed, other meanes have bin found to ſupply the want: But the prime and principal device was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95174:13"/>
found out by that worthy <hi>Briton,</hi> and Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton,</hi> by whoſe wit, care, and coſt, the new River of <hi>Ware</hi> was brought from <hi>Chadwel,</hi> and <hi>Amwel,</hi> to water and refreſh the heart, and bowels of the City; The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was long in ſuſpence, and under weighty deliberation, it receiv'd heat and cold a long time, being expoſed to ſo many difficulties, and vaſt expence, able to terrifie the ſtouteſt man. At laſt, courage and reſolution, with a love to the publique good met in the breaſt of the Adventurer, and ſpur'd him on to ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an enterpriſe, which hath proved ſo happily commodious, and of ſuch infinite utility to the whole City, that had he lived under ſome other Meridians, that I know, he ſhould have had his Statue erected in the eminenteſt place of the City, to eternize his name &amp; tranſmit his memory, and keep it freſh (like his waters) to all future Ages; Now as Mr. <hi>Stow</hi> ſpeaks very ingeniouſly, if thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to all good actions, Danger, difficulty detraction, contempt, ſcorn, &amp; envy, could have prevail'd by their malevolent interpoſition, either before, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and in the very birth of the attempt, and a good while after; this work had never bin accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gave way, by act of Parliament, to her Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and power for cutting and conveying of a River from any part of <hi>Middleſex</hi> or <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> into the City of <hi>London,</hi> with a limitation of ten years time for the performance thereof; but that Enterprize expir'd with her life: King <hi>James</hi> her immediate ſucceſſor, did grant the like, but without<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date of time for the ſame effect; And when the courage of others were quite quail'd, and utterly refuſed the buſineſs, Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton</hi> did undertake it, and ſo with infinite pains, and no leſſe expence, he finiſh'd the work, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a River of wholſom fine chearful water from <hi>Chadwel</hi> and <hi>Amwel,</hi> to the North ſide of <hi>London,</hi> near <hi>Iſlington,</hi> where he built a large Ciſtern to receive it. The work began the 28. day of February, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1608. and in the compaſs of five years was fully compleated. Touching the Aquaeduct, or the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof to <hi>London,</hi> it hardly can be imagined, what difficulties and rubs there were in the way, by reaſon of the various qualities of grounds, through which the water was to paſſe; ſome being ozie, ſoft, and muddy; others again as ſtiffe, and craggy; The depth of the Trench in ſome places deſcended full thirty foot and more, whereas in other places, it required as much artifice, to mount it over a valley in troughs betwixt Hills, and thoſe troughs to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by woodden Arches, ſome of them fix'd in the Earth very deep, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in height above 23. foot. Being brought to the foreſaid great Ceſtern, the water was not yet let in, till on Michaelmas day, <hi>Anno</hi> 1613. being the day that Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> Brother to the ſaid <hi>Sir Hugh,</hi> was elected Lord Maior of <hi>London</hi> for the year enſuing. In the afternoon of the ſame day, Sir <hi>John Swinerton,</hi> then Lord Maior, accompanied with the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Mountague,</hi> Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> and many of the worthy Aldermen, rode in a ſolemn manner, to ſee the great Ceſtern, and firſt iſſuing of the ſtrange River thereunto, which then was made free Denizon of <hi>London,</hi> and the Solemnity was thus. A Troop of Labourers to the number of threeſcore, or more, well apparell'd, and wearing green Monmouth Caps, after the <hi>Britiſh</hi> manner, all alike, carried Spades, Shovels, Pickaxes, and ſuch like Inſtruments of laborious Employment, and marching after Drums, twice or thrice about the Ciſtern, preſented themſelves before the Mount, where the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen were, where after a handſome ſpeech, the Flud-gates flew open, the ſtream ran chearfully into the Ciſtern, the Drums and Trumpets ſounding in triumphant manner, and a gallant peal of Chambers gave a Period to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.

            <p>The next River that diſgorgeth her ſelf into the <hi>Thames,</hi> is Weſt of the <hi>Wam I ſles,</hi> a rill of no great note, or long courſe; for riſing about <hi>Coringham</hi> it runs not many miles Eaſt and by South, till it falls into the mouth of this River; Laſt of all the <hi>Thames</hi> takes acquaintance, and mingleth with <hi>Medway</hi> a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable River watering all the South parts of <hi>Kent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This noble navigable River flows, and fills all her Channels twice ev'ry natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral day, by the flux and reflux of the Sea, which holdeth on for the ſpace of 70 miles within the main Land; the ſtream or tyde being higheſt at <hi>London,</hi> when the Moon doth exactly touch the North-eaſt, and South or Weſt points of the Heavens, whereof one is viſible, the other underneath us: Theſe tydes do alſo differ in their times, each one coming later than the other by ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes as paſſe; yet the revolution and natural courſe of the Heavens, do reduce and bring about the ſaid Planet to theſe her former places, whereby the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon difference 'twixt one tyde and another, is found to conſiſt of 24 minutes, which wanteth but twelve of a whole hour in 24 as experience doth confirm; In like manner we daily find, that each tyde is not of equal heighth and fulneſs; For at the Full and the Change of the Moon, we have the higheſt flouds, and ſuch is their extraordinary courſe that as they diminiſh from their Changes and Fulls, unto their firſt and laſt Quarters, ſo afterwards, they encreaſe again until they come to the Full and Change; ſometimes they riſe alſo ſo high, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the wind be at the North or North-eaſt, which brings in the water with more vehemency, becauſe the tyde which fills the Channel cometh Northward, that the <hi>Thames</hi> often inounds the bankes about <hi>London,</hi> which happeneth moſt frequently in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> which makes the grounds afterwards more fertile. Neither do the tydes alter a whit, unleſſe ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous winds from the Weſt or South-weſt, do keep back and check the ſtream, as the Eaſt and North-Eaſt do haſten the coming in thereof: or elſe ſome other extraordinary occaſion put by the courſe of the German Seas, which do fill the River by their natural return, and flowings; And the probableſt reaſon why three or four tydes do chop in in one day is, becauſe the winds blowing more ſtrong than ordinarily North or North-eaſt, make the Sea to ruſh in with more ſpeed, and abundance of water.</p>
            <p>The Land ſtreams or white waters, do oftentimes thicken the fineneſſe of the River, in ſo much that after a Land floud, 'tis uſual to take up Haddocks with ones hand beneath the Bridge, as they float aloft on the water, their eyes being ſo blinded with the thickneſſe of the water, that they cannot ſee whither they ſwimme; and how to make ſhift for themſelves before the poor creature be ſurpriz'd, otherwiſe the <hi>Thames</hi> water uſeth to be as clear and pellucid, as any ſuch great River in the world.</p>
            <p>Having gone along ſo far with this great goodly River, even from her ſource until ſhe diſimboques, and payes Tribute to Neptune, and caſt her ſelf into his imbraces, It will be now expedient to go on further, and acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with the juriſdiction, and Prerogatives of the <hi>Thames,</hi> with the extent thereof, Which begins at a place call'd <hi>Colnie</hi> ditch, a little above <hi>Stanes-</hi>bridge, Weſtward as far as <hi>London-</hi>bridge, and from thence to a place call'd <hi>Yendall, alias Yenleete,</hi> and the waters of <hi>Medway,</hi> all which extent is under the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95174:15"/>
and conſervancy of the Lord Mayor, the Comminalty, and Citizens of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, that there have been ſome Conteſts betwixt the Lord Mayor, and the Lord high Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> concerning the ſaid Juriſdiction and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but after a fair and judicial Tryal in open Court, the controverſie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in favour of the City; and the Lord Mayor adjudged to be <hi>Conſervator of the Thames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were alſo ſome other controverſial points about the Rivers, of <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Medway,</hi> but all differences were abſolutely concluded <hi>Anno</hi> 1613, Sir <hi>John Swinerton</hi> being then Lord Mayor, and Mr. <hi>Sparry</hi> being then his Deputy, or reſpective Bayliff for the execution of ſuch a great truſt repos'd in him. Ever ſince, as well as in former times, the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> hath been ſtyl'd the Conſervator of the ſaid River, within the forenamed limits and bounds, having plenary power to inflict puniſhments upon all tranſgreſſors relating to the ſaid Rivers; the Water-Bayly of <hi>London</hi> being his ſubſtitute. And whereas there are a company of Fiſhermen call'd <hi>Tinckermen,</hi> frequenting the River of <hi>Thames</hi> Eaſtward, who in times paſs'd have been reported, and found out to make an infinit deſtruction of the young brood or fry of fiſh, by uſing unlawful Nets, and other Engines feeding their Hoggs with them; by the ſingular care and coſt of the Lord Mayor, and vigilance of the City, thoſe prohibited Engines and Nets, are now quite ſuppreſs'd, and a true, and orderly manner of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought into uſe, that ſuch a havock may not be made of the young fry.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there are a great number of other kind of Fiſhermen, beſide Tinckermen belonging to the <hi>Thames,</hi> call'd <hi>Hebbermen, Petermen,</hi> and <hi>Traw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermen,</hi> that had lived in former times, by unlawful fiſhing on the ſaid River, to the deſtruction of the young fiſh, as aforeſaid; but now they are reſtrain'd, and regulated to a more orderly way of fiſhing.</p>
            <p>There have bin other kind of abuſes reformed herein, as upon complaint made to the Lord Mayor, concerning certain Timbers ſtanding in <hi>Tilbury</hi> Hope; a matter not only dangerous to the Paſſengers, but a cauſe alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the young brood of fiſh, by the dammage thoſe Timbers did to the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Nets, in regard of their continual ſtanding in the main courſe, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the River: that great grievance was ſpeedily redreſſed, by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and prudence of the Lord Mayor, and the Water-Bayly.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there hath been care taken, to clear and cleanſe the ſaid noble River Weſtward of ſeventy nine ſtops or hatches conſiſting of ſundry great ſtakes and piles, purpoſely erected by Fiſhermen for their private lucre, and ſtanding illfavouredly for paſſengers near unto the <hi>Fair deep;</hi> but none of them remain now, but ſuch as ſtand out of the paſſable high ſtream, and can be no prejudice to paſſers by; yet ſome are permitted to be planted at the waters bottome, and ſo they ſerve as a great ſuccour to the young brood of fiſh, being placed ſo remote on the River. Nor is this provident care for ſecurity of paſſengers, and conſervation of the young fry or fiſh, a new thing, for it appears that the like courſe was kept in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and after in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, as Records and Chronicles do ſhew. Moreover, there is a watchful eye, that no carren, or dead carkaſſes be thrown into the River to pollute, or infect the ſtream.</p>
            <p>To all theſe intents and purpoſes, the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen his Brethren with the under Officers, do uſe to meet eight times yearly, in the four Counties of <hi>Middleſex, Surrey, Kent,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and have a judicial ſitting for maintenance of the Rivers Rights, and Priviledges, where they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to empanel Juries, to make Inquiſition after all offences committed upon the River within their extent; And as the Verdict given up by the Jury make it appear, ſo they proceed to the puniſhment of the tranſgreſſors, according to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95174:15"/>
the quality of the offence: and it is worthy the obſervation, to know the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their ſo ſolemn proceedings, whereof this inſtance ſhall be produced, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of authentick Records.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Jolles</hi> Knight and Lord Mayor of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and waters of <hi>Medway,</hi> aſſiſted and accompanyed by the Aldermen, and two Sheriffs then contemporary, and attended by the Recorder, and the Sub-conſervator, or Water-bayly, with fifty Officers and ſervants, took their Barges at <hi>Belinſgate</hi> the third of <hi>July</hi> 1616, and within few hours arriv'd at <hi>Graveſend</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where a Seſſion for the conſervancy of the ſaid River was kept before the ſaid Lord Mayor, and his forenamed Aſſiſtants; At which time and place, a Jury of the Freeholders of the ſaid County, being ſworn to enquire of all offences committed in any part of the River whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, within the ſaid County, the Common Sergeant of the City (the Recorder being then abſent upon extraordinary occaſions) deliver'd them a charge to this effect; That, foraſmuch as there had not been any Seſſion of Conſervancy in many years paſsed, kept by any Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> in that place, it was probable and evident they could not be well informed, neither of the Lord Mayors jurisdiction and power to reform annoyances and offences there, and to inflict due puniſhments upon the Offendors; nor of the nature of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to be by them performed in the courſe of their enquiry; therefore he thought it convenient to make it known unto them, both the one and the other. Hereupon he ſhew'd them, The Juriſdiction of the Court of <hi>London</hi> in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> from <hi>Stanes-</hi>bridge Weſtward unto the points of the River next the Sea Eaſtward, appear'd to belong to the City in manner and form fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In point of right by <hi>Praeſcription,</hi> as it appeareth by an ancient Book call'd <hi>Dunthorne,</hi> that, <hi>Civitatis fundationis, aedificationis, &amp; conſtructionis cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacrat Thameſis Fluvius, quorum vero Civitatis &amp; Fluminis gubernationem tam Duces, Majores, Cuſtodes, Vicecomites, Aldr. &amp; magnates Civitatis memoratae hucuſque obtinuerunt &amp; habuerunt;</hi> Whence he inferr'd, that the government of the River hath belong'd to the City, time out of mind. In 21. <hi>Hen. 3. Jorden Coventry</hi> one of the Sheriffs of the City, was ſent by the Mayor and Aldermen, to remove certain Kiddles that annoy'd the Rivers of <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Medway,</hi> who <hi>ultra Yenland verſus Mare,</hi> did take divers perſons that were Offendors, and impriſon'd them; Whereupon, complaint being made to the King, he took the matter ill at the firſt, and ſent for the Lord Mayor and Citizens to <hi>Kennington;</hi> where, upon hearing of the matter before the ſaid King, the Cityes Juriſdiction over the ſaid River, was ſet forth and allow'd, and the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants convinc'd, and every one of them amerc'd at 10 <hi>l.</hi> and the amercements adjudged to the City; And afterward, their Nets were burnt by judgement given by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen in the <hi>Huſtings.</hi> Moreover, 1. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardi ſecundi,</hi> Writs were directed to the Sheriffs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> reciting the Cities Title, with command, not to ſuffer the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> to be moleſted contrary to the Liberties formerly granted, and allowed unto them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in point of right <hi>by allowance in Eire,</hi> the conſervation of the <hi>Thames</hi> belongs to the City: for it was produc'd that 1. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. before <hi>Hugh Bigot</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice Itinerant, the Sheriffs and Citizens of <hi>London</hi> were call'd in queſtion for their Juriſdiction exerciſed on the <hi>Thames,</hi> before whom it was found by a Jury in <hi>Southwark, Quòd nullus habeat aliquid juris in Thamiſia uſque ad novum gurgitem niſi Cives Londonexſ.</hi> In the 14. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. the Conſtable of the <hi>Tower,</hi> was indited by divers Wards of <hi>London,</hi> before the Juſtices in <hi>Eire</hi> at the <hi>Tower, De muneris et recep. cove. pro kidellis in Thamiſiis, et Conſtabularius ad Kidellas reſpondet quòd Juſtic. non habent juriſdictionem extra</hi> London <hi>plitum. inde cognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere cum predict. kidelli ſunt in aliis comitatibus, et Juſtic. dixerunt, Aqua Thamiſia
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95174:16"/>
pertinet ad Civitatem London uſque mare, &amp; ſi velit reſpondeat,</hi> who then pleaded, Not guilty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He went further, that this Jurisdiction belonged to the City <hi>by ancient Charters,</hi> 8. R. 1. <hi>Dominus Ricardus Rex, filius Regis Henrici ſecundi conceſſit, &amp; firmiter praecepit, ut omnes Kidelli qui ſunt in Thamiſia amoveantur ubicunque fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erint in Thamiſia; 1. Joh. Rex conceſſit, &amp; firmiter praecepit, ut omnes kidelli qui ſunt in Thamiſia vel in Medway amoveantur, &amp; ne caeteri kidelli alicubi po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantur in Thamiſia vel in Medway ſuper fort: X. li. ſterlingorum.</hi> Then he urg'd the famous Charter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, which ran thus. <hi>Henry</hi> by the Grace of God, King of <hi>England,</hi> Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitaine,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> unto all Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, Juſtices, Sheriffs, Stewards, Miniſters, and to all Bayliffs, and to all his true Men, Greeting: Woteth well, that We for the health of our ſoul, and the health of the ſoul of King <hi>John</hi> our Fader, and the ſouls of all our Anceſtors; and alſo for common profit of our City of <hi>London,</hi> and of all our Realms, have granted, and ſteadfaſtly commanded; That all the Weares that be in Thames, or in Medway be done away; And that from henceforth no Weares be ſet in Thames or Medway, upon the forfeiture of 10. l. Alſo we claim quit to our Citizens of <hi>London</hi> all that, that our Conſtable of our <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> was wont to take of the ſaid Weares. Wherefore we will, and ſteadfaſtly command that no Conſtable of the aforeſaid Tower, at any time from henceforth forward any thing ask, nor any grievance do, to any of the ſame City, by encheſen of the ſame Weares; It is to us known enough, and by true men, do us to underſtand, that moſt privacy, and moſt profit might fall unto the ſame City, and to the whole Realm by encheſen of the ſame weares; which we make for ever firm and ſtable unto the ſame City, as the Charter of our Lord King <hi>John,</hi> our Fader, which our Barons of <hi>London,</hi> thereof have reaſonably witneſſed. Witneſſes, <hi>Euſtace</hi> of <hi>London, Peter</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> &amp;c. At <hi>Westminſter</hi> the 18. of February, the year of our Reign eleven. Beſides theſe, he produced divers others in this Kings Raign.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Jurisdiction belongs to the City of <hi>London,</hi> by <hi>Acts of Parliament. W. 2. ca. 47. An.</hi> 13. No Salmons to be taken, from the Nativity of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, unto St. <hi>Martins</hi> day in all points; Nor none to be taken in Mill-pools, from the midſt of April, until Midſummer, 1. Offence, burning of Nets, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines. 2. Offence, impriſonment for a quarter of a yeer. 3. A whole year. 13. R. 2. confirms the reſtraint of taking Salmons in many waters, from the midſt of April, until Midſommer, upon the ſame pain; nor within that time to uſe any Nets call'd <hi>Stalkers,</hi> nor any other Engine, whereby the fry may be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>1. Eliz. <hi>None ſhall with any manner of Net, Weele, Butcaining, Kepper, limecreele, rawfagnet, trolnet, trimnet, ſcalboat, webliſter, ſturlamet, or with any other device or Engine, made of cheare, woolbine or Canvas, or ſhall by any heeling Nets, or Trimbleboat, or any other device, Engines, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telles, wayes or meanes ſoever, heretofore made or deviſed, or hereafter to be made or deviſed, take, or kill any young brood, ſpawn, or fry of Eeles, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Pike, or Pickrel, or of any other Fiſh or Flud-gate, Pipe, or tail of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mill, Weare, or in any ſtreights, ſtreams, brooks, Rivers, ſalt or freſh. 2. None ſhall take or kill any Salmon and Trouts, not being in ſeaſon, being Kepper Salmons, or Kepper Trouts, or Shedder Salmons, or Shedder Trouts, &amp;c. The Mayor of</hi> London, <hi>inter alia, ſhall have full power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by this Act, to enquire of all offences committed contrary thereunto, by the Othes of 12 men or more, and to hear and determine all and every the ſame, and inflict puniſhments, and impoſe fines, accordingly.</hi>

            <p n="5">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95174:16"/>
5. Then he proceeds to aſſert the Cities Right, to the conſervation of the Thames, and waters of Medway, by <hi>way of Inquiſition,</hi> whereof there were two: the one taken at <hi>Raynam</hi> in Eſſex, the other at <hi>Graveſend</hi> in Kent, 9. <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. before <hi>William Grocer,</hi> then Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> where it was preſented, That whereas by the ancient Ordinances of <hi>London,</hi> the Meſches of Nets ſhould be two Inches in the forepart, and one inch in the hinder part; and it being found, that the offences according to the ſaid Inquiſitions are <hi>contra libertates &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudines Civitatis,</hi> it was adjudged, that the Nets ſhould be burnt, according to the ancient cuſtom in that behalf provided.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He goes on after, to prove that this Right belongs to the City by <hi>Decrees.</hi> In 8. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. The Mayor and Aldermen did exhibit their humble Petition to the Kings Councel reciting; That, time out of minde, they have had the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and correction of the River of Thames, of all trinks, nets, and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines whatſoever in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and Medway placed, and have uſed to make a ſub-Conſervator under them; and complaining, that <hi>Alexander Bonner,</hi> then ſub-Conſervator, having diſcharg'd his duty, in removing Kiddels, he was ill entreated by the owners, the ſame owners dwelling in <hi>Erith, Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferry, Barking, Woolwich,</hi> and other places in the Counties of Kent, and Eſſex: and upon hearing of the matter in <hi>Camera ſtellata,</hi> they were found guilty, and conſtrained to ſubmit themſelves to the Lord Mayor, and ordered to bring alwayes their Nets unto him, before they ſhould uſe them. And that the Kiddles then taken, ſhould be at the diſpoſition of the Lord Mayor; ſo the Offendors made their ſubmiſſion accordingly.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He proceeds; This right appertains to the City of <hi>London,</hi> by <hi>Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</hi> which he proved by a grant made by <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th, to the Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi> for ſetting up a Weare in the River of Thames: which grant was revok'd and annul'd, at the inſtance of the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen, upon ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their right: therefore alledg'd, It was contrary to their ancient Cuſtoms. At which time, the Cities Title to the conſervacy of the Thames, and Medway, was at large ſet forth, and recited to have bin ſhewn to the Lord Chancellour, and to the ſaid Earl and his Councel, which accordingly was allowed.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He reinforceth the right of the City by <hi>Proclamations,</hi> whereof one was made by <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. in 34. of his Raign, wherein it is affirmed, that the Lord Mayor and his Predeceſſors, have had by divers grants of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and, by Acts of Parliament, enjoyed alwayes the conſervacy of the Thames, without impediments, or interruption; By which Proclamation, it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that none ſhould reſiſt, deny, or impugne the Lord Mayor, or his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, in doing or executing any thing that might conduce to the conſervacy of the River, and of the fiſh and fry within the ſame.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He produceth <hi>Report;</hi> for in a controverſie 'twixt the Lord Admiral, and the Lord Mayor, for the meaſuring of Coles, and other things upon the Thames, it then fell into debate, to whom the Conſervacy of the River appertain'd which cauſe was referred by Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Councel of State, 1597. to the Atturney General, and Solicitor, who joyntly certified among other things, <hi>that the Conſervacy and care of the River did, and ought to belong to the City of London,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. By <hi>quo Warranto,</hi> 'twas proved, that the Conſervacy of the Thames be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the City, for 3. <hi>Jacobi;</hi> a <hi>quo warranto,</hi> was brought againſt the City in the Exchequer, to know by what Title ſhe claimed the Conſervacy of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Thames, &amp; the waters of Medway: whereupon the City made her Title good thereunto, by ancient preſcription, and otherwiſe; ſo judgement was given in her favour.</p>
            <p n="11">11. He goes on afterwards to confirm the right of the City, <hi>by proof of uſage;</hi> in regard the Lord Mayor and Aldermen have time out of minde, made Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances concerning the good Government of the River of Thames, as well for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95174:17"/>
the ſeaſons and manner of fiſhing beneath <hi>London</hi> Bridge Eaſtward, upon pain of penalties, as it appears from time to time, from the Raign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and ſo downward: the Lord Mayor hath removed Kiddels, Weares, Trinks, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlawful Engines, and hath reformed the diſorders of ſuch as have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded beſides, in the River of Thames, and inflicted puniſhment, upon Offendors accordingly.</p>
            <p>The right of the City appeares alſo by the Writs and Precepts under the teſte of the Lord Mayor, to the Sheriffs of Kent and Eſſex, for the returning of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries before him, to enquire of Offences done in the River. The ſame right of the City, appeares alſo by Commiſſions, whereof divers have bin directed to the Lord Mayor, to put in execution the Acts of Parliament, made for the Conſervancie of the <hi>Thames and Medway,</hi> and to enquire of all offences, made or done in the ſaid waters, and to puniſh the Delinquents accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, He makes good the Right and Title of the City, by the continual claim ſhe made thereunto, as appears in thoſe various conteſts ſhe had with the Lord Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> wherein after divers debates and bandings, ſhe kept ſtill above water, and made her Title good; which moved King <hi>James, Anno</hi> the 3d of his Raign, to put a final determination to the buſineſs by the Letters Patents, he paſſed unto the City, wherein he ſaith, that <hi>ad omnem controverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am in hac parte temporibus tam preſentibus quàm futuris tollendam, &amp; omne dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um amovendum,</hi> that to cut off all controverſies, as well of the preſent times, as of future, and to remove all doubts, he did confirm and ratifie the ſaid right unto the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was the Title, Prerogative, and right of the City of <hi>London</hi> ſtoutly, and ſtrongly aſſerted by eleven pregnant, and convincing proofs, to the conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her dearly beloved Minion, the River of Thames, both by preſcription; by allowance in <hi>Eire;</hi> by ancient Charters; by Acts of Parliament; by Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; by Decrees <hi>coram ipſo Rege;</hi> By Letters Patents; by Proclamations; by Report of the learned Councel; by a <hi>quo Warranto;</hi> And laſtly, by ancient u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, cuſtom, and continual claim.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Stow</hi> in his ſurvey of the City of <hi>London,</hi> hath more about this buſineſs, then here is inſerted, which made the laſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, to command Sir <hi>John Coke</hi> his Secretary, to write to Sir <hi>Henry Martin,</hi> Judge of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, to this effect,</p>

            <p>Now, there be many things that concern the incumbency of the Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of ſo Noble a River, it being an Office of no ſmall extent.</p>
            <p>His firſt duty is to preſerve the currency of the ſtream, and the banks on both ſides.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He muſt preſerve the Fiſh and Fry within the ſame; He muſt prevent all Encroachments upon the River, and the banks thereof; as alſo he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95174:17"/>
muſt enquire of all Flud-gates, Mill-dams, and ſuch like annoyances; and whether any do hurl in any ſoyl, duſt, or rubbiſh, or other filth whatſoever to choak her. But for the ſtrength, and ſafety of the River, againſt the invaſion of an enemy, by Block-houſes, Forts, Baſtions or Caſtles, and the ſecuring of the Merchant, and Navigation to and fro, that charge belongs to the Soveraign Prince, and not to the City.</p>
            <p>But indeed, touching the former charge, circumſpection and care of the River of Thames, it is moſt proper for the City of <hi>London,</hi> who lies perpetually by her Beds ſide, and therefore in a fit poſture to be watchful of her: for which vigilance the Thames rewards her abundantly, by bringing her in the Spices of the South, the Jewels of the Eaſt, and Treaſure of the Weſt, Inſomuch, that it may be well ſaid, this Office of Conſervatorſhip, or ſuperintendency of ſo Noble and uſeful a River, is as a fair flower, or rich Jewel, in the Cap of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. This famous River, taking all her advantages together, ſurpaſſing all other whatſoever, that pay tribute to the Ocean, if you regard the ſtreightneſs of her courſe, the ſtilneſs of her ſtream, for her proportionable latitude; as alſo her length, for ſhe comes ſporting along from her firſt ſource, above nineſcore miles before ſhe emboſomes her ſelf in the Arms of <hi>Neptune.</hi> Add hereunto, the great ſtore, and variety of Fiſh ſhe abounds withall; the moſt delectable, and fertile ſoiles, on both ſides; And laſtly the conveniency of her ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being towards the Center of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then in her entrance to the Sea, ſhe opens upon <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> having them both in her eye; Beſides, ſhe hath another advantagious property, that to the knowing Native, the entrance into the River is ſafe and eaſie, but difficult and hazardous to ſtrangers, either to come in, or go out; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that the Thames may be ſaid to be <hi>Londons</hi> beſt friend, which puts me in minde of a paſſage of drollery, that happened in the time of King <hi>James,</hi> who being diſpleaſed with the City, becauſe ſhe would not lend him ſuch a ſum of money, and the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen attending him one day, being ſomewhat tranſported, he ſaid, that he would remove his own Court, with all the Records of the Tower, and the Courts of Weſtminſter-Hall, to another place, with further expreſſions of his indignation. The Lord Mayor calmly heard all and at laſt anſwered, Your Majeſty hath power to do what you pleaſe, and your City of <hi>London</hi> will obey accordingly; <hi>but ſhe humbly deſires, that when your Majeſty ſhall remove your Courts, you would pleaſe to leave the Thames behind you.</hi>

            <head>Of the great and admirable BRIDGE In the City of <hi>LONDON</hi> over the Thames.</head>
            <p>HAving bin thus long upon water, and accompanied the <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>Thetis</hi> lap, 'tis time now to land, and take a view of her greateſt Bridge, which, if the ſtupendious Site, and ſtructure thereof be well conſidered, may be ſaid to be one of the Wonders of the World: though, as ſome think, it hath too many Arches; ſo that it may be ſaid, <hi>If Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Bridge had fewer eyes, it would ſee far better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as we fetch'd the Thames from her Spring, ſo we will fetch her Bridge from its firſt foundation. At firſt there was but a Ferry kept in the place where now the Bridge is built, at length the Ferriman and his Wife deceaſing, left the ſaid Ferry to their only Daughter a Mayden, who with other goods, left her by her Parents, together with the profits ariſing from the ſaid Ferry, did build a holy Houſe for Nuns; in place whereof, the Eaſt part of St. <hi>Mary O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries</hi> ſtands now above the Quire, where ſhe was buried: and unto that Houſe of Nuns, ſhe bequeathed the over-ſight and benefit of the Ferry; But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that Houſe of Nuns being converted into a Houſe of Prieſts, the Prieſts did build a Bridge of Timber, and from time to time, kept the ſame in good reparation, till at length, conſidering the great charges which were beſtowed in the frequent repair of the woodden Bridge, there was at laſt, by the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of the Citizens, and others, a Bridge built of Stone.</p>
            <p>The Timber Bridge had ſtood ſome Ages before; for the Story ſaith, that when <hi>Sweyn,</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> had beſieged the City of <hi>London,</hi> both by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Land in the year 994. the Citizens manfully defended themſelves under their King <hi>Ethelred;</hi> ſo that a great number of the Enemies was ſlain in Battel, and part of them were drown'd in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> becauſe they could not recover the Bridge: Add hereunto, that in the year 1016. <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> with a great Navy came up to <hi>London,</hi> and on the South of the Thames caus'd a Trench to be caſt, through the which his Ships were tow'd towards the Weſt ſide of the Bridge, and then with a deep Trench, and ſtreight ſiege, he encompaſſed the City about.</p>
            <p>Moreover, 1052. the Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> with the like Navy, taking his courſe up the River, and finding no reſiſtance on the Bridge, he ſail'd up the South ſide. Further, 1067. <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror in his Charter to the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in Weſtminſter, confirmed to the Monks ſerving God there, a Gate in <hi>London</hi> call'd <hi>Buttolphs</hi> Gate then, with a Wharf which was at the head of <hi>London</hi> Bridge.</p>
            <p>We read likewiſe, that <hi>Anno</hi> 1114. in the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> 1. the River of Thames was ſo dryed up, and the water grew ſo ſhallow, that between the Tower of <hi>London</hi> and the Bridge, not only with Horſe, but people might have paſſed over a foot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95174:18"/>
In the year 1122, <hi>Thomas Arden</hi> gave to the Monks at <hi>Bermondſey</hi> the Church of St. <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and five ſhillings yearly rent out of the Land pertaining to <hi>London-</hi>Bridge. There is alſo a remarkable Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. upon Record, to this tenor. Henry <hi>King of</hi> England, <hi>to</hi> Ralph Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>and all the Miniſters of</hi> Suſſex, <hi>ſendeth greeting; Know ye, I command by my Kingly authority, that the Manor call'd</hi> Alceſton, <hi>which my Father gave with other Lands to the</hi> Abbey <hi>of</hi> Battle, <hi>be free, and quiet from Shiers and Hundreds, and all other Cuſtomes of earthly ſervitude, as my Father held the ſame moſt freely and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and namely from the work of</hi> London-<hi>Bridge, the work of the Caſtle at</hi> Peven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey: <hi>And this I command upon my forfaiture. Witneſſe</hi> William de Pontdelarche <hi>at</hi> Berry.</p>
            <p>The firſt year of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> a fire began in the houſe of one <hi>Ailwards</hi> neer unto <hi>London-</hi>ſtone, which conſum'd Eaſt unto <hi>Ludgate,</hi> and Weſt to St. <hi>Erkenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald's</hi> ſheine in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church. The Bridge of Timber upon the River of <hi>Thames</hi> was alſo burnt, but afterwards repair'd. Beſides in the Reign of the ſaid King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. men ſtood in great numbers upon the Bridge to ſee paſtimes that were upon the River. In the year 1163, that Bridge was not only repair'd, but built all of new Timber as before, by <hi>Peter Colechurch</hi> Prieſt, and Chaplain.</p>
            <p>This ſerves to ſhew, that there was a Timber Bridge a long tract of time over the <hi>Thames,</hi> which was maintain'd partly by the proper Lands thereof, partly by the Legacies and liberality of divers perſons, and partly by tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in divers Sheirs, at leaſt 215 years before the Bridge of ſtone was erected.</p>
            <p>Now, about the year 1176 the ſtone-Bridge had its firſt foundation by the foreſaid <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Cole-Church,</hi> near unto the place of the Timber Bridge, but ſomewhat more Weſt, for the Chronicle ſaith, that <hi>Buttolphes</hi> Wharf was at the end of <hi>London-</hi>Bridge; The King not only countenanced, but aſſiſted the great work, a Cardinal being then here Legate, and <hi>Richard</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> gave 1000 Marks towards the Foundation. The courſe of the River for a time was turn'd another way about, by a trench caſt up for that purpoſe, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Eaſt about <hi>Radriff,</hi> and ending in the Weſt about <hi>Patricksey,</hi> now call'd <hi>Batterſay.</hi> This work to wit, the Arches, Chappel, and the Stone Bridge over the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> having been 33 years in building, was in the year 1209 fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, by the worthy Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> viz. <hi>Serle Mercer, William Almane,</hi> and <hi>Benedict, Botewrite,</hi> being principal Maſters of that Fabrique: for <hi>Peter Colechurch</hi> was dead four years before, and was as the principal Benefactor bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Chappel on the Bridge.</p>
            <p>Certain void places were given by King <hi>John</hi> to build upon about <hi>London,</hi> the profits whereof were aſſign'd to maintain the Bridge.</p>
            <p>A Maſon, being Maſter Workman of the Bridge, builded from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the large Chappel on that Bridge upon his own charges, which Chappel was then endow'd with two Prieſts and four Clerks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beſides Chanteries; After the finiſhing of this Chappel, which was the firſt building upon thoſe Arches, ſundry Manſion Houſes in tract of time were erected; whereunto many charitable men gave Lands, Tenements, and ſums of money towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance thereof; All which was ſometimes regiſtred, and fairly written in a Table for poſterity, which was put up in the ſaid Chappel, till at laſt the ſaid Chappel was turn'd to a dwelling Houſe, and then remov'd to the Bridge-houſe: Now, in <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. time it ſtands upon Record, that all the payments and allowances belonging to <hi>London-</hi>Bridge, amounted to above 815 <hi>l.</hi> by which account made then, may be partly gueſſed the great Revenues, and incomes of the ſaid Bridge, and to what improvement, and encreaſe it may be come unto by this time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95174:19"/>
But this noble Bridge, as other earthly things, hath ſuffer'd many diſaſters ſince: for four years after the finiſhing thereof, in the year 1212, on the 10th. of <hi>July</hi> at night, the Burrough of <hi>Southwark</hi> on the South ſide of <hi>Thames,</hi> as alſo the Church of our Lady of the Canons there, being on fire, and an exceeding great multitude of people paſſing the Bridge, either to extinguiſh and quench it, or to behold and gaze upon it, ſuddenly the North part by blowing of the South wind, was alſo ſet on fire, and the people which were then paſſing the Bridge perceiving the ſame, would have return'd, but were ſtopp'd by the fury of the fire: and it came to paſſe as they ſtayed all in a conſternation, and protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the time; the other South end of the Bridge, was alſo ſet on fire; ſo that the people thronging themſelves betwixt two raging fires, did nothing elſe but expect preſent death; Whereupon, there came to ſave them many ſhips and veſſels, into which the multitude ſo inadviſedly ruſh'd in, that the ſhips being thereby ſunk, they all periſhed; And it was found that above three thouſand ſouls periſhed by this diſaſtrous accident at that time, whoſe bodies were found half burnt, beſides thoſe who were turn'd to aſhes.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in the year 1282, through a great froſt and deep ſnow, five Arches of <hi>London</hi> Bridge were born down, and deſtroyed: A little after, <hi>Anna</hi> 1289, the Bridge was o ſore decayed for want of reparations, that people were afraid to paſs thereon, and a ſubſidy was granted towards the amendment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; Afterwards, Sir <hi>John Britain,</hi> being then <hi>Cuſtos</hi> of <hi>London Anno</hi> 1381, a great Collection was made by all the Clergy for the repair of <hi>London-</hi>Bridge.</p>
            <p>In the year 1381, on St. <hi>Georges</hi> day was a great ſolemnity of Juſts and Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements upon <hi>London-</hi>Bridge, between <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wells</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whereby one may infer, that the houſes were not there ſo thick, at that time.</p>
            <p>The Tower on <hi>London-</hi>bridge, at the North end of the Draw-bridge (which was then in a poſture to be drawn up) was built <hi>Anno</hi> 1426, in the Majoralty of <hi>John Rainwell. Anno</hi> 1471, a houſe call'd the <hi>Common ſiege</hi> on <hi>London-</hi>Bridge, tumbled down into the <hi>Thames</hi> by death of divers perſons a little after.</p>
            <p>But in the year ſixteen hundred thirty three, there happen'd a moſt raging diſmal fire upon the North ſide of <hi>London-</hi>bridge, which by computation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd above the third part of the Buildings thereof; But by the commendable care of the City, there are other goodly ſtructures rais'd up in ſome of their rooms, of a ſtronger and more ſtately way of building, and pity it is that the work were not compleated, there being no object (after the Church of St. <hi>Pauls)</hi> that can conduce more to the glory and Ornament of this renowned City.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this Bridge that may be call'd, <hi>the Bridge of the world,</hi> there are other inferior Bridges, which have ſtill the names of Bridges that belong to the City of <hi>London,</hi> the firſt is <hi>Fleet-bridge</hi> in the Weſt, fenc'd with iron Pikes, on which towards the South there be certain Lanthorns of Stones, for lights to be placed in Winter Evenings, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of paſſengers; Under this Bridge runs a water ſometimes call'd, the River <hi>Wells,</hi> but ſince <hi>Turn-hill brook,</hi> and now <hi>Fleet Dike,</hi> becauſe it runs by the <hi>Fleet</hi> under ground to the River of <hi>Thames;</hi> this Bridge hath been far greater in times paſs'd, but leſſened as the water courſe hath been narrowed.</p>
            <p>Over the ſayd River of <hi>Wells</hi> northerly ſtands <hi>Oldenbridge,</hi> now <hi>Holborn-bridge,</hi> ſo call'd of a boorn that ſometimes ran down <hi>Holborn</hi> hill into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; this Bridge like <hi>Fleet-bridge,</hi> ſerves for paſſage only.</p>
            <p>Then comes <hi>Cow-bridge</hi> more Northerly over the ſame water near unto <hi>Cow-lane,</hi> but this Bridge being decayed, another of Timber is made more North to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Chicklane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſome other ſmall Bridges over the Town-ditch, viz. without <hi>Eald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> without <hi>Biſhopſgate, Mooregate,</hi> the Poſtern of <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> as alſo without

               <hi>Alderſgate,</hi> the Poſtern of <hi>Chriſts Hoſpital, Newgate,</hi> and <hi>Ludgate,</hi> which are now paved eaven with the ſtreets; only there remains one of Timber over the River of <hi>Wels</hi> or <hi>Fleet</hi> Dike. There have bin in former ages divers Bridges in ſundry places over the courſe of <hi>Wallbrook;</hi> but now they are made levell with the pavements of the Streets, ſo that the water-courſe can now be hardly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, being vaulted over with Brick.</p>

            <p>ANd now that we are come ſo near the famous and great <hi>Tower</hi> Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, or Cittadel of <hi>London;</hi> we will try whether we can get in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without paying fees, and take a view thereof as briefly as we can, it being an ill-favoured, and tedious thing to ſtay there long.</p>
            <p>I know it is the current vulgar opinion, that <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> the firſt <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> or rather indeed <hi>Diſcoverer</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> was the Original Founder thereof, but there is very litle probability of truth in that for two Reaſons; The firſt is, the little ſtay he made here, during which he had other things to think on: The ſecond is, that he himſelf who is ſo exact in his relations, ſpecially if they conduce to his honour; nor any other <hi>Roman</hi> Author, makes any mention of of ſuch a work, or Fabrique; Therefore, that opinion which approacheth truth the neereſt, is, that <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> was the firſt tracer and erector of the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Edmond de Hadenham,</hi> an old Engliſh Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary affirms; The firſt part that was built, was the great ſquare and White Tower, (though black to ſome) which was about the year 1078, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Gundulph</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was principal Superviſer and Surveyer, who was log'd then in the houſe of <hi>Edmere</hi> a Burgeſſe of <hi>London,</hi> as it ſtands upon La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Record in the forenamed Author.</p>
            <p>Now it is to be conſidered, that at firſt the wall of the City was in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces furniſh'd with ſundry Baſtions and Turrets in due diſtance one from the other, and divers ſtood on the waters ſide, where ſome of the ſaid Wall extended at firſt, but the <hi>Thames</hi> with her ebbings and flowings, did as it were corrode, and ſubvert thoſe Buildings on the South ſide; Wherefore the <hi>Conqueror</hi> (for then the Art of fortification was come to a greater perfection) for defence of the City and River, pitch'd upon that place as moſt convenient, to erect a Bulwark in the Eaſt part of the Wall. The White ſquare Tower (as was formerly ſaid) was firſt erected, and finiſh'd in the <hi>Conquerors</hi> time, but ſtood naked and ſingle without other Buildings a good while: and the ſtory ſaith, that in <hi>William Rufus</hi> time, it was by the injury of the Heavens, and violence of tempeſt ſore ſhaken, and ſome part tumbled down, which was repair'd by the ſaid <hi>Rufus</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, who alſo cauſed a Caſtle to be built under the ſaid White Tower, on the South ſide towards the <hi>Thames,</hi> and he ſurrounded that alſo with a ſtrong Wall; Now, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntindon</hi> relates, that <hi>VVill. Rufus</hi> challeng'd the inveſtiture of Prelates, and pill'd the people pitifully, to ſpend the treaſure about the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and the great Hall at <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> whereof he was Founder. The firſt Keeper of the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was call'd <hi>Conſtable, Oſtowerus, Acolinillus, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Geoffrey Magnaville,</hi> were the firſt four <hi>Conſtables</hi> of the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> by ſucceſſion, all which held a portion of Land that appertain'd to the Priory of the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> near <hi>Algate,</hi> viz. <hi>Eaſt Smithfield,</hi> as belonging to that Office, making thereof a Vineyard; and would

would not part with it till the ſecond year of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> when by judgment of the Court, it was reſtored to the Church. The foreſaid <hi>Geoffery Magnaville,</hi> was at one time <hi>Conſtable</hi> of the <hi>Tower, Sherif</hi> of <hi>London, Middleſex, Eſſex,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> as the Chronicles relate; He alſo fortified the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> againſt King <hi>Stephen,</hi> but the King took him at laſt at St. <hi>Albanes,</hi> and would not free him till he had ſurrendred the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> with the Caſtles of <hi>VValden</hi> and <hi>Plaſhey</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.

            <p>In the year 1216, the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was delivered to <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> by the Barons of <hi>England,</hi> who banded againſt the King; <hi>Anno</hi> 1222. the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>London,</hi> having made an uprore againſt the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter, Hubere de Burgh</hi> chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> came to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and ſummoned before him the Mayor and Aldermen: of whom he enquired, and demanded the principal Authors of that Inſurrection. Among whom one <hi>Conſtantine Fitzaeluphe</hi> confeſs'd that he was the man, ſaying undauntedly that he was the man, and that he had done much leſſe than he had thought to have done; Whereupon the Juſtice paſſed him over to <hi>Fulke de Brent,</hi> who with a band of arm'd men, brought him to the Gallowes where he was executed. <hi>Anno 1244. Griffeth</hi> the eldeſt Son to <hi>Luellin</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> being kept priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> deviſed means to eſcape, and having made a Line of the Sheets and Hangings, he put himſelf down from the top of the Tower, but in the ſliding, the weight of his Body, he being a corpulent man, brake the rope with his neck together.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 3d. impriſoned the Sheriffs of <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1253. for the eſcape of a priſoner out of <hi>Newgate.</hi> The ſame <hi>Henry</hi> with his Queen, to ſecure himſelf from rebelling Barons, kept his Court at the <hi>Tower,</hi> &amp; ſent for the Lords to hold a Parliament; and the next year his Queen paſſing through <hi>London-</hi>Bridge, the Londoners did outrage her as ſhe paſs'd hurling ſtones and dirt at her, in ſo much that ſhe was forc'd to return; hereupon the Mayor, Aldermen, and She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95174:20"/>
were ſent to divers Priſons, and a <hi>Cuſtos</hi> was ſet over the City for the time, viz. <hi>Othon</hi> Conſtable of the Tower, until ſubmiſſion had bin made, and other ſatisfaction given.</p>
            <p>It is upon Record, that <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. allowed a Knight 2 d. <hi>per diem,</hi> and a Squire a peny, for their Diet, as long as they were priſoners in the Tower upon his Command: <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> being priſoner in the Tower, gave his Watch-men a ſleeping potion, and ſo eſcaped; but afterwards, he was arraigned and condemned by his Peers, without perſonal appearance, and ſo executed at the Elmes, where he hung two dayes.</p>
            <p>The Londoners in the year 1326. ſeized upon the Tower, wreſting the keys out of the Conſtables hands, they freed all the Priſoners, and kept it in their hands for the uſe of Queen <hi>Iſabel,</hi> and her Son <hi>Edward,</hi> both Tower and City.</p>
            <p>The firſt gold that was coin'd in the Tower, was in the raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and the peeces were call'd Florences, of the value of 6 <hi>s. 8 d; Perceval de poſt</hi> being Maſter of the Mint at that time. All great ſums before, were uſed to be payd by the weight, as ſo many pounds or marks of ſilver, or ſo many pounds or marks of gold; but they bore no ſtamp, the leſſer payments were in Starlings, which was the only coin then current, and ſtamp'd, which were pence ſo call'd. And they had their antiquity no further, then from the raign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond. Nevertheleſs, the Saxon coines before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, were pence of fine ſilver, ſomewhat weightier, and better then the latter ſtarlings, and the probableſt Reaſon that is given, why it was ſtarling money, was, becauſe in the ring or border of the peny, there was a Starre ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Tower of <hi>London:</hi> In the year 1360. <hi>John</hi> the French King being Priſoner in the Tower, King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, being newly retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned victoriouſly from <hi>France,</hi> the firſt thing he did, was to viſit his Priſoner whoſe ranſome was aſſeſſed afterwards at three millions of Florences or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; whereupon he was brought honourably to the Sea ſide: <hi>Anno</hi> 1387. King <hi>Richard</hi> kept his Chriſtmas in the Tower, and the year after was clapt up Priſoner there.</p>
            <p>In the year 1458. there were Juſts and Tournements in the Tower, wherein the chief Actor was the Duke of <hi>Somerſet; Anno 1465, Henry</hi> the ſixth, was brought Priſoner to the Tower, where he remained many years, of whom was given this Character, that <hi>he was a good King, but born in an ill time:</hi> The Mayor of <hi>London</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Lee,</hi> and the Aldermen, freed the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> once from his impriſonment; but being ſent thither again, he was pittifully mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. <hi>Anno</hi> 1478. The Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> was drowned in a But of <hi>Malmſey</hi> within the Tower: and 5. years after young <hi>Edward</hi> the fifth, with his Brother, were by the practices of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, ſtifled there betwixt two Fether-beds, as the current ſtory goes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford, Anno</hi> 1485. was made Conſtable of the Tower, and he had alſo the keeping of the Lions, and Leopards, as the ſtory makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Wife to <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, died in the Tower, <hi>Anno</hi> 1502. in Child-birth, and the year before there was running at tilt, and tourney there; The Chappel in the high white Tower was burnt <hi>Anno</hi> 1512. Queen <hi>Anne Bullein,</hi> was beheaded in the Tower 1541. and a little after, the Lady <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Howard,</hi> both Wifes to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: <hi>Anno</hi> 1546. a ſtrange accident happened in the Tower: for one <hi>Foxley,</hi> who was Pot-maker for the Mint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen aſleep, he could not be awakened by pinching, cramping, or burning for fourteen dayes, at which time he awak'd as freſh as at the firſt day he began to ſleep.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:95174:21"/>
In <hi>Henry</hi> the eights time, the Tower was ever and anon full of priſoners, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> was clap'd there cloſe Priſoner: and at laſt they took away from him all his Books, ſo he did ſhut up all his windows, and liv'd afterwards in obſcurity, and being asked Why, he anſwered, <hi>'Tis time to ſhut up ſhop, when the Ware is all gone:</hi> At his firſt entrance to the Tower, the Gentleman Porter, ask'd for his fee, which is the upper Garment, whereupon Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> pull'd off his Cap to give him, but that not ſufficing, he pull'd out a handful of Angels, end gave him a good many, a Knight that was in his Company telling him, that he was glad to ſee him ſo full of Angels; yes, anſwered he, <hi>I love to carry my friends alwayes about me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The young Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> was beheaded there not long after, and upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſhe made a moſt ingenious Speech, and full of pity, <hi>That ſhe came thither, to ſerve for an example to poſterity, that innocence cannot be any protection againſt greatneſs; And that ſhe was come thither, not for aſpiring to a Crown, but for not refuſing one, when it was offered Her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was brought up many years in that School of affliction, but afterwards ſhe may be ſaid to have gone from the Scaffold to the Throne; For the truth is, that the Scaffold had made an end of her, had not King <hi>Philip</hi> her Brother in Law, ſtrongly interceded for her. In her dayes, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> loſt his head in the Tower, which he might have kept on many years longer, had he not bin betrayed by the Lady <hi>Walſingham;</hi> to whom after the ſentence of condemnation, he ſent a Ring, which the Queen had given him as a token that ſhe would ſtick to him in any danger: the Lady delivered not this Ring, and being a little after upon her Death-bed ſhe deſired to ſpeak with the Queen, and having disburthened a great weight which lay upon her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for that act, the Queen flung away in a fury, and never enjoyed her ſelf perfectly after that time, but ſhe would break out often into paſſion, and wring her hands, crying, O <hi>Eſſex, Eſſex.</hi> And this Earl was the laſt, who was executed within the walls of the Tower.</p>
            <p>In King <hi>James</hi>'s time, for 22 years, there was no blood ſpilt, in the Tower, or upon Tower-hill, only Sir <hi>Gervaſe Elwayes</hi> was hanged there, when he was Lieutenant: and one remarkable paſſage there was in his Speech upon the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that being in the low Countries, and much addicted to gaming, he made a vow, that if ever he played more above ſuch a value, he might be hanged; but he did violate the Oath, and ſo the juſt Judgement of Heaven did fall upon him, accordingly as he ſaid.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Caſtlehaven</hi> was brought from the Tower to be executed for hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid kinds of incontinencies in <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt time; Afterwards, in the raign of the <hi>long Parliament,</hi> and ever ſince, the Tower of <hi>London</hi> hath had more number of Priſoners, then it had in the compaſſe of a hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>This ſtately Tower of <hi>London,</hi> ſerves not only for a Gaol to detain priſoners, but for many other uſes, It is a ſtrong Fort, or Cittadel, which ſecures both City and River, It ſerves not only to defend, but to command either, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; It ſerves as a royal Randezvouz for Aſſemblies and Treaties; It is the Treaſury for the Jewels and Ornaments of the Crown; The great Archive which conſerves all the old Records of the Courts of Juſtice at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> It is the place for the Royal Mint, and Coynage of Gold and Silver; It is the chief Magazin and Armory, or Arſenal of the whole Land, for Martial Engines, and Proviſion. There only, is the <hi>Brake</hi> or <hi>Rack,</hi> uſually call'd the <hi>Duke of Exceters Daughter,</hi> becauſe he was the firſt Inventer of it.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, It is a great Ornament, by the ſituation of it, both to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and City.</p>

The City of <hi>London</hi> hath divers other interior Towers, as that on the North of the great Bridge; At the South end over the Gate, there is alſo another Tower over <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> which hath ſuffered many accidents of firing, and otherwiſe, and was ſtill made up by the care and charge of the City, ſpecially one time when it was under baſtard <hi>Fawconbridge,</hi> burnt by the Marriners, and Saylers of <hi>Kent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Antiquaries ſpeak of two Caſtles that were in the Weſt part of <hi>London,</hi> one call'd the Caſtle of <hi>Monfiquet,</hi> which was built by a Baron of that name, who came over with the Conqueror, which was afterwards demoliſhed, and the <hi>Black Fryers</hi> riſen up out of the ruines of it; The ſecond Caſtle is <hi>Baynards Castle,</hi> by <hi>Pauls</hi> Wharf, built alſo by one <hi>Baynard,</hi> who came over with the Conqueror: who being ennobled, the honour of <hi>Baynards</hi> Caſtle ſucceeded from Father to Son, a long time, till it came to Sir <hi>Robert Fitzwater,</hi> a valiant Cavalier: who being fallen into the diſpleaſure of King <hi>John,</hi> in the Barons Warres, was baniſhed, and <hi>Baynards</hi> Caſtle deſtroyed; But afterwards, being reſtored to the Kings favour, by an exployt he did in <hi>France,</hi> he was re-inveſted in all his Livings, and ſo repair'd <hi>Baynards</hi> Caſtle again: Moreover, he was made chief <hi>Banner-bearer</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> whereof he had a Charter, which ran to this ſenſe, <q>That he ſaid, <hi>Robert Fitzwater,</hi> and his Heirs, ought to be, and are chief <hi>Bannerers</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> in fee for the Chaſtilary, which he and his Anceſtors had from <hi>Baynards</hi> Caſtle, and the ſaid City. In time of War, the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> and his Heires, ought to ſerve the City as followeth. The ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> (he being the twentieth man of Armes himſelf) ought to come on Horſeback, covered with Cloth or Armor, under the great Weſt door of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with his Banner diſplayed before him; and when he is come mounted to that door, and apparreld, as before is ſaid, The Maior (with the Aldermen and Sheriffs) in their Arms, ſhall come out of the Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> unto the ſaid Weſt door, the Maior bearing a Banner in his hand, all on foot, which Banner ſhall be <hi>Gules,</hi> the Image of St. <hi>Paul</hi> Gold, the face, hands, feet, and Sword Argent; And as ſoon as the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> ſhall ſee the Maior, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Sheriffs, come on foot out of the Church, armed with ſuch a Banner, he ſhall alight off his Horſe, and ſalute the Maior, and ſay to him, Sir Maior, I am come to do my ſervice which I owe to the City: whereunto the Maior, and Aldermen ſhall anſwer, We give to you, as to our Bannerer of ſee in this City, the Banner of this City, to beare, and govern to the honour and profit of this City to your power: And the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> and his Heires, ſhall receive the ſaid Banner in his hands, and ſhall go on foot out of the Gate, with the Banner in his hands, and the Maior, Aldermen, and Sheriffs, ſhall follow to the door, and ſhall bring a Horſe to the ſaid Bannerer, worth twenty pounds, which Horſe ſhall be ſadled with a ſaddle of the Arms of the ſaid Bannerer, and ſhall be covered with ſindalls of the ſaid Arms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Moreover, they ſhall preſent unto him, twenty pounds Starling money, and deliver it to the Chamberlain of the ſaid Bannerer, for his expences that day. Then the ſaid Bannerer ſhall mount on Horſeback, with the Banner in his hand, and as ſoon as he is up, he ſhall ſay to the Lord Maior, that he cauſe a Marſhal to be choſen for the Hoſt, one of the City; which Marſhal being nam'd, the ſaid Bannerer ſhall command the Maior and Burgeſſes of the City, to warn the Commons to aſſemble, and they ſhall all go under the Banner of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and the ſaid Bannerer ſhall bear it himſelf unto <hi>Ealdgate,</hi> and there the ſaid Bannerer, and the Maior, ſhall deliver the ſaid Banner from thence, to whom they ſhall aſſent and think good; And in caſe they make any iſſue out of the City, then the ſaid Bannerer ought to chooſe two out of every Ward, the moſt ſage Perſonages, to foreſee and look to the ſafe keeping of the City, after they be gone forth; And this Councel ſhall be taken in the priory of the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> near unto <hi>Aldgate;</hi> And alſo before every Town or Caſtle, they

            </p>
            <p>Theſe be the Rights that the ſaid <hi>Bannerer</hi> ſhall have in time of War; But the Rights that belong unto the ſaid Bannerer Sir <hi>Rob. Fitzwater</hi> in time of peace are theſe, that is to ſay, <q>The ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> hath a Soke or Ward in the City, that is to ſay, a Wall of the Canonry of St. <hi>Paul</hi> unto the Thames, &amp; ſo to the ſide of the Mill, which is in the water that cometh from <hi>Fleet</hi> bridge, &amp; ſo goeth by Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don walls betwixt the Fryars Preachers &amp; Ludgate, &amp; ſo returneth back by the houſe of the ſaid Fryrs, unto the ſaid Walls, of the ſaid Canonry of St. <hi>Pauls, viz.</hi> all the Pariſh of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> which is in the gift of his Anceſtors by the ſaid Signority; And ſo the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> hath appendant unto the ſaid Soke, all theſe things under-written, &amp; if any of the Sokemanry be impleaded in <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> of any thing that toucheth not the Body of the Lord Mayor, or the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs for the time being, it is not lawful for the Sokeman of the Sokmanry of the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> to demand a Court of the ſaid <hi>Robert;</hi> And the Mayor and the Citizens of London ought to grant him a Court, and in his Court he ought to bring his Judgments as it is aſſented and agreed upon in the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> that ſhall be given him. If any therefore be taken in his Sokemanry, he ought to have his ſtocks and impriſonment in his Soke, and he ſhall be brought thence to the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> before the Mayor, and there they ſhall provide him his judgement that ought to be given of him; but his judgement ſhall not be publiſh'd till he come unto the Court of the ſaid <hi>Robert,</hi> and in his Liberty. And the Judgement ſhall be ſuch, that if he have deſerved death for Treaſon, he is to be tied to a Poſt in the <hi>Thames</hi> at a good Wharf, where Boats are faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, two ebbings and two flowings of the water: And if he be condemn'd for a common thief, he ought to be led to the <hi>Elmes,</hi> and there ſuffer his judgement as other thieves; So the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> and his Heirs hath the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that he holdeth a great Franchiſe within the City, that the Mayor of the City, and the Cittizens are bound to do him of Right, <hi>viz.</hi> that when the Mayor will hold a great Councel, he ought to call the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> and his Heir to be with him in the Councel of the ſaid City; and the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> ought to be ſworn of the Councell of the ſaid City, againſt all people; ſaving the King, and his Heirs. And when the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> comes to the <hi>Huſtings</hi> in the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> of the ſaid City, the Mayor or his Livetenant, ought to riſe and ſet him down to ſit neer him; and ſo long as he is in the Guild-hall, all the judgements ought to be given by his mouth, according to the Records of the Recorders of the ſaid Guildhall; And ſo many Waifes as come while he he is there, he ought to give them to the Bayliffs of the ſaid Town, or to whom he will by the Councel of the City.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the ancient Franchiſes that belong to the <hi>Bannerer</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as they ſtand upon ancient authentick Records; But when this honor fell from the <hi>Fitzwaters,</hi> and from <hi>Baynards</hi> Caſtle, 'tis incertain; Now, that Caſtle fell after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> who was Crown'd there by the Title of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, to whom this City ſtuck very cloſe; But in the ſeventh year of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, many of the greateſt men of <hi>London</hi> were attach'd for Treaſon, with divers Aldermen, whereof though they were acquitted, yet they did forfeit their goods to the value of 40000 marks; among whom Sir <hi>Thomas Coke,</hi> Sir <hi>John Plummer,</hi> and <hi>Humfrey Howard,</hi> were of the number; And the ſaid <hi>Coke</hi> Lord Mayor a little before was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> with one <hi>Hawkins;</hi> nor could <hi>Coke</hi> be acquitted until he had paied 8000 Marks to the King.</p>

A great part of the Houſe on the Weſt ſide, was given to the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> whence <hi>Salisbury</hi> Court derives its name to this day; The other part towards the Eaſt remain'd waſt, until <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, did build a ſtately Palace there in a very ſhort time, and call'd it <hi>Bridewel,</hi> which he did for the entertainment of his Nephew <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who came hither <hi>Anno</hi> 1522, and was there entertain'd in a Princely and Magnificent manner.</p>

            <p>IT is obſerved, that the Engliſh Nation hath bin alwaies extraordinarily addicted to Literature, and to the love of Knowledge: which among other inſtances appears; in that, of old times, there were three principal Churches in <hi>London</hi> which had famous Schools, wherein there were profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors &amp; Doctors, which were famous for their knowledge in Philoſophy and the Mathematicks; The three Churches which had theſe Schools by Priviledges, were the Cathedral Church of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> for by General Councel held in the year 1176 at Rome in the Patriarchy of Saint <hi>Lateran,</hi> it was decreed, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cathedral Church ſho uld have a School-maſter to teach poor Schollers, and others. The ſecond, was St. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whereof <hi>Ingulphus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Crowland</hi> in the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror writes thus; <hi>I</hi> Ingulphus <hi>an humble ſervant of God, born of Engliſh Parents in the moſt beautiful City of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>for to attain to Learning, was firſt put to</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>and after to ſtudy at</hi> Oxford, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The third School, ſeemes to have bin in the Monaſtery of St. Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in <hi>Bermondſey</hi> at <hi>Southwark.</hi>

            <p>The Chronicles teach us, that <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth having ſuppreſſed the <hi>Priories Aliens,</hi> whereof there were ſome about <hi>London,</hi> namely, our Lady of <hi>Rouncival</hi> by <hi>Charing croſſe,</hi> one other Hoſpital in <hi>Oldborn,</hi> now <hi>Holborn,</hi> another without <hi>Gripplegate,</hi> and the fourth without <hi>Alderſgate,</hi> beſides others that are worne long ſince out of memory, only that of <hi>Rouncival</hi> continued till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, being converted to a brotherhood; But <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Patent, that there ſhould be in <hi>London</hi> more Grammar Schooles erected, to wit, one in St <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> another in <hi>Alhallows</hi> the great, another in St <hi>Peters</hi> on <hi>Cornhil,</hi> and another in the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Acon</hi> in Weſt cheap. The Free-ſchool of <hi>Pauls</hi> was built of an old ruined houſe in ample manner, and richly endowed <hi>Anno</hi> 1512, by Doctor <hi>Colet</hi> Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> for 153 poor mens children: for which there was a chief Maſter, an Uſher, and Chaplain ordained.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in the year 1553, after the erection of <hi>Christs Hoſpital,</hi> which riſſe out of the ruins of the <hi>Grey Fryers</hi> that ſtood there, a great number of poor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were taken in, and a fair School appointed at the charge of the City, though <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth bear the name of Patron.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1561 the <hi>Marchant Taylors</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> founded one notable School. in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Lawrence Poultney.</hi> The houſe was ſometimes the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> called, <hi>the Mannor of the Roſe,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Richard Hills</hi> Maſter of the company, did purchaſe for 500 l. and beſtowed it for a free School.</p>
            <p>There was an old Cuſtome in <hi>London,</hi> that the School, Maſters ſhould meet on feſtival daies, and their Schollers ſhould diſpute in Logick, as well as Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Queſtions, and Principles, and the moſt common randezvouz, was Saint <hi>Bart holmews</hi> in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> being a priory, where upon a bank boorded under
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95174:23"/>
a tree, they uſed to meet, and the beſt Schollers were rewarded with Bows and Arrows of ſilver, which they carried away as prizes: but that laudable cuſtome is grown obſolete, and quite diſcontinued.</p>
            <p>A great emulation there was 'twixt <hi>Pauls</hi> Schollers, and thoſe of St. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;</hi> the Schollers of <hi>Pauls</hi> would taunt, and term them, St. <hi>Anthonies Piggs;</hi> and they would call St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Schollers, <hi>Pigeons of Pauls,</hi> and many feuds hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd amongſt them in the open ſtreets: but St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> School decaying, the quarrel alſo ceas'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1582, a publick Lecture of <hi>Chirurgery</hi> was founded, to be read in the Colledge of Phyſitians in <hi>Knight-rider-ſtreet</hi> twice every week; The Founder thereof was, the honourable Baron the Lord <hi>Lumley,</hi> and <hi>Richard Chadwel</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of Phyſick; and Doctor <hi>Foſter</hi> was the firſt Reader thereof.</p>
            <p>A Mathematical Lecture was alſo founded about the ſame time, to be read in a fair ancient Chappel, built by <hi>Simon Eyre</hi> within <hi>Leaden-hall;</hi> But this Chappel, being employ'd afterwards for ſtowage of goods taken out of a Spaniſh Cara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1579 Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham</hi> (Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Royal Marchant or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, ſpoken of before) gave the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> with all the buildings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto appertaining, <hi>viz.</hi> the one moity to the Mayor and Comminalty of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and their Succeſſors, upon truſt that they perform as ſhall be declared; and the other moity to the Mercers on the ſame confidence; The Maior &amp; Aldermen are to find four to read Lectures of Divinity, Aſtronomy, Muſick, and Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try within that dwelling in <hi>Biſhopsgate-ſtreet,</hi> and to beſtow the ſum of 200 l. <hi>viz.</hi> 50 l. <hi>per annum</hi> to every Reader. The Mercers alſo are to find three Readers in the ſame place, that is, The <hi>Civil Law, Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and every Reader was to have 50 l. a year ſtipen'd, which great gift was confirm'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by Act of Parliament, and ſo to continue for ever.</p>
            <p>Theſe Lectures are to be read every day in the week in Term time (Sundays excepted) in the Latine Tongue in the morning, and the ſame in Engliſh in the ſame dayes afternoon, only the Muſick Lecture, whereof Doctor <hi>Bull</hi> was the firſt Lecturers was to be read only in Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there is in and about the City of London, a whole Univerſity, as it were of Students, Practiſers, or Pleaders, and Judges of the Lawes of England, not living of common Salaries, as is uſed in other Academies; but of their private maintenance, as being ſupported, by their own means or practiſe, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition from their friends; In ſo much that moſt of them are Sons &amp; youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brothers to wealthy Parents, where, beſides the knowledge of the Laws, they learn all other civilities and exerciſes beſides.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Nurſeries or Societies there are fourteen, whereof nine do ſtand within the Liberties of the City, and five without; Thoſe that ſtand within the Liberties are, <hi>Sargeants Inne</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet, Sargeants Inne</hi> in <hi>Chancery Lane,</hi> the two <hi>Temples,</hi> which are called, <hi>Inns of Court;</hi> The other are, <hi>Cliffords Inne, Thavies Inne</hi> in <hi>Holborn, Furnevals Inne, Barnards Inne,</hi> and <hi>Staples Inne,</hi> which are termd Inns of <hi>Chancery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without the Liberties, there is <hi>Grayes Inne</hi> in <hi>Holburn, Lincolns Inne,</hi> (which are Inns of Court) <hi>Clements Inne, New Inne,</hi> and <hi>Lions Inne,</hi> which are houſes of Chancery. In former time, there was in <hi>Scroops</hi> Court in <hi>Holborn</hi> an Inne of Sargeants alſo; There was likewiſe where <hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe now ſtands <hi>Cheſters Inne</hi> or <hi>Strand Inne,</hi> in the liberty of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> which was pull'd down with many other Buildings, to make room for <hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe, who had alſo his materials from St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which ſome held to be no better than Sacriledge; and therefore that fatal death, to be beheaded, befell the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> who with his Councel were, it ſeems, ſo infatuated, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95174:24"/>
to call for his Clergy, whereby, by the Lawes of England; he might have bin ſaved. Juſſice <hi>Forteſcue</hi> makes mention alſo of a tenth houſe of <hi>Chancery,</hi> but he names not the place. The choiſeſt, gentlieſt &amp; moſt ingenious wits of the Land, are founds among theſe Students of the Inns of Court, having co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly bin gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates before, in one of the Univerſities; But the Inns of Chancery being as it were Provinces ſubjected ſeverally to the Inns of Court be chiefly made up of Attorneys, Sollicitors, and Clerks that follow the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall; yet many of them remove to one of the great Inns of Court, where continuing ſeven years, and frequenting Readings, Mootings, Boltings, and other learned Exerciſes, they improve themſelves in the knowledge of the Lawes: they are then by the conſent of the <hi>Benchers,</hi> who are moſt commonly of the grave and learned ſort ſelected, &amp; call'd to the degree of <hi>Utter Barriſters,</hi> and ſo enabled to be Practitioners in the Law, both in their Chamber, and at the Barre in open Court-Of theſe after they be call'd to a further ſtep of preferment, 2. were uſed to be choſen every year to be Readers, who make two Readings eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year out of ſome choiſe hard points in the Law, one in <hi>Lent,</hi> the other in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi> Out of theſe Benchers and Readers, Sergeants at Law are made, and of them the Judges, unleſſe it be that ſome by ſpecial favour of the Prince are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen otherwiſe; But being made Sergeants, they leave the Inns of Court and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to one of the Sergeants Inns; where they only, and the reverend Judges are admitted. Touching the two Temples, they are diſcourſed of here in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; But, concerning <hi>Grayes Inne</hi> and <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> they took their denominations from two noble Lords, who had formerly Palaces in thoſe places where thoſe two Innes now ſtand; The one is ſingular, for a curious Chappel it hath; the other for choiſe delicate Walks, high and low, with a large delightful proſpect that carrieth the optiques very far, where the choiſeſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both of City and Suburbs uſe to reſort in the Summer, to ſolace themſelves, and breath freſh aire.</p>
            <p>Thus have we rambled through the City of London, and waded hitherto through univerſals (wherein there is not alwaies plain-dealing) we will now hunt dry foot after particulars, and find out the Primitive mode, &amp; method of Government which <hi>London</hi> had, with the Titles of her chief <hi>Magiſtrates;</hi> We will then Muſter her twelve prime Companies, with all the reſt of her Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; Then, a Perambulation ſhall be made through all her Precincts, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermanries and Wards, as far as the point of the Lord Mayors Sword doth reach; Then ſhall there be a Parallel 'twixt <hi>London,</hi> and other the greateſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the world; wherein it will appear to the impartial diſcerning Reader, that, if conſideration be had to the Prerogatives and power of her chiefeſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, to their plenty, magnificence and hoſpitality, to the ſecurity of Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers up and down her ſtreets at midnight, as well as at noon daies, The City of <hi>London</hi> admits no Parallel.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Touching the primitive Government of <hi>London</hi> in the time of the <hi>Britains,</hi> Antiquity ſcarce affords us any light, whereby to diſcern what it was, <hi>Caeſar</hi> gives us moſt, when he writes, that <hi>Mandrubacius</hi> was King of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> or the <hi>Trinobants,</hi> which laſt word extends alſo to ſome of the <hi>Counties</hi> adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; But it may be wondred, that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> ſhould know ſo much, in regard that He never took firm footing in Great <hi>Britain,</hi> but, by way of explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, did only <hi>diſcover</hi> Her; <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> may be ſaid to <hi>conceal</hi> Her. <hi>Caligula</hi> intending an Invaſion, was diverted by his Warres with the <hi>Germans. Claudius Caeſar</hi> (from whom <hi>Gloceſter</hi> takes her name, being no other then <hi>CaſtrumClaudii,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Claudius)</hi> was the firſt that fixt here, and he ſent over <hi>Publins Agriola</hi> for his Lieutenant, who took great pains to civilize the Nation: and as he was about the work, he ſent notice to Rome, that he preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Britiſh</hi> wits before the <hi>Gallic.</hi> Then was <hi>London</hi> made a <hi>Praefectura,</hi> and the Magiſtrate in chief, was called <hi>Praefect</hi> (as he of <hi>Rome</hi> is called to this day) this Title continued all the time that the <hi>Romans</hi> had dominion here, which was above 300 years. Afterwards, the <hi>Romans</hi> having ſo many great Irons in the fire by Warres they had againſt divers Nations, who had revolted from them, they drain'd this Iland not only of great numbers of the <hi>Britiſh Youth,</hi> to ſerve them in their Wartes abroad, but drew away at laſt their own <hi>Legions;</hi> whereupon, the Iland being thus grown weak, much depopulated, and to a long deſuetude of Arms, the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who are now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (yet keep ſtill their firſt denomination of <hi>Saxons,</hi> both in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tongues to this day) came over with a conſiderable ſtrength, and having in a <hi>Parly</hi> on <hi>Salsbury</hi> Plains, muſtered moſt of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nobility by a ſtratagem, and taken <hi>Vortiger</hi> the King Priſoner, He for his ranſom was forc'd to give, not only <hi>London,</hi> but moſt part of the Iland to the <hi>Saxons.</hi> And the chief Magiſtrate of <hi>London,</hi> they call'd <hi>Portreve,</hi> which is a Gardian or Governour of a Port, and that name is yet uſed in <hi>England,</hi> in ſome places. The <hi>Saxons</hi> then changed their names into <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> yet they continued <hi>Pagans</hi> a long time after but at laſt, the <hi>Britains</hi> converted them to Chriſtianity, and then the City of <hi>London</hi> flouriſhed exceedingly for many Ages, till there came over a ſwarm of <hi>Danes,</hi> who proved more fatal to <hi>London,</hi> then any other Nation; for by fire and ſword, they had almoſt utterly deſtroyed Her, had not the <hi>Londoners</hi> at laſt rowz'd up their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who making vertue of neceſſity, did fall upon King <hi>Swein</hi> the inſulting E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, with ſuch a reſolution, that by a mighty ſlaughter, and extraordinary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95174:25"/>
proweſſe, they utterly repel'd him; The City having recovered her former luſtre (though 'twas a good while firſt) ſhe continued under the Engliſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Magiſtracy of a <hi>Portreve,</hi> till the <hi>Norman</hi> ruſh'd in; yet the Title was not alter'd a good while after, when at laſt he came to be call'd <hi>Bayliffe,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Provoſt: Richard</hi> the firſt, for ſupporting the <hi>Croy ſada,</hi> and his Warres in the Holy Land, got great Contributions of monies, from the <hi>Londoners;</hi> in lieu whereof, he gave them leave to chooſe two Bayliffs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. King <hi>John</hi> after him chang'd their Bayliffs into a <hi>Maior,</hi> and two <hi>Sheriffs:</hi> To theſe <hi>Henry</hi> the third adds ſome <hi>Aldermen,</hi> who though yeerly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legible at firſt, grew afterwards Perpetual; Now, this Word <hi>Alderman,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to <hi>Senator,</hi> being both derived from old Age and Gravity.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Alderman</hi> we read of in <hi>England,</hi> was in the time of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 800 years agoe, whoſe name was <hi>Ailwine,</hi> and was deſcended of the blood Royal, as appeares by his Epitaph in that goodly Monaſtery, in the Ile of <hi>Ely,</hi> whereof he was founder himſelf, which Epitaph runs thus.
<q>
                  <p>Hic requieſcit Dom. Ailwinus inclyti Regis Edgari Cognatus, totius Angliae Aldermannus, &amp; hujus Sacri coenobii miraculoſus Fundator.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here reſteth the Lord <hi>Ailwine</hi> (Couſin to Noble King <hi>Edgar)</hi> Alderman of all <hi>England</hi> which ſome interpret chief Juſtice, &amp; miraculous Founder of this holy Abbey. Hence it may be infer'd, that the appellation of <hi>Alderman,</hi> is not only venerable, but ancient, &amp; honourable. And from this Lord <hi>Ailwine,</hi> it ſeemes the firſt <hi>Maior</hi> of <hi>London</hi> deſcended, who was <hi>Henry Fitz-Alwin, Anno</hi> 1191. who continued many years in the Office, &amp; lies buried in St. <hi>Mary Bothaw,</hi> near <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-ſtone;</hi> and the next <hi>Maior</hi> to him was <hi>Roger Fitz-Alwin,</hi> after whom the Office grew annual.</p>
            <p>The City being thus, in tract of time, come to a fixed and ſetled Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe began to flouriſh exceedingly. And as ſhe increaſed in Men, Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and Merchandizing, ſo the Kings did enlarge their royal favours unto Her, <hi>Anno 1220. Henry</hi> the third confirmed unto the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> free Warren, or liberty to hunt about the City, and in the Warren of <hi>Stanes;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, that the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> ſhould paſſe Toll-free, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>England,</hi> and that the <hi>Keddles</hi> and <hi>Weres</hi> in the Rivers of <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Medway,</hi> ſhould be plucked up and deſtroyed for ever, becauſe Navigation to <hi>London</hi> might be more free. <hi>Roger Renger</hi> was Maior, when theſe Patents were granted. A few years after the liberties, and franchiſes of <hi>London,</hi> were ratified by the ſame King, who granted, that either <hi>Sheriff</hi> ſhould have two <hi>Clarks,</hi> and two <hi>Sargeants,</hi> and that the Citizens ſhould have a <hi>Common Seal:</hi> A little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame <hi>King</hi> granted that the <hi>Maior Elect,</hi> ſhould be preſented to the <hi>Barons</hi> of the Exchequer, and they ſhould admit him. Moreover, he gave way, that the City ſhould be fortified with <hi>Poſts,</hi> and Iron <hi>Chains,</hi> drawn athwart o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſtreets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno 1326. Edward</hi> the third much increaſed the immunities of the City, and the Authority of the <hi>Maior;</hi> for he granted, that the <hi>Maior ſhould be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for the Gaol delivery</hi> at Newgate, and have power to reprieve Priſoners. That the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> ſhould not be conſtrained to go out of the City of <hi>London,</hi> to any Warre; He granted alſo, that the liberties and franchiſes of the City, ſhould not after that time be taken into the <hi>Kings</hi> hands, as it had bin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before, when a <hi>Cuſtos</hi> was put in. Moreover, He granted by Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, that there ſhould be no other <hi>Eſchetor</hi> in the City, but the <hi>Maior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1338. He granted, that the <hi>Sargeants</hi> attending the Maior and the Sheriffs, ſhould bear <hi>Maces ſilver and gilt,</hi> with the Royal Arms engraven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:95174:25"/>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1356. The ſame King ordained, that whereas the <hi>Aldermen</hi> were uſed to be chang'd <hi>yeerly,</hi> they ſhould not be removed without ſpetial cauſe for the future. Then for the higher honour, and Authority of the Office, the Sword was added with the Cap of Maintenance.</p>
            <p>Thus in proceſs of time, the Government of <hi>London,</hi> grew to be more and more eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1416. Sir <hi>Henry Barton</hi> being Maior, ordained <hi>Lanthorns and Lights</hi> to be hang'd out on the Winter Evenings, betwixt <hi>Alhollontide</hi> and <hi>Candlemas:</hi> Sir <hi>John Norman,</hi> being Maior, was the firſt who went upon the River to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> having made a ſtately <hi>Barge</hi> to that purpoſe, <hi>Anno</hi> 1453. And the reſt of the <hi>Companies</hi> followed that laudable Example, with their Barges alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1473. Sir <hi>John Tate</hi> being Maior, the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted each of them, to have <hi>ſixteen Serjeants,</hi> and every Serjeant to have his <hi>Yeoman;</hi> Moreover, they were to have <hi>ſix Clerks,</hi> a <hi>Secondary,</hi> a <hi>Clark of the Papers,</hi> with fower other Clarks, beſides the <hi>Under Sheriffs</hi> Clark.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1484. It happened, that there was ſucceſſively one after the other, three Mayors, and three Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> in the compaſſe of one year; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſweating ſickneſs, which rag'd ſo extreamly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1501. Sir <hi>John Sha</hi> being <hi>Maior,</hi> added ſome ſtate to the Office; for it was ordered, that the Aldermen his Brethren ſhould attend him on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, from Guild-hall to the Rivers ſide, when he took Barge for <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> Beſides, he was the firſt who kept Court in his own Houſe, for redreſſing of ſuch matters that came before him; Sir <hi>William Capel</hi> being Maior of <hi>London,</hi> caus'd <hi>Cages</hi> to be ſet up in every Ward, for the puniſhments of <hi>Vagabonds,</hi> and <hi>Rogues. Anno</hi> 1556. Sir <hi>Thomas Offley</hi> being Mayor, the <hi>Night Bel-man</hi> was firſt ordained.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did much favour the City of <hi>London;</hi> and for the better Government thereof, gave way for a <hi>Provoſt Marſhal</hi> to be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Thus have we obſerved, that the Governours in chief of the City of <hi>London,</hi> have had from time to time, differing appellations. Under the <hi>Britains,</hi> they were call'd Kings; The <hi>Romans</hi> ſtiled them, <hi>Praefects.</hi> The <hi>Saxons, Portreves.</hi> The <hi>Norman</hi> Kings at their firſt comming, <hi>Bayliffs,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Provoſts,</hi> Then came the Office to be eſtabliſhed in the Title of <hi>Maior,</hi> which hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued any time theſe 467. years, though it was interrupted ſometimes by a <hi>Cuſtos;</hi> which ſome of the Kings, as <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, upon a diſpleaſure againſt the City, were uſed to appoint.</p>
            <p>This great <hi>Urban</hi> Magiſtrate, the Maior of <hi>London,</hi> uſeth to be choſen upon the feaſt of St. <hi>Michael the Archangel,</hi> every year out of the ſix and twenty Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, who are his Brethren; but he takes not his place, until the 28. of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> next following.</p>
            <p>Touching the State and Authority of the Lord Maior of <hi>London,</hi> there is no <hi>Oppidan</hi> Magiſtrate in Chriſtendom, all things well conſidered, lives in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Let us examine the particulars, and firſt go to his domeſtical attendance, and the Officers thereunto belonging, which are, 1. A Sword-bearer. 2. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hunt. 3. Common Cryer. And 4. Water Bayliffs, all Eſquires by their places. Then is there the Coroner of <hi>London,</hi> three Sergeant Carvers, 3. Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants of the Chamber; Sargeant of the Channel, 4 Yeomen of the Water ſide. The Under Water Bayliffe; two Yeomen of the Chamber, three Meal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighers; two Yeomen of the Wood-Wharfs; and moſt of theſe have their Servants allowed them; but the common Huntſman and Water-Bayliffe, have two a peece; ſome of them have Liveries from the Lord Maior, and the reſt from the Chamber of <hi>London.</hi>

There be divers other great publick Officers belong to the Government of the City of <hi>London,</hi> as the two Sheriffs, which, like the Lord Maior, are but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual; The Recorder, the Chamberlain, the Common Sergeant, the Town-Clark, or common Clark, the Remembrancer, all Eſquires.</p>
            <p>The Sheriffs are choſen upon Midſummer day: they formerly were uſed to be elected out of the Commonalty; and ſometimes they came to be Aldermen, as many Aldermen were made <hi>Maiors,</hi> though not having bin <hi>Sheriffs;</hi> But of latter years, the Sheriffs have bin Aldermen before, or preſently after their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; And 'tis remarkable, that <hi>Nicolas Faringdon</hi> was 4 times Maior of <hi>London,</hi> and yet never Sheriff.</p>
            <p>Now touching the Election of theſe Officers, we ſhall give a brief account, the prime Magiſtrate, the Lord Maior and the Aldermen, met at Guild-hall at 8. in the morning, in their Scarlet Gowns, and their Cloaks fur'd riding on Horſeback, and having bin a while in the Councel Chamber, they come forth into the Orphans Court, whence they go in their Cloaks to the Chappel, to hear Service and Sermon, where the Lord Maior, with ſome of the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, take the Communion, which being ended, and Offrings delivered, they return to the Councel Chamber, and thence to the <hi>Hustings,</hi> the higheſt Court; where the Recorder makes a Speech, touching the buſineſs in hand: then they go back to the Lord Maiors Court, where they remain, the doors ſhut un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Election be brought unto them; Then the common Sargeant having the Sheriffs on either ſide, and the Sheriffs other Officers al out them, makes another Speech, touching the Cuſtom of the City in this kind; whereupon, they chooſe two, whoſe names are brought up to the Lord Maior and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, who by ſcrutiny, elect one of thoſe two, whom the Commons had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated before. Then the Lord Maior returns to the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> and he who is choſen, goeth upon his left hand, and ſitteth next him; Then the Recorder ſpeaks again to the Commons, nominating the perſon whom the Lord Maior, and the Aldermen had admitted, and demands whether it be their free choyce; the commons affirming it, the Sword-bearer goes to the Lord Maior, Elect, and taketh off his Tippet (which he takes for his fee) and puts on his Chain; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, he making a ſhort Speech of gratitude, the Lord Maior, and the new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, go to the Eldeſt Sheriffs Houſe to dinner.</p>
            <p>After dinner, the Lord Elect taking the Common Hunt, and other Officers to attend him, beſides a Company of Aldermen, goeth to the Lord Keeper of the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> where five or ſix Aldermen preſent him, wearing their Violet Gowns.</p>
            <p>The morrow after <hi>Michaelmas day,</hi> the Lord Maior and the Aldermen go with the two new Sheriffs to the Exchequer-chamber in Weſtminſter, where they are preſented and ſworn, and the old Sheriffs are ſworn alſo to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Judes</hi> day, the Aldermen and Sheriffs attend the old Lord Maior at his Houſe, whence they come in their formalities to the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> where being ſate, the common Cryer commands ſilence: then the Town-Clark exhibites an Oath to the Lord Maior Elect, which being done, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Lord Maior giveth place to the New; which being done, the Chamberlain delivers him the Scepter, next the Keyes of the Common Seal; and laſtly, the Seal of the Majoralty; Then the Sword-bearer delivers him the Sword.</p>
            <p>On the morrow after, all the Aldermen and Sheriffs ſolemnly meet at the new Lord Maiors Houſe, by 8. in the morning, whence they go to the Guild-Hall, and thence to the Vine-Tree, where they take Barge, and are rowed in ſtate to <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> the reſt of the chief Companies attending in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Barges, with their Arms, Colours, and Streamers, in a very gay manner; Being come to the Hall, they go round about, and ſalute all the Tribunals of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95174:26"/>
juſtice: then they aſcend to the <hi>Exchequer</hi> Chamber to the <hi>Barons,</hi> where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Recorder</hi> hath made a Speech, the Oath is adminiſter'd. Then they come down to the Hall, and go firſt to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> then to the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey,</hi> where having walk'd about the <hi>Kings Tombs,</hi> they return to their Barges, and ſo to <hi>London</hi> again; where, being landed, they go to the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> where a moſt plentifull dinner is prepared, which laſts many hours, being called, <hi>the Lord Mayors feaſt;</hi> The Lords of the privy Councel, the Judges, with other Lords and Ladies of the beſt quality, are thither invited; After dinner, the Lord Mayor with all the Companies attending, ride ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> to do their devotions; and ſo the Ceremony of that great day is concluded.</p>
            <p>Touching the Election of the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen meet at 8 in the morning at Guild-hall in their violet-colour'd Gowns, and their Cloaks of Scarlet lin'd but without horſes; where from the <hi>Counſel-</hi>Chamber, they go to the <hi>Orphans</hi> Court, &amp; ſo to the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> where the <hi>Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> having made a ſpeech touching the preſent meeting, the Mayor &amp; Aldermen go to the Mayors Court, the dores ſhut upon them, then the Commons fall to the Election of <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> as alſo a <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> two <hi>Bridg-maſters,</hi> the <hi>Auditors</hi> of the City and <hi>Bridg-houſe</hi> Accounts, and the <hi>Surveyors</hi> for Beer and Ale: which being done, the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> with the other Officers, the Common Cryer go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them with his Mace, go up to the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> and the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> to cary up the report of what is done at the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> whither the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen deſcend again, and confirm the Elections; Then the <hi>Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> making them a Speech of thanks, the meeting ends.</p>
            <p>Now touching the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> which we have mentioned ſo often, it is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient'ſt and higheſt Court of the City of <hi>London;</hi> Touching the Etymology of it, it is a pure <hi>Saxon</hi> word, and is derived of <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>dhing</hi> or <hi>thing,</hi> which among the <hi>Saxons</hi> ſignified a Cauſe or Plea; in ſo much that <hi>Huſtings</hi> is no other then the Houſe of Cauſes, or Pleading; and <hi>Thingere</hi> was the ancient word for a Lawyer or Pleader; This Court preſerves the Laws, Rights, Franchiſes, Cuſtoms and Dignities of the City; There be handled alſo there the intricat'ſt accounts, and Pleas of the Crowns, and of the whole Kingdom; which Court hath for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages, conſerv'd inviolably its own Prerogatives and Cuſtoms. This Court was anciently held every Munday, but it was chang'd of late years into Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, becauſe of the Sheriffs intending the Market, which being kept upon Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day would hinder their ſitting in the <hi>Huſtings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward the Confeffors</hi> Lawes refer much to this <hi>Huſtings Court;</hi> Moreover, the Cities o <hi>York, Wincheſter, Lincoln,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Shepey,</hi> and other places, have had their <hi>Huſtings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is alſo another Court peculiar to <hi>London,</hi> which diſcovers as much of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> as of <hi>Policy:</hi> It is call'd the Court of <hi>Requests,</hi> or the Court of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> It was firſt erected by an act of Common-Councel <hi>Anno 9. Henry</hi> 8. viz. <hi>That the Lord Mayor and Aldermen for the time being ſhould monthly aſſign two Aldermen, and four diſcreet Commoners, to ſit twice a week to hear, and determine all matters brought before them (betwixt Free-men) where the due debt, or dammage did not exceed</hi> 40s. Afterwards the ſaid number of Commiſſioners was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to the number of twelve, which continued till the end of Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign; But, <hi>primo Jacobi,</hi> it was confirm'd by Act of Parliament, That the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhould have power to exhibit an Oath, and to commit to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuch as did not obey their Summons, or perform the Orders they made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Plaintiff and Defendant, Debitor or Creditor, touching any debt, not amounting to forty ſhillings; but ſuch hath been the unconſcionableneſſe and malice of ſome men of late times, that they have endeavour'd to overthrow the the ſaid Court, by cavilling at ſome doubtful words therein, &amp; wreſting them to a perverſe ſenſe, the rich might have power thereby to oppreſſe the poorer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orr,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95174:27"/>
by bringing them to <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall to a further expence of time and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</p>
            <p>There is then the Court of the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen, which is a Court of <hi>Record;</hi> the Recorder and the two Sheriffs (being Aldermen not elſe) are members of this Court, whoſe office it is, to redreſſe and correct the errors, defaults and miſpriſions which happen in the Government of the City; This Court is kept Tueſdays and Thurſdays throughout the year.</p>
            <p>Then are the two Courts of the Sheriffs, one for every Counter, whereof there are two Lawyers as Judges, well read in the Cuſtoms of the City, as well as the common Laws; but if an erroneous judgment be given before the Sheriffs, the party griev'd may ſue a <hi>Writ of error,</hi> and remove it to the <hi>Huſtings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then is the <hi>Court of Orphans;</hi> For the Mayor and Aldermen, by Cuſtome, have the cuſtody of the <hi>Orphans</hi> within the City, and if they commit the Cuſtody of the <hi>Orphans</hi> to another man, he ſhall have a <hi>raviſhment of ward</hi> if the Orphan be taken away; it being enacted that the Mayor and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, ſhall have the keeping of all the Lands and Goods of ſuch Orphans, as happen within the City; ſaving to the King, and other Lords, their Rights of ſuch as hold of them out of the ſame Liberty; Now the Chamberlain is a ſole Corporation to himſelf, and his Succeſſors for Orphans; and a Recognizance made to him and his Succeſſors touching Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, ſhall by cuſtome go to his Succeſſor; Moreover, the Government of Orphans, is ſo inveſted in the Mayor, that if any Orphans ſue in the <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Court, or elſe-where for a Legacy, or duty due to them, by the Cuſtome, a <hi>Prohibition</hi> doth lye.</p>
            <p>Then is there the Court of <hi>Common Councel,</hi> which hath ſome reſemblance of the high Court of Parliament: for it conſiſts of two Houſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the one of the Mayor and Aldermen, and the other of the Commoners of the City; Here they make Conſtitutions and Laws for advancement of Trade, and regulation of other things which bind the whole City.</p>
            <p>There is then the Court of the <hi>Chamberlain</hi> for Apprentices; Now, one may be free of <hi>London</hi> three manner of wayes, firſt, by <hi>Service;</hi> ſecondly, by <hi>Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> being ſonne of a Freeman; And thirdly, by <hi>Redemption</hi> by Order of the Court of Aldermen.</p>
            <p>The Chamberlain of <hi>London,</hi> is an Officer very conſiderable in point of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: for without him no man can ſet up ſhop, or occupy his Trade without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſworn before him; No man can ſet-over an Apprentice to another, but by his Licence; He may impriſon any that diſobeys his Summons, or any Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that miſdemeans himſelf, or puniſh him otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>There are the Courts of the <hi>Coroner,</hi> and the <hi>Eſcheator,</hi> which both belong to the Lord Mayor; he being <hi>Coroner,</hi> and <hi>Eſcheator</hi> by vertue of his authority, and Office.</p>
            <p>Then is there a Court for the conſervation of the water &amp; River of <hi>Thames,</hi> which belongs to the Lord Mayor, from <hi>Stanes-</hi>bridge unto the water of <hi>Yendal</hi> and <hi>Medway,</hi> as is amply ſpoken of before.</p>
            <p>Then is there the Court of the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> and this Court is held within the Verge of the City before the Steward by preſcription of debt, treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and other actions; now, part of the Tower is within the City, and part in <hi>Middleſex, viz.</hi> the Eaſt part, but the Weſt in <hi>London,</hi> whereof there was a notable example in the perſon of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> who being poyſon'd in a Chamber on the Weſt part, the principal murtherers were tryed before Commiſſioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and ſo was Sir <hi>Gervaſe Elwayes</hi> the Livetenant of the Tower at that time.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a peculiar Court, call'd the <hi>Court of Policies,</hi> and of Aſſurances in <hi>London,</hi> to Marchants that venture and traffique on the Seas, where ſhips
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95174:27"/>
and goods are inſur'd at ſo much in the hundred, where there is an Officer of good quality who Regiſters theſe Aſſurances.</p>
            <p>Then is the Court of <hi>Halmote,</hi> or Hall Court, for every Company of <hi>London</hi> having a particular Hall. They uſe to meet there to deliberate of matters belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Company.</p>
            <p>Then is the Court of the <hi>Wardmote,</hi> or of the <hi>Wardmote Inqueſt.</hi> For the whole City being divided to 26 Wards, every Ward hath ſuch an Inqueſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of twelve or more, who inquire after abuſes and diſorders, and preſent them to be redreſſed.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a kind of Court call'd the Colledge of the Preſident, Cenſors, and Commonalty of <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> who have peculiar Lawes of their own: and among other, one is remarkable, that if one who is not of the myſtery of a <hi>Phyſician</hi> or <hi>Chirurgion,</hi> take upon him the Cure of a ſick Body, and he dieth of the Potion or Medicament, this is, as <hi>Britton</hi> the great Lawyer ſaith, <hi>Covert Felony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then is there the Court of <hi>Seſſions,</hi> or monthly Goal-delivery at the Old-Bayly, both for the City and <hi>Middleſex</hi> for tryal of Felons, whereof the Lord Mayor is the chief Judge, and hath power of reprieving.</p>

            <head>Touching the Eccleſiaſtical Government OF THE <hi>City of</hi> LONDON.</head>
            <p>HAving thus in a curſory way run over, and taken in <hi>groſſe</hi> as it were, a view of the <hi>Civil</hi> Government of the City of <hi>London;</hi> we will now make ſome inſpections into her ſpiritual way of Government, which was alwaies Epiſcopal from the beginning; for there be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords that may well induce us to believe, that in the time of the <hi>Britains</hi> there were Biſhops of <hi>London,</hi> whereof they ſay <hi>Thean</hi> was the firſt; and in the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> we read that <hi>Reſtitutus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> had his Seſſion in a Councel he ſummoned at <hi>Arles;</hi> After that, the <hi>Saxons</hi> making twice an irruption into this Iſland, and at laſt poſſeſſing the better part of it, and being not reduced a good while after, to Chriſtianity, there was a long interruption, and no Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> till <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk came over, who was call'd the Apoſtle of the <hi>Saxons</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for he abſolutely converted them; He conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated <hi>Melitus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> from whom to Doctor <hi>Juxon</hi> yet living, there are upon good Record the names of 97 Biſhops of <hi>London,</hi> who ſucceeded one another. In ſo much that the City of <hi>London</hi> was not without a Biſhop any time theſe thouſand years till now: The Prior of the holy Trinity at <hi>Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> was a great man alſo in the Government of the City, for he uſed to ride with the Mayor &amp; the Aldermen in robes; but the chief adminiſtration of all <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi> affairs was in the Biſhop. Now the City of <hi>London</hi> hath oftentimes far'd the better for her Biſhops, who have done her many ſignal good ſervices, upon ſome diſcompoſures; &amp; ſtood as a skreen 'twixt the fury of the Prince and Her. When the <hi>Norman</hi> came over, and was much incens'd againſt the City, <hi>William</hi> her Biſhop then, took off the edg of his fury, and introducing her to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors favour, got her that famous Charter which is worthy to be here inſerted.</p>

            <p>It ſtands upon Record, how <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond. <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, with other Kings, had Her their ſore enemies; It is well known, how often ſhe ſmarted for it, how often her Poſts &amp; Chains were taken away, how her Maior &amp; Sheriffs were clap'd in Priſon, and a <hi>Cuſtos</hi> appointed over her in the interim; How <hi>Rich.</hi> the firſt trounced her for murthering the <hi>Jews,</hi> how ſhe ſuffered for the <hi>barbarous fray</hi> 'twixt the <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> and <hi>Taylors</hi> Servants; For the blood, ſhed 'twixt her and the men of <hi>Weſtminster</hi> on St. <hi>James</hi>'s day; For the brawl about the <hi>Bakers loaf</hi> in Salsbury Court; For the outrages done to St. <hi>Martins</hi> Sanctuary men; for the <hi>Ill May day;</hi> and a little of late years for the murther of Doctor <hi>Lamb.</hi> But now that we are giving a touch of her Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, It is obſervable in Hiſtory, how her Biſhops proved her beſt friends at a pinch, to pull her out of ſuch plunges, and rectifie her again in the opinion of her <hi>Soveraign.</hi> Nay, it ſtands upon good Record, that ſhe was no City, till ſhe had a Biſhop; for we well know, that a City muſt have of neceſſity, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church, with the Seat and See of a Biſhop.</p>

               </head>
               <p>OUt of an honour which is due to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> it being the prime Fortreſſe and propugnacle of the City, both by water and Land, the chief Armory and Archive of the whole Iſland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we will begin with <hi>Tower-ſtreet Ward,</hi> it being the firſt Ward Eaſt-ward within the Wall, extending it ſelf along the River from the Tower al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to <hi>Billinſgate;</hi> One half of the Tower, the ditch on the Weſt ſide, and Bulwarks adjoyning, do ſtand within that part where the wall of the City of old time went ſtreight from the Poſtern gate South to the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> before that the <hi>Tower</hi> was perfectly built. Then was <hi>Tower hill</hi> ſometimes a clear large plot of ground. but now peſter'd with encroachments of houſes, built upon the banks of the ditch, much to the prejudice, and choaking up of the ſaid ditch.</p>
               <p>This Hill hath alwaies a Scaffold, and Gallowes erected for execution of Traytors and others, which the City oppoſed at firſt.</p>
               <p>Many claſhings have been alſo 'twixt the Lord Mayor and the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> about the extent of their Liberties, and ſome Priviledges touching priſoners the Lievtenant claim'd, which were reconciled 1585; in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time at <hi>Nonſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the Northſide of Tower-hill, there is <hi>Lumly houſe;</hi> then is <hi>Tower-ſtreet,</hi> ſtretching from Tower-hill to Saint <hi>Margaret Pattens.</hi> At the end of this is the Pariſh Church called <hi>Alhallows Barking;</hi> on the North ſide whereof was ſometimes a fair Chappel, built by <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt; and ſome ſay that his Heart (which is call'd <hi>Coeur de lion)</hi> was buried there under the high Altar; it became afterward a little Colledge of Prieſts, and ſtood till <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth. <hi>Henry Howard</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> being beheaded, was buried in <hi>Barking</hi> Church; <hi>John Fiſher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> having layen naked upon the Scaffold a long time, was at laſt carried thither, and buried in the Churchyard; There were divers other men of note buried there: and lately Doctor <hi>Laud</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> who was beheaded by the long Parliament.</p>
               <p>By the Weſt ſide of <hi>Barking,</hi> Church lyeth <hi>Sydon</hi> Lane, commonly call'd <hi>Sithing</hi> Lane, wherein among other large Buildings, there is <hi>Walſingham</hi> Houſe.</p>
               <p>Then is there the Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Olave,</hi> hard by <hi>Hart-</hi>ſtreet, where there are ſome Monuments of the noble Family of the <hi>Radcliffs</hi> Earls of <hi>Suſſex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then is there <hi>Mart-lane,</hi> part whereof lies in <hi>Algate</hi> Ward, where there are many fair Houſes, &amp; rich Marchants. Then is there <hi>Mincheon</hi> Lane, ſo call'd, becauſe of Tenements there, ſometimes pertaining to the <hi>Minchuns,</hi> or <hi>Nuns</hi> of St. <hi>Helens</hi> in <hi>Biſhopſgate-ſtreet;</hi> There dwelt in this Lane divers ſtrangers in times paſs'd, and they were commonly call'd <hi>Gallimen,</hi> becauſe they brought up Wines, and other commodities in Gallies, which they landed in the <hi>Thames</hi> ſtreet, in a place call'd Galley Key; They brought alſo a Coin with them call'd <hi>Gally half pence,</hi> which was a <hi>Ligurian</hi> Coin; But in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, it was inordred, that whoſoever ſhould import that Coin with <hi>Suskins</hi> or <hi>Dodkins,</hi> ſhould be puniſhed as a Felon; The <hi>Clothwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Hall is in this Lane.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:95174:32"/>
Then have you the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Mary Pattens,</hi> and Bear Lane hard by, reaching to <hi>Thames</hi> ſtreet; The next is <hi>Spurrier</hi> lane, call'd ſo in times paſs'd, but now named <hi>Water</hi> lane; then is there <hi>Hart</hi> lane, call'd at firſt <hi>Harp-lane,</hi> which likewiſe reaches to <hi>Thames</hi> ſtreet. In this Lane is the <hi>Bakers Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Tower</hi> ſtreet 'twixt <hi>Hart-</hi>lane and <hi>Church-</hi>lane, was in times paſs'd a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant call'd <hi>Galley-row,</hi> becauſe <hi>Galley men</hi> dwelt there: whence may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, that Galleys was a kind of ſhipping, not unknown to <hi>England</hi> in times paſs'd.</p>
               <p>Then have you two Lanes out of <hi>Tower</hi> ſtreet, both call'd <hi>Church lanes,</hi> then hard by, is there another call'd <hi>Fowl-lane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards you come to the Pariſh Church of S. <hi>Dunſtans</hi> in the Eaſt: it is a fair large Church of an ancient building, with a ſpacious Church-yard; the chiefeſt <hi>Salters</hi> &amp; <hi>Ironmongers</hi> were uſ'd to be thick there. There are many Monuments of Knights, and other perſons of ranke in this Church; among others, that of Sir <hi>John Hawkins</hi> the great Seaman.</p>
               <p>There are many Keys in this Pariſh, among others <hi>VVooll Key,</hi> where was uſed to be the <hi>Trouage</hi> of Woolls; Then <hi>Cuſtome-houſe Key,</hi> which part of the Town was uſed to be call'd in times paſsd <hi>Petty VVales.</hi> And ſome are of opinion, that the Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> when they repair'd to the City, had a Pallace there, the ruines whereof remain to this day of firm ſtone.</p>
               <p>There was in former times an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Barking,</hi> for the ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of poor Prieſts, with other both men and women that were Lunatick. And ſo much in brief for what concerns Tower-ſtreet Ward.</p>

On the Eaſt and by North of the <hi>Tower</hi> lieth <hi>Eaſt Smithfield</hi> and <hi>Tower</hi> hill, two Plots of ground ſo call'd without the Walls of the City, where ſometimes ſtood a Monaſtery call'd <hi>New Abbey,</hi> founded by <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion following; That having eſcaped a great danger in a tempeſt at Sea he made a vow to build a Monaſtery, in ſign of gratitude to heaven, to the honor of God and our <hi>Lady of Grace,</hi> which he perform'd accordingly. But the ſaid Monaſtery, being afterwards pull'd down by Sir <hi>Arthur Darcy</hi> of late time, in place thereof is built a large ſtore-houſe for victual, with convenient Ovens, for baking of Bisket to ſerve the <hi>Navy Royal;</hi> the reſt of the ground is become into ſmal Tenements.</p>

               <p>Then ſomewhat more Weſt is <hi>Bahettars</hi> Lane, ſo called of the firſt Builder and owner thereof: now corruptly called <hi>Billiter</hi> lane; betwixt this <hi>Belzet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens</hi> lane and <hi>Lime-ſtreet,</hi> was (of later time) a frame of three fair Houſes, ſet up in the year 1590, in place where before was a large Garden-plot, encloſed from the High-ſtreet with a Brick Wall, which Wall being taken down, and the ground digged deep for cellerage, there was found right under the ſaid Brick Wall, another Wall of ſtone with a Gate arch'd of ſtone, and Gates of Timber, cloſed in the middeſt towards the ſtreet; the Timber of the Gates was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but the Hinges of Iron ſtill remained on, and their Staples on both the ſides.</p>
               <p>Moreover in that Wall were ſquare Windowes, with Bars of Iron on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Gate; this Wall was under ground above two fathoms deep, as it was eſteemed, and ſeemed to be the ruines of ſome Houſe burned in the Reign of King <hi>Steven,</hi> when the fire began in the Houſe of one <hi>Aleward,</hi> neer <hi>Londons</hi> ſtone, and conſumed Eaſt to <hi>Ealdgate,</hi> whereby it appeareth, how greatly the ground of this City hath been in that place raiſed.</p>
               <p>On the North ſide, this principal ſtreet ſtretcheth to the Weſt corner of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> Church, and then the Ward turneth towards the North, by S. <hi>Mary</hi> ſtreet; on the Eaſt ſide, to St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Church in the Wall, and ſo by <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes Markes</hi> again, or about by the Wall to <hi>Ealdgate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond way from <hi>Ealdgate,</hi> more towards the South from the Pump afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, is called <hi>Fen-Church-ſtreet,</hi> and is of <hi>Ealdgate</hi> Ward, till ye come to <hi>Cull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Alley,</hi> on the Weſt ſide of <hi>Ironmongers</hi> Hall; where ſometimes was a Lane, which went out of <hi>Fen-</hi>Church-ſtreet, to the middeſt of <hi>Lime-</hi>ſtreet, but this Lane was ſtopped up, for ſuſpicion of Thieves that lurked there by night.</p>
               <p>Again, to <hi>Aldgate,</hi> (out of the principal ſtreet, even by the Gate and Wall of the City,) runneth a Lane South to <hi>Croſſed</hi> or <hi>Crouched-Fryers,</hi> and then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95174:34"/>
                  <hi>Woodroof</hi> Lane, to the Tower Hill; and out of this Lane Weſt, a ſtreet called <hi>Hart-</hi>ſtreet, which of that Ward ſtretcheth to <hi>Sydon-</hi>lane, by St. <hi>Olaves Church;</hi> one other Lane more Weſt from <hi>Algate,</hi> goeth by <hi>Northumberland.</hi> Houſe towards the <hi>Croſſed Fryars;</hi> then have you on the ſame ſide, the North end of <hi>Mars-lane,</hi> and <hi>Blanch-axelton</hi> or <hi>Chappleton,</hi> where that Ward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <p>Thus much for bounds. Now for Monuments, or places moſt ancient and notable; I am firſt to begin with the late diſſolved <hi>Priory of the holy Trinity,</hi> call'd <hi>Chriſts-Church</hi> on the right hand within <hi>Aldgate;</hi> This Priory was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Matilda,</hi> Queen and Wife to <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, in the ſame place where <hi>Siredus</hi> ſomtime began to erect a Church in honour of that Croſſe, and of Saint <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> of which the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Waltham,</hi> were wont to receive thirty ſhillings, the Queen was to acquit her Church thereof; and in exchange gave unto them a Mill; King <hi>Henry</hi> her husband confirmed her gift; This Church was given to <hi>Norman,</hi> the firſt Canon regular in all <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſaid Queen gave alſo unto the ſame Church, and thoſe that ſerved God therein, the plot of <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and the Soke or Tenements thereunto belonging, with all Cuſtoms, ſo free as ſhe had held the ſame, and 25 <hi>l.</hi> Blanks, which ſhe had of the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> as appeareth by her Deed, wherein ſhe nameth the Houſe of Chriſts-Church, and reporteth <hi>Aldgate</hi> to be of her Demains, which ſhe granteth, with two parts of the rent of the City of <hi>Exceſter. Norman</hi> took on him to be <hi>Prior</hi> of <hi>Chriſts-Church</hi> in the year of Chriſt 1108, in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> St. <hi>Michael</hi> St. <hi>Katherine,</hi> and the <hi>bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and was (in old time) of the holy <hi>Croſſe,</hi> or holy <hi>Road</hi> Pariſh.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Priory</hi> was builded on a piece of ground in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Katherine,</hi> towards <hi>Aldgate,</hi> which lyeth in length, betwixt the Kings-ſtreet, by the which men go towards <hi>Algate</hi> near to the Chappel of St. <hi>Michael</hi> towards the North, and containeth in length eighty three ells, half quarter, and half quartern of the Kings Iron eln, and lieth in breadth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Soke and Ward of <hi>Aldgate</hi> was then bounded, as I have before ſhewn. The Queen was a mean alſo, that the Land and Engliſh <hi>Knighten-Guild</hi> was given unto the Prior <hi>Norman,</hi> and the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man <hi>Geffrey de Clinton,</hi> was a great helper therein, and obtained, that the Canons might encloſe the way betwixt their Church and the Wall of the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Priory in proceſſe of time, became a very fair and large Church, rich in Lands and Ornaments, and paſſed all the Priories in the City of <hi>London,</hi> or Shire of <hi>Middleſex.</hi> The Prior whereof was an <hi>Alderman</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to wit, of <hi>Portſoken</hi> Ward.</p>
               <p>It is Recorded, that <hi>Euſtacius</hi> the eighth Prior, about the year 1264, becauſe he would not deal with temporal Matters, inſtituted <hi>Theobald Fitz Ivonas</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman of the ſaid <hi>Portſoken</hi> Ward under him; and that <hi>VVilliam Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> Prior of Chriſts Church, was ſworne Alderman of the ſaid <hi>Portſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> Ward, in the firſt of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond. Theſe Priors have fitten and ridden amongſt the Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> in Livery like unto them, ſaving that his habit was in ſhape of a ſpirituall perſon, at which time the Prior kept a moſt bountiful houſe of meat and drink, both for rich and poor, as well within the Houſe as at the Gates, to all comers according to their eſtates and qualities.</p>
               <p>But to take leave of this Priory: King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth minding to reward Sir <hi>Thomas Audley</hi> Speaker of the Parliament againſt Cardinal <hi>Woolſey,</hi> as ye may read in the Chronicle, ſent for the Prior, commending him for his Hoſpitality, promiſed him preferment as a man worthy of a far greater dignity, (which promiſe ſurely he performed) and compounded with him, though in what ſort I never heard; ſo that the Priory, with the appurtenances, was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95174:35"/>
to the King, in the month of <hi>July</hi> 1531, the 23 of the ſaid Kings Reign, the Canons were ſent to other houſes of the ſame Order: and the Priory with the appurtenances, King <hi>Henry</hi> gave to Sir <hi>Tho. Audley</hi> newly knighted, and afterwards made Lord Chancelour.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Audley</hi> offered the great Church of this Priory, with a ring of nine Bells well tuned (whereof four of the greateſt were ſince ſold to the Pariſh of <hi>Stebunbith,</hi> and the five leſſer to the Pariſh of St. <hi>Katherine</hi> Chriſts-Church, in exchange for their ſmall Pariſh Church, minding to have pulled it down, and to have builded there towards the ſteeet; But the Pariſhioners, having doubts in their heads of after-claps, refuſed the offer.</p>
               <p>Then was the Priory Church and Steeple, proffered to whomſoever would take it down, and carry it from the ground, but no man would undertake the offer; whereupon, Sir <hi>Thomas Audley</hi> was fain to be at more charges than could be made of the Stones, Timber, Lead, Iron, &amp;c. For the Workmen, with great labour, beginning at the top, looſed ſtone from ſtone, and threw them down, whereby the moſt part of them were broken, and few remained whole, &amp; thoſe were ſold very cheap; for all the buildings then made about the City, were of Brick &amp; Timber; At that time any man in the City might have a Cart-load of ſtone for paving brought to his door for <hi>6d.</hi> or <hi>7d.</hi> with the carriage.</p>
               <p>The ſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> builded and dwelt on this Priory during his life, and dyed there in the year 1544, ſince which time, the ſaid Priory came (by Marriage of the Lord <hi>Audley's</hi> Daughter and Heir) unto <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> and was then called the <hi>Dukes-place.</hi> At this time the Inhabitants dwelling &amp; abiding in the ſaid <hi>Dukes-place</hi> became utterly deſtitute of any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Church, for reſorting to Gods Divine ſervice, and the adminiſtration of the bleſſed Sacraments; which in the time of their former zeal, the demoliſhed Priory, not only ſerv'd their uſe, but infinite numbers beſides, reſorted thither. In which reſpect, the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Katherine</hi> being ſo near, and ſtanding in the Coemitery or Church-yard of the late diſſolved Priory of the <hi>Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> whereby it was called Saint <hi>Katherine Chriſts-Church,</hi> they reſorted thither at the hours of Divine Service, and for the benefit of the bleſſed Sacraments, whereby they became a burthen to the ſaid Pariſh, yet well enough borne withal, in regard of the benefit enſuing by them, ſo that they carried the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of equal pariſhioners, exerciſing and accompliſhing all duties there, even as if it had been their own proper Pariſh.</p>
               <p>The long continuance of them in this kind, although ſome much miſliked, and gladly would have compaſſed means for remedy thereof; yet their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er not ſtretching ſo far, nor the way (as yet) fitting for their purpoſe, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained contented againſt their Wills, till time would fit them with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient opportunity; Ground they wanted not, for raiſing a ſufficient Pariſh Church to themſelves, neither did any good will fail in them for the effecting their purpoſe; but only were curbed by the lack of ſtrength, how and which way to bring it about. At length perceiving their ground (intended for ſo good a uſe to themſelves) aimed at for buildings to private mens benefits, that ſo they might be fruſtrate of any ſuch help, when occaſion ſhould in better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhine on them, ſome of the beſt adviſed among them, by Petition ſolicited the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to make their deſire and intention known to the King, which he did. And the King, finding the caſe ſo truly honeſt and religious, for new erecting a Church where ſuch neceſſity required, and where Superſtition had ſo long time formerly been harboured, not only gave the Lord Archbiſhop and the Suitors, both thanks and commendation, but alſo under his Hand and broad Seal, authorizable Warrant for their proceeding. The Lord Mayor and Senate of Aldermen, having intelligence in the caſe, and perceiving what an honour would redound thereby, firſt to God who inſpired them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; next to the King, for ſo Royally granting the ſuite; and then to the City,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95174:35"/>
for furthering it to Effect, notwithſtanding that divers oppoſitions were made by them, who would have things ſtill continue, as formerly they did, without bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of a Pariſh Church of their own. It proceeded on with good &amp; proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, to the no mean Honour, and commendation of the Lord Maior then being, Sir <hi>Ed. Barkham</hi> by name, the Court of Aldermen, and ſtate of this famous City by whoſe good meanes it is made a very beautiful and comely Pariſh Church, it being called in the time of re-edifying, <hi>Trinity Chriſts Church,</hi> raiſed out of the long decayed ruines, of <hi>Trinity Priory</hi> in the <hi>Dukes place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time, the work is grown to ſuch fulneſs and perfection, as now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanteth, but the windows glazing, which was performed in this manner,</p>
               <p>The main and great Eaſt light in the Chancel, Sir <hi>Edward Barkham</hi> himſelf undertook, and effected it at his own Charge, as the expreſſion teſtifieth in the ſame Window. The other ſideling by it; but inclining more Southerly. Mr. <hi>George Whitmore,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicholas Rainton,</hi> performed. And the third, ſtanding Northerly in the ſame Chancel, Mr. <hi>Walter Leigh,</hi> who had bin a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant at Arms, to the Kings Majeſty, and then Sword-bearer of <hi>London,</hi> did likewiſe at his own Charge perform, The two Weſtern lights in the bottom of the Church, being (indeed) very fair lights; the Company of <hi>Drapers</hi> effected the one, and the <hi>Wood-mongers</hi> Society finiſhed the other. Beſide, the two Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Windows, the one done at the charge of Mr. <hi>Cornelius Fiſh,</hi> Chamberlain of <hi>London;</hi> and the other by Mr. <hi>Waldron,</hi> then Marſhal: ſo now ye have the Church of St. <hi>James</hi> compleat.</p>
               <p>The Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Katherine,</hi> ſtandeth in the Caemitery of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Priory of the holy Trinity, and is therefore called St. <hi>Katherine</hi> Chriſts Church. The Church ſeemeth to be very old, ſince the building whereof, the High ſtreet hath bin ſo often raiſed by Pavements, that now men are fain to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the ſaid Church, by divers ſteps, ſeven in number; but the Steeple, or Bell Tower thereof, hath bin lately builded, to wit, about the year 1504.</p>
               <p>For Sir <hi>John Perceival</hi> Marchant-Tailor, then deceaſing, gave money towards the building thereof.</p>
               <p>Now concerning this Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Katherine</hi> Chriſts Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>Cree-Church,</hi> as formerly hath bin ſaid, it had a deſcent down into it by ſeven ſteps or ſtayers; but being now newly built, and made a very fair Church: the aſcent into the Church, is by four or five degrees.</p>
               <p>At the North-Weſt corner of this Ward, in the ſaid High ſtreet, ſtandeth the fair and beautiful Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Andrew the Apoſtle,</hi> with an Addition, to be known from other Churches of that Name, of the <hi>Knape,</hi> or <hi>Underſhaft</hi> and ſo called St. <hi>Andrew Underſhaft:</hi> becauſe that of old time, every year (on <hi>May-day</hi> in the morning) it was uſed, that an high or long ſhaft, or May-pole, was ſet up there, in the midſt of the ſtreet, before the South door of the ſaid Church, which Shaft or Pole, when it was ſet on end, and fixed in the ground, was higher then the Church Steeple. <hi>Jeffrey Chawcer,</hi> writing of a vain boaſter, hath theſe words, meaning of the ſaid Shaft.</p>

               <p>It was there I ſay, hanged on Iron hooks many years, till the third of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth. That one Sir <hi>Steven,</hi> Curate of St. <hi>Katherine Chriſts Church,</hi> preaching at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſſe, ſaid there, that this <hi>Shaft</hi> was made an Idoll, by naming the Church of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> with the addition of <hi>Under-ſhaft;</hi> he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therefore, that the names of Churches might be altered: Alſo, that the names of the dayes in the week, might be changed, the <hi>Fiſh dayes</hi> to be kept any dayes, except Friday and Saturday; and the <hi>Lent</hi> any time, ſave only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Shrovetide</hi> and <hi>Eaſter:</hi> This man forſaking the Pulpit of his ſaid Pariſh Church, would preach out of an high Elm Tree, in the midſt of the Church-yard. And then entring the Church, forſaking the Altar, to have ſung his High Maſſe in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> upon a Tomb of the Dead, towards the North; But his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at <hi>Pauls Croſſe,</hi> took ſuch effect, that in the Afternoon of that preſent Sunday, the Neighbors and Tenants to the ſaid Bridge, over whoſe doors, the ſaid Shaft had lain, after they had dined (to make themſelves ſtrong) gathered more help, and with great labor, raiſing the Shaft from the Hooks (whereon it had reſted two and thirty years) they ſawed it in pieces, every man taking for his ſhare, ſo much as had lain over his door and ſhall, the length of his houſe; and they of the Alley, divided amongſt them, ſo much as had lain over their Alley gate. Thus was his <hi>Idoll</hi> (as he termed it) mangled, and after bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Soon after, was there a commotion of the Commons in <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk, Eſſex,</hi> and other Shires, by means whereof, ſtreight Orders being taken for the ſuppreſſion of rumors, divers perſons were apprehended, and executed by <hi>Marſhal</hi> Law; amongſt the which, the Bayliffe of <hi>Rumford</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> was one, a man very well beloved: he was early in the morning of <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> day (then kept Holy-day) brought by the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> and the Knight-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall, to the Well within <hi>Aldgate,</hi> there to be executed upon a Gibbit, ſet up that morning, where being on the Ladder, he had words to this effect;</p>

Now in the ſecond way from <hi>Aldgate,</hi> more toward the South, from the Well or Pump aforeſaid, lieth <hi>Fenne-</hi>Church ſtreet; on the right hand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſomewhat Weſt from the South end of <hi>Belzetters</hi> lane, is <hi>Ironmongers-Hall,</hi> which Company was incorporated in the third of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Richard Flemming</hi> was their firſt Maſter, <hi>Nicholas Marſhall,</hi> and <hi>Richard Cox,</hi> were Cuſtodes or Wardens. And on the left hand, or South ſide, (even by the Gate and Wall of the City) runneth down a Lane to the Tower-Hill: the South part whereof, is called <hi>Woodroof-Lane;</hi> and out of this Lane toward the Weſt, a ſtreet called <hi>Hart-ſtreet.</hi> In this ſtreet, at the South-Eaſt Corner thereof, ſometime ſtood one houſe of <hi>Crowched</hi> or <hi>(Croſſed)</hi> Fryers, founded by <hi>Ralph Hoſier,</hi> and <hi>William Sabernes,</hi> about the year 1298. <hi>Stephen</hi> the tenth Prior of the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> granted three Tenements for 13 s. 8 d. by the year, unto the ſaid <hi>Ralph Hoſiar,</hi> and <hi>William Saburnes,</hi> who afterwards became Fryers of S. <hi>Croſſe.

               <p>In place of this Church, is now a Carpenters yard, a Tennis-Court, and ſuch like: the Fryers Hall was made a Glaſſe-houſe, or houſe, wherein was made Glaſſe of divers ſorts to drink in: which houſe, in the year 1575. on the fourth of September, burſt out into a terrible fire, where all meanes poſſible being practiſed to quench it, notwithſtanding, as the ſame houſe in a ſmall time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had conſumed a great quantity of Wood, by making of Glaſſes; Now it ſelf, having within it about 40 000 Billets of Wood, was alſo conſumed to the ſtone walls, which nevertheleſs, greatly hindred the fire from ſpreading any further.</p>
               <p>Adjoyning unto this Fryers Church, by the Eaſt end thereof in Woodroffe Lane, towards the Tower-Hill, are certain Almes-houſes, 14. in number, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Brick and Timber, founded by Sir <hi>John Milburn,</hi> Draper, ſometime Maior, 1521. wherein be placed 13. aged poor men, and their Wives: theſe have their dwellings rent-free, and 2 s. 4 d. a peece, the firſt day of every Moneth for ever.</p>

And this is the fartheſt of <hi>Aldgate</hi> VVard toward the South, and joyneth to the Tower-Hill; the other ſide of that Lane, over againſt the Lord <hi>Lumleys</hi> houſe, on the wall ſide of the City, is now for the moſt part (or altogether) builded, even to <hi>Aldgate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then have ye on the South ſide of <hi>Fenne-</hi>Church-ſtreet, over againſt the wall or Pump, amongſt other fair and large builded houſes, one that ſometime belonged to the <hi>Prior of Monte Joves,</hi> or <hi>Monaſtarie Cornute,</hi> a Cell to <hi>Monte Joves</hi> beyond the Seas; in <hi>Eſſex</hi> it was the <hi>Priors</hi> Inne, when he repaired to this City; Then a Lane that leadeth down by <hi>Northumberland</hi> Houſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Croſſed Fryers, as is afore ſhewed.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Northumberland</hi> Houſe in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Katherine Coleman,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Henry Percy,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in the 33. of <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſixth; but of late being leſt by the Earls, the Gardens thereof were made into Bowling Alleys, and other parts into Dicing-houſes, common to all commers, for their money, there to bowl &amp; recreate themſelves. But now of late, ſo many Bowling Alleys, and other houſes for unlawful gaming, have been raiſed in other parts of the City and Subburbs, that this which was uſed to be the ancienteſt, and only Rendezvonz of ſport, is left and forſaken of the Gameſters, and therefore
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95174:37"/>
turned into a number of great Rents, ſmall Cottages, for ſtrangers and others.</p>
               <p>At the Eaſt end of this Lane, in the way from <hi>Aldgate,</hi> toward the <hi>Croſſed Friers,</hi> of old time, were certain Tenements, called the <hi>Poor Jurie,</hi> of Jewes dwelling there.</p>
               <p>Next unto this <hi>Northumberland</hi> houſe, is the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Katherine,</hi> called <hi>Coleman;</hi> which addition of <hi>Coleman,</hi> was taken of a great Haw-yard, or Garden, of old time called <hi>Coleman Haw,</hi> in the Pariſh of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> now called <hi>Chriſts Church.</hi> And in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Katherine,</hi> and All-ſaints, called <hi>Coleman Church.</hi> There are ſome handſome Tombs in this Church, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of Sir <hi>Henry Billingley</hi> Knight, and Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> who was a Benefactor or thereunto.</p>
               <p>Then have ye <hi>Blanch Appleton,</hi> whereof we read in the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> the firſt, that a Lane behind the ſame <hi>Blanch Appleton,</hi> was granted by the King to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, and ſhut up; This <hi>Blanch Appleton</hi> was a Mannor belonging to Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Roos</hi> of <hi>Hamelake,</hi> Knight, the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2d, ſtanding at the North-Eaſt corner of <hi>Mart</hi> Lane, ſo called, of a priviledge ſometime enjoyed to keep a <hi>Mart</hi> there, long ſince diſcontinued, and therefore forgotten: ſo as nothing remaineth for memory, but the name of <hi>Mart Lane,</hi> and now corruptly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Mark Lane.</hi>

               <head>Of the fourth Ward, or Aldermanry of <hi>London,</hi> called <hi>Limeſtreet</hi> Ward.</head>
               <p>WE will now give a viſit to <hi>Limestreet</hi> Ward, which takes its denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the ſtreet, and the ſtreet from making <hi>Lime</hi> there, in times paſſed.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Limeſtreet</hi> are divers fair Houſes; for Marchants and others, there was ſometime a Manſion houſe of the <hi>Kings,</hi> called the <hi>Kings</hi> Attirce, as it ſtands upon Record, in the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; but now grown out of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: We read alſo of another great Houſe, in the Weſt ſide of <hi>Limeſtreet,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Chappel on the South, and a Garden on the Weſt, belonging to the Lord <hi>Nevill,</hi> which Garden is now called <hi>Green Yard,</hi> of the Leaden Hall.</p>
               <p>This Houſe in the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. pertained to Sir <hi>Simon Burley,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Burley</hi> his Brother; and of late, the ſaid Houſe was taken down, and the fore-front thereof new builded of Timber, by <hi>Hugh Offley,</hi> Alderman.</p>
               <p>At the North-weſt Corner of <hi>Limestreet,</hi> was (of old time) one great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage, called <hi>Benbridges Inne; Raph Holland,</hi> Draper, about the year 1452. gave it to <hi>John Gill,</hi> Maſter, and to the VVardens and Fraternity of Taylors, and Linnen Armourers of St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and to their ſucceſſors for ever, They did ſet up in places thereof, a fair large frame of Timber, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the high ſtreet, one great houſe; and before it, to the corner of <hi>Limeſtreet</hi> three other Tenements, the corner houſe being the largeſt; and then down <hi>Limeſtreet,</hi> divers handſome Tenements: All which, the Marchant-Taylors, in the Raign of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. ſold to <hi>Stephen Kirton,</hi> Marchant-Taylor, and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who gave with his Daughter <hi>Griſild,</hi> to <hi>Nicholas Woedroffe,</hi> the ſaid great Houſe, with two Tenements before it, in lieu of an hundred pounds, and made it up in money, three hundred ſixty ſix pounds, thirteen ſhillings four pence:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95174:37"/>
This worthy man, and the Gentlewoman his Widow, after him, kept thoſe houſes down <hi>Limeſtreet,</hi> in good reparations, never put out but one Tenant, took no fines, nor raiſed rents for them, which was ten ſhillings the piece year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; But whether that favour did over-live her Funeral, the Tenants now can beſt declare the contrary.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> of which we read, that in the year 1309. it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sir <hi>Hugh Nevil,</hi> Knight, and that the Lady <hi>Alice</hi> his Wife, made a Feoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, by the name of <hi>Leaden Hall,</hi> with the Advouſions of S. <hi>Peter</hi> on <hi>Cornhill,</hi> and other Churches, to <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Arrundel,</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> 1362.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in the year 1380. <hi>Alice Nevil,</hi> Widow to Sir <hi>John Nevil,</hi> Knight of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> confirmed to <hi>Thomas Cogſhall,</hi> and others, the ſaid Mannor of <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> and the advouſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1384. <hi>Humphrey de Bohun,</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> had the ſaid Mannor, And in the year 1408. <hi>Robert Rikeden</hi> of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to <hi>Richard Whittington,</hi> and other Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> the ſaid Mannor of <hi>Leaden Hall,</hi> with the Appurtenances, the Advouſion of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, S. <hi>Margaret Pattens,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in the year 1411. the ſaid <hi>Whitington,</hi> and other, confirmed the ſame to the Maior, and Comminalty of <hi>London,</hi> whereby it came to the poſſeſſion of the City.</p>
               <p>Then in the year 1443. the one and twenty of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, <hi>John Hatheyr ley,</hi> Maior, purchaſed Licence of the ſaid King, to take up 200. fodder of Lead, for the building of Water Conduits, a common Granary, and the Croſſe in Weſt Cheape, more richly, for the honour of the City.</p>
               <p>In the year next following, the Parſon and Pariſh of St. <hi>Dunſtane,</hi> in the Eaſt of <hi>London,</hi> ſeeing the Noble and mighty Man (for the words be in the Grant; <hi>Cum Nobilis &amp; Potens v. r.)

               </p>
               <p>Alſo, certain evidences of an Alley, and Tenements pertaining to the <hi>Horſe Mill,</hi> adjoyning to the ſaid <hi>Leaden Hall</hi> in <hi>Graſſe-ſtreet,</hi> given by <hi>VVilliam Kingſtone,</hi> Fiſhmonger, unto the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> upon <hi>Cornhill,</hi> do ſpecifie the ſaid Granary, to be builded by the ſaid Honourable and famous Marchant, <hi>Simon Eyre,</hi> ſometime an Upholſter, and then a Draper, in the year 1419. He builded it of ſquared ſtone, in form as now it ſheweth, with a fair and large Chappel in the Eaſt ſide of the Quadrant; over the Porch of which, he cauſed to be written, <hi>Dextra Domini exaltavit me,</hi> The Lords right hand exalted me.</p>
               <p>Within the ſaid Church, on the North wall, was written, <hi>Honorandus famo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Mercator Simon Eyre, hujus operis, &amp;c.</hi> In Engliſh thus, The honourable and famous Marchant <hi>Simon Eyre,</hi> founder of this work, once Maior of this City, Citizen and Draper of the ſame, departed out of this life, the <hi>18th</hi> day of Septemb. the year from the Incarnation of Chriſt, 1459. and the 38. year of the Raign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth: he was buried in the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Mary Wolnoth,</hi> in <hi>Lumbard ſtreet;</hi> he gave by his Teſtamont, to be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all Priſons in <hi>London,</hi> or within a mile of that City, ſomewhat, to relieve them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:95174:38"/>
More, he gave 2000 Marks upon a condition, which not performed, was then to be diſtributed to Maids Marriages, and other deeds of Charity: he alſo gave 3000 Marks to the Drapers, upon condition, that they ſhould within one year after his deceaſe, eſtabliſh perpetually a Maſter or Warden, five ſecular Prieſts, ſix Clerks, and two Queriſters, to ſing daily Divine Service, by note for ever, in this Chappel of the <hi>Leaden-hall;</hi> Alſo, one Maſter with an Uſher for Grammar, one Maſter for Writing, and the third for Song, with Houſes there newly builded for them for ever; the Maſter to have for his ſalary, ten pounds, and every other Prieſt, eight pounds; every other Clarke, five pounds ſix ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings eight pence; and every other Choriſter, five Marks; and if the Drapers refuſed this to do, within one year after his deceaſe, then the three thouſand Marks to remain to the Prior and Covent of <hi>Chriſts-Church</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to eſtabliſh things as aforeſaid, within two years after his deceaſe; And if they refuſed, then the three thouſand Marks to be diſpoſed by his Executors, as they beſt could deviſe in works of Charity.</p>
               <p>Thus much for his Teſtament, not performed by eſtabliſhing of Divine Service in his Chappel or Free-School, and Scholars; neither was it known how the ſtock of three thouſand Marks (or rather five thouſand Marks) was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Executors, he left iſſue <hi>Thomas,</hi> who had iſſue <hi>Thomas, &amp;c.</hi> True it is, that in the year 1464, the third of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, it was agreed by the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, Aldermen, and Commonalty of <hi>London,</hi> that notwithſtanding the Kings Letters Pattents, lately before granted unto them, touching the <hi>Trouage or weighing of Wares,</hi> to be held at <hi>Leaden-hall;</hi> yet Suite ſhould be made to the King, for new Letters Pattents, to be granted to the Mayor of the Staple, for the <hi>Trouage of Wools,</hi> to be holden there, and order to be taken by the diſcretion of <hi>Thomas Cooke,</hi> then Mayor; The Councel of the City, <hi>Geffrey filding,</hi> then May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the Staple at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and of the Kings Councel what ſhould be paid to the Mayor, and Aldermen of the City, for the laying and houſing of the Wools there, that ſo they might be brought forth and weighed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the Chappel there, we find that in the year 1466, by Licence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, in the ſixth of his Reign, a Fraternity of the Trinity of 60 Prieſts (beſides other brethren and ſiſters) in the ſame Chappel, was founded by <hi>Rouſe, John Risby,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Aſhby</hi> Prieſts: ſome of the which ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prieſts, every Market-day, in the fore-noon, did celebrate Divine ſervice there, to ſuch Market people as repaired to prayer, and once every year, they met altogether, and had ſolemn Service, with proceſſion of all the Brethren, and Siſters; this foundation was in the year 1512, by a Common-Councel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to the ſixty Trinity Prieſts, and to their Succeſſors, at the will of the Mayor and Commonalty.</p>
               <p>In the year 1484 a great fire happened upon <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> by what caſualty it was not known, but much houſing was there deſtroyed, with all the Stocks for Guns, and other proviſion belonging to the City, which was a great loſſe, and no leſſe charge to be repaired by them.</p>
               <p>In the year 1503. the eighteenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, a requeſt was made by the Commons of the City, concerning the uſage of the ſaid <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> in form as followeth;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Pleaſe it the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Councel, to enact, that all Frenchmen bringing Canvas, Linnen cloth, and other Wares to be ſold, and all Forreins bringing Woolſteads, Sayes, Stamins, Kiverings, Nayles, Iron work, or any other Wares, and alſo all Forreins, bringing Lead to the City to be ſold, ſhall bring all ſuch their Wares aforeſaid, to the open Market of the <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> and no where elſe to be ſhewed, ſold and uttered, like as of old time it hath been uſed, upon pain of forfeiture of all the ſaid Wares, ſhewed or ſold in any other place than aforeſaid; And the ſhew of the ſaid
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95174:38"/>
Wares to be made three daies in a week, that is to ſay <hi>Monday, Tueſday,</hi> and <hi>Wedneſday;</hi> It is alſo thought reaſonable, that the common Beam be kept from henceforth in the <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> &amp; the Farmer to pay therefore reaſonable rent to the Chamber, for better it is, that the Chamber have advantage thereby, than a Forreign perſon; And alſo the ſaid <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> which is more chargeable now by half than profitable, ſhall better bear out the charges thereof; Alſo the common Beam for Wool at <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> may pay yearly a rent to the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> toward the ſupportation and charges of the ſame place: for reaſon it is, that a common Office occupied upon a common ground, bear a charge to the uſe of the Communalty; Alſo that Forrains bringing Wools, Felts, or any other Marchandizes or Wares to <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> to be kept there for the ſale and market, may pay more largely for keeping of their goods than Freemen. Thus much for the requeſt of the Commons at that time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now to ſet down ſome proof, that the ſaid Hall hath been employed and uſed as a Granary for Corn and grain (as the ſame was firſt appointed) lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all former examples, this one may ſuffice, <hi>Roger Achley</hi> Mayor of <hi>London</hi> in the year 1512, the third of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, when the ſaid Mayor entred the Majoralty, there was not found one hundred quarters of Wheat in all the Garners of this City, either within the Liberties or near adjoyning, through the which ſcarcity, when the Carts of <hi>Stratford</hi> came laden with Bread to the City (as they had been accuſtomed) there was ſuch preſs about them, that one man was ready to deſtroy another, in ſtriving to be ſerved for their money; but this ſcarcity laſted not long, for the Mayor (in ſhort time) made ſuch proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Wheat that the Bakers, both of <hi>London,</hi> and of <hi>Stratford,</hi> were weary of taking it up, and were forced to take much more than they would, and for the reſt the Mayor laid out the money, and ſtored it up in <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> and other Garners of the City; This Mayor alſo kept the Market ſo well, that he would be at the <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> by four a clock in the Summer mornings, and from thence he went to other Markets to the great comfort of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</p>
               <p>We read alſo, that in the year 1528, the twentieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyers were appointed to view the Garners of the City, namely, the <hi>Bridge-houſe</hi> and the <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> how they were ſtored of Grain for the ſervice of the City; And becauſe we have here before ſpoken of the Bread-carts coming from <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> at the <hi>Bow,</hi> ye ſhall underſtand, that of old time the Bakers of Bread at <hi>Stratford,</hi> were allowed to bring daily (except the Sabbath and principal Feaſts) divers long Carts laden with bread, the ſame being two ounces in the penny wheaten loaf heavier than the penny wheaten loaf baked in the City, the ſame to be ſold in Cheap, three or four Carts ſtanding there 'tween <hi>Gutherans</hi> Lane, and <hi>Fauſters</hi> Lane end, one Cart on <hi>Cornhil</hi> by the Conduit, and one other in <hi>Graſſe-ſtreet;</hi> And we may read, that in the fourth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Richard Reffeham,</hi> being Mayor, a Baker named <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Stratford,</hi> for making Bread leſſer than the Aſſize, was with a fools hood on his Head, and loaves of Bread about his Neck, drawn on a hurdle through the ſtreets of the City. Moreover, in the four and fortieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>John Chicheſter</hi> being Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> as we may read in the viſions of <hi>Pierce Plowman,</hi> a Book ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as followeth;</p>
               <p>There was a careful commune, when no Cart came to Town with Basket Bread from <hi>Stratford</hi> tho gan beggars weep, and workmen were agaſt, a little this will be thought long in the date of our dirte, in a dry Averel, a thouſand and three hundred, twice thirty and ten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read alſo in the twentieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, Sir <hi>James Spencer</hi> being Mayor, ſix Bakers of <hi>Stratford,</hi> were amerced in the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95174:39"/>
under the ſize appointed; But theſe Bakers of <hi>Stratford</hi> left ſerving this City, I know not upon what occaſion, above forty years ſince.</p>
               <p>In the year 1519 a Petition was exhibited by the Commons to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Councel, and was by them allowed, concerning the <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> how they would have it uſed, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Meekly beſeeching, ſheweth unto your good Lordſhip, and Maſterſhips, divers Citizens of this City, which (under correction) think, that the great place called the <hi>Leaden hall,</hi> ſhould, nor ought not to be letten out to Farme, to any perſon or perſons and in ſpecial, to any fellowſhip or Company incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, to have and hold the ſame Hall for term of years; for ſuch convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as thereby may enſue, and come to the hurt of the Common-weale of the ſaid City in time to come, as ſomewhat more largely may appear in the Articles following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if any aſſembly or haſty gathering of the Commons of the ſaid City, for ſuppreſſing or ſubduing of miſruled people within the ſaid City, hereafter ſhall happen to be called or commanded by the Mayor, Aldermen, and other Governours and Councellors of the ſaid City for the time being; there is none ſo convenient, meet and neceſſary a place to aſſemble them in, within the ſaid City, as the ſaid <hi>Leadon-hall,</hi> both for largeneſſe of room, and for their ſure defence in time of their counſelling together about the premiſes. Alſo, in that place hath been uſed the Artillery, Guns, and other Armors of the ſaid City, to be ſafely kept in a readineſſe, for the ſafegard, wealth, and defence of the ſaid City to be had and occupied at times when need required. As alſo the ſtore of Timber, for the neceſſary reparations of the Tenements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Chamber of the ſaid City, there commonly hath been kept.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> If any Triumph or Nobleneſſe were to be done, or ſhewed by the Commonalty of the City, for the honour of our Soveraign Lord the King and Realm, and for the worſhip of the ſaid City, the ſaid <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> is the moſt meet and convenient place, to prepare and order the ſaid Triumph therein, and from thence to iſſue forth to the places thereof appointed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> at any Largeſſe or dole of any money, made unto the poore people of this City; it hath been uſed to be done and given in the ſaid <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> for that the ſaid place is moſt meet therefore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> the honourable Father, that was maker of the ſaid Hall, had a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all will, intent, and mind, that (as it is commonly ſaid) the Market men and women, that came to the City with victuals and other things, ſhould have their free ſtanding within the ſaid <hi>Leaden-Hall</hi> in wet weather, to keep themſelves &amp; their Wares dry, and thereby to encourage them, and all other, to have the better will and deſire, the more plentiouſly to reſort to the ſaid City, to victual the ſame; And if the ſaid Hall ſhould be letten to Farme, the will of the ſaid honourable Father, ſhould never be fullfilled, nor take effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> if the ſaid place, which is the chief Fortreſſe, and moſt neceſſary place within all the City, for the tuition and ſafegard of the ſame, ſhould be letten out to Farme, out of the hands of the chief Heads of the ſame City, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to any other Body politick, it might at length (by likelihood) be an occaſion of diſcord and debate, between the ſaid Bodies politick, which God defend.</p>
                  <p>For theſe, and many other great and reaſonable cauſes, which hereafter ſhall be ſhewed to this honourable Court, your ſaid Beſeechers think it much neceſſary, that the ſaid Hall be ſtill in the hands of this City; and to be ſurely kept by ſad and diſcreet Officers in ſuch wiſe, that it might alwaies be ready to be uſed and occupied, for the Common-weale of the ſaid City, when
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95174:39"/>
need ſhall require, and in no wiſe to be letten to any Body politick. Thus much for the Petition.</p>

               <p>About the year one thouſand five hundred thirty four, great means was made about the <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> to have the ſame made a Burſe for the Aſſembly of Marchants, as they had been accuſtomed in <hi>Lumbard-ſtreet;</hi> many Common-Councels were called to that end, but in the year 1535, <hi>John Champneys</hi> being Mayor, it was fully concluded, that the Burſe ſhould remain in <hi>Lumbard ſtreet,</hi> as afore, and <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> no more to be ſpoken of concerning that matter.</p>
               <p>The uſe of <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> was us'd to be thus; In a part of the North Quadrant, on the Eaſt ſide of the North Gate, were the common Beams, for weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wooll and other Wares, as had been accuſtomed; On the Weſt ſide of the Gate was the Scales to weigh Meal: the other three ſides were reſerved (for the moſt part) to the making and reſting of the Pageants ſhewed at Mid-Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the watch: the remnant of the ſides and Quadrants, were employed for the ſtowage of Wool-ſacks, but not cloſed up: the lofts above were partly uſed by the Painters, in working for the decking of Pageants and other devices, for beautifying of the Watch and Watch-men: the reſidue of the Lofts were letten out to Marchants, the Wooll-winders and Packers therein, to winde and pack their Wools. And thus much for <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Now on the North of <hi>Limeſtreet</hi> Ward, in the Highſtreet are divers fair hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for Marchants, and proper Tenements for Artificers, with an Alley alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Shaft Alley,</hi> of the Shaft or May-pole, ſometime reſting over the Gate thereof, as I have declared in <hi>Aldgate Ward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1576. partly at the charges of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the charges of the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> a water-pump, was raiſed in the high ſtreet of <hi>Lime-ſtreet Ward,</hi> neer unto <hi>Lime-ſtreet</hi> corner, for the placing of the which Pump, having broken up the ground, they were forced to dig more than two fadome deep, before they came to any main ground, where they found a Hearth made of <hi>Britaine,</hi> or rather <hi>Romane</hi> Tyle, every Tyle half yard ſquare, and about two inches thick, they found coal lying there alſo (for that lying whole will never conſume) then digging one fadome in the main, they found water ſufficient, made their Prall, and ſet up the Pump, which Pump, with oft repairing and great charges to the Pariſh, continued not four and twenty years, but being rotted, was taken up, and a new one ſet in the place, in the year 1600. Thus much for the High-ſtreet.</p>
               <p>In Saint <hi>Mary</hi> ſtreet had ye (of old time) a Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Mary</hi> a Virgin, Saint <hi>Urſula,</hi> and the 11000 Virgins, which Church was commonly called Saint <hi>Mary at the Axe;</hi> of the Signe of an Axe, over againſt the Eaſt end thereof, or Saint <hi>Mary Pellipar,</hi> of a plot of ground lying on the North ſide thereof pertaining to the <hi>Skinners</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> This Pariſh about the year 1565. was united to the Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> Under Shaft, and ſo was Saint <hi>Mary at the Axe</hi> ſuppreſſed, and letten out to be a Ware-houſe for a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; Againſt the Eaſt end of this Church, was ſometime a ſair Well, now turned to a Pump; Alſo againſt the North end of this Saint <hi>Mary</hi> ſtreet, was ſometime one other Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> called Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in the Wall, for that it ſtood adjoyning to the Wall of the City, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called Saint <hi>Auguſtines Papey,</hi> or the poor, as I have read, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. About the year 1430, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, the ſame Church was allowed to the Brethren of the <hi>Papey,</hi> the Houſe of <hi>poor Prieſts,</hi> whereof I have ſpoken in <hi>Aldgate</hi> Ward, the Pariſhioners of this Church were appointed to the Pariſh Church of <hi>Alhallowes</hi> in the Wall, which is in <hi>Broad</hi> ſtreet Ward, and this Brotherhood called <hi>Papey,</hi> being ſuppreſſed, the Church of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was pulled down, and in place thereof one <hi>Grey</hi> Apothecary, builded a Stable, a Hay-loft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is now a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95174:40"/>
dwelling houſe, thoſe two Pariſh Churches, both lying in the Ward of <hi>Lime-ſtreet;</hi> being thus ſuppreſſed, there is not any one Pariſh Church or place for Divine Service in that Ward, but the Inhabitants thereof repair to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Cornhill</hi> Ward, Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> in <hi>Aldgate</hi> Ward, <hi>Alhallows in the Wall in Broad-ſtreet</hi> Ward, and ſome to Saint <hi>Denys</hi> in <hi>Langbourne</hi> Ward.</p>
               <p>Now, becauſe there hath been ſome queſtion, to what Ward this Church of Saint <hi>Auguſtine Papey</hi> ſhould of right belong, for the ſame hath been chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by them of <hi>Aldgate</hi> Ward, and (without reaſon) taken into <hi>Biſhops-gate</hi> Ward, from <hi>Lime-street</hi> Ward, I am ſomewhat to touch it.</p>
               <p>About 70 years ſince, the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> granted a Leaſe of groundly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near <hi>London</hi> Wall, in the Ward of <hi>Lime-ſtreet,</hi> from the Weſt of the ſaid Church or Chappel of Saint <hi>Auguſtine Papey,</hi> towards <hi>Biſhops-gate &amp;c.</hi> on the which plot of ground, the Leaſee builded three fair Tenements, and placed Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants there, theſe were charged to bear Scot and Lot, and ſome of them to bear Office in <hi>Lime ſcreet</hi> Ward, all which they did willingly without grudging; And when any ſuſpected or diſordered perſons were by the Landlord placed there, the Officers of <hi>Lime ſtreet</hi> Ward, fetched them out of their Houſes, committed them to Ward, procured their due puniſhments, and baniſhed them from thence; whereby in ſhort time that place was reformed, and brought into good order, which thing being noted by them of <hi>Aldgate</hi> Ward, they moved their Alderman, Sir <hi>Thomas Offley,</hi> to call in thoſe Houſes to be of his Ward; But Mr. <hi>Stow</hi> producing a fair Ledgier Book, ſometime pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the late diſſolved <hi>Priory</hi> of the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> within <hi>Aldgate,</hi> wherein were ſet down the juſt bounds of <hi>Aldgate</hi> Ward, before Sir <hi>Thomas Offley,</hi> Sir <hi>Rowland Hayward,</hi> the Common-Councel, and Ward-Mote Inqueſt, of the ſaid <hi>Lime ſtreet</hi> Ward, Sir <hi>Thomas Offley</hi> gave over his Challenge, and ſo that matter reſted in good quiet, until the year 1579. that Sir <hi>Richard Pype</hi> (being Mayor, and Alderman of <hi>Biſhops-gate</hi> Ward) challenged thoſe Houſes to be of his Ward, whereunto (without reaſon ſhewed) Sir <hi>Rowland Hayward</hi> yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and thus is that ſide of the ſtreet from the North corner of Saint <hi>Mary</hi> ſtreet, almoſt to <hi>Biſhopſgate,</hi> (wherein is one plot of ground, letten by the Chamberlaine of London, to the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Martins Oteſwich,</hi> to be a Church-yard, or burying-place for the dead of that Pariſh, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly drawn and with-holden from the Ward of <hi>Lime-ſtreet,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Stow</hi> avoucheth.</p>

               <p>And here is to be noted, that time out of minde, it hath been a laudable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, that on good Friday in the After-noon, ſome eſpecial learned man, by appointment of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> ſhould preach a Sermon at <hi>Pauls Croſſe,</hi> treating of Chriſts paſſion, and upon the three next Eaſter Holydayes, Munday, Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and Wedneſday, the like learned men, by the like appointment, have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to preach on the forenoons at the ſaid <hi>Spittle,</hi> to perſwade the Article of Chriſts Reſurrection; and then on Low Sunday, one other learned man at

                  <hi>Stephen Foster</hi> Maior, in the year, 1594. gave 40 l. to the Preachers of <hi>Pauls Croſſe</hi> and <hi>Spittle.</hi> We find alſo, that the aforeſaid Houſe, wherein the Maior and Aldermen do ſit at the Spittle, was builded (for that purpoſe) of the goods, and by the Executors of <hi>Richard Rawſon,</hi> Alderman, and <hi>Iſabel</hi> his Wife, in the year 1488.</p>
               <p>In the year 1594. this Pulpit being old, was taken down, and a new one ſet up: the Preachers face turned towards the South, which was before towards the Weſt. Alſo a large Houſe (on the Eaſt ſide of the ſaid Pulpit) was then builded, for the Governours and Children of <hi>Chriſts Hoſpital</hi> to ſit in; and this was done of the goods of <hi>William Elkin,</hi> Alderman before deceaſed; But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the firſt year, the ſame Houſe decaying, and like to have fallen, was again (with great coſt) repaired at the Cities Charge.</p>
               <p>On the Eaſt ſide of this Church-yard, lyeth a large field, of old time called <hi>Loleſworth,</hi> now <hi>Spittle-field,</hi> which about the year, 1576. was broken up, for Clay to make Brick: in the digging thereof, many Earthen Pots called <hi>Urnae,</hi> were found full of Aſhes, with burnt bones of men, to wit, of the Romans that inhabited here; for it was the Cuſtom of the Romans, to burn their dead, to put their Aſhes in an Urn, and then bury the ſame with certain Ceremonies, in ſome field appointed for that purpoſe near unto their City; and commonly, there was another Urn of freſh water, laid by the other, denoting the teares of their friends.</p>
               <p>Every of theſe Pots had in them (with the Aſhes of the Dead) one piece of Copper money, with the Inſcription of the Emperor then reigning, ſome of them were of <hi>Claudius,</hi> ſome of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> ſome of <hi>Nero,</hi> of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> of <hi>Trajanus,</hi> and others; Beſides thoſe Urns, many other Pots were found in the ſame place, made of a white Earth, with long necks, and handles, like to our ſtone Jugs: theſe were empty, but ſeemed to be buried full of ſome liquid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, long ſince conſumed, and ſoked through; For there were found divers Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and other faſhioned Glaſſes; ſome moſt cunningly wrought, and ſome of Cryſtal, all which had water in them (which it ſeems were the teare-Bottles) nothing differing in clearneſs, taſt, or ſavour from common Spring water, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it was at the firſt; Some of theſe Glaſſes had Oyl in them very thick, and earthy in ſavour; ſome were ſuppoſed to have balm in them, but had loſt the vertue; many of theſe Pots and Glaſſes were broken in cutting of the Clay, ſo that few were taken up whole.</p>
               <p>There were alſo found divers Diſhes and Cups, of a fine red coloured Earth, which ſhewed outwardly ſuch a ſhining ſmoothneſs, as if they had been of Curral; Thoſe had (in the bottoms) <hi>Roman</hi> letters printed: There were alſo
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95174:42"/>
Lamps of white Earth and red, artificially wrought with divers Antiques about them, ſome three or four Images, made of white Earth, about a ſpan long each of them; one was of <hi>Pallas.</hi> Amongſt divers of thoſe Antiquities, there was found one Urn, with Aſhes and Bones, and one pot of white Earth, very ſmall, not exceeding the quantity of a quartern of a Wine pint, made in ſhape of a Hare ſquatted upon her leggs, and between her Eares is the mouth of the Pot.</p>
               <p>There hath alſo bin found (in the ſame field) divers Coffins of ſtone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the bones of men; theſe I ſuppoſe to be the Burials of ſome ſpecial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in time of the <hi>Britons,</hi> or <hi>Saxons,</hi> after that the <hi>Romans</hi> had left to govern here.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there were alſo found the ſculls and bones of men, without Coffins; or rather, whoſe Coffins (being of Timber) were conſumed; divers great Nails of Iron were there ſound, ſuch as are uſed in the Wheels of ſhod Carts; being each of them as big as a mans finger, and a quarter of a yard long; the heads two inches over: Thoſe nayles were more wondred at, then the reſt of the things there found; and many Opinions of men were there paſſed upon them; namely, that the men there buried, were murthered by driving thoſe nayles into their heads.</p>
               <p>But to ſet down what was obſerved, concerning this matter; there were there, the bones of a man lying, the head North, the feet South, and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him (athwart his head) along both his ſides, and thwart his feet ſuch nails were found; wherefore it may be conjectured, they were the nayls of his Coffin, which had bin a trough cut out of ſome great Tree; and the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a Plank of that thickneſs, faſtened with ſuch nayls, and found under the broad heads of ſome of thoſe nayls, the old Wood was found ſcant turned into Earth; but ſtill retaining both the grain and proper colour. And thus much for that part of <hi>Biſhopſgate-</hi>Ward; now we will proceed to that part which lyeth within the <hi>Gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt, to begin on the left hand of <hi>Bishopſgate;</hi> from the <hi>Gate</hi> ye have certain Tenements of old time, pertaining to a Brother-hood of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> granted to the Pariſh Clarks of <hi>London,</hi> for two Chaplains to be kept in the Chappel of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> near unto the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> in the 27. of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. The firſt of theſe Houſes towards the North, and againſt the Wall of the City, was ſometime a large Inne or Court, called the <hi>Wraſtlers</hi> of ſuch a ſigne; And the laſt in the high ſtreet, towards the South, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time alſo a fair Inne, called the Angel, of ſuch a ſigne. Amongſt theſe ſaid Tenements was (on the ſame ſtreet ſide) a fair Entry or Court, to the common Hall of the ſaid Pariſh-Clarks, with proper Alms-houſes, ſeven in number ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning; for Pariſh-Clarks, and their Wives, and their Widows, ſuch as were in great years, not able to labour; one of theſe by the ſaid Brother-hood of Pariſh-Clarks, was allowed ſixteen pence the week: the other ſix had each of them nine pence the week, according to the Patent granted to that effect.</p>
               <p>This Brother-hood (amongſt other) being ſuppreſſed, in the Raign of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſixth: the ſaid Hall, with the other Buildings there, was given to Sir <hi>Robert Chester,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Cambridge-shire,</hi> againſt whom the Pariſh-Clarks commencing ſuit, in the Raign of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and being like to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Cheſter</hi> pulled down the Hall, ſold the Timber, ſtone, and Lead; and thereupon the ſuit was ended. The Alms-houſes remained in the Queens hands, and people were there placed, ſuch as could make beſt friends, ſome of them taking the penſion appointed, and letting forth their houſes at great Rent, have given occaſion to the Parſon of the Pariſh, to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Tithes of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Next unto this is the ſmall Pariſh Church of <hi>Saint Ethelburgh, Virgin;</hi> and from thence, ſome ſmall diſtance is a large Court, called <hi>Little St. Helens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pertained to the Nuns of St. <hi>Helens,</hi> and was their Houſe: there were there ſeven Alms-Rooms, or Houſes for the poor, belonging to the Company of <hi>Leather ſellers;</hi> Then ſomewhat more Weſt, is another Court, with a winding Lane, which commeth on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Priory</hi> was founded before the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third; <hi>William Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> was the firſt founder, and was there buried; and <hi>William Baſing,</hi> one of the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, was holden alſo to be a Founder, or rather an helper thereof: This <hi>Priory</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing valued at 1314 l. 2 s. 6 d. was ſurrendred the five and twentieth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> the thirtieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: the whole Church, the partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Nuns</hi> Church; and the Pariſh Church being taken down, remaineth now to the Pariſh, and is a fair Church, but wanteth ſuch a Steeple, as Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham</hi> promiſed to have builded, in recompence of ground in that Church, filled up with his Monument.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nuns</hi> Hall, and other Houſing thereto pertaining, was ſince purchaſed by the Company of <hi>Leather-ſellers,</hi> and is their common Hall; which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, was incorporate, the one and twentieth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond.</p>
               <p>A young new born Child was taken up, between the great Ware-houſe, and Sir <hi>John Spencers</hi> back-gate, being (by a moſt unnatural Mother) there buried in a great Dung-hill of Sea-coal Aſhes, with the face upward; yet found alive by <hi>Richard Atkinſon,</hi> who uſed to make cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The Child had not any ragg, or Cloth about it, but was all bloodied, by reaſon that the Navil ſtring was unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Body meerly cruſted over with the Seacoal-duſt; yet being made clean by the poor mans Wife, it was found to be a moſt goodly Man-Child, ſtrong and well-featured, without any blemiſh or harm upon it; but ſtrangled inwardly, by ſucking in the noyſome filth and Aſhes.</p>
               <p>He was Chriſtned, and named <hi>Job cinere extractus, Job</hi> taken out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, He lived three dayes, and lies buried in the Church-yard, the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> 1612.</p>

               <p>This Merchant-Taylors Hall, ſometime perteining to a worthy Gentleman, named <hi>Edmund Crepin, Dominus Creeping</hi> after ſome Record; he, in the year of Chriſt 1331, the ſixth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, for a certain ſum of money to him paid, made this grant thereof, by the name of his principal Meſſuage, in the Wards of <hi>Cornhill</hi> and <hi>Broad-ſtreet,</hi> which Sir <hi>Oliver Ingham</hi> Knight, did then hold, to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Yakeley</hi> the Kings Pavilion-maker; This was called the <hi>New Hall,</hi> or <hi>Taylors Inne,</hi> for a difference from their old Hall, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the back ſide of the <hi>Red Lion</hi> in <hi>Baſing Lane,</hi> and in the Ward of <hi>Cord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayner</hi> ſtreet.</p>
               <p>The one and twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Thomas Holm,</hi> aliàs <hi>Clarentiaux</hi> King of Armes for the South part of <hi>England,</hi> granted by his Patents to the ſaid Fraternity and Guild of Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> of <hi>Taylors</hi> and <hi>Linnen Armorers,</hi> to bear in a field Silver, a Pavilion between two Mantles Imperial, Purple, garniſhed with Gold, in a chief Azure, a holy Lamb, ſet within a Sun, the Creſt upon the Helm; a Pavilion purple, garniſhed with Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, was himſelf a Brother of this Fraternity, or Guild of S. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> of <hi>Taylors</hi> or <hi>Linnen Armorers,</hi> (as divers others of his Predeceſſors Kings had been) to wit <hi>Richard</hi> the third, <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond. And for that divers of that Fraternity had (time out of mine) been great Merchants, and had frequented all ſorts of Merchandizes into moſt parts of the world, to the honour of the Kings Realm, and to the great profit of his Subjects, and of his Progenitors, and the men of the ſaid Myſtery, (during the time aforeſaid) had exerciſed the buying and ſelling of all Wares and Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, eſpecially, of Woollen Cloth, as well in groſſe, as by retaile, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and chiefly within the ſaid City; therefore he of his eſpecial grace, did change, transfer, and tranſlate, the Guild aforeſaid, and did incorporate them into the name of the Maſter and Wardens of the <hi>Merchant-Taylors,</hi> of the Fraternity of S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some diſtance Weſt from this <hi>Merchant-Taylors</hi> Hall, is <hi>Finkes</hi> Lane, ſo called of <hi>Robert Finke,</hi> and <hi>Robert Finke</hi> his ſon, <hi>James Finke</hi> and <hi>Roſamond Finke; Robert Finke</hi> the elder, new builded the Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Bennet</hi> commonly called <hi>Finke</hi> of the Founder; his Tenements were both of St. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> pariſh, and Saint <hi>Martins Oteswich</hi> Pariſh, the one half of this <hi>Finke</hi> Lane is of <hi>Broad-</hi>ſtreet ward, to wit, on the Weſt ſide, up to the great and principal houſe, wherein the ſaid <hi>Finke</hi> dwelled; But on the other ſide, namely the Eaſt, not ſo much towards <hi>Cornhil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then without this Lane, in the aforeſaid <hi>Threed-Needle</hi> ſtreet, is the ſaid Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Bennet</hi> a handſome Church in which are ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry old Monuments.</p>
               <p>There happened lately a great fire in <hi>Threed-Needle</hi> ſtreet, over againſt <hi>Merchant-Taylors</hi> Hall, which rag'd as far as Saint <hi>Bennets</hi> Church Walls, and there the fury was ſtopped, otherwiſe it might have deſtroyed all this City.

On the North ſide of this ſtreet, from over againſt the Eaſt corner, of St. <hi>Martins Oſteſwich</hi> Church, have ye divers fair and large houſes, till you come to the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> ſometime a Cell of St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> of <hi>Vienna;</hi> For we read, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, granted to the Brother-hood of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> a place amongſt the Jewes, which was ſometime their <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and had been builded by them, about the year 1231. But the Chriſtians ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the King, that it ſhould be dedicated to our <hi>bleſſed Lady;</hi> and ſince, an Hoſpital being there builded, was called St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> It was founded in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Bennet Finke,</hi> for a Maſter, two Prieſts, one School-maſter, and twelve poor men; after which foundation, amongſt other things, was given to this Hoſpital, one Meſſuage and Garden, whereon was builded the fair large <hi>Free-School,</hi> and one other parcel of ground, containing thirty ſeven foot in length, and eighteen foot in breadth, whereon were builded the <hi>Alms-Houſes</hi> of hard Stone and Timber, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. Which ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, in the twentieth of his Reign, gave unto <hi>John Carpenter,</hi> Dr. of Divinity, and Maſter of St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Hoſpital, and to his Brethren, and their Succeſſors for ever, his Mannor of <hi>Pomington,</hi> with the appurtenances, with certain Penſions, and Portions of <hi>Milburn, Burneworth, Charleton,</hi> and <hi>Up-Wimburn,</hi> in the County of <hi>Southhampton,</hi> towards the maintenance of five Scholars in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to be brought up in the faculty of Arts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rate of ten pence the week for every Scholar; ſo that the ſaid Scholars be firſt inſtructed in the rudiments of Grammar, at the Colledge of <hi>Eaton,</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſaid King.</p>
               <p>In the year 1474. <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> granted to <hi>William Say,</hi> Batchelor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, Maſter of the ſaid Hoſpital, to have Prieſts, Clerks, Scholars, poor men, and Brethren of the ſame, Clerks, or Laymen, Queriſters, Procters, Meſſengers, Servants in Houſhold, and other things whatſoever, like as the Prior, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> of <hi>Vienna, &amp;c.</hi> He alſo annexed, united, and appropriated the ſaid Hoſpital, unto the Collegiate of St. <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Windſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Protectors of this Houſe, were to collect the benevolence of charitable Perſons, towards the building and ſupporting thereof.</p>
               <p>In the year 1499. Sir <hi>John Tate,</hi> ſometime Alebrewer, then a Mercer, cauſed his Brewhouſe, called the Swan, near adjoyning to the ſaid Free Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, College, or Hoſpital of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> to be taken for the enlarging of the Church, which was then newly builded; toward the building whereof, the ſaid <hi>Tate</hi> gave great ſums of money, and finiſhed it in the year 1501, Sir <hi>John Tate,</hi> deceaſed 1514. and was there buried, under a fair Monument by him prepared, Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> Maſter of the Rolls, and other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walter Champion,</hi> Draper, one of the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> 1529. was buried there, and gave to the Beadmen twenty pounds, The Lands by year of this Hoſpital, were valued in the 37. of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, to be 55 l. 6 s. and 8. pence.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Johnſon</hi> (a Schoolmaſter of the famous Free-School there) became a prebend of <hi>Windſor,</hi> and then (by little and little) followed the ſpoil of this Hoſpital: he firſt diſſolved the Quire, conveyed away the Plate and Ornaments, then the Bels; and laſtly, put out the Alms men from their houſes, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them portions of twelve pence the week to each; but now I hear of no ſuch matter performed; for their houſes, with other, be letten out for rent, and the Church is a preaching place for the French Nation, as was touched before.</p>
               <p>This School was commended in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and ſithence commended above other; but now decayed, and come to nothing, by taking that from it, which thereunto belonged.</p>
               <p>Next is the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Bartholmew,</hi> at the end of <hi>Bartholmew</hi> Lane, <hi>Thomas Pike</hi> Alderman, with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Nicholas Yoo,</hi> one of the Sheriffs
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95174:46"/>
of <hi>London,</hi> about the year 1438. new builded this Church.</p>
               <p>Weſt from this Church, have ye <hi>Scalding Alley,</hi> of old time called <hi>Scalding Houſe,</hi> or <hi>Scalding wick,</hi> becauſe that ground (for the moſt part) was then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by Poulterers, that dwelled in the high ſtreet, from the Stocks Market, to the great Conduit. Their Poultry which they ſold at their ſtalls, were ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there: the ſtreet doth yet bear the name of the Poultry, and the Poulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are but lately departed from thence, into other ſtreets, as into <hi>Graſſe-ſtreet,</hi> and the ends of <hi>St. Nicholas Fleſh-ſhambles.</hi>
               </p>

               <head>Of the Seventh Ward, or Aldermanry of the City of <hi>London,</hi> called <hi>Corn-hill Ward.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw <hi>Cornhil</hi> Ward comes to conſideration, corruptly called <hi>Cornwel</hi> by the vulgar; It was called <hi>Corn-hill</hi> of a Corn-Market, time out of mind there holden, and is a part of the principal high ſtreet, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Weſt end of <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> ſtretching down Weſt, on both the ſides, by the South end of <hi>Finkes Lane,</hi> on the right hand, and by the North end of <hi>Birchoven</hi> Lane, on the left part: of which Lanes, to wit, to the middle of them, is of this Ward, and ſo down to the Stocks Market; and this is the bounds. The upper or Eaſt part of this Ward, and alſo a part of <hi>Limeſtreet</hi> Ward, hath been (as I ſaid) a Market-place, eſpecially for Corn, and ſince for all kind of Victuals, as is partly ſhewed in <hi>Limestreet</hi> Ward.</p>
               <p>It appeareth by Record, that in the year 1522. the <hi>Rippiers</hi> of Rie and other places, ſold their freſh Fiſh in <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> Market upon <hi>Cornhill;</hi> but forraign Butchers were not admitted there to ſell Fleſh, till the year 1533.</p>
               <p>And it was enacted, that Butchers ſhould ſell their Bief, not above a half peny the pound; and Mutton, half peny, half farthing: which Act being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, for the great Commodity of the Realm, (as it was then thought) hath ſince proved far otherwiſe; for, before that time, a fat <hi>Oxe</hi> was ſold at <hi>London,</hi> for ſix and twenty ſhillings eight pence, at the moſt; a fat <hi>Weather,</hi> for three ſhillings four pence; a fat Calf at the ſame price; a fat Lamb for twelve pence; pieces of Bief weighing, 2. pounds and a half at the leaſt, yea, 3. pound or better for a peny, on every Butchers Stall in this City; and of thoſe pieces of Bief, 13, or fourteen for twelve pence; fat Mutton for eight pence the quarter; and one hundred weight of Bief, for four ſhillings eight pence, at the deareſt.</p>
               <p>What the price is now, I need not ſet down; many men thought the ſame Act to raiſe the price, <hi>by reaſon that Graſiers knew, or ſuppoſed what weight every their Beaſts contained;</hi> and ſo raiſing their price thereafter, the Butcher could be no gainer, but by likewiſe raiſing his price: the number of Butchers then in the City and Suburbs, was accounted ſixſcore, of which every one killed ſix Oxen a peece weekly, which is in forty ſix weeks, 33120. Oxen, or ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Oxen weekly.</p>
               <p>The forraign Butchers (for a long time) ſtood in the high ſtreet of <hi>Limeſtreet-</hi>Ward, on the North ſide, twice every week, <hi>viz,</hi> Wedneſdayes and Saturdayes, and were ſome gain to the Tenants, before whoſe doors they ſtood, and into
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95174:46"/>
whoſe houſes they ſet their blocks and ſtalls; but that advantage being eſpied, they were taken into <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> there to pay for their ſtanding to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for the Market upon <hi>Cornhill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief Ornaments in <hi>Cornhill-VVard,</hi> are theſe;</p>
               <p>Firſt, at the Eaſt end thereof, in the middle of the high ſtreet, and at the parting of four wayes, have ye a Water-Standard, placed in the year 1582. in manner following; A certain <hi>German,</hi> named <hi>Peter Morris,</hi> having made an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial <hi>Forcier</hi> for that purpoſe, conveyed <hi>Thames-water</hi> in Pipes of Lead, over the Steeple of St. <hi>Magnus</hi> Church, at the North end of <hi>London-Bridge;</hi> and from thence into divers mens Houſes in <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> New <hi>Fiſh-ſtreet,</hi> and <hi>Graſſe-street,</hi> (now <hi>Gracious-ſtreet)</hi> up to the North Weſt corner of <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> the higheſt ground of all the City; where the waſte of the main Pipe riſing into this Standard (provided at the charges of the City) with four ſpouts, did at every Tyde run (according to Covenant) four wayes, plentifully ſerving to the Commodity of the Inhabitants, near adjoyning in their houſes; and alſo clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Channels of the ſtreet, toward <hi>Biſhops-gate, Aldgate,</hi> the <hi>Bridge,</hi> and the <hi>Stocks Market;</hi> but now no ſuch matter, by what default I know not.</p>
               <p>Then have ye a fair Conduit, of ſweet water, caſtellated in the midſt of that Ward; This Conduit was firſt builded of ſtone, in the year 1282. by <hi>Henry VVallis,</hi> Maior of <hi>London,</hi> to be a Priſon for Night-walkers, and other ſuſpicious perſons, and was called the <hi>Tunne upon Cornhill;</hi> becauſe the ſame was builded ſomewhat in faſhion of a Tunne, ſtanding on the one end.</p>
               <p>To this Priſon, the Night-watchers to this City, committed not only Night-walkers, but alſo other perſons, as well ſpiritual as temporal, whom they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of incontinency, and puniſhed them according to the cuſtoms of this City; but complaint therefore being made, about the year of Chriſt, 1297.

               <p>In the year 1570. on the 23. of January, the Queens Majeſty, attended with her Nobility, came from her Houſe at the Strand, called <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> and entred the City by Temple-Barre, through Fleet-ſtreet, Cheape, and ſo by the North ſide of the Burſe, through Thredneedle-ſtreet, to Sir <hi>Thomas Greshams</hi> Houſe in Biſhop gate-ſtreet, where ſhe dined: After dinner, her Majeſty returning through Corn-hill, entred the Burſe on the South ſide; and after ſhe had viewed every part thereof above the ground, eſpecially the <hi>Pawne,</hi> which was richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all ſorts of the fineſt Wares in the City, ſhe cauſed the ſame <hi>Burſe,</hi> by an Haurald and a Trumpet, to be proclaimed at the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> and ſo to to be called from thenceforth, and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Next adjoyning to this <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> remaineth one part of a large ſtone Houſe, and is now called the Caſtle, of ſuch a ſign at a Tavern door; there is a paſſage thorough out of <hi>Cornhill,</hi> into <hi>Threed-needle</hi> ſtreet; The other part of the ſaid ſtone Houſe was taken down, for enlarging the <hi>Royal Exchange;</hi> This ſtone Houſe was ſaid of ſome to have been a Church, whereof it had no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; of others, a <hi>Jewes</hi> Houſe, as though none but Jewes had dwelt in ſtone houſes, but that opinion is without warrant.</p>
               <p>

For beſide the ſtrong building of ſtone houſes, againſt invaſion of thieves in the night when no watches were kept, In the firſt year of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the firſt, (to prevent caſualties of fire, which often had hapned in the City, when the Houſes were builded of Timber, and covered with Reed and Straw, <hi>Henry Fitz Allwine</hi> being Mayor) it was Decreed, That from thenceforth, no man ſhould build within the City but of ſtone unto a certain height, and to cover the ſame building with Slate, or burnt Tyle; This was the very cauſe of ſuch ſtone Buildings, whereof many have remained until our time that for gaining of ground, they have been taken down, and in place of ſome of them being low, (as but two Stories above the ground) many Houſes of four or five Stories high are placed.</p>
               <p>From this Stone Houſe down to the <hi>Stocks,</hi> are divers large Houſes, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for height, for Merchants and Artificers.</p>
               <p>On the South ſide of this High-ſtreet, is the Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> upon <hi>Cornhill,</hi> which ſeemeth to be of an ancient building, but not ſo ancient as fame reporteth; for it hath been lately repaired, if not all new builded, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Steeple which is ancient.</p>
               <p>The Roof of this Church and Glazing, was finiſhed in the Reign of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the fourth, as appeareth by Armes of Noble men, and Aldermen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> then living. There remaineth in this Church a Table, wherein it is written I know not by what Authority, but of no late hand, that King <hi>Lucius</hi> founded the ſame Church, to be an <hi>Archbiſhops See,</hi> Metropolitane, and chief Church of his Kingdom, and that it ſo continued the ſpace of four hundred years, unto the coming of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk.</p>
               <p>Now, becauſe many may be curious to be further acquainted therewith, I have here inſerted the ſame <hi>Verbatim,</hi> as it is there recorded in the Table.</p>
               <p>BE it known unto all men, that the year of our Lord God 179, <hi>Lucius</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King of this Land, then called <hi>Britaine,</hi> founded the firſt Church in <hi>London,</hi> that is to ſay, the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> upon <hi>Cornhill;</hi> and he founded there an <hi>Archbiſhops See,</hi> and made that Church the Metropolitan and chief Church of this Kingdom, and ſo endured the ſpace of four hundred years, unto the coming of St. <hi>Auſtin, the Apoſtle of the Engliſh,</hi> the which was ſent into this Land by St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Doctor of the Church, in the time of King <hi>Ethilbert;</hi> And then was the Archbiſhops <hi>See,</hi> and <hi>Pall,</hi> removed from the foreſaid Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> upon <hi>Cornhill,</hi> unto <hi>Doreburniam</hi> that now is called <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and there remaineth to this day. And <hi>Millet</hi> the Monk, which came into the Land with S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> was made this firſt Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and his <hi>See</hi> was made in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, And this King <hi>Lucius</hi> was the firſt Founder of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church upon <hi>Cornhill;</hi> and he reigned in this Land after <hi>Brute,</hi> a thouſand two hundred fourty five years, and the year of our Lord God, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred twenty four, <hi>Lucius</hi> was Crowned King; and the years of his Reign were ſeventy ſeven years, and he was (after ſome Chronicle) buried at <hi>London;</hi> and (after ſome Chronicle) he was buried at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> in that place where the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. <hi>Francis</hi> ſtandeth now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joceline</hi> of <hi>Furncis</hi> writeth, that <hi>Thean</hi> or <hi>Theon,</hi> the firſt Arch biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Lucius</hi> builded the ſaid Church, by the aid of <hi>Ciran</hi> chief Butler to King <hi>Lucius:</hi> and alſo that <hi>Elvanus</hi> the ſecond Archbiſhop buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Library to the ſame adjoyning, and converted many of the <hi>Druydes</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men in the Pagan Law, to Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Harriſon,</hi> diſcourſing hereon more at large, hath theſe very words,</p>
               <p>There is a Controverſy (ſaith he) moved among our Hiſtoriographers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church that <hi>Lucins</hi> built at <hi>London,</hi> ſtood at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> or in <hi>Cornhill;</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:95174:48"/>
For, there is ſome cauſe, why the Metropolitane Church ſhould be thought to ſtand where St. <hi>Peters</hi> now doth, by the ſpace of four hundred and od years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was removed to <hi>Canterbury</hi> by <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, if a man would lean to one ſide without any conference of the aſſeverations of the other; But herein there may lurk ſome ſcruple; for, beſides that St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church ſtood in the Eaſt end of the City, and that of <hi>Apollo</hi> in the Weſt; the word <hi>Cornhil,</hi> a deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination given of late (to ſpeak of) to one ſtreet, may eaſily be miſtaken for <hi>Thorney.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>And now to return where we left; True it is, that a Library there was, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to this Pariſh Church, of old time builded of Stone, and of late repaired with Brick, by the Executors of Sir <hi>John Crosby</hi> Alderman, as his Arms on the South end do witneſſe.</p>
               <p>This Library hath been (of late time) to wit within this ſeventy years, well furniſhed of Books, <hi>John Leyland</hi> viewed and commended them: but now thoſe Books are gone, and this place is occupied by a School-maſter, and his Uſher, for a number of Scholers learning their Grammer Rules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Notwithſtanding before that time, a Grammar School had been kept in this Pariſh, as appeareth in the year a thouſand four hundred twenty five.</p>
               <p>We read, that <hi>John Whitby</hi> was Rector, and <hi>John Steward</hi> School-maſter there; and in the five and twentieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, it was Enacted by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that four Grammer Schools in <hi>London,</hi> ſhould be maintained, <hi>viz</hi> In the Pariſhes of <hi>Alhallowes</hi> in <hi>Thames</hi> ſtreet, Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> in <hi>Oldburn,</hi> Saint <hi>Peters</hi> upon <hi>Cornhill,</hi> and Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Acres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then have ye the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel: for the antiquity thereof, we find that <hi>Alnothus</hi> the Prieſt, gave it to the Abbot and Covent of <hi>Coveſham; Raynold</hi> the Abbot and the Covent there, did grant the ſame to <hi>Sparling</hi> the Prieſt, in all meaſures, as he and his Predeceſſors before had held it: to the which <hi>Sparling</hi> alſo, they granted all their Lands which they there had, except certain Lands which <hi>Orgar le proud</hi> held of them, and paid two ſhillings yearly; For the which grant, the ſaid <hi>Sparling</hi> ſhould yearly pay one mark of Rent to the ſaid Abbot of <hi>Coveſham,</hi> and find him his lodging, Salt, Water, and Fire, when he came to <hi>London;</hi> This was granted, a thouſand one hundred thirty three, about the thirty four of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt.</p>
               <p>The fair new Steeple or Bell-Tower of this Church, was begun to be builded in the year 1421, which being finiſhed, and a fair ring of five Bells therein placed, a ſixth Bell was added, and given by <hi>John VVhitwell, Iſabel</hi> his Wife, and <hi>William Rus,</hi> or <hi>Rous</hi> Alderman, and Goldſmith, about the year 1430, which Bell named <hi>Rus,</hi> (nightly at eight of the clock, and otherwiſe for Knels, and in Peals, rung by one man by the ſpace of 160 years) of late over-haled by four or five at once, hath been thrice broken, and new caſt, within the ſpace of ten years, to the charges of that Pariſh more than 100 marks.</p>
               <p>And here note of this Steeple: Upon St. <hi>James</hi> night, certain men in the loft next under the Bells, ringing of a peal, a tempeſt of Lightning and Thunder did

               <p>At the ſame time, certain main Timber poſts at <hi>Queen-Hith,</hi> were ſcratched and cleft from the top to the bottome; and the <hi>Pulpit-croſſe</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard, was likewiſe ſcratcht, cleft, and overturned; One of the Ringers lived in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, who would verifie the ſame to be true to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Fabian</hi> Alderman, and Chronicler of <hi>England,</hi> lieth buried in this Church, with divers others perſons of note.</p>
               <p>This Pariſh Church hath on the South ſide thereof a hanſome Cloyſter, and a fair Church-yard, with a Pulpit-croſs, not much unlike to that in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard; Sir <hi>John Rudſtone</hi> Mayor, cauſed the ſame Pulpit-croſſe in his life time to be builded, the Church-yard to be enlarged, by ground purchaſed of the next Pariſh; and alſo hanſome Houſes to be raiſed, for lodging of <hi>Quire men,</hi> ſuch as at that time were aſſiſtants to Divine Service, then daily ſung by note in that Church.</p>

               <p>WE will now go South-Eaſt, and take a Survey of <hi>Billingſgate-Ward,</hi> which beginneth at the Weſt end of <hi>Tower-ſtreet</hi> Ward in <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> about <hi>Smarts Key,</hi> and runneth down along that ſtreet, on the South ſide, to St. <hi>Magnus</hi> Church, at the Bridge foot, and on the North ſide of the ſaid <hi>Thameſ-ſtreet,</hi> from over againſt <hi>Smarts Key</hi> till over againſt the North-Weſt Corner of St. <hi>Magnus</hi> Church aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>On this North ſide of <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> is St. <hi>Mary Hill Lane,</hi> up to St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garets</hi> Church, and then part of St. <hi>Margarets Pattens ſtreet,</hi> at the end of St. <hi>Mary Hills</hi> Lane; next out of <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> is <hi>Lucas Lane;</hi> and then <hi>Buttolph</hi> Lane; and at the North end thereof <hi>Philpot</hi> Lane, Then is there <hi>Rother</hi> Lane, of old time ſo called; and thwart the ſame Lane is little <hi>Eaſt-Cheape,</hi> And theſe be the bounds of <hi>Billingſgate</hi> Ward.</p>
               <p>

Touching the principal Ornaments within this Ward, on the South ſide of <hi>Thamesſtreet,</hi> beginning at the Eaſt end thereof; there is firſt the ſaid <hi>Smarts Key,</hi> ſo called, of one <hi>Smart,</hi> ſometime owner thereof.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> whereof the whole Ward taketh name, the which (leaving out of the <hi>Roman's</hi> faining it to be builded by King <hi>Belinus,</hi> a <hi>Britain,</hi> long before the Incarnation of Chriſt) is at this preſent, a large Water-gate, Port, or Harbor for Ships and Boats, commonly arriving there with Fiſh, both freſh and ſalt, Shell-fiſhes, Salt, Oranges, Onions, and other Fruits and Roots, Wheat, Rie, and Grain of divers ſorts, for ſervice of the City, and the parts of this Realm adjoyning. This Gate is now more frequented, then of old time, when the Queens <hi>Hith</hi> was uſed, as being appointed by the Kings of this Realm, to be the ſpecial or only Port, for taking up of all ſuch kind of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, brought to this City by ſtrangers and Forraigners, becauſe the Draw-Bridge of Timber at <hi>London</hi> Bridge, was then to be raiſed, and drawn up for paſſage of Ships, with tops to the ſaid Queen <hi>Hith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the ancient Cuſtoms of <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; every great Ship landing there, paid for ſtandage, two pence, every little Ship with orelocks, a peny: the leſſer Boat, called a Battle, a half-peny; or two quarters of Corn meaſured, the King was to have one farthing; of a Combe of Corn, a peny, of every weight going out of the City, a half peny, of two quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Sea-Coals meaſured, a farthing; and of every Tun of Ale, going out of <hi>England,</hi> beyond the Seas, by Marchants ſtrangers, four pence; of every thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Herrings, a farthing, except the Franchiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next to this is, <hi>Sommers</hi> Key, which likewiſe took that name, of one <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> dwelling there, as did <hi>Lyon Key,</hi> of one <hi>Lyon,</hi> owner thereof, and ſince of the Signe of the Lyon.</p>
               <p>Then is there a fair Wharf or Key, called <hi>Buttolphs-gate,</hi> by that name ſo called, in the time of <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> and before him, of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next is the Pariſh of St. <hi>Buttolph,</hi> a comely Church, and hath had many fair Monuments therein, now much defaced and gone; Among others, there is <hi>William Rainwel</hi> and his Sonne, who gave a Stone-Houſe to be a Veſtry to that Church; with Lands and Tenements to diſcharge <hi>Billingſgate, Dowgate,</hi> and <hi>Algate,</hi> of fifteens granted to the King, and other Tolls: this was about the year 1426.</p>
               <p>This Pariſh of St. <hi>Buttolph,</hi> is no great thing; notwithſtanding, divers ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are there harboured, as may appear by a preſentment, not many years ſince made, of ſtrangers Inhabitants in the Ward of <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> in theſe words.</p>
               <p>In Billingſgate Ward, were one and fifty Houſholds of ſtrangers, whereof thirty of theſe Houſholders, inhabited in the Pariſh of <hi>St. Buttolph,</hi> in the chief and principal Houſes, where they give twenty pounds a year, for an houſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, uſed to be let before for four marks: the nearer they dwell to the Water ſide, the more they give for Houſes; and within 30. years before, there was not in the whole Ward above three <hi>Nether landers;</hi> at which time, there was within the ſaid Pariſh, levied for the help of the poor, ſeven and twenty pounds by the year; but ſince they came ſo plentifully thither, there cannot be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered above eleven pounds; the ſtrangers being exempted, to contribute to ſuch charges as other Citizens do, in regard they much advance the Trade of the City.</p>
               <p>On the North ſide is <hi>Boſſe Alley,</hi> ſo called of a Boſſe of Spring-water, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually running, which ſtandeth by <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> againſt this Alley; and was ſometimes made by the Executors of <hi>Richard Whittington.</hi>

Then is <hi>St. Mary Hill lane</hi> which runneth up North from Billingsgare, to the end of <hi>St. Margaret</hi> Pattens, commonly called <hi>Rood-lane;</hi> and the greateſt half of that Lane, is alſo of Billingsgate Ward. In this <hi>St. Mary</hi> Hill lane, is the fair Pariſh Church of <hi>St. Mary on the Hill,</hi> called ſo, becauſe of the aſcent from Billingsgate.</p>
               <p>In the year 1497. in the Moneth of <hi>April,</hi> as labourers digged for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a Wall, within the Church of St. <hi>Mary Hill,</hi> near unto <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> they found a Coffin of rotten Timber, and therein the Corps of a Woman, whole of skin, and of bones undiſſevered, with the joynts of her Arms, ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, without breaking of the skin, upon whoſe Sepulcher this was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here lie the Bodies of</hi> Richard Hackney, <hi>Fiſhmonger, and</hi> Alice <hi>his Wife; The which.</hi> Richard, <hi>was Sheriff, in the fifteenth of</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>the ſecond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her Body was kept above ground three or four dayes, without noyance; but then it waxed unfavory, and was again buried.</p>
               <p>This Lane on both ſides, is furniſhed with fair Houſes for Marchants, and hath at the North end thereof, one other Lane, called St. <hi>Margaret Pattens,</hi> becauſe of old time, <hi>Pattens</hi> were uſually there made and ſold; but of latter time, this is called <hi>Rood Lane,</hi> of a Rood there placed, in the Church-yard of St. <hi>Margaret,</hi> whileſt the old Church was taken down, and again new builded; during which time, the oblations made to this <hi>Rood,</hi> were imployed towards building of the Church; But in the year 1538. about the 23. of <hi>May</hi> in the morning, the ſaid Rood was found to have been in the night preceding (by people unknown) broken all to pieces; together, with the Tabernacle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it had bin placed.</p>
               <p>Then have ye another Lane, called <hi>Rother Lane,</hi> or <hi>Red Roſe Lane,</hi> of ſuch a ſigne there, now commonly called <hi>Pudding Lane,</hi> becauſe the Butchers of <hi>Eaſt-Cheape,</hi> have their Scalding-houſe for Hoggs there, &amp; their Puddings, with other filth of Beaſts, are voided down that way to their Dung-boats on the <hi>Thames:</hi> In this Church you have the Sepulchers of ſundry worthy men, among other of Mr. <hi>Vandepute,</hi> a very worthy Marchant, whoſe Son Mr. <hi>Giles Vandepute,</hi> was lately buried alſo there.</p>
               <p>Then on the Weſt ſide of St. <hi>Mary Hill</hi> Church, is a Lane called <hi>Rope-lane</hi> of old, and after <hi>Lucas-lane,</hi> but now <hi>Love lane;</hi> Then have you the Pariſh of St. <hi>Andrew Hubbart</hi> in <hi>East-Cheape;</hi> Then is there <hi>Buttolph-lane,</hi> and afterwards the Church of St. <hi>George Buttolph-lane,</hi> which though ſmall, hath divers Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>Theſe two Companies of <hi>Stock-Fiſhmongers</hi> and <hi>Salt-Fiſhmongers,</hi> of old time had their ſeverall Halls, to wit, in <hi>Thames</hi> ſtreet twain, in New Fiſh-ſtreet twain, in Old Fiſh-ſtreet twain, in each place one for either Company, in all ſix ſeveral Halls; the Company was ſo great, that it lies upon Records, that theſe <hi>Fiſhmongers</hi> have been jolly Citizens, and ſix Mayors have been of their Company in the ſpace of four and twenty years, to wit, <hi>Walter Turk 1350, John Lofkin 1359, John Wroth, 1361, John Pechie 1362, Simon Morden</hi> 1369 and <hi>William Wallworth</hi> 1374.</p>
               <p>It followed, that in the year 1382, through the Counſel of <hi>John North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton</hi> Draper, then being Mayor, <hi>VVilliam Eſſex, John More</hi> Mercer, and <hi>Richard Northbury,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Fiſhmongers</hi> were greatly troubled, hindred of their Liberties, and almoſt deſtroyed by combinations made againſt them, ſo that in a Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> the controverſie depending between the Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> and the Fiſhmonger, <hi>Nic.

               <p>After this, many of the Nobles aſſembled at <hi>Reading,</hi> to ſuppreſſe the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Sheirs of the ſaid <hi>John Northampton,</hi> or Combarton, late Mayor, that had attempted great and hainous enterpriſes, of the which he was convict; and when he ſtood mute nor would utter one word, it was Decreed, that he ſhould be committed to perpetual priſon, his goods confiſcate to the Kings uſe, and that he ſhould not come within a hundred miles of <hi>London,</hi> during his life; He was therefore ſent to the Caſtle of <hi>Fintegall</hi> in the Confines of <hi>Cornwall;</hi> and in the mean ſpace the Kings Servants ſpoiled his goods: <hi>John Moore, Richard Northbury,</hi> and others were likewiſe there Convict, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to perpetual priſon, and their goods confiſcate, for certain Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by them made againſt the Fiſhmongers in the City of <hi>London,</hi> as is aforeſaid,

               <p>In the year 1410, the eleventh of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, upon the Even of Saint <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the Kings Sonnes, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> being in <hi>East-Cheape</hi> at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, (or rather at break-faſt; for it was after the Watch was broken up, betwixt two and three a Clock after mid-night) a great debate happened between their men, and other of the Court, which laſted one houre, till the Maior and Sheriffs, with other Citizens appeaſed the ſame; For the which, afterwards, the ſaid Maior, Aldermen and Sheriffs, were called to anſwer before the King, his Sons, and divers Lords, being highly moved againſt the City; At which time, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Gaſcoigne,</hi> chief Juſtice, required the Maior and Aldermen, for the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to put them in the Kings Grace; whereunto they anſwered, that they had not offended, but (according to the Law) had done their beſt, in ſtinting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and maintaining of the peace; upon which anſwer, the King remitted all his Ire, and diſmiſſed them.</p>
               <p>And to prove this <hi>East-Cheape</hi> to be a place repleniſhed with Cooks, it may appear by a Song, called <hi>London lick-penny,</hi> made by <hi>Lidgate,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Bury,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, in the perſon of a Country-man, comming to <hi>London,</hi> and travelling thorough the ſame.

In <hi>Corn-hill,</hi> to buy old Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and Houſhold-ſtuffe, where he was forced to buy his own Hood, which he had loſt in <hi>Westminſter-hall.</hi> In <hi>Candlewright-ſtreet,</hi> Drapers profered him Cheap Cloth. In <hi>East-Cheape,</hi> the Cooks cryed hot Ribs of Beef roſted, Pies well baked, and other Victuals. There was clattering of Pewter-Pots, Harp, Pipe and Sawtry; yea by cock, nay by cock, for greater Oaths were ſpared, ſome ſang of <hi>Jenkin,</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> &amp;c.

Then is <hi>Abchurch</hi> Lane, which is on both ſides, almoſt wholly of this Ward: the Pariſh Church there (called of St. <hi>Mary Abchurch, Apechurch,</hi> or <hi>Upchurch,</hi> as I have read it) ſtandeth ſomewhat near unto the South end thereof, on a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ground.

               <p>On the South ſide of this Ward, beginning again at the Eaſt, is St. <hi>Michaels</hi> lane; which lane is almoſt wholly of this Ward, on both ſides down towards Thames ſtreet, to a Well or Pump there; on the Eaſt ſide of this Lane is <hi>Crooked</hi> Lane aforeſaid, by <hi>St. Michaels</hi> Church, towards <hi>New Fiſhſtreet.</hi> One of the moſt ancient Houſes in this Lane, is called the <hi>Leaden Porch,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed ſometime to Sir <hi>John Merston,</hi> Knight, the firſt of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th;</hi> It is now called the <hi>Swan</hi> in <hi>Crooked</hi> Lane, poſſeſſed of ſtrangers, and retailing of <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wine.

               <p>
                  <hi>VV. de Burgo,</hi> gave two Meſſuages to that Church in <hi>Candlewick</hi> ſtreet, 1317. <hi>John Loveken,</hi> Stock-fiſh monger, four times Maior, builded (in the ſame ground) this fair Church of <hi>St. Michael,</hi> and was there buried in the Quire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a fair Tombe, with the Images of him and his Wife in Alabaſter: the ſaid Church hath bin ſince increaſed, with a new Quire, and ſide Chappels by Sir W. <hi>Walworth,</hi> Stock-fiſhmonger, Maior, ſometime Servant to the ſaid <hi>John Loveken;</hi> Alſo the Tombe of <hi>Loveken</hi> was removed, and a flat ſtone of gray marble, garniſhed with Plates of Copper, laid on him, as it yet remaineth in the Body of the Church.</p>

The <hi>King</hi> gave to the Maior, a hundred pound Land by year, and to each of the other forty pound Land, year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to them and their Heires for ever.</p>
               <p>After this, in the ſame year, the ſaid Sir <hi>William Walworth,</hi> founded in the ſaid Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> a Colledge, of a Maſter and nine Prieſts, or Chaplains, and deceaſing 1385. was there buried in the North Chappel by the Quire; but his Monument being (amongſt other by bad people) defaced in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth; and again, ſince renewed by the Fiſhmongers, for lack of knowledge, whatſoever before had been written in this Epitaph, they followed a fabulous Book, and wrote <hi>Jack Straw,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Wat Tylar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath alſo been, and is now grown to a common opinion, that in reward of this ſervice done by the ſaid <hi>William Wallworth,</hi> againſt the Rebel, that King <hi>Richard</hi> added to the Arms of this City (which was Argent, a plane Croſſe Gules) a Sword, or Dagger, (for ſo they terme it) whereof Mr. <hi>John Stow</hi> makes a doubt; but to the contrary, he alledgeth, that in the fourth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, in a full Aſſembly made in the upper.

               <p>This new Seal ſeemeth to be made before <hi>William Walworth</hi> was Knighted; for he is not there intituled Sir, as afterwards he was; and certain it is, that the ſame new Seal then made, is now in uſe, and none other in that Office of the Majoralty, which may ſuffice to anſwer the former ſuppoſition, without ſhewing of any evidence ſealed with the old Seal, which was the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and not the Dagger of <hi>William Walworth.</hi> In this Church are ſundry ancient Monuments, of Mayors and Sheriffs of <hi>London.</hi>

his Writ to the Treaſurer, and Baron of his Exchequer commanding that they ſhould make Inquiſition thereof; Before whom the Marchants being called, when they were not able to diſcharge themſelves, ſith they enjoyed the <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> to them granted for the ſame, a precept was ſent to the Maior and She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, to diſtrain the ſaid Marchants to make reparations; namely, <hi>Gerard Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bod,</hi> Alderman of the Haunce, <hi>Ralph de Cuſſarde</hi> a Citizen of Colen, <hi>Ludero de Denauar,</hi> a Burgeſſe of <hi>Trivon, John</hi> of <hi>Aras</hi> a Burgeſſe of <hi>Trivon, Bartram</hi> of <hi>Hamburgh, Godeſtalk</hi> of <hi>Hundondale,</hi> a Burgeſſe of <hi>Trivon, John de Deal</hi> a Burgeſſe of <hi>Munster,</hi> then remaining in the ſaid City of <hi>London,</hi> for themſelves, and all other Merchants of the <hi>Haunce,</hi> and ſo they granted 210 Marks ſterling, to the Maior and Citizens; and undertook, that they and their Succeſſors, ſhould (from time to time) repair the ſaid <hi>Gate,</hi> and bear the third part of the Charges in money, and men to defend it, when need were.</p>
               <p>And for this Agreement, the ſaid Maior and Citizens, granted to the ſaid Marchants their liberties, which till of late they have enjoyed; as namely, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other, that they might lay up their Grain, which they brought into this Realm, in Inns, and ſell it in their Garners, by the ſpace of forty dayes, after they had laid it up; except by the Mayor and Citizens they were expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, becauſe of Dearth, or other reaſonable occaſions. Alſo they might have their Aldermen, as they had bin accuſtomed; provided alwayes, that he were of the City, and preſented to the Maior and Aldermen of the City, ſo oft as any ſhould be choſen, and ſhould take an Oath before them, to maintain Juſtice in their Courts, and to behave themſelves in their Office, according to Law, and as it ſtood with the Cuſtoms of the City.</p>
               <p>Thus much for their priviledges, whereby it appeareth, that they were great Marchants of Corne, brought out of the Eaſt parts hither; inſomuch, that the Occupiers of Husbandry in this Land, were enforced to complain of them, for bringing in ſuch abundance, when the Corn of this Realm was at an eaſie price; whereupon it was ordained by Parliament, That no perſon ſhould bring into any part of this Realm, by way of Marchandize, Wheat, Rie, or Barley, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the ſaid Realm, when the Quarter of Wheat exceeded not the price of <hi>ſix ſhillings eight pence, Rie four ſhillings the Quarter, and Barley three ſhillings the Quarter,</hi> upon forfeiture one half to the <hi>King,</hi> the other half to the ſeiſor thereof: Theſe Marchants of the <hi>Hawnce,</hi> had their <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> in the place aforeſaid, by the ſaid <hi>Coſin-lane:</hi> Their Hall is large, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Stone, with three Arched Gates towards the ſtreet; the middlemoſt whereof, is far bigger than the other, and is ſeldom opened, the other two be mured up, the ſame is now called the <hi>Old Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> they hired one Houſe next adjoyning to their <hi>Old Hall,</hi> which ſometime belonged to <hi>Richard Lions,</hi> a famous <hi>Lapidary,</hi> one of the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> in the 49 of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d;</hi> and in the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> by the Rebels of <hi>Kent,</hi> drawn out of that Houſe, and beheaded in <hi>Weſt-Cheape:</hi> This alſo was a great Houſe, with a large Wharf on the <hi>Thames;</hi> and the way thereunto was called <hi>Windgooſe,</hi> or <hi>Wildgooſe-lane,</hi> which is now called <hi>Windgooſe-Alley;</hi> for that the ſame Alley is (for the moſt part) builded on by the <hi>Styliard Marchants.</hi> The Abbat of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> had a Meſſuage here, with a key given to him, in the 34. of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then is one other great Houſe, which ſometime pertained to <hi>John Rainwel,</hi> Stock-Fiſhmonger, <hi>Maior,</hi> and it was by him given to the <hi>Maior</hi> and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, to the end, that the profits thereof, ſhould be diſpoſed in deeds of piety; which Houſe, in the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> was confirmed unto the ſaid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, in manner following, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>In the year 1551, the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> through complaint of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Marchants,</hi> the liberty of the <hi>Steel-yard Marchants,</hi> was ſeized into the <hi>Kings</hi> hands, and ſo it reſteth.</p>
               <p>Then is <hi>Church-lane,</hi> at the Weſt end of <hi>Alhollowes</hi> Church, called <hi>Alhollowes</hi> the more in <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> for a difference from <hi>Alhollowes</hi> the leſſe, in the ſame ſtreet; It is alſo called <hi>Alhollowes ad faenum in the Ropery,</hi> becauſe Hay was ſold near thereunto, at <hi>Hay-Wharf,</hi> and Ropes of old time made and ſold in the high ſtreet: This is a fair Church, with a large <hi>Cloyſter</hi> on the South ſide thereof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Church-yard, but fouly defaced and ruinated. Dr. <hi>Lichfield,</hi> a learned man, and an Authour, who died 1447. lieth here buried, with other Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.</p>
               <p>At the Eaſt end of this Church goeth down a Lane called <hi>Hay Wharf-</hi>lane, now lately a great Brew-houſe, builded there by one <hi>Pot; Hen.

J. Butler,</hi> Draper, one of the Sheriffs, in the year 1420. dwelled there; He appointed his houſe to be ſold, and the price thereof to be given to the poor; it was of <hi>Alhollowes</hi> Pariſh the leſſe.</p>
               <p>Then is there the ſaid Pariſh-Church of <hi>Alhollowes</hi> called the Leſſe, and by ſome <hi>Alhollowes</hi> on the Cellars; for it ſtandeth on Vaults, it is ſaid to be builded by Sir <hi>John Poultney,</hi> ſometimes Mayor: The Steeple and Quire of this Church, ſtand on an Arched Gate, being the entry to a great Houſe, called <hi>Cold Harborough,</hi> the Quire of late being fallen down, is now again at length, in the year 1594. by the Pariſhioners new builded.</p>
               <p>Touching this <hi>Cold Harborough,</hi> I finde, that in thirteenth of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, Sir <hi>John Abel,</hi> Knight, demiſed, or let unto <hi>Henry Stow,</hi> Draper, ill that his Capital Meſſuage, called the <hi>Cold Harborough,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>All Saints ad faenum,</hi> &amp; all the purtenances within the Gate, with the Key which <hi>Rob.

After the which <hi>Jo.

               <p>In the year 1397. the 21. of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d. John Holland,</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> was lodged there, and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond his Brother, dined with him, it was
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95174:58"/>
then counted a right fair and ſtately houſe; But in the next year following, I finde, that <hi>Edmund, Earl of Cambridge,</hi> was there lodged, notwithſtanding, the ſaid houſe ſtill retained the name of <hi>Poultneys Inne,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, the 26 of his Reign. It belonged ſince to H. <hi>Holland, Duke of Exceſter,</hi> and he was lodged there, in the year 1472. In the year 1485. <hi>Richard</hi> the third, by his Letters Patents, granted and gave to <hi>John VVrith, alias Garter,</hi> principal <hi>King</hi> of Arms of Engliſh men, and to the reſt of the <hi>Kings</hi> Heralds, and Purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Arms, all that Meſſuage, with the appurtenances called <hi>Cold Harber,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Al-Saints the little in London,</hi> and their Succeſſors for ever, Dated at <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> the ſecond of <hi>March, Anno regni ſui primo,</hi> without fine or fee. How the ſaid <hi>Heraulds</hi> departed therewith, I have not read; but in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, the Biſhop of <hi>Durhams</hi> houſe, neer <hi>Charing Croſſe,</hi> being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the <hi>Kings</hi> hand, <hi>Cuthbert Tunſtall,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> was lodged in this <hi>Cold Harber;</hi> ſince the which time it hath belonged to the Earls of <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> by compoſition, (as is ſuppoſed) from the ſaid <hi>Cuthbert Tunſtall.</hi> The laſt decea ed Earl took it down, and in place thereof, builded a great number of ſmall Tenements, now letten out for great Rents, to people of all ſorts.</p>
               <p>Then is the <hi>Dyers-hall,</hi> which Company was made a Brother-hood and a <hi>Guild,</hi> in the fourth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and appointed to conſiſt of a Gardian, or Warden, and a Communalty, the twelvth of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. Then be there divers large Brew-houſes, and others, till you come to <hi>Ebgate Lane,</hi> where that Ward endeth in the Eaſt; On the North ſide of <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> be divers Lanes alſo, the firſt is at the South end of <hi>Elbow</hi> Lane, before ſpoken of, Weſt from <hi>Downgate,</hi> over againſt <hi>Greenwich-lane,</hi> then be divers fair Houſes for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and others all along that ſide; The next Lane Eaſt from <hi>Down-gate,</hi> is called <hi>Buſh-lane,</hi> which turneth up to <hi>Candlewick-ſtreet,</hi> and is of <hi>Down-gate</hi> Ward. Next is <hi>Suffolk lane,</hi> likewiſe turning up to <hi>Candlewick-street,</hi> in this Lane is one notable Grammar School, founded in the year 1561. by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Wardens, and Aſſiſtants of the Marchant-Taylors, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Poultney, Richard Hills,</hi> ſometimes Maſter of that Company, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given 500 <hi>l.</hi> toward the purchaſe of an Houſe, called the <hi>Mannor of the Roſe,</hi> ſometime belonging to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> wherein the ſaid School is kept.</p>
               <p>Then is there one other Lane, which turneth up to St. <hi>Lawrence-hill,</hi> and to the South vveſt Corner of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> Church-yard, then another Lane, called <hi>Poultney-lane,</hi> that goeth up of this Ward to the South-Eaſt corner of St. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> Church-yard, and ſo down again, and to the Weſt corner of St. <hi>Martin Orgar lane,</hi> and over againſt <hi>Ebgate-lane;</hi> and this is all of <hi>Downgate-vvard,</hi> the thirteenth in number, lying Eaſt from the Water-courſe of <hi>VVallbrooke,</hi> and hat hnot any one Houſe on the Weſt ſide of the ſaid Brook.</p>

               <p>THe Wards ſpoken of hitherto may beſaid to lye on the Eaſt.

Whereby it appears, that in thoſe daies, (and till of late times) every man lived according to his own profeſſed Trade, not any one interrupting another; The Cooks dreſſed meat, and ſold no Wine; and the Taverner ſold Wine, but dreſſed no meat for ſale, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Ward beginneth in the Eaſt, at the Weſt end of <hi>Downgate</hi> Ward, at the Water-courſe of <hi>Walbrook,</hi> which parteth them, to wit, at <hi>Granthams</hi> Lane on the Thames ſide, and at <hi>Elbow-</hi>Lane on the Lands ſide, it runneth along in <hi>Thames</hi> ſtreet Weſt, ſome three houſes beyond the <hi>Old Swana</hi> Brew-houſe; and on the Land ſide, ſome three Houſes Weſt, beyond Saint <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Garlick Hithe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In breadth, this Ward ſtretcheth from the <hi>Vintry</hi> North, to the Wall of the Weſt gate of the <hi>Tower Royal,</hi> the other North part is of <hi>Cordwainer-ſtreet</hi> Ward.

               <p>Then from the South gate Weſt, runneth one other ſtreet, called <hi>Knight-riders ſtreet,</hi> by Saint <hi>Thomas Apoſtles</hi> Church, on the North ſide, and <hi>Wringwren</hi> Lane, by the ſaid Church, at the Weſt end thereof, and to the Eaſt end of <hi>Trinity Church</hi> in the ſaid <hi>Knight-riders ſtreet,</hi> where this Ward endeth, on that South ſide the ſtreet; but on the North ſide it runneth no farther than the corner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the new builded Taverne, and other Houſes, in a plot of ground where ſometime ſtood <hi>Ormond place;</hi> yet have ye one other Lane, lower down in <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all-ſtreet,</hi> ſtretching forth from over againſt Saint <hi>Michaels</hi> Church, to and by the North ſide of Saint <hi>James</hi> Church by <hi>Garlick Hithe,</hi> this is called, <hi>Kerion</hi> Lane; and thus much for the bounds of the <hi>Vintry</hi> Ward.

Then is <hi>Simpſons</hi> Lane, of one <hi>Simpſon;</hi> or <hi>Emperours head</hi> Lane, of ſuch a Sign: then the <hi>Three Cranes</hi> Lane, ſo called, not only of a Sign of three <hi>Cranes</hi> at a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne door, but rather of three ſtrong <hi>Cranes of Timber</hi> placed on the Vintry Wharf, by the Thames ſide, to Crane up Wines there as is aforeſaid; this Lane was of old time, to wit, the ninth of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, called the <hi>Painted Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi> Lane, of the Tavern being painted.</p>
               <p>Then next over againſt St. <hi>Martins</hi> Church, is a large Houſe builded of Stone and Timber, with Vaults for the ſtowage of Wines, and is called the <hi>Uin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> There dwelled <hi>John Giſers</hi> Vintner, Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Conſtable of the Tower;</hi> and then was <hi>Henry Picard,</hi> Vintner, Mayor; In this houſe <hi>Henry Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card</hi> feaſted four Kings in one day, as is ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Then next is <hi>Uanners</hi> Lane, ſo called of <hi>Uanner</hi> that was owner thereof; it is now called <hi>Church</hi> Lane, of the coming up from St. <hi>Martins</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Next is <hi>Broad-</hi>Lane, for that the ſame is broader for the paſſage of Carts from the <hi>Uintry</hi> Wharf, than be the other Lanes.

               <p>The <hi>Uintners</hi> builded for themſelves a fair Hall, and alſo thirteen <hi>Almſ-houſes</hi> there, for thirteen poor people, which are kept of Charity Rent-free.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uintners</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> were (of old time) called <hi>Marchant Uintners of Gaſcoyne,</hi> and ſo I read them in the Records of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, the eleventh year, and <hi>Edward</hi> the third the ninth year; they were as well <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> as <hi>ſtrangers</hi> born beyond the Seas, but then ſubjects to the King of <hi>England,</hi> great <hi>Burdeaux Merchants of Gaſcoyne</hi> &amp; <hi>French Wines,</hi> divers of them were <hi>Mayors</hi> of this City; namely, <hi>John Adrian</hi> Vintner, <hi>Reignold</hi> at Conduit, <hi>John Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Henry Picard</hi> that feaſted the Kings of <hi>England, France, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres; John Stodie,</hi> that gave <hi>Stodies</hi> Lane to the <hi>Vintners,</hi> which four laſt named, were <hi>Mayors</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and yet <hi>Gaſcoyne</hi> Wines were then to be ſold at <hi>London,</hi> not above fourpence, nor <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wines above ſix pence the Gallon.</p>
               <p>I read of <hi>Sweet Wines,</hi> that in the fiftieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>John Peachie,</hi> Fiſhmonger was accuſed of, for that he procured a Licenſe for the only ſale of them in <hi>London,</hi> which he endeavoured to juſtifie by Law, yet he was impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fined.</p>
               <p>More I read, that in the ſixth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, the <hi>Lombards</hi> corrupted their <hi>Sweet Wines;</hi> when knowledge thereof came to <hi>John Raynwel</hi> Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> he (in divers places of the City) commanded the heads of the Buts and other Veſſells in the open ſtreets, to be broken, to the number of a hundred and fifty, ſo that the liquour running forth, paſſed through the City like a ſtream of rain water, in the ſight of all the people, from whence there iſſued a moſt loathſome ſavour.</p>
               <p>I read in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, that no <hi>Sweet VVines</hi> were brought into this Realm but <hi>Malmſyes,</hi> by the <hi>Longobards,</hi> paying to the King for his Licence, ſix ſhillings eight pence of every Butt, beſides twelve pence for Bottel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.</p>
               <p>In thoſe daies <hi>Malmſey</hi> was not to be ſold above three half-pence the pint; For proof whereof, it appeareth in the Church of St. <hi>Andrew Under-ſhaft,</hi> that in the year 1547, <hi>J. G.</hi> and <hi>S. K.</hi> then Church-Wardens, for eighty pints of Malmſey ſpent in the Church, after one penny half penny the pint, paid at the years end for the ſame ten ſhillings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:95174:59"/>
Moreover, no Sacks were ſold, but <hi>Rumney,</hi> &amp; that for Medicine more than for drink; but now many kinds of Sacks are known and uſed. And ſo much for Wines.</p>
               <p>I read further that in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the young Prince <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, T.</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence, J.</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> the Kings ſons, came to Supper amongſt the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> in the <hi>Vintry,</hi> in the Houſe of <hi>Lewes John</hi> a <hi>Briton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſucceſſors of thoſe Vintners and Wine-drawers, that retailed by the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, Pottel, quart, and pint, were all incorporated by the name of <hi>Wine-tunners,</hi> in the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and confirmed the fifteenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth.</p>
               <p>Next is <hi>Palmers</hi> Lane, now called, <hi>Anchors</hi> Lane, the <hi>Plummers</hi> have their Hall there, but are Tenants to the Vintners.</p>
               <p>Then is <hi>Worceſter</hi> Houſe, ſometimes belonging to the Earls of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> now divided into many Tenaments; The <hi>Fruiterers</hi> have there Hall there.</p>
               <p>On the Land ſide, is the <hi>Royal</hi> ſtreet, and <hi>Pater noſter</hi> Lane, I think of old time called the <hi>Arches,</hi> for I read, that <hi>Robert de Suffolk,</hi> gave to <hi>Walter Darford,</hi> his Tenement with the apurtenance, in the Lane called <hi>Les Arches,</hi> in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of Saint <hi>Michael de Pater noſter</hi> Church, between the Wall of the field called <hi>Wincheſter field</hi> on the Eaſt, and the ſame Lane on the Weſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>More, there was a ſtone Houſe called <hi>Stoda de Winton, juxta Stodum</hi> Bridge, which in that Lane was over <hi>Walbrook</hi> water.</p>
               <p>Then is the fair Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> called <hi>Pater noſter</hi> Church, in the <hi>Royal</hi> ſtreet; This Church was new builded, and made a <hi>Colledge</hi> of S. <hi>Spirit,</hi> and S. <hi>Mary,</hi> founded by <hi>Richard VVhittington,</hi> Mercer, four times <hi>Mayor,</hi> for a Maſter, four Fellows, Maſters of Art, Clerks, Conducts, Choriſts, &amp;c. and an Alms-houſe, called <hi>Gods houſe</hi> or Hoſpital, for thirteen poor men, one of them to be <hi>Tutor,</hi> and to have ſixteen pence the week, the other twelve, each of them to have fourteen pence the week for ever, with other neceſſary proviſion, an Hutch with three Locks, with a common Seal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Licence for this foundation was granted by King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the eleventh of his Reign, and in the twelfth of the ſame Kings reign, the Mayor and the Communalty of <hi>London,</hi> granted to <hi>Richard VVhittington,</hi> a vacant piece of ground thereon, to build his Colledge in the <hi>Royall;</hi> all which was confirmed by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth the third of his Reign, to <hi>John Coventry, Jenkin Carpenter,</hi> and <hi>VVilliam Grove,</hi> Executors to to <hi>Richard Whittington.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This foundation was again confirmed by Parliament, the tenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and was ſuppreſſed by the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth. The Alms-Houſes, with the poor men, do remain, and are paid by the Mercers.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Richard VVhittington</hi> was (in this Church) three times buried, firſt, by his Executors, under a fair Monument; then, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, the Parſon of that Church, thinking ſome great riches (as he ſaid) to be buried with him, cauſed his Monument to be broken, his Body to be ſpoiled of his Leaden ſheet, and again the ſecond time to be buried; And in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Pariſhioners were forced to take him up, and lap him in Lead, as afore, to bury him the third time, and to place his Monuments, or the like, over him again, which remaineth ſtill and ſo he reſted.</p>
               <p>Among others, Sir <hi>Thomas Tanke</hi> Knight of the Garter born in <hi>Almain,</hi> a great Martial man, lieth buried there.</p>
               <p>At the upper end of this ſtreet, is the <hi>Tower Royall,</hi> whereof that ſtreet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth name; This Tower &amp; great place was ſo called, of pertaining to the <hi>Kings</hi> of this Realm, but by whom the ſame was firſt builded, or of what Antiquity continued, it doth not appear, more than that in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the

firſt, the ſecond, fourth, and ſeventh year, it was the Tenement of <hi>Simon Beawmes;</hi> Alſo that in the thirty ſixt of <hi>Edward</hi> the third the ſame was called the <hi>Royal,</hi> in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Michael de Pater noſter,</hi> and that in the three and fortieth of his Reign, he gave it by the name of his Inne, called the <hi>Royall,</hi> in his City of <hi>London,</hi> in value twenty pounds by year, unto his <hi>Colledge</hi> of Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> at <hi>Westminſter;</hi> Notwithſtanding, in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, it was called the <hi>Queens Wardrobe,</hi> as appeareth by this that followeth.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard,</hi> having in <hi>Smithfield</hi> overcome and diſperſed the Rebels, He, his Lords, and all his Company, entred the City of <hi>London</hi> with great joy, and went to the Lady Princeſſe his Mother, who was then lodged in the <hi>Tower</hi> called the <hi>Queens Wardrobe,</hi> where ſhe had remained three daies and two nights much affrighted; But when ſhe ſaw the King her Son, ſhe was greatly rejoyced, <hi>Ah Son, What great ſorrow have I ſuffered for you this day?</hi> The King anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Certainly, Madam, I know it well, but now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and thank God, for I have this day recovered mine Heritage, and the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>which I had near-hand laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Tower</hi> ſeemeth to have been (at that time) of good defence; for when the Rebels had beſet the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and got poſſeſſion thereof, taking from thence whom they liſted, the Princeſſe being forced to fly, came to this <hi>Tower-Royall,</hi> where ſhe was lodged, and remained ſafe, as ye have heard, and it may be alſo ſuppoſed, that the King himſelf was at that time lodged there.</p>
               <p>I read, that in the year 1386, <hi>Lyon</hi> King of <hi>Armony,</hi> being chaſed out of his Realm, by the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> received innumerable gifts of the <hi>King</hi> and of his Nobles, the King then lying in the <hi>Royall,</hi> where he alſo granted to the ſaid King of <hi>Armony,</hi> a Charter of a thouſand pounds by year during his Life; This for proof may ſuffice, that Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been lodged in this <hi>Tower,</hi> though the ſame (afterwards) hath been neglected, and turned into <hi>ſtabling</hi> for the Kings Horſes, and now letten out to divers men and divided into Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Horſe-Bridge-street,</hi> is the <hi>Cutlers</hi> Hall, <hi>Richard de Wilehale,</hi> 1295, confirmed to <hi>Paul Butelar</hi> this Houſe, and Edifices, in the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Pater noſter</hi> Church, and Saint <hi>John</hi> upon <hi>Walbrook,</hi> which ſometime <hi>Lawrence Giſers,</hi> and his ſon <hi>Peter Giſers</hi> did poſſeſſe, and afterward <hi>Hugonis de Hingham,</hi> and lyeth between the Tenement of the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> towards the South; and the Lane called <hi>Horſe-ſhoe-Bridge,</hi> towards the North, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the way called <hi>Pater noſter</hi> Church on the Weſt, and the courſe of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke</hi> on the Eaſt, paying yearly one <hi>Clove of Gilliflowers</hi> at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and to the poor and Convent of Saint <hi>Mary Overy,</hi> ſix ſhillings. This Houſe ſometime belonged to <hi>Simon Doleſly</hi> Grocer, and Mayor 1359, They of this Company had (of old time) three Arts, or ſorts of Workmen, to wit, the firſt were <hi>Smiths, Forgers</hi> of <hi>Blades,</hi> and therefore called <hi>Bladers,</hi> and divers of them proved wealthy men, as namely, <hi>Walter Nele</hi> Blader; one of the Sheriffs, the twelfth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, Deceaſed 1352, and was buried in Saint <hi>James Garlicke Hithe,</hi> He leſt Lands to the mending of High-wayes about <hi>London,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Newgate</hi> and <hi>Wicombe, Ealdgate</hi> and <hi>Chelmesford, Biſhopſgate</hi> and <hi>Ware, Southwark</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter, &amp;c.</hi> The ſecond were <hi>Makers of Hafts,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Garniſhers of Blades.</hi> The third ſor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In this ſtreet is the Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Thomas Apoſtles,</hi> by <hi>Wring-wren</hi> Lane a hanſome Church, and in the year 1629, well repaired and finely garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; but Monuments of antiquity, there are none beyond the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, except ſome Arms in the Windows, as alſo in the Stone-work, which ſome ſuppoſe to be of <hi>John Barnes</hi> Mercer, Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1371, a great builder thereof.

               <p>This ſtreet beginneth by Weſt-cheap, and Saint <hi>Mary Bow</hi> Church is the head thereof on the Weſt ſide, and it runneth down South, thorow that part which of latter time was called <hi>Hoſier</hi> Lane, now <hi>Bow</hi> Lane; and then by the Weſt end of <hi>Aldermary</hi> Church to the new builded Houſes, in place of <hi>Ormond Houſe,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Garlick hill,</hi> or <hi>Hith,</hi> to St. <hi>James</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>The upper part of this ſtreet towards <hi>Cheap,</hi> was called <hi>Hoſier</hi> Lane, of Hoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers dwelling there in place of <hi>Shoomakers;</hi> but now thoſe Hoſiers being worn out by men of other Trades, (as the <hi>Hoſiers</hi> had worn out the <hi>Shoomakers)</hi> the ſame is called <hi>Bow-Lane,</hi> of <hi>Bow</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>On the Weſt ſide of <hi>Cordwainer-ſtreet,</hi> is <hi>Baſing-lane,</hi> right over againſt <hi>Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe-lane,</hi> This <hi>Baſing-lane,</hi> Weſt to the back gate of the <hi>Red Lyon,</hi> in <hi>Wathling-ſtreet,</hi> is of this <hi>Cordwainer-ſtreet</hi> Ward.</p>
               <p>Now again on the North ſide of this high ſtreet, is <hi>Budge-row:</hi> by the Eaſt end of St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Church, have ye St. <hi>Sithes Lane,</hi> ſo called of St. <hi>Sithes Church,</hi> (which ſtandeth againſt the North end of that Lane) and this is wholly of <hi>Cordwainer-ſtreet Ward;</hi> alſo the South ſide of <hi>Needlers lane,</hi> which reacheth from the North end of St. <hi>Sithes lane,</hi> vveſt to <hi>Soper lane;</hi> then vveſt from St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Church, is the South end of <hi>Sopers lane,</hi> which lane took that name, not of <hi>Sope-making,</hi> as ſome have ſuppoſed, but of <hi>Alen le Sopar,</hi> in the ninth of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95174:62"/>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond; nor can we read of <hi>Sope-making</hi> in this City, till within this hundred and fifty years, that <hi>John Lambe,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Graſſe-ſtreet,</hi> ſet up a boyling houſe; for this City (in former time) was ſerved of white Sope in hard Cakes (called Caſtle-Soap, and other) from beyond the Seas, and of gray Sope, ſpeckled with white, very ſweet and good, from <hi>Briſtow,</hi> ſold here for a peny the pound, and never above peny farthing; and black Sope for an half-peny the pound.</p>
               <p>Then in <hi>Bow-lane</hi> (as they now call it) is <hi>Gooſe-lane,</hi> by <hi>Bow-</hi>Church; <hi>William Eſſex,</hi> Mercer, had Tenements there, in the ſix and twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>Then from the South end of <hi>Bow-lane,</hi> up <hi>Wathling-ſtreet,</hi> till over againſt the <hi>Red Lyon,</hi> are the bounds of <hi>Cordwainer-ſtreet</hi> Ward.</p>
               <p>Then is there a fair Pariſh in <hi>Budge-row,</hi> called St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> at firſt, and now St. <hi>Antlins.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Knowles</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> lyeth buried there, who repaired, and was a great Benefactor to that Church, upon whom is this Epitaph,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Here lyeth graven under this Stone,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Thomas Knowles,</hi> both fleſh and bone, &amp;c.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Next on the South ſide of <hi>Budge-row,</hi> by the Weſt corner thereof, and on the Eaſt ſide of <hi>Cordwainer-ſtreet,</hi> is one other fair Church, called <hi>Aldermary Church,</hi> becauſe the ſame was very old, and elder then any Church of St. <hi>Mary</hi> in the City; till of late years, the foundation of a very fair new Church, was laid there by <hi>Henry Keeble,</hi> Grocer, and Mayor, who deceaſed 1518, and was ther buried in a Vault, by him prepared, with a fair Monument raiſed over him, on the North ſide of the Quire, now deſtroyed and gone: he gave by his Teſtament, a thouſand pound toward the building up of that Church; and yet was not permitted a reſting place for his bones there afterwards. <hi>Richard Chawcer</hi> Vintner, thought to be the Father of <hi>Jeffrey Chawcer</hi> the Poet, was a great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor to this Church.</p>
               <p>At the upper end of <hi>Hoſier-lane,</hi> toward <hi>VVeſt-Cheape,</hi> is the fair Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Mary Bow;</hi> this Church in the Reign of <hi>VVilliam the Conqueror,</hi> being the firſt in this City, builded on <hi>Arches of Stone,</hi> was therefore called <hi>New Mary Church,</hi> of <hi>St. Mary de Areubus, or le Bow,</hi> in <hi>VVest Cheaping;</hi> As <hi>Stratford Bridge,</hi> being the firſt builded (by <hi>Matilda,</hi> the Queen, VVife to <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt) with <hi>Arches</hi> of Stone was called <hi>Stratford le Bow;</hi> which names, to the ſaid Church and Bridge, remain till this day; the Court of the Arches is kept in this Church, and taketh name of the place, not the place of the Court; but of what Antiquity, or continuation that Court hath there continued, 'tis uncertain.</p>
               <p>This Church is of <hi>Cordwainer-ſtreet,</hi> and for divers accidents happening there, hath bin made more famous than any other Pariſh Church of the whole City, or Suburbs.</p>
               <p>Firſt we read, that in the year 1090, and the third of <hi>VVilliam Rufus,</hi> by tempeſt of vvind, the roof of the Church of St. <hi>Mary Bow</hi> in <hi>Cheape,</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, wherewith ſome perſons were flain, and four of the Rafters of ſix and twenty foot in length, with ſuch violence were pitched in the ground of the high ſtreet, that ſcantly four foot of them remained above ground, which were fain to be cut even with the ground, becauſe they could not be plucked out; for the City of <hi>London</hi> was not then paved, but a Mooriſh ground.</p>
               <p>In the year 1196. <hi>VVilliam Fitz Osbert,</hi> a ſeditious Traytor, took the <hi>Steeple of Bow,</hi> and fortified it with Munitions and victuals, but it was aſſaulted, and <hi>VVilliam</hi> with his Complices, were taken (though without blood-ſhed) for he was forced by fire and ſmoak to forſake the Church, and then being by the Judges condemned, he was by the heels drawn to the <hi>Elmes in Smithfield,</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:95174:62"/>
and there hanged with nine of his fellowes, where becauſe his favourers came not to deliver him, he forſook <hi>Maries</hi> Son, (as he termed Chriſt our Saviour) and called upon the Devil to help and deliver him: ſuch was the end of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, a man of an evil life, a ſecret murtherer, a filthy fornicator, a keeper of Concubines, and (amongſt other his deteſtable facts) a falſe accuſer of his elder Brother, who had (in his youth) brought him up in learning, and done many things for his preferment.</p>
               <p>In the year 1271. a great part of the Church of <hi>Bow</hi> fell down, and ſlew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people, men and women.</p>
               <p>In the year 1284, the thirteenth of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, <hi>Lawrence Ducket,</hi> Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, having grievouſly wounded one <hi>Ralph Crepin</hi> in <hi>Weſt Cheap,</hi> fled into <hi>Bow-Church,</hi> into the which (in the night time) entred certain evil perſons, friends unto the ſaid <hi>Ralph,</hi> and ſlew the ſaid <hi>Laurence,</hi> lying in the Steeple, and then hanged him up, placing him ſo by the Window, as if he had hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo was it found by Inquiſition; for the which fact, <hi>Lawrence Ducket</hi> being drawn by the feet, was buried in a ditch without the City; but ſhortly after (by relation of a Boy, who lay with the ſaid <hi>Lawrence,</hi> at the time of his death, and had hid him there for fear) the truth of the matter was diſcloſed; for the which cauſe, <hi>Jordan Good-Cheape, Ralph Crepin, Gilbert Clarke,</hi> and <hi>Jof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey Clarke,</hi> were attainted, and a certain Woman named <hi>Alice,</hi> that was chief cauſer of the ſaid miſchief, was burned, and to the number of ſixteen men, were drawn and hanged, beſides others that, being richer, after long impriſonment, were hanged by the purſe.</p>
               <p>The Church was interdicted, the Doors and Windows were ſtopped up with Thorns for a while, but <hi>Lawrence</hi> was taken up, and honeſtly buried in the Church-yard afterwards.</p>
               <p>The Pariſh-Church of St. <hi>Mary Bow,</hi> by meanes of incroachment, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Houſes, wanting room in their Church-yard, for burial of the Dead, <hi>John Rotham,</hi> or <hi>Rodham,</hi> Citizen and Taylor, by his Teſtament dated the year 1465. gave to the Parſon and Church-wardens, a certain Garden in <hi>Hoſier-lane,</hi> to be a Church-yard, which ſo continued near a hundred years, but now is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on, and is a private mans houſe. The old Steeple of this Church, was by little and little re-edified, and new builded up, at the leaſt ſo much as was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len down, many men giving ſums of money to the furtherance thereof, ſo that at length, to wit, in the year 1469, it was ordained by a Common Councel, that the <hi>Bow Bell</hi> ſhould be nightly rung at nine of the Clock.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, <hi>John Donne</hi> Mercer, by his Teſtament dated 1472, according to the truſt of Reginald <hi>Longdon,</hi> gave to the Parſon and Church-wardens of St. <hi>Mary Bow</hi> two Tenements, with the appurtenances, ſince made into one, in <hi>Hoſierlane,</hi> then ſo called, to the maintenance of <hi>Bow Bell,</hi> the ſame to be rung as aforeſaid, and other things to be obſerved, as by the Will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arches</hi> or <hi>Bowes</hi> thereupon with the Lanthorns five in number, to wit, one at each Corner, and one on the top in the middle upon the Arches, were alſo afterward finiſhed of Stone, brought from <hi>Cane</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> delivered at the Cuſtomers Key, for four ſhillings eight pence the Tun 1515, and 1516, <hi>William Copland</hi> being Church-warden. It is ſaid that this <hi>Copland</hi> gave the great Bell, which made the fifth in the Ring, to be rung nightly at nine of the Clock: This Bell was firſt rung (as a Knell) at the Burial of the ſame <hi>Copland;</hi> It appeareth, that the Lanthorns on the top of this Steeple, were meant to have bin glazed, and lights in them placed nightly in the Winter, whereby Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to the City might have the better ſight thereof, and not to miſſe of their wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:95174:63"/>
In this Pariſh alſo was a Grammar-School, by commandment of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, which <hi>School</hi> was (of old time) kept in an houſe for that purpoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the Church-yard; But that School being decayed, as others about this City, the School-houſe was let out for Rent, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> for four ſhillings the year, a Cellar for two ſhillings the year, and two Vaults under the Church, for 15 <hi>s.</hi> both.</p>
               <p>There are Monuments of divers Citizens of note in this Church, but moſt of them much defac'd, and mouldred away.</p>
               <p>Without the North ſide of this Church of St. <hi>Mary Bow,</hi> towards <hi>Weſt-Cheape,</hi> ſtandeth one fair building of Stone, called in Record <hi>Sildam,</hi> a ſhed which greatly darkneth the ſaid Church; for by meanes thereof, all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and doors on that ſide, are ſtopped up; King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, upon occaſion, as ſhall be ſhewed in the Ward of <hi>Cheap,</hi> cauſed this ſide or ſhed to be made, and ſtrongly to be builded of Stone for himſelf, the Queen, and other States, to ſtand there to behold the Juſtings, and other ſhewes at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; And this Houſe (for long time after) ſerved to that uſe, namely, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond; but in the year 1410. <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, in the twelfth of his Reign, confirmed the ſaid ſhed or building, to <hi>Stephen Spilman, William Marchford,</hi> and <hi>John Wattle,</hi> Mercers, by the name of one new <hi>Sildain,</hi> Shed or Building, with Shops, Cellars, and Edifices, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever appertaining, called <hi>Crounſild,</hi> or <hi>Tamerſild,</hi> ſcituate in the Mercery of <hi>Weſt-Cheape,</hi> and in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Mary de Arcubus</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding which grant, the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and other great Eſtates, as well of forraign Countries repairing to this Realm, as Inhabitants of the ſame, have uſually repaired to this place, therein to behold the ſhewes of this City, paſſing through <hi>Weſt-Cheape;</hi> namely, the great Watches accuſtomed in the night, on the Even of St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> at Midſommer; the Examples whereof were over-long to recite, wherefore let it ſuffice briefly to touch one.</p>
               <p>In the year 1510, on St. <hi>Johns</hi> Eve at night, King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, came to this place, then called the <hi>Kings-Head</hi> in <hi>Cheape,</hi> in the Livery of a Yeoman of the Gard, with an Halberd on his ſhoulder, and there beholding the Watch, departed privily, when the Watch was done; and was not known to any, but whom it pleaſed him; But on Saint <hi>Peters</hi> night next following, He and the Queen came Royally riding to the ſaid place, and there with their Nobles, beheld the Watch of the City, and return'd in the morning.</p>

The High ſtreet of the <hi>Poultrey,</hi> the lower end of <hi>Buckles bury,</hi> and the nether part of the <hi>Venell,</hi> or entry into <hi>Scalding Alley,</hi> &amp; ſo running along, as far as unto the North-Eaſt corner of <hi>Bow-lane</hi> on the South ſide, and from thence into <hi>Bow-lane</hi> on the Eaſt ſide, until ye come to the Channel over againſt the Cellardoor under the Church; &amp; then, on the North ſide of <hi>Cheap,</hi> up to the Standard, ſtretching it ſelf into divers Lanes and peeces, onthe right hand, and on the left hand, as it commeth along.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the High ſtreet of the Poultrey (which is the main body of this Ward:) on the South ſide thereof toward the Eaſt, this Ward beginneth in the way going down to St. <hi>Mary Wooll-Church.</hi>

               <p>Now for Antiquities, and things worthy of memory in <hi>Cheap-</hi>Ward.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the main Body of this Ward, that is, the <hi>Poultry,</hi> ſtandeth the hanſome little Church, that beareth the name of St. <hi>Mildred in the Poultry the Virgin,</hi> which name was given ſurely for diſtinction not for ſuperſtition; for ſo was the Cuſtom of the Kingdom (&amp; yet is) in building their things for the ſervice of God, thatthe Founders called them by the name of ſome Apoſtle, Saint, Martyr, or Confeſſor, as beſt liked their own conceit, at the preſent time, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them from others.</p>
               <p>Who this <hi>Mildred</hi> was, whether ſhe was the Eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Merwaldus,</hi> King of the <hi>VVest-Mercians,</hi> as ſome think, or that ſhe was Daughter of <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> one of the founders of <hi>Pauls Church,</hi> it is incertain: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it much material, but it is probable, that ſhe was ſome holy and devout Maid, which the People of that Age held to be a Saint afterward in Heaven.</p>
               <p>In what years this Church was firſt erected, or who was the firſt Founder of it, we find not; but it appeareth by ſome ancient Evidences of the ſaid Church, that from the beginning it had not ſo much ſpare ground about it, as to make a Church-yard of, until in the year of our Lord God 1420, and the <hi>8th</hi> of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, <hi>Thomas Morſted</hi> Eſquire, and Chirurgion to the Kings, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. (And afterward, in <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1436. was Sheriff and Alderman of <hi>London)</hi> gave unto the Church a parcel of ground, lying between his dwelling-houſe and the ſaid Church (and adjoyning unto the ſaid Church toward the North) to make a Church-yard of, for the burial of their Dead, containing in length, from the Courſe of <hi>VVall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi> toward the Weſt, forty five foot, and in breadth, from the Church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North, thirty five foot.</p>
               <p>Within ſhort time after, ſome body, of Religious and Charitable diſpoſition, erected upon the ſides of the ſaid Church-yard, but upon Poſts and Pillars, with Cloyſters underneath, toward the Weſt, a Parſonage Houſe, or Manſion, and free dwelling of the Miniſters and Rectors of the ſaid Church, and toward
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95174:64"/>
the Eaſt four Chambers, then called the Prieſts Chambers, now converted into a Tenement or dwelling Houſe, &amp; demiſed for yearly Rent, but the Church-yard is much abridged, and of late fouly defaced; and the lights of the ſaid Parſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage hindered by additions of pieces, to the ſaid ancient Chambers, which ought not to be: In this ancient Church, ſome Citizens of note lie buried.</p>
               <p>Some few Houſes Weſt from this Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Mildred,</hi> is a Priſon-houſe, pertaining to one of the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> and is called the Counter in the <hi>Poultry:</hi> This hath bin there kept, and continued time out of minde; for I have not read of the Original thereof: Weſt from this Counter, was a proper Chappel, called of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> and St. <hi>Mary,</hi> at <hi>Cony-hope</hi> lane end, in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of the ſaid <hi>Mildred,</hi> founded by one named <hi>Jorivirunnes,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; in which Chappel was a <hi>Guild</hi> or Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that might diſpend in Lands better then twenty pounds by year; it was ſuppreſſed by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and purchaſed by one <hi>Thomas Hobſon,</hi> Haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſher: he turned this Chappel into a fair Ware-houſe, and Shops towards the ſtreet, with fair Lodgings over them.</p>
               <p>Then is <hi>Cony-hope lane,</hi> of old time ſo called, of a ſigne of three Coneys, which hung over a Poulterers Stall at the Lanes end; within this Lane ſtandeth the <hi>Grocers Hall,</hi> which Company being of old time called <hi>Pepperers,</hi> were firſt incorporated by the name of <hi>Grocers,</hi> in the year 1345, at which time, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for Cuſtos, or Gardian of their Fraternity, <hi>Richard Oſwin,</hi> and <hi>Lawrence Hallwell,</hi> and twenty Brethren were then taken in, to be of their Society.</p>

               <p>About the year 1429, the <hi>Grocers</hi> had Licence to purchaſe five hundred Marks Land; ſince the which time, near adjoyning unto the <hi>Grocers Hall;</hi> the ſaid Company have builded ſeven proper Houſes, for ſeven aged poor Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people; <hi>Thomas Knowles</hi> Grocer and Maior, gave his Tenement in St. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> Church-yard to the <hi>Grocers,</hi> towards the relief of the poor Brethren in that Company: Alſo <hi>Henry Keeble,</hi> Grocer and Maior, gave to the ſeven Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people, ſix pence weekly for ever; which Penſion is now increaſed by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to ſome of them two ſhillings a peece weekly, and to ſome of them leſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Concerning other Antiquities there, firſt is <hi>Bucklesbury,</hi> ſo called of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and Tenements pertaining to one <hi>Buckle,</hi> who there dwelled, and kept his Courts; this Mannor is ſuppoſed to be the great Stone-Building, yet in part remaining on the South ſide of the ſtreet, which of late time hath been called the <hi>Old Barge,</hi> of ſuch a ſigne hanged out, near the Gate thereof; This Mannor, or great Houſe, hath of long time bin divided, and letten out into many Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and it hath bin a common Speech, that when <hi>Wallbrook</hi> did lie open, Barges were rowed out of the Thames, or towed up ſo far; and therefore the place hath ever ſince bin called the <hi>Old Barge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo, on the North ſide of this ſtreet, directly over againſt the ſaid <hi>Buckles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> was one ancient and ſtrong Tower of Stone; the which Tower, King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third, in the eighteenth of his Reign, called by the name of the <hi>Kings</hi> Houſe, and <hi>Cornet Stoure</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and did appoint his <hi>Exchange of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> there to be kept: In the nine and twentieth, he granted it to <hi>Frydus Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſane,</hi> and <hi>Landus Bardaile,</hi> Marchants of <hi>Luke,</hi> for twenty pound the year; And in the three and twentieth, he gave the ſame Tower to his <hi>Colledge,</hi> or Free Chappel of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> at <hi>VVeſtminster,</hi> by the name of <hi>Cornet Stoure,</hi> at <hi>Bucklesbury</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This whole ſtreet, called <hi>Buckles bury,</hi> on both the ſides throughout, is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of <hi>Grocers,</hi> and <hi>Apothecaries;</hi> toward the Weſt end thereof, on the South ſide, breaketh out one other ſhort lane, called in Records, <hi>Peneritch-ſtreet,</hi> it reacheth but to St. <hi>Sythes</hi> lane; and St. <hi>Sythes</hi> Church, is the fartheſt part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for by the Weſt end of the ſaid Church, beginneth <hi>Needles</hi> Lane, which reacheth to <hi>Sopers</hi> Lane, as is aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>This ſmall Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Syth,</hi> hath alſo an addition of <hi>Bennet Shorne,</hi> (or <hi>Shrog,</hi> or <hi>Shorehog)</hi> for by all theſe names it hath bin called; but the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is <hi>Shorne,</hi> wherefore it ſeemeth to take that name of one <hi>Benedict Shorne;</hi> ſometime a Citizen and <hi>Stock-fiſhmonger</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> a new Builder, repairer, or Benefactor thereof, in the year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, ſo that <hi>Shorne</hi> is but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly called <hi>Shrog,</hi> and more corruptly <hi>Shorehog,</hi> Here are divers Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and among other the Tomb of Sir <hi>Raph VVarren,</hi> Knight, Alderman, twice Lord Maior of <hi>London,</hi> and Marchant of the Staple at <hi>Callis;</hi> with his two Wives, <hi>Anno</hi> 1553.</p>
               <p>Then in <hi>Needlers</hi> Lane, have ye the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Pancraſe,</hi> a proper ſmall Church, but divers rich Pariſhioners therein, and hath had of old time, many liberal Benefactors; But of late, ſuch as (not regarding the Order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,)</hi> the leaſt Bell in their Church being broken, have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſold the ſame for half the value, then put the Pariſh to charge with new caſting: late experience hath proved this to be true, beſides the ſpoil of Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there; This little Church hath alſo ſome handſome Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Then is a part of <hi>Sopers-lane,</hi> turning up to <hi>Cheap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the aſſent of <hi>Stephen Abunden,</hi> Maior, the <hi>Pepperers</hi> in <hi>Sopers</hi> lane, were admitted to ſell all ſuch Spices, and other Wares, as <hi>Grocers</hi> now uſe to ſell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the old name of <hi>Pepperers</hi> in <hi>Sopers</hi> lane, till at length, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, the ſame <hi>Sopers</hi> lane was inhabited by <hi>Cordwayners</hi> and <hi>Curriers,</hi> after that the <hi>Pepperers</hi> or <hi>Grocers</hi> had ſeated themſelves in a more open ſtreet, to wit, in <hi>Buckles bury,</hi> where they now remain: Thus much for the South Wing of <hi>Cheap-Ward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Weſt end of this <hi>Poultry,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Bucklers bury,</hi> beginneth the large ſtreet of Weſt <hi>Cheaping,</hi> a Market place ſo called, which ſtreet ſtretcheth Weſt, till ye come to the little Conduit by <hi>Pauls</hi> Gate, but not all of <hi>Cheap</hi>

Ward. In the Eaſt part of this ſtreet ſtandeth the Great Conduit, of Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, conveyed by Pipes of Lead, under ground from <hi>Paddington,</hi> for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of this City, caſtellated with ſtone, and Ciſterned in Lead, about the year 1285, and again new builded and enlarged by <hi>Thomas Ilam</hi> one of the Sheriffs, 1479.</p>
               <p>About the middeſt of this ſtreet is the <hi>Standard</hi> in <hi>Cheape:</hi> of what Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the firſt foundation is, I have not read. But <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth by his Patent, dated at <hi>Windſor,</hi> the one and twentieth of his Reign (which Patent, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Parliament, 1442) granted Licence to <hi>Thomas Knolles, John Chichle,</hi> and other Executers to <hi>John Wells,</hi> Grocer, ſometime Maior of <hi>London,</hi> with his Goods to make new the high-way, which leadeth from the City of <hi>London,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> before and nigh the Mannor of <hi>Savoy,</hi> parcel of the Dutchey of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> a way then very ruinous, and the Pavement broken, to the hurt and miſchief of the Subjects, which old Pavement, then remaining in that way, within the length of five hundred foot, and all the breadth of the ſame, before and nigh the ſite of the Manner aforeſaid, they were to break up, and with Stone, Gravel, and other ſtuffe, make one other good and ſufficient way for the Commodity of the Subjects; And further, that the <hi>Standard</hi> in <hi>Cheape,</hi> where divers Executions of the Law before time had bin performed; which Standard at that preſent was very ruinous with age; in which there was a Conduit, ſhould be taken down, and another competent Standard of Stone; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a Conduit in the ſame, of new, ſtrongly to be builded, for the Commodity and honour of the City, with the goods of their Teſtator, without interruption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of Executions at the Standard in <hi>Cheape,</hi> we read, that in the year 1293. three men had their right hands ſmitten off there, for reſcuing of a Priſoner, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted by an Officer of the City.</p>
               <p>In the year 1326, the Burgeſſes of <hi>London,</hi> cauſed <hi>Walter Stapleton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exceter,</hi> Treaſurer to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and others, to be beheaded at the Standard in <hi>Cheap</hi> (but this was by <hi>Pauls</hi> Gate.)</p>
               <p>In the year 1351, the ſix and twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, two Fiſhmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were beheaded at the Standard in <hi>Cheape. 1381, Wat Tylar</hi> beheaded, <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Lyons,</hi> and others, there.</p>
               <p>In the year 1399, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, cauſed the Blank Charters, made by <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the ſecond, to be burnt there.</p>
               <p>In the year 1450, <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Rebels, beheaded the Lord <hi>Say</hi> there.</p>
               <p>In the year 1461, <hi>John Davy</hi> had his hand ſtricken off there, becauſe he had ſtricken a man before the Judges at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then next is the great Croſſe in <hi>VVeſt Cheap,</hi> which Croſſe was there erected in the year 1290, by <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; upon occaſion thus, Queen <hi>Elianor</hi> his Wife, dyed at <hi>Hardeby</hi> (a Town near unto the City of <hi>Lincoln)</hi> her Body was brought from thence to <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> and the King in memory of her, cauſed in every place, where her Body reſted by the way, a ſtately Croſſe of Stone to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, with the Queens Image, and Arms upon it, as at <hi>Grantham, VVoborn, Northampton, Stony-stratford Dunstable,</hi> St. <hi>Albones, VValtham, VVeſt-Cheape,</hi> and at <hi>Charing,</hi> from whence ſhe was conveyed to <hi>VVestminster,</hi> and there bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
               <p>This Croſſe in <hi>VVeſt-Cheape,</hi> being like to thoſe other which remain to this day; and being by length of time decayed, <hi>John Hatherley,</hi> Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> procured in the year 1441, Licence of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, to re-edifie the ſame in more beautiful manner, for the honour of the City; and had Licence alſo to take up two hundred Fodder of Lead, for the building thereof, &amp; of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conduits, and a common Granary. This Croſſe was then curiouſly wrought, at the Charges of divers Citizens: <hi>John Fiſher</hi> Mercer, gave ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95174:65"/>
Marks towards it, the ſame was begun to be ſet up 1484, and finiſhed 1486, the ſecond of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh: It was, after, gilt over, in the year 1522, againſt the comming in of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, Emperor. In the year 1553, againſt the Coronation of Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> New burniſhed againſt the Coronation of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth; And again new guilt 1554, againſt the comming in of King <hi>Philip.</hi> Since which time, the ſaid Croſſe having bin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by divers Juries, (or Queſts of <hi>Wardmote)</hi> to ſtand in the high-way, to the let of carriages (as they alledged) but could not have it removed; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that in the year 1581, the twenty one of <hi>June,</hi> in the night, the loweſt Images round about the ſaid Croſſe (being of Chriſt his Reſurrection, of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, and ſuch like) were broken, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced: Proclamation was made, that who ſo would diſcover the doers, ſhould have forty Crowns, but nothing came to light: the Image of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, at that time was robbed of her Son, and her Arms broken, by which ſhe ſtayed him on her knees; her whole body was alſo haled with Ropes, and leſt likely to fall; but in the year 1595. was again faſtened and repaired; and in the year next following, a new miſ-ſhapen Son, as born out of time, all naked, was laid in her Arms; the other Images remaining, broke as afore. But on the Eaſt ſide of the ſame Croſſe, the ſteps being taken thence; under the Image of Chriſts Reſurrection defaced, was ſet up a curious wrought Tabernacle of gray Marble, and in the ſame an Alabaſter Image of <hi>Diana,</hi> and water conveyed from the Thames, prilling from her naked Breſt for a time, but now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed.</p>
               <p>In the year 1599, the Timber of the Croſſe at the top, being rotted within the Lead, the Arms thereof bending, were feared to have fallen, to the harming of ſome people; and therefore the whole Body of the Croſſe, was ſcaffolded about, and the top thereof taken down, meaning in place thereof, to have ſet up a <hi>Pyramis:</hi> but ſome of her Majeſties honourable Councellors, directed their Letters to Sir <hi>Nicholas Moſley,</hi> then Maior, by her Highneſſe expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment concerning the Croſſe, forthwith to be repaired, and placed again as it formerly ſtood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Notwithſtanding, the ſaid Croſſe ſtood headleſs more then a year after, whereupon the ſaid Councellors in great number, meaning not any longer to permit the continuance of ſuch a contempt, wrote to <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rider,</hi> then Maior, requiring him, by vertue of her Highneſs ſaid former direction and Commandement, without any further delay, to accompliſh her Majeſties moſt princely care therein, reſpecting eſpecially, the Antiquity and continuance of that Monument, and ancient Enſign of Chriſtianity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> dated the four and twentieth of <hi>December,</hi> 1600. After this, a Croſſe of Timber was framed, ſet up, covered with Lead, and gilded, the Body of the Croſſe down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, cleanſed of duſt, the Scaffold carryed thence. About twelve nights fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the Image of our Lady was again defaced, by plucking off her Crown, and almoſt her head, taking from her, her naked Child, and ſtabbing her in the Breſt.</p>
               <p>But in the year 1644, during the Reign of the long Parliament, the ſaid Croſſe, by an Ordinance thereof, was utterly demoliſhed; and while the thing was doing, there was a noyſe of Trumpets blew all the while. Upon the utter demolition of this ſo ancient and viſible a Monument, or Ornament of the City of <hi>London</hi> as all Forrainers eſteemed it, it fortuned, that there was another new one, popp'd up in <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> hard by the Standard, <hi>viz.</hi> a high ſquare Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Stone, left in Legacy by one <hi>Ruſſel</hi> a Porter, and well-minded man, with this Diſtichengraven,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>God bleſſe the Porter who great pains doth take,</l>
                  <l>Reſt here, and welcome when thy back doth ake.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Thus much for the <hi>Croſſe</hi> in <hi>Weſt-cheape.</hi> Then at the Weſt end of <hi>West-</hi>Cheap-ſtreet,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95174:66"/>
was ſometimes a Croſſe of Stone called the <hi>Old Croſſe. Ralph Higden</hi> in his <hi>Polychronicon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Walter Stapleton</hi> Biſhop of Exceter, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, was by the Burgeſles of <hi>London</hi> beheaded at this Croſſe, then called the Standard, without the North door of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church; and ſo it is noted in other Writers that then lived. This old Croſſe ſtood and remained at the Eaſt end of the Pariſh Church called St. <hi>Michael</hi> in the corner by <hi>Pauls</hi> Gate, near to the North end of the old Exchange, till the year 1390, the thirteenth of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, in place of which old Croſſe then taken down, the ſaid Church of St. <hi>Michael</hi> was enlarged, and alſo a fair Water-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit builded, about the ninth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, divers Juſtings were made in this ſtreet, betwixt <hi>Sopers</hi> Lane and the great Croſſe, namely, one in the year 1331, about the one and twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> as 'tis obſerved by divers Writers of that time. In the middle of the City of <hi>London,</hi> (ſay they) in a Street called <hi>Cheap,</hi> the Stone pavement, being covered with ſand, that the Horſes might not ſlide, when they ſtrongly ſet their feet to the ground, the King held a Tournement three daies together with the Nobility, valiant men of the Realm, and others, ſome ſtrange Knights; And to the end the beholders might with the better eaſe ſee the ſame, there was a wooden Scaffold erected croſſe the ſtreet, like unto a Tower, wherein Queen <hi>Philip</hi> and many other Ladies, richly attired, and aſſembled from all parts of the Realm, did ſtand to behold the Juſts, but the higher frame in which the Ladies were placed, brake in ſunder, whereby they were (with ſome ſhame) forced to fall down, by reaſon whereof the Knights, and ſuch as were underneath, were grievouſly hurt; wherefore the Queen took great care to ſave the Carpenters from puniſhment, and through her prayers (which ſhe made upon her Knees) pacified the King and Councel, and thereby purchaſed great love of the people. After which time, the King cauſed a ſhed to be ſtrongly made of Stone for himſelf, the Queen, and other States to ſtand on, and there to behold the Juſtings, and other ſhewes, at their pleaſure, by the Church of St. <hi>Mary Bow,</hi> as is ſhewed in <hi>Cordwayner-ſtreet</hi> Ward. Thus much for the High ſtreet of <hi>Cheap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now of the North ſide of Cheap ſtreet and Ward, beginning at the great Conduit, and by St. <hi>Mary Cole Church,</hi> where we left; Next thereunto Weſt-ward, is the <hi>Mercers Chappel,</hi> ſometime an Hoſpital, entituled of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Acon,</hi> or <hi>Acars,</hi> for a Maſter and Brethren. <hi>Militia Hoſpitalis &amp;c,</hi> ſaith the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, the fourteenth year, it was founded by <hi>Thomas Fitz Theohald de Heili,</hi> and <hi>Agnes</hi> his Wife, ſiſter to <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond: they gave to the Maſter and Brethren the Lands with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances, that ſometimes were <hi>Gilbert Beckets,</hi> Father to the ſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> in the which he was born, there to make a Church; There was a Charnel, and a Chappel over it of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen;</hi> This Hoſpital was valued to diſpend two hundred ſeventy ſeven pounds, three ſhillings four pence, ſurrendred the thirtieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, the one and twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> and was ſince purchaſed by the <hi>Mercers,</hi> by means of Sir <hi>Richard Greſham,</hi> and was again ſet open on the Eve of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> 1541, the three and thirtieth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; It is now called the <hi>Mercers Chappel,</hi> therein is kept a free Grammar School, as of old time had been accuſtomed, commanded by Parliament.</p>
               <p>In this Chappel there is every Sunday morning throughout the year a Sermon in the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, beginning about ten a clock.</p>
               <p>Here be many Monuments remaining, but more have been defaced; among others, there is <hi>James Butler</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and Dame <hi>Joane</hi> his Counteſſe, 1428.</p>
               <p>Before this Hoſpital towards the ſtreet, was builded a fair and beautiful Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel arched over with ſtone, and thereupon the Mercers Hall, a moſt curious

pieceor work, Sir <hi>John Allen</hi> Mercer, being ſounder of that Chappel, was there buried, but ſince his Tombe is removed thence into the Body of the Hoſpitall Church, and his Body-room divided into Shops, are letten out for Rent; Theſe Mercers were enabled to be a Company, and to purchaſe Lands to the value of twenty pound the year, the ſeventeenth of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond; they had three Meſſuages and Shops in the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Martins Oteſwich,</hi> in the Ward of <hi>Biſhopſgate,</hi> for the ſuſtentation of the poor, and a Chantry, the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond. <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth in the twelfth of his Reign, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to <hi>Stephen Spilman, W. Marchford</hi> and <hi>John Watild</hi> Mercers by the name of one new <hi>Sildam,</hi> ſhed, or building, with Shops, Cellars, and Edifices what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever appertaining, called <hi>Crownſildes</hi> Scituate in the <hi>Mercery</hi> in Weſt-cheap, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Mary de Arcubus</hi> in <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> to be holden in <hi>Burgage,</hi> as all the City of <hi>London</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Next beyond the <hi>Mercers Chappel,</hi> and their Hall, is <hi>Ironmonger</hi> Lane, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of <hi>Ironmongers</hi> dwelling there.</p>
               <p>In this Lane, is the ſmall Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> called <hi>Pomary,</hi> upon what occaſion I certainly know not; it is ſuppoſed to be of <hi>Apples</hi> growing, where now Houſes are lately builded.</p>
               <p>Farther Weſt, is St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> Lane, ſo called of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> Church, which ſtandeth directly over againſt the North end thereof. Antiquities in this Lane I finde none other, then that among many fair Houſes, there is one large Inne for receipt of travellers, called <hi>Bloſſomes Inne,</hi> but corruptly <hi>Boſomos Inne,</hi> and hath to Sign St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> the Deacon, in a Border of <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> or Flowers.</p>
               <p>Then near to the ſtandard in Cheap, is <hi>Hony-lane,</hi> being very narrow, and ſomewhat dark.</p>
               <p>In this Lane, is the ſmall Pariſh Church called <hi>Alhallowes in Hony-Lane;</hi> There be no Monuments in this Church worth the noting. I find that <hi>John Norman,</hi> Draper, Mayor 1453, was buried there. He gave to the Drapers his Tenements on the North ſide the ſaid Church; they to allow for the Beam light and Lamp, thirteen ſhillings four pence yearly, from this Lane to the Standard. And thus much for Cheap Ward, in the High-ſtreet of Cheap, for it ſtretcheth no farther.</p>
               <p>Now, for the North wing of <hi>Cheap</hi> Ward, have ye <hi>Catte-street,</hi> corruptly called <hi>Catteaten-</hi>ſtreet, which beginneth at the North end of <hi>Ironmonger</hi> Lane, and runneth to the Weſt end of Saint <hi>Lawrence-Church,</hi> as is afore-ſhewed.</p>
               <p>On the North ſide of this ſtreet is the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> wherein the Courts for the City are kept, namely, firſt the Court of <hi>Common-Councel,</hi> ſecond the Court of the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> and his Brethren the Aldermen, third the Court of <hi>Huſtings,</hi> fourth the Court of <hi>Orphanes,</hi> fifth the two <hi>Courts of the Sheriffs,</hi> ſixt the Court of the <hi>Wardmote,</hi> ſeventh the Court of <hi>Hallmote,</hi> eight the Court of <hi>Requeſts,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>the Court of Conſcience,</hi> nine the <hi>Chamberlains Court</hi> for Prentices, &amp; making them free; This <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> ſaith <hi>Robert F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The firſt year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, <hi>John Coventry</hi> &amp; <hi>John Carpenter</hi> Executors to <hi>Richard Whittington,</hi> gave towards the paving of this great Hall twenty pounds and the next year fifteen pounds more to the ſaid pavement, with hard Stone of <hi>Purbeck;</hi> They alſo glaz'd ſome VVindows thereof, and of the Mayors Court,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95174:67"/>
on every which Window, the Arms of <hi>Richard Whittington</hi> are placed. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Mayors Court was laid in the third year of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and of the Porch on the South ſide of the Mayors Court, in the fourth of the ſaid King. Then was builded the Mayors Chamber, and the Councel Chamber, with other Roomes above the ſtaires.</p>
               <p>Having here ſo juſt occaſion, ſpeaking of that former ancient Councel Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which hath continued ſo ever ſince, I cannot but account it expedient (as in no place better fitting) to remember the fair and goodly new Councel Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a worthy Act, and an Honour to the City. The ſaid new Councel Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with a fair Room over the ſame, appointed for a Treaſury, wherein to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Books and Records belonging to the City, and another Room alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the ſame Chamber, reſerved for neceſſary uſe and employment, began to be builded the firſt week after Eaſter, in the time of the Majoralty of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Middleton.</hi> Knight, and Alderman, in the year of our Lord 1614, it was fully finiſhed ſhortly after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1615, at the latter end of the Majoralty of Sir <hi>Thomas Hayes,</hi> Knight and Alderman; But the Lord Mayor, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen his Brethren, kept their firſt Court in the ſaid new Councel Chamber, on the ſeventh day of <hi>November,</hi> in the year of our Lord 1615, Sir <hi>John Jolles</hi> Knight and Alderman, being then Lord Mayor; by whoſe order and direction, the ſaid building was performed, from the firſt beginning thereof, to the finall finiſhing of the ſame, amounting to the charge of 1740 <hi>l.</hi> than which, no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney could be better beſtowed, nor more to the Cities credit and renown.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, a ſtately Porch entring the great Hall, was erected; the front there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of towards the Stouth, being beautified with Images of Srone.</p>
               <p>Now for the Chappel or Colledge of our Lady <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and of <hi>All Saints</hi> by <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> called <hi>London Colledge,</hi> we read, that the ſame was buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about the year 1299, and that <hi>Peter Fanelore, Adam Francis,</hi> and <hi>Henry Frowick</hi> Citizen, gave one Meſſuage with the appurtenances, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Foſter,</hi> to <hi>William Brampton</hi> Cuſtos of the Chauntry, by them founded in the ſaid Chappel, with four Chaplains; and one other Houſe in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Giles</hi> without <hi>Creplegate,</hi> in the ſeven and twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, was given to them.</p>
               <p>Adjoyning to this Chappel on the South ſide, was ſometime a fair and large Library, furniſhed with Books pertaining to the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> and Colledge.</p>
               <p>Theſe Books (as it is ſaid) were in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, ſent for by <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> Lord Protector, with promiſe to be reſtored ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Men laded from thence threeſcore Carts with them, but they were never returned; This Library was builded by the Executors of <hi>R. Whittington,</hi> and by <hi>W. Bury;</hi> on the other ſide, it is now lofted through, and made a Store-houſe for Cloaths,</p>
               <p>South-weſt from this <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> is the fair Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> called, in the <hi>Jury,</hi> becauſe (of old time) many Jewes inhabited there about; This Church is fair and large, and hath divers Monuments.</p>
               <p>In this Church there was the Shank-bone of a man, and alſo a Tooth of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great bigneſs, hanged up for ſhew, in Chains of Iron, upon a Pillar of Stone: the Tooth (being about the bigneſs of a mans fiſt) is long ſince conveyed from thence; the Thigh or Shank-bone, of five and twenty inches in length by the Rule, remaineth yet faſtned to a poſt of Timber, and is not ſo much to be noted for the length, as for the thickneſs, hardneſs, and ſtrength thereof; for when it was hanged on the Stone Pillar, it fretted (with moving) the ſaid Pillar, and was not it ſelf fretted, nor (as ſeemeth) is not yet lightned by remaining dry: but where or when this Bone was firſt found or diſcovered, I have not heard.</p>

               <p>Antiquities therein to be noted, are theſe, Firſt, the ſtreet of <hi>Lothbury, Lathbery,</hi> or <hi>Loadbay;</hi> This ſtreet is poſſeſſed (for the moſt part) by Founders, that caſt Candleſticks, Chafing-diſhes, Spice-Mortars, and ſuch like Copper or Latin workes, and do after turn them with the Foot, and not with the Wheel, to make them ſmoth and bright, with turning and ſcrating, (as ſome do term it) making a loathſome noiſe to the by-paſſers, that have not been uſed to the like, and therefore by them diſdainedly called <hi>Lothbury.</hi> On the South ſide of this ſtreet amongſt the Founders be ſome fair Houſes and large, for Merchants; namely, one that of old time was the Jews <hi>Synagogue,</hi> which was defaced by the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> after that they had ſlain ſeven hundred Jewes, and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the reſidue of their goods, in the year 1262, the forty ſeventh of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.

               <p>The Synagogue being ſo ſuppreſſed, certain Fryars got poſſeſſion thereof; For in the year 1257, (ſaith <hi>Matthew Paris)</hi> there were ſeen in <hi>London</hi> a new Order of Fryars, called <hi>De poenitentia Jeſu,</hi> or <hi>Fratres de ſacco,</hi> becauſe they were apparrelled in ſackcloth, who had their Houſe in <hi>London,</hi> near unto <hi>Alderſgate,</hi> without the gate, and had Licence of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, in the four and twentieth of his Reign, to remove from thence to any other place; and in the fifty ſixt, ſhe gave unto them this <hi>Jews Synagogue.</hi> After which time <hi>Elianor</hi> the Queen, wife to <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, took into her protection, and warranted unto the Prior and Brethren <hi>De poenitentia Jeſu Chriſti,</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the ſaid Land and building in <hi>Cole-Church</hi> ſtreet, in the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Olave</hi> in the Jury and St. <hi>Margaret</hi> in <hi>Loathbury,</hi> by her granted, with conſent of <hi>Stephen de Fulborn,</hi> under-Warden of the Bridge-houſe, and other Brethren of that Houſe, for threeſcore Marks of Silver, which they had received of the ſaid Prior and Brethren of repentance, towards the building of the ſaid Bridge. This Order of Friers gathered many good Schollars, and multiplyed in number exceedingly, untill the Councel of <hi>Lyons;</hi> by the which it was Decreed, that (from that time forth) there ſhould no more Orders of Begging Fryers, be permitted, but only the four Orders, to wit, the <hi>Dominick</hi> or Preachers, the <hi>Minorites</hi> or <hi>Gray Fryers,</hi> and the <hi>Auguſtines:</hi> and ſo from that time the Begging Fryers decreated and fell to nothing.</p>

Now it followed, that in the year 1305, <hi>Robert Fitzwalter,</hi> requeſted and obtained of the ſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, that the ſame Fryers of the <hi>Sack,</hi> might aſſigne to the ſaid <hi>Robert,</hi> their Chappel or Church, of old time, called the Synagogue of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> near adjoyning to the then Manſion houſe of the ſame <hi>Robert,</hi> which was in place where now ſtandeth the <hi>Grocers</hi> Hall, and the ſaid Synagogue was at the North Corner of the old Jury, <hi>Robert Large,</hi> Mercer, Mayor, in the year 1439, kept his Majoralty in this Houſe, and dwelled there until his dying day.</p>
               <p>This Houſe ſtandeth, and is of two Pariſhes, as opening into <hi>Lothbury,</hi> of St. <hi>Margarets</hi> Pariſh, and opening into the <hi>Old Jewry,</hi> of St. <hi>Olaves</hi> Pariſh, The ſaid <hi>Robert Large,</hi> gave liberally to both theſe Pariſhes, but was buried at St. <hi>Olaves.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, grievouſly puniſhed them for corrupting his Coyne. <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt forbad Jewes, and Women to be preſent at his Coronation, for fear of Inchantments; for breaking of which Commandment, many Jews were ſlain, who being aſſembled, to preſent the King with ſome gift, one of them was ſtricken by a Chriſtian, which ſome unruly people perceiving, fell upon them, beat them to their houſes, and brent them therein, or ſlew them at their comming out.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Jewes at <hi>Norwich,</hi> St. <hi>Edmonds bury, Lincoln, Stanford,</hi> and <hi>Lyn,</hi> were robbed and ſpoyled; and at <hi>York,</hi> to the number of five hundred, beſides Women and Children entred a Tower of the Caſtle, profered money to be in ſurety of their lives; but the Chriſtians would not take it; whereupon, they cut the throats of their own Wives and Children, and caſt them over the Walls on the Chriſtians heads; and then, entring the Kings Lodging, they burned both the Houſe and themſelves.</p>
               <p>King <hi>John,</hi> in the <hi>11th</hi> of his Reign, commanded all the Jews, both Men and Women, to be impriſoned, and grievouſly puniſhed, becauſe he would have all their Money; ſome of them gave all they had, and promiſed more, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape ſo many kinds of torments; for every one of them, had one of their eyes at the leaſt plucked out.

                  <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and of <hi>Guyan,</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> to the Biſhop, Juſtices, Sheriffs, Barons, Miniſters, and all his true Lieges of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſendeth greeting: Know ye, that we have granted to the <hi>Weavers</hi> in <hi>London</hi> their <hi>Guuld,</hi> with all the Freedoms, and Cuſtoms that they had in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> my Grandfather, ſo that they intermit none but within the City, of their Craft, but he be of their Guild; neither in <hi>Southwark,</hi> or other places pertaining to <hi>London,</hi> otherwiſe than it was done in the time of <hi>King Henry</hi> my Grand-father; wherefore I will and ſtraightly command, that over all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully they may treat, and have all aforeſaid, as well in peace, free, worſhipful, and wholly, as they had it freer, better, worſhipfuller, and whollier than in the time of <hi>King Henry</hi> my Grand-father, ſo that they yield yearly to me, two Marks of Gold, at the feaſt of St. <hi>Michael.</hi> And I forbid, that any man to them do any Unright, or Diſeaſe, upon pain of ten pound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lower down, is the <hi>Girdlers Hall,</hi> and this is all touching the Eaſt ſide of this Ward.</p>
               <p>On the Weſt ſide, almoſt at the South end thereof, is <hi>Bakewell-Hall,</hi> corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Blackwell-Hall,</hi> concerning the Original whereof, I have heard divers Opinions, which I over-paſſe as Fables, without colour of truth; for though the ſame ſeemed a Building of great Antiquity, yet (in mine Opinion) the Foundation thereof was firſt laid, ſince the Conqueſt of <hi>VVilliam,</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy;</hi> for the ſame was builded upon Vaults of Stone; which Stone was brought from <hi>Cane</hi> in <hi>Normandy:</hi> The like of that in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, builded by <hi>Mauritius</hi> and his Succeſſors, Biſhops of <hi>London;</hi> but that this Houſe hath bin a Temple, or Jewiſh Synagogue (as ſome have fantiſied) I allow not, ſeeing that it had no ſuch form of roundneſs, or other likeneſs; neither had it the form of a Church, for the Aſſembly of Chriſtians, which are builded Eaſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95174:70"/>
and Weſt; but contrariwiſe, the ſame was builded North and South, and in the form of a Noblemans Houſe, and therefore the beſt Opinion (in my judgement) is, that it was (of old time) belonging to the Family of the <hi>Baſſings,</hi> which was in this Realm, a name of great Antiquity and Renown; and that it beares al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the name of that Family, and was called therefore <hi>Baſsings-Haugh,</hi> or <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now how <hi>Bakewell-hall</hi> took that name, is another Queſtion, For which I read, That <hi>Thomas Bakewel</hi> dwelled in this Houſe, in the 36. of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> and that in the 20. of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> the ſaid <hi>King</hi> for the ſum of 50. pounds, which the Mayor and the Communalty, had paid into the <hi>Hanapar,</hi> granted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, ſo much as was in him, to <hi>John Froſh, William Parker,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> (Citizens and Mercers) that they, the ſaid Meſſuage, called <hi>Bakewell-hall,</hi> and one Garden, with the appurtenances, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Michael</hi> of <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings-Haugh,</hi> and of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> in the Jewry of <hi>London,</hi> and one Meſſuage, two Shops, and one Garden, in the ſaid Pariſh of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> which they held of the King in <hi>Burgage,</hi> might give and aſſign to the Mayor and Communalty for ever.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Bakewell-Hall</hi> thus eſtabliſhed, hath bin long ſince imployed, as a week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Market-place for all ſorts of <hi>Woollen Clothes,</hi> broad and narrow, brought from all parts of this Realm, there to be ſold. In the 21. of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Richard Whittington</hi> Mayor; and in the 22. <hi>Drew Barringtine</hi> being Mayor, it was decreed, that no Forraign or ſtranger, ſhould ſell any Woollen-Cloth; but in <hi>Bakewell-hall,</hi> upon pain of forfeiture thereof.</p>
               <p>This Houſe (of late years) growing ruinous, and in danger of falling, <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard May,</hi> Merchant-Taylor, at his deceaſe, gave towards the new building of the outward part thereof, <hi>300l.</hi> upon condition, that the ſame ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, within three years after his Deceaſe; whereupon, the old <hi>Bakewell-Hall,</hi> was taken down, and in the Moneth of <hi>February</hi> next following, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a new, ſtrong, and beautiful Store-houſe being laid, the work thereof was ſo diligently applyed, that within the ſpace of ten moneths after, to the charges of two thouſand five hundred pounds, the ſame was finiſhed, in the year 1588.</p>
               <p>Next beyond this Houſe, are placed divers fair Houſes for Marchants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, till ye come to the back Gate of <hi>Guild-hall;</hi> which Gate, and part of the building within the ſame, is of this Ward: ſome ſmall diſtance beyond this Gate, the <hi>Coopers</hi> have their common Hall.</p>
               <p>Then is the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> called St. <hi>Michael</hi> at <hi>Baſsings-hall,</hi> a proper Church, lately re-edified or new builded.</p>

               <head>The Nineteenth Ward, or Aldermanry of the City of <hi>LONDON,</hi> called <hi>Cripple-gate</hi> Ward.</head>
               <p>THe Next Ward is called of <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> and conſiſteth of divers Streets and Lanes, lying as well without the Gate and Wall of the City, as within. Firſt, within the Wall on the Eaſt part thereof, towards the North; it runneth to the Weſt-ſide of <hi>Baſſing Hall's Ward,</hi> and towards the South, it joyneth to the Ward of <hi>Cheap;</hi> It beginneth at the Weſt end of the St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Church in the Jury, on the North-ſide, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Weſt to a Pumpe, where ſometimes was a well with Buckets, at the South Corner of <hi>Alderman-Bury-Street,</hi> which Street runneth down North to <hi>Gayſpur</hi> Lane, and to London Wall, which Street and Lane are wholly (on both ſides) of this Ward, and ſo be ſome few houſes (on both ſides) from <hi>Gayſpur</hi> Lane, by and againſt the Wall of the City, Eaſt to the Grates, made for the water-courſe of the Channels, and Weſt to the <hi>Creple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now on the South ſide, from over againſt the Weſt End of Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> Church, to the Pumpe, and up <hi>Milke-Street</hi> South unto <hi>Cheap,</hi> which <hi>Milke-Street</hi> is wholly (on both the ſides) of <hi>Cripplegate</hi> Ward, as alſo without the South end of <hi>Milke-Street,</hi> a part of Weſt <hi>Cheap,</hi> to wit, from the Standard to the Croſſe, is all of <hi>Cripplegate</hi> Ward. Then down great <hi>Wood-Street,</hi> which is wholly of this Ward on both the ſides thereof, ſo is little <hi>Wood-Street,</hi> which runneth down to <hi>Creplegate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of this <hi>Wood-Street</hi> be diver Lanes, namely on the Eaſt ſide is <hi>Lad lane,</hi> which runneth Eaſt to <hi>Milke-Street</hi> Corner, down lower in <hi>WoodStreet</hi> is <hi>Love lane,</hi> which lieth by the South ſide of St. <hi>Albans</hi> Church in <hi>Wood-Street,</hi> and runneth down to the <hi>Conduit</hi> in <hi>Aldermanbury-Street;</hi> Lower down in <hi>Wood-Street,</hi> is <hi>Addle-Street,</hi> out of the which runneth <hi>Philip-lane,</hi> down to <hi>London</hi> Wall. Theſe be the Lanes on the Eaſt-ſide.</p>
               <p>On the Weſt ſide of <hi>Wood-Street,</hi> in <hi>Huggon lane,</hi> by the South ſide of St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Church &amp; goeth thorow to <hi>Gutherons lane;</hi> Then lower is <hi>Maiden-lane,</hi> which runneth Weſt to the North End of <hi>Gutherons lane,</hi> and up the ſaid lane on the Eaſt ſide thereof, till againſt <hi>Kery lane,</hi> and back again, then the ſaid <hi>Maiden-lane,</hi> on the North ſide, goeth up to <hi>Staining lane,</hi> &amp; up a part thereof on the Eaſt ſide, to the fartheſt North part of <hi>Haberdaſhers Hall,</hi> and back again to <hi>Wood-Street,</hi> and there lower down is <hi>Silver Street,</hi> which is of this Ward, till ye come to the Eaſt End of St. <hi>Olaves</hi> Church on the South ſide, and to <hi>Monkes-well Street,</hi> on the North ſide, then down the ſaid <hi>Monkes-well Street</hi> on the Eaſt ſide thereof, and ſo to <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> do make the bonds of this Ward within the Walls.</p>
               <p>Of theſe <hi>More-Fields,</hi> you have formerly read, what a Mooriſh rotten ground they were, unpaſſable, but for Cawſways; purpoſely made to that intent; what they were alſo in our own nearer times of Memory, even till Sir <hi>Leonard Halliday</hi> was Lord Major of <hi>London,</hi> Iam very well aſſured many do perfectly remember. And what they are now at this inſtant by the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able coſt and care of this City, and the induſtrious pains and diligence of that worthy Cittizen Mr. <hi>Nicolas Leate,</hi> we all (to our continuall comfort) do evidently behold.</p>
               <p>Then to turn back again, through the ſaid <hi>Poſternlane</hi> to <hi>More-lane,</hi> which
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:95174:71"/>
                  <hi>More-lane,</hi> with all the Allies and buildings there, is of this Ward.

               <p>Then is <hi>Beech lane</hi> before ſpoken of; the Eaſt ſide of the <hi>Red-Croſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Barbican-Street,</hi> more than halfe thereof toward <hi>Alderſgate-Street.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the Antiquitie of this Old <hi>Aldermans-Bury</hi> or Court, I have not read other, then that <hi>Richard Kenery,</hi> one of the Sheriffs of <hi>London;</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, which was in the year of Chriſt 1189. gave to the Church of Saint <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Oſney</hi> by <hi>Oxford,</hi> certain grounds and rents in <hi>Alderman-Bury,</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as appeareth by the Regiſter of that Church, as is alſo entered into the <hi>Huſtings</hi> of the Guild-Hall in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Old Bery, Court, or Hall continued, and the courts of the Major and Aldermen were continually holden there, untill the New <hi>Bery-Court,</hi> or Guild-Hall that now is, was builded and finiſhed, which Hall was firſt begun to be founded in the year 1411, and was not fully finiſhed in twenty years after, The ruines of the Old Court Hall in <hi>Alderman-Bury-Street</hi> yet appear which of late hath bin imployed as a Carpenters yard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then is the pariſh Church of St. <hi>Mary Aldermanbury,</hi> a fair Church, with a Church-yard and Cloyſter adjoyning. In the which Cloyſter is hanged and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Shanke-bone of a man (as is ſaid) very great, and larger by three inches and a half, than that which hangeth in St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Church in the <hi>Jury,</hi> for it is in length twenty Eight inches and a half of aſſiſe, but not ſo hard and Steely, like as the other; for the ſame is Leight, and ſomewhat pory and ſpongy. This bone is ſaid to be found amongſt the bones of men removed from the Charnell houſe of <hi>Pauls,</hi> or rather from the Cloyſter of <hi>Pauls</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Beneath this Church have ye <hi>Gayſpur-lane,</hi> which runneth down to <hi>London</hi> Wall, as is afore ſhewed. In this lane, at the North end thereof, was (of old time) a houſe of <hi>Nuns,</hi> which houſe being in great decay <hi>William Elſing,</hi> Mercer, in the year of Chriſt 1329. the third of <hi>Edward</hi> of the third, began in place thereof the foundation of an Hoſpitall, for ſuſtentation of one hundred blind men: Towards the erection whereof, he gave his two houſes in the Pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of St. <hi>Alphage</hi> and our Bleſſed <hi>Lady</hi> in <hi>Aldermanbury</hi> Near <hi>Cripplegate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This houſe was after called a <hi>Priory</hi> or <hi>Hoſpitall</hi> of St. <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Virgin,</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the year 1332. by <hi>W. Elſing</hi> for <hi>Canons</hi> Regular, the which <hi>W.</hi> became the firſt Prior there.</p>
               <p>In the ſame place where the aforeſaid <hi>Elſing</hi> Spittle and priory, were formerly ſcituated, there is now newly erected a Colledge for the Clergy of <hi>London,</hi> and Liberties thereof, called by the name of <hi>Sion-Colledge:</hi> And Almes-houſes for twenty poor people, ten men and ten women.</p>
               <p>This was done by the eſpeciall care and paines of Mr. <hi>John Simſon,</hi> Rector of St. <hi>Olaves</hi> Hart-Street <hi>London,</hi> one of the Executors of the laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. <hi>Thomas White,</hi> Doctor in Divinity, Vicar of S. <hi>Dunſtans</hi> in the Weſt, and one of the Canons Reſidentiary of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church <hi>London:</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e-named <hi>Thomas White,</hi> (beſides ſundry ſums of money, and great yearly Revenues given by him to pious and Charitable uſes in divers places) gave three thouſand pound to purchaſe and build the aforeſaid Colledge for the uſe of the Clergy, and Almes-houſes for the twenty poor people aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>He gave alſo unto the ſaid Colledge, and Almes-houſes, a hundred ſixty pound, <hi>per annum</hi> for ever; whereof there is a hundred twenty pound yearly allowed for the maintenance of the poor Almes-men and women: And forty pound yearly for four dinners for the Clergy, who are to have four Latine Sermons in the year one every quarter, and upon theſe dayes are to dine together in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:95174:71"/>
In the ſame Colledge the forenamed <hi>John Simſon</hi> did in his life time, at his own proper Coſts and Charges, build a very faire and ſpacious Library, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, a hundred twenty one foot in length, within the Walls, and above twenty five foot in breadth. And hath furniſhed it with Wainſcot, Stalls, Desks, Seats, and other Neceſſary and uſefull Ornaments befitting the place.</p>
               <p>To this Library there have been already divers bountifull, and well diſpoſed Benefactors, who have given large ſums of money towards the furniſhing of it with Books.</p>
               <p>Then is there the Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Alphage;</hi> The principall Ile of this Church towards the North, was pulled down, and a frame of four houſes ſet up in the place: the other part, from the Steeple upward, was converted into a Pariſh Church of S. <hi>Alphage;</hi> and the Pariſh Church which ſtood near unto the Wall of the City by <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> was pulled down; the plot thereof made a Carpenters Yard, with Saw-pits.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hoſpitall</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>Prior,</hi> and Canons houſe, with other Lodgings were made a dwelling houſe, the Church-Yard is a Garden plot, and a faire Gallery on the Cloyſter; the Lodgins for the poor are tranſlated into ſtabling for horſes.</p>
               <p>Now we will return to <hi>Milk-Street</hi> ſo call'd of Milke ſold there at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. In this <hi>Milk-Street,</hi> is a ſmall Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delen,</hi> which hath of late years been repaired. <hi>William Brown,</hi> Mayor 1513. gave to this Church fourty pounds, and was buried there.</p>
               <p>Then Next is <hi>Wood-Street,</hi> by what reaſon ſo called, I know not. True it is, that (of old time) according to a Decree made in the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, the houſes of <hi>London</hi> were builded of Stone, for defence of fire, which kind of building was uſed for two hundred years or more, but of latter time, for the winning of ground, taken down; and houſes of Timber were ſet up in their place. It ſeemeth therefore that this Street hath been of the latter build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all of timber, (for ſcarce one houſe of ſtone hath been known there) and therefore called <hi>Wood-Street:</hi> otherwiſe it might take the name of ſome buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or owner thereof.</p>
               <p>On the Eaſt ſide of this Street is one of the Priſon-houſes, pertaining to the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and is called the <hi>Compter</hi> in <hi>Wood-Street,</hi> which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to be a priſon-houſe in the year 1555. And on the Eve of S. <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangell, the priſoners that lay in the Compter in <hi>Bread-Street,</hi> were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to this Compter in <hi>Wood-Street.</hi> Beneath this Compter in <hi>Lad-lane,</hi> or <hi>Ladle Hall,</hi> for ſo I find it of Record, in the pariſh of Saint <hi>Michaell Wood-Street;</hi> and Beneath that is <hi>Love lane,</hi> ſo called of <hi>wantons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this lane is the Ancient pariſh Church of S. <hi>Albans.</hi> One note of the great Antiquity of it, is the name, by which it was at firſt dedicated to St. <hi>Albanus,</hi> the firſt Martyr of England. Another Character of the Antiquity of it, is to be ſeen in the manner of the turning of the Arches in the windows, and heads of the Pillars. A third Note, appears in the <hi>Roman</hi> Bricks, here and there inlayed amongſt the ſtones of the building. Very probable it is, that this Church is at leaſt of as ancient a ſtanding as King <hi>Aldelſtane</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> who, as the Tradition ſayes, had his houſe at the Eaſt end of this Church. This Kings houſe, having adoor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo into <hi>Adel-Street</hi> in this Pariſh, gave name, as 'tis thought, unto the ſaid <hi>Adel-Street,</hi> which in all Evidences to this day, is written King <hi>Adel-Street.</hi> One great ſquare Tower of this Kings houſe ſeems yet remaining, to be ſeen at the North corner of <hi>Love lane,</hi> as you come from <hi>Alderman-bury;</hi> which Tower is of the very ſame ſtone and manner of building with S. <hi>Albans</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>There is alſo (but without any outward Monument) the head of <hi>James</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>Scots</hi> of that name, ſlain at <hi>Flodden</hi> field, and buried here by this occaſion: After the Battell, the body of the ſaid King being found, was cloſed
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:95174:72"/>
in lead, and conveyed from thence to <hi>London,</hi> and ſo to the Monaſtery of <hi>Sheine</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> where it remained for a time, in what order I am not certain: But ſince the diſſolution of that houſe, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Henry Gray</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> being lodged and keeping houſe there, the ſame body was to be ſhew'd, ſo lapped in lead, cloſe to the head and body, thrown into a waſte room amongſt the old timber, lead, &amp; other rubble; ſince which time, the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men there (for their fooliſh pleaſure) hewed off his head; and <hi>Launcelot Young,</hi> Maſter Glaſier to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> feeling a ſweet ſavour to come from thence, and ſeeing the ſame dried from all moiſture, and yet the form remaining, with the hair of the head and beard red, brought it into <hi>London,</hi> to his houſe in <hi>Wood-ſtreet,</hi> where (for a time) he kept it for the ſweetneſſe; but in the end, cauſed the Sexton of that Church, to bury it amongſt other bones, taken out of their Charnell, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There are divers Records of a houſe in <hi>Wood-ſtreet,</hi> then called <hi>Black Hall,</hi> but no man at this day can tell thereof. On the North ſide of this Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaels</hi> Church is <hi>Maiden-lane,</hi> now ſo called, but (of old time) <hi>Ingene-lane,</hi> or <hi>Inglane.</hi> In this Lane the <hi>Wax-Chaundlers</hi> have their Common Hall, on the the South ſide thereof; and the <hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> have their Hall on the North ſide, at <hi>Stayning-lane</hi> end. This Company of the <hi>Haberdaſhers,</hi> or <hi>Hurrers,</hi> of old time ſo called, were incorporated a Brotherhood of St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> the twenty ſixth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and ſo confirmed by <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth of his Reign; the <hi>Cappers</hi> and <hi>Hat-Merchants,</hi> or <hi>Hurrers,</hi> being one Company of <hi>Haberdaſhers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Down lower in <hi>VVood-street</hi> is <hi>Silver-ſtreet</hi> (I think, of Silver-Smiths dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there) in which be divers fair houſes.</p>
               <p>And on the North ſide thereof is <hi>Monks-well</hi> ſtreet, ſo called, of a well, at the North end thereof, where the Abbot of <hi>Garendon</hi> had an home or Cell, called <hi>Saint James</hi> in the wall by <hi>Cripple-gate,</hi> and certain Monks of their houſe were Chaplains there; wherefore the Well (belonging to that Cell or Hermitage) was called <hi>Monks-well,</hi> and the ſtreet of the well, <hi>Monks-well ſtreet.</hi> The Eaſt ſide of this ſtreet down againſt <hi>London</hi> wall, and the South ſide thereof to <hi>Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-gate,</hi> be of <hi>Cripple-gate</hi> Ward, as is afore-ſhewed.</p>
               <p>In this ſtreet, by the corner of <hi>Monks-well ſtreet,</hi> is the <hi>Bowyers Hall.</hi> On the Eaſt ſide of <hi>Monks-well ſtreet,</hi> be convenient Almſ-houſes, <hi>twelve</hi> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, founded by Sir <hi>Ambroſe Nicholas,</hi> Salter, Maior, 1575. wherein he placed twelve poor and aged people rent-free, having each of them ſeven pence the week, and once the yeer each of them five ſacks of <hi>Charcoals,</hi> and one quartern of one hundred of <hi>Faggots,</hi> of his gift for ever.</p>
               <p>On the North ſide of the way, turning towards <hi>Cripple-gate,</hi> and even upon, or cloſe to <hi>London</hi> wall, (as it were) are certain new erected <hi>Almeſ-houſes,</hi> ſix in number, of the coſt and gift of Mr. <hi>Robert Rogers,</hi> Leather-Seller, and very good maintenance allowed (for ever) to ſuch people as are appointed to dwell in them.</p>
               <p>Then, in little <hi>VVood-ſtreet,</hi> be ſeven proper Chambers in an Alley on the Weſt ſide, founded for ſeven poor people, therein to dwell rent-free, by <hi>Henry Barton,</hi> Skinner, Maior, 1516.</p>
               <p>Now without the Poſtern of <hi>Cripple-gate,</hi> firſt is the Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> a very fair and large Church, lately repaired, after that the ſame was burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the yeer 1545, the thirty ſeventh of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, by which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, the Monuments of the dead in this Church are very few.</p>
               <p>In <hi>VVhite Croſſe-ſtreet</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth builded a fair houſe, and founded there a <hi>Brotherhood</hi> of S. <hi>Giles</hi> to be kept, which houſe had ſometime been an Hoſpitall of the <hi>French</hi> Order, by the name of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> without <hi>Cripple-gate.</hi> In the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, the King having the Juriſdiction, and pointing a <hi>Cuſtos</hi> thereof, for the Precinct of the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> &amp;c. which Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

               <p>One Alley, of divers Tenements, over againſt the North wall of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> Church-yard, was appointed to be <hi>Almſ-houſes,</hi> for the poor, wherein they dwelled rent-free, and otherwiſe were releeved; but the ſaid Brotherhood was ſuppreſſed by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, ſince which time, Sir <hi>John Greſham,</hi> Maior, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the lands, and gave part thereof to the maintenance of a <hi>Free School,</hi> which he had founded at <hi>Holt,</hi> a Market-town in <hi>Norfolk.</hi>

               <p>In <hi>Red Croſſe-ſtreet,</hi> on the Weſt ſide from S. <hi>Giles</hi> Church-yard, up to the ſaid Croſſe, be many fair houſes builded outward, with divers Alleys, turning into a large plot of ground, of old time called the <hi>Jews Garden,</hi> as being the only place appointed them in <hi>England,</hi> wherein to bury their dead, till the year 1177, the twenty fourth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, that it was permitted them (after long ſuit to the King and Parliament at <hi>Oxford)</hi> to have a ſpeciall place aſſigned them in every quarter where they dwelled.</p>

               <p>In <hi>Britaine</hi> ſtreet, which took that name of the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> Lodging there, is one proper Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Buttolph;</hi> In which Church was ſometime a Brotherhood of St. <hi>Fabian</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> founded in the year 1377, the fifty one of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; and confirmed by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth in the ſixth of his Reign.

The inner Body of this Croſſe was Oak, the next Cover was lead, and the outermoſt was of Copper red varniſhed. The Bole and Eagle, or Cock, were of Copper, and gilt alſo. The height of the Steeple was 520 Foot, whereof the Stone-work was 260 Foot, and the Spire was likewiſe 260 Foot. The length of the whole Church is 240 Taylors yards, which make 720 Foot.

               <p>In the year 1561. the fourth of <hi>June,</hi> betwixt the houres of three and four of the Clock in the Afternoon, the great Spire of the Steeple of St. <hi>Pauls Church,</hi> was fired by lightening, which brake forth (as it ſeemed) two or three yards beneath the foot of the Croſſe, and from thence it burnt downward the ſpire to the Battlements, Stone-work, and Bells, ſo furiouſly, that within the ſpace of four houres, the ſame Steeple, with all the roofs of the Church, were conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to the great ſorrow, and perpetual remembrance of the beholders; After this miſchance, the Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> directed her Letters to the Maior, willing him to take order for ſpeedy repairing of the ſame; And ſhe, of her gracious diſpoſition, for the furtherance thereof, did preſently give, and deliver in gold, one thouſand Marks, with a Warrant for a thouſand Loads of Timber, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of her Woods, or elſe-where.</p>
               <p>The Citizens alſo gave firſt a great Benevolence, and after that three fifteens to be ſpeedily paid.</p>

               <p>Then in <hi>Thames</hi> ſtreet, of this Ward, and on the North ſide over againſt the Queens <hi>Hith,</hi> is the Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Church, but all the Monuments therein are defaced.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Then is a ſmall Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> called <hi>parva,</hi> or little, near unto <hi>Pauls</hi> Wharf. In this Church no Monuments do remain.</p>

               <p>Then is <hi>Queen-hithe,</hi> a large receptacle for Ships, Lighters, Barges, and ſuch other Veſſels. Touching the Antiquity and uſe of this Gate and Hithe, firſt I find, that the ſame belonged to one named <hi>Edred,</hi> and was then called <hi>Edreds Hith,</hi> which ſince falling into the hands of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> it was by his Charter confirmed to <hi>William de Ypre,</hi> the Farm thereof in Fee and in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage; <hi>William de Ypre,</hi> gave i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Edreds Hith,</hi> after the foreſaid Grant, came again to the Kings hands, by what means I have not read, but it pertained unto the Queen, and therefore was called <hi>Ripa Reginae,</hi> the Queens Bank, or <hi>Queens-Hith,</hi> and great profit thereof was made to her uſe, as may appear by this which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, in the ninth of his Reign, commanded the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> to arreſt the Ships of the Cinque-Ports on the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and to compell them to bring their Corn to no other place, but to the <hi>Queens Hith</hi> only. In the eleaventh of his Reign, he charged the ſaid Conſtable, to diſtrain all Fiſh offered to be ſold in any place of this City, but at the <hi>Queens Hith.</hi> Moreover, in the eight and twentieth of his Reign, an Inquiſition was made before <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Provoſt of <hi>Beverley, Henry</hi> of <hi>Bath,</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Caxton,</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices <hi>Itinerantes,</hi> ſitting in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> touching the Cuſtoms of <hi>Queen-hith,</hi> obſerved in the year laſt before the Wars between the King and his Father, and the Barons of <hi>England,</hi> and of old Cuſtoms of other times, and what Cuſtoms had been changed, at what time the Tax and Payment of all things coming thither, and between <hi>VVoore-path,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nede Hith,</hi> were found and ſeized, according to the old Order, as well Corne and Fiſh, as of other things; All which Cuſtomes were as well to be obſerved in the part of <hi>Down-gate,</hi> as in <hi>Queen-Hith,</hi> for the Kings uſe, when alſo it was found, that the Corn arriving between the Gate of Guild Hall, of the Merchants of <hi>Colleyne,</hi> and the Soke of the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (for he had a Houſe near unto the <hi>Black-Fryers)</hi> was
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:95174:81"/>
not to be meaſured by any other quarter, than by that of the Queens Soke.</p>
               <p>Next adjoyning to this <hi>Queen-hith,</hi> on the Weſt ſide thereof, is <hi>Sult-Wharf,</hi> named of Salt taken up, meaſured, and ſold there.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Stew</hi> Lane, of a Stew, or Hot-houſe there kept.</p>
               <p>After that is <hi>Timber-Hith,</hi> or Timber ſtreet, ſo called, of Timber, or Boards, there taken up, and wharfed; it is in the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Mary Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Hith,</hi> as we read in the fifty ſix of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and in the ninth of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Then is <hi>Brookes Wharfe,</hi> and <hi>Broken Wharfe,</hi> a Water-gate or Key, ſo called of being broken and fallen down into the <hi>Thames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this <hi>Broken-VVharfe</hi> remaineth one large old building of Stone, with Arched Gates; which Meſſuage, as we finde, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the forty three year, pertained unto <hi>Hugh de Bigot,</hi> and in the eleaventh of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, to <hi>Thomas Brotherton,</hi> the Kings Brother, Earle of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> Marſhall of <hi>England,</hi> in the eleaventh of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, to <hi>John Mowbray</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Within the Gate of this Houſe (now belonging to the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don)</hi> is lately, to wit, in the year 1594. and 1595, builded one large Houſe, of great height, called an Engine, made by <hi>Bevis Bulmar,</hi> Gentleman, for the conveying and forcing of Thames water, to ſerve in the middle and Weſt parts of the City; the ancient great Hall of this Meſſuage, is yet ſtanding, and pertaining to a great Brew-Houſe for Beere.</p>
               <p>Weſt from this is <hi>Trigge</hi> Lane, going down to the <hi>Thames.</hi> Next is called <hi>Boſſe-</hi>Lane of a Boſſe of water, like unto that of <hi>Belingſgate,</hi> there placed by the Executors of <hi>Richard Whittington.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then is one great Meſſuage, ſometime belonging to the Abbots of <hi>Chartſey,</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and was their Inne, wherein they were lodged when they repaired to the City: it is now called <hi>Sandle</hi> Houſe, by what reaſon we have not heard; ſome think the Lord <hi>Sands</hi> hath been lodged there.</p>

               <p>Then is there a great <hi>Brew-houſe,</hi> and <hi>Puddle-Wharfe,</hi> a Water-gate into the Thames, where Houſes uſe to be watered, and therefore being filled with their trampling, &amp; made puddle-like, as alſo of one <hi>Puddle</hi> dwelling there, it is call'd <hi>Puddle Wharfe.</hi> Then is there a Lane between the Black Fryars and the Thames, called in the twenty ſix of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Caſtle-lane.</hi> This Ward aſcendeth up by the Eaſt VVall of the <hi>Black-Fryers,</hi> to the South VVeſt end of <hi>Creed Lane</hi> where it endeth on that ſide.

Then alſo were Orders deviſed for relief of the poor, the Inhabitants were all called to their Pariſh Churches, where, by Sir <hi>Richard Dobbs,</hi> then Mayor, their ſeveral <hi>Aldermen,</hi> or other grave Citizens, they were by eloquent Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons perſwaded, how great, and how many Commodities would enſue unto them, and their City, if the poor of divers ſorts, which they named, were taken from out their ſtreets, Lanes, and Alleys, and were beſtowed and provided for in Hoſpitals abroad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore was every man moved, liberally to grant (what they would impart) towards the preparing and furniſhing of ſuch Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals; and alſo, what they would contribute weekly towards their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for a time, which (they ſaid) ſhould not be paſt one year, or twain, until they were better furniſhed of endowment; To make ſhort, every man granted liberally, according to his ability.

Then is <hi>Furnivals</hi> Inne, now an Inne of <hi>Chancery,</hi> but ſometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Sir <hi>William Furnival</hi> Knight, and <hi>Thomaſin</hi> his Wife, who had in <hi>Holdbourne</hi> two Meſſuages, and thirteen Shops, as appeareth by Record of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, in the ſixth of his Reign.</p>
               <p>Now again from <hi>Newgate,</hi> on the left hand, or South ſide, lyeth the <hi>Old Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,</hi> which runneth down by the Wall, upon the Ditch of the City, called <hi>Houndſditch,</hi> to <hi>Ludgate:</hi> we have not read how this ſtreet took that name; but it is like to have riſen of ſome Court of old time there kept; and we finde that in the year 1356. the thirty four of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, the Tenement and ground upon <hi>Houndſditch,</hi> between <hi>Ludgate</hi> on the South, and <hi>Newgate</hi> on the North, was appointed to <hi>John Cambridge,</hi> Fiſhmonger, Chamberlain of <hi>London,</hi> whereby it ſeemeth, that the Chamberlains of <hi>London,</hi> have there kept their Courts, as now they do in the <hi>Guild-hall:</hi> and till this day, the Mayor and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this City, keep their Seſſions in a part thereof, now called the <hi>Seſſions Hall,</hi> both for the City of <hi>London,</hi> and Shire of <hi>Middleſex;</hi> over againſt the which Houſe, on the right hand, turneth down St. <hi>Georges</hi> Lane, towards <hi>Fleet</hi> Lane.</p>
               <p>In this St. <hi>Georges</hi> Lane, on the North ſide thereof, remaineth yet an old wall of ſtone, incloſing a peece of ground up <hi>Sea-cole-Lane,</hi> wherein (by report) ſometime ſtood an Inne of <hi>Chancery;</hi> which Houſe being greatly decayed, and ſtanding remote from other Houſes of that Profeſſion, the Company removed to a Common Hoſtery, called of the ſigne, our <hi>Lady Inne,</hi> not far from <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Inne,</hi> which they procured from Sir <hi>John Fincox,</hi> Lord chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench; and ſince, have held it of the owners, by the name of the <hi>New Inne,</hi> paying therefore ſix pounds Rent, by the year, as Tenants at their own will, for more (as is ſaid) cannot be gotten of them, and much leſſe, will they be put from it.</p>
               <p>Beneath this Saint <hi>Georges</hi> Lane, is the Lane called <hi>Fleet-lane,</hi> winding South by the Priſon of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> into <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> by <hi>Fleet-bridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next out of the high ſtreet, turneth down a Lane, called the <hi>Little Bayly,</hi> which runneth down to the Eaſt end of St. <hi>Georges</hi> Lane.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Sea-cole-lane,</hi> I think, called <hi>Limeburners</hi> Lane, of burning Lime there with Sea-cole; For we read in Record of ſuch a Lane, to have bin in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> and there yet remaineth in this Lane, an Alley, called <hi>Lime-burners Alley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Near unto this <hi>Sea-cole-lane,</hi> in the turning towards <hi>Oldbourne-</hi>Conduit, is <hi>Turn-again-lane,</hi> or rather, as in a Record of the fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Wind-again-lane,</hi> for that it goeth down Weſt to <hi>Fleet Dike,</hi> from whence, men muſt turn again the ſame way they came, for there it is ſtopped.</p>

Then the high ſtreet turneth down <hi>Snow-hill,</hi> to <hi>Holdbourne</hi> Conduit, and from thence, to <hi>Ouldbourn-bridge;</hi> beyond the which Bridge, on the left hand, is Shooe-lane, by the which, men paſſe from <hi>Ouldbourne</hi> to <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> by the Conduit there.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Shooe-lane,</hi> on the left hand, is one old Houſe, called <hi>Oldbourn-Hall,</hi> it is now letten out into divers Tenements.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, at the very corner, ſtandeth the Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Andrew.</hi>

               <p>From this Church to St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> up <hi>Oldbourn-hill,</hi> be divers fair builded Houſes; amongſt the which, on the left hand, there ſtandeth three Inns of <hi>Chancery,</hi> whereof the firſt, adjoyning unto <hi>Crook-horn-Alley,</hi> is called <hi>Thavies Inne,</hi> and ſtandeth oppoſite to <hi>Ely</hi> Houſe.</p>
               <p>Then is <hi>Fewter-lane,</hi> which ſtretcheth South into <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> by the Eaſt end of St. <hi>Dunſtances Church,</hi> and is ſo called of <hi>Fewters</hi> (or idle people) lying there, as in a way leading to <hi>Gardens;</hi> but the ſame is now of later years, on both ſides builded thorow with many fair Houſes: and in the waſt grounds and Gardens, betwixt <hi>Shooe-lane</hi> and <hi>Fewter-lane;</hi> there are now many fair convenient Houſes, built by the Company of the <hi>Goldſmiths;</hi> as alſo a ſtreet called <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> betwixt <hi>Alderſgate</hi> and <hi>Redcroſſe-ſtreet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beyond this <hi>Fewters</hi> Lane, is <hi>Baynards</hi> Inne, aliàs <hi>Mackworths</hi> Inne, which is of the <hi>Chancery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then is <hi>Staple-Inne</hi> alſo of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> but whereof ſo named, I am igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; the ſame of late, is (for a great part thereof) fair builded, and not a little augmented; And then at the Barres endeth this Ward, without <hi>Newgate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Without <hi>Ludgate,</hi> on the right hand, or North ſide, from the ſaid Gate, lyeth the <hi>Old Bayley,</hi> as I ſaid, then the high ſtreet, called <hi>Ludgate-hill,</hi> down to <hi>Fleet-</hi>Lane; in which Lane ſtandeth the <hi>Fleet,</hi> a Priſon-houſe, ſo called of the Fleet, or water running by it, and ſometime flowing about it, but now vaulted over.</p>
               <p>Then alſo, againſt the South end of <hi>Shooe-lane,</hi> ſtandeth a fair Water-Conduit, whereof <hi>William Eaſtfield,</hi> ſometime Mayor, was Founder; for the Mayor and Commonalty of <hi>London,</hi> being poſſeſſed of a Conduit Head, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Springs of water gathered thereunto, in the Pariſh of <hi>Padington,</hi> and the water conveyed from thence, by Pipes of Lead, towards <hi>London</hi> unto <hi>Teyborn,</hi> where it had lain by the ſpace of ſix years, and more: the Executors of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Eaſtfield,</hi> obtained Licence of the Mayor and Communalty, for them, in the year 1453. with the Goods of Sir <hi>William,</hi> to convey the ſaid Water, firſt, in Pipes of Lead, into a Pipe, begun to be laid beſides the great Conduit Head at <hi>Maribone,</hi> which ſtretcheth from thence unto a ſeparall, late before made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chappel of <hi>Rounſeval,</hi> by <hi>Charing-Croſſe,</hi> and no further; and then from thence, to convey the ſaid water into the City, and there to make Receit, or Receits for the ſame, unto the Common-weale of the Commonalty; to wir, the poor to drink, the rich to dreſſe their Meats, which water was by them brought thus into <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> to a Standard which they had made and finiſhed 1471.</p>
               <p>From this Conduit up to <hi>Fewters</hi> Lane, and further, is the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Dunstane,</hi> called in the Weſt, (for difference from Saint <hi>Dunſtane</hi> in the Eaſt.)</p>
               <p>Next beyond this Church, is <hi>Cliffords Inne,</hi> ſometime belonging to <hi>Robert Clifford,</hi> by gift of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond.</p>

And then next was ſometime the Houſe of the <hi>converted Jews,</hi> founded by King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, in place of a Jews Houſe to him forfeited, in the year 1233. and the ſeventeenth of his Reign; who builded there for them, a fair Church, now uſed, and called the Chappel; for the Cuſtody of Rolles and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Chancery, it ſtandeth not far from the old Temple and the new; in thee which Houſe, all ſuch Jews and Infidels, as were converted to the Chriſtian Faith, were ordained and appointed (under an honeſt rule of life) ſufficient maintenance: whereby it came to paſſe, that in ſhort time, there were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great number of Converts which were baptized, inſtructed in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, and there lived under a learned Chriſtian, appointed to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them; ſince the which time, to wit, in the year 1290. all the Jews in <hi>England,</hi> were baniſhed out of the Realm, whereby the number of Converts in this place was decayed, and therefore in the year 1377. this Houſe was annexed by Patent, to <hi>William Burſtall</hi> Clark, <hi>Cuſtos Rotulorum,</hi> or Keeper of the Rolls of the Chancery, by <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in the fifty one year of his Reign; and this firſt Maſter of the Rolls was ſworn in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> at the <hi>Table of Marble-ſtone;</hi> ſince the which time, that Houſe hath bin commonly called the <hi>Rolls in Chancery-Lane.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Next is <hi>Bride-lane,</hi> and therein <hi>Bridewell,</hi> of old time the Kings Houſe; for the Kings of this Realm have bin there lodged, and till the ninth of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the Courts were kept in the Kings Houſe, whereſoever he was lodged, as may appear by ancient Records, whereof there are many; and for example, have ſet forth one in the Chapter, or Towers and Caſtles.</p>

               <p>Next is the <hi>New Temple,</hi> ſo called, becauſe the <hi>Templers,</hi> before the building of this Houſe, had their Temple in <hi>Oldbourn:</hi> This houſe was founded by the <hi>Knights Templers</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond: and the ſame was dedicated to <hi>God,</hi> and our <hi>Bleſſed Lady,</hi> by <hi>Heraclius,</hi> Patriark of the Church, called the Holy <hi>Reſurrection in Jeruſalem,</hi> in the year of Chriſt, 1185.</p>
               <p>Many Parliaments and great Councels have been there kept, as may appear by our Hiſtories.</p>

After <hi>Aimer de Valence</hi> (ſaith ſome) <hi>Hugh Spencer</hi> (uſurping the ſame) held it during his life; by whoſe death, it fell again to the hands of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; but in the mean time, to wit, 1324. by a Councel holden at <hi>Vienna,</hi> all the Lands of the Templers (leſt the ſame ſhould be put to prophane uſes) were given to the <hi>Knights Hoſpitalers,</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> called Saint <hi>John of Jeruſalem;</hi> which Knights had put the <hi>Turks</hi> out of the Ile of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and after, wan upon the ſaid Turk, daily for a long time.</p>

               <p>Alſo, it was provided, that the ſaid Letters Patents, ſhould not be prejudicial to the Offices of the great Maſter or Steward of the Kings Houſhold, within the Borough and Precincts aforeſaid, to be executed while the ſame Borough and Precincts ſhould be within the <hi>Verge;</hi> Nor to <hi>John Gates</hi> Knight, one of the Gentlemen of the Kings Privy Chamber, concerning any Lands, Tenements, Offices, Profits, Franchiſes, or Liberties to him granted during his life, by the ſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, or by his Father King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth.</p>
               <p>About the ſpace of a Month after the ſaid Borough of <hi>Southwark</hi> was ſo granted by King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, to the Mayor Communalty and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and that they by force of the ſaid Letters Patents, ſtood charged with the Ordering, Survey, and Government of the ſame Borough, and of all the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:95174:88"/>
Kings Subjects, iuhabiting therein, and repairing thither. At a Court holden before Sir <hi>Rowland Hill</hi> Knight, then Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and the Aldermen of the ſame City, in the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the eight and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of <hi>May,</hi> in the ſaid fourth year of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, the ſaid Town or Borough was named and called the Ward, or <hi>Bridge VVard without.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after, it was enacted, that beſides the then ancient accuſtomed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of five and twenty Aldermen, there ſhould be one Alderman more elected, to have the Rule, Charge, and Governance of the ſaid <hi>Borough</hi> and Town. And that four diſcreet perſons, or more, being Freemen of <hi>London,</hi> and dwelling within the ſaid City, or the <hi>Borough</hi> of <hi>Southwarke,</hi> or in other the Liberties of the ſaid City, ſhould from thenceforth, as often as the Caſe ſhall require, be from time to time nominated, appointed, and choſen by the Inhabitants of the ſaid <hi>Borough</hi> for the time being, before the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> for the time being; And that the ſaid Lord Mayor for the time being, ſhould (at the next Court of Aldermen, to be holden at the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> of the ſaid City, next after ſuch election) preſent the Names and Sirnames of all ſuch perſons, as ſo ſhould be named before him, and put in the ſaid Election; And that the ſaid Lord Mayor and Aldermen, for the time being, ſhould of thoſe four perſons, or mo, ſo preſented, Elect and Chuſe one, by way of <hi>Scrutinie,</hi> to be an Alderman of the ſaid City, and to have the peculiar Ordering, Rule, and Governance of the ſaid Borough and Town of <hi>Southwarke,</hi> and of the Inhabitants thereof, and of all other the Kings liege people, repairing to the ſame.</p>
               <p>This Borough being in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> conſiſteth of divers ſtreets, waies, and winding Lanes, all full of Buildings inhabited; And firſt, to begin at the Weſt part thereof, over againſt the Weſt Suburbe of the City, on the Bank of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> there is now a continual building of Tenements, about half a mile in length to the Bridge.</p>
               <p>Then South a continual ſtreet called <hi>Long Southwark,</hi> builded on both ſides with divers Lanes, and Alleys up to St. <hi>Georges</hi> Church, and beyond it through <hi>Blackman</hi> ſtreet, towards <hi>New Town,</hi> (or <hi>Newington)</hi> the Liberties of which Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, extend almoſt to the Pariſh Church of <hi>New Town</hi> aforeſaid, diſtant one mile from <hi>London</hi> Bridge, and alſo South-weſt a continual building, almoſt to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> more than one mile from the ſaid Bridge.</p>
               <p>Then from the Bridge along by the Thames Eaſt-ward, is St. <hi>Olaves</hi> ſtreet, having continual building on both the ſides, with Lanes and Alleys up to <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-Bridge:</hi> to <hi>Horſe-down,</hi> and towards <hi>Rother-Hith</hi> alſo, ſome good half mile in length from <hi>London</hi> Bridge, ſo that I account the whole continual buildings, on the Bank of the ſaid River, from the Weſt towards the Eaſt to be more than a large mile in length.</p>
               <p>Then have ye from the entring towards the ſaid <hi>Horſe-down,</hi> one other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſtreet, called <hi>Barmonds eye ſtreet,</hi> which ſtretcheth South, likewiſe furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Buildings on both the ſides, almoſt half a mile in length up to the late diſſolved Monaſtery of St. <hi>Saviours,</hi> called <hi>Bermondſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And from thence is one Long Lane (ſo called of the length) turning Weſt to St. <hi>Georges</hi> Church aforenamed, out of the which Lane, mentioned <hi>Long-lane,</hi> breaketh one other ſtreet towards the South and by Eaſt, and this is called <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh-ſtreet,</hi> for that it is the way leading into that County; and ſo have ye the bounds of this Borough.</p>
               <p>The Antiquities moſt notable in this Borough are theſe; Firſt, for Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, there was <hi>Bermondſey,</hi> an <hi>Abbey of Black Monks;</hi> St. <hi>Mary Overies,</hi> a <hi>Priory</hi> of <hi>Canons Regular;</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> a <hi>Colledge</hi> or <hi>Hoſpital</hi> for the poor; and the <hi>Loke,</hi> a <hi>Lazar-houſe</hi> in <hi>Kent-ſtreet.</hi> Pariſh Churches there have been ſix, whereof five do remain, <hi>(viz.)</hi> St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> in the Priory of Saint <hi>Mary Overy;</hi> Now the ſame St. <hi>Mary Overy</hi> is the Pariſh Church for the ſaid
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:95174:88"/>
                  <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and for Saint <hi>Margaret</hi> on the Hill, and is called Saint <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Margaret</hi> on the Hill, being put down is now a Court for Juſtice; St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the <hi>Hoſpital</hi> ſerveth for a Pariſh Church as afore; St <hi>George</hi> a Pariſh Church, as before it did; ſo doth St, <hi>Olave,</hi> and St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> by the Abby of <hi>Bermondſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be alſo theſe five Priſons, or Goals, the <hi>Clink</hi> on the Bank, the <hi>Compter</hi> in the late Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Margaret,</hi> the <hi>Marſhalſey,</hi> the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and the <hi>White-Lyon,</hi> all in <hi>Long Southwarke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to return to the Weſt Bank, there were two <hi>Bear-Gardens,</hi> the old and new, places wherein were kept <hi>Bears, Bulls,</hi> and other Beaſts, to be bated; As alſo Maſtives, in ſeveral Kenels, nouriſhed to baite them. Theſe Bears and other Beaſts are there baited in plots of ground, Scaffolded about, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders to ſtand ſafe; but this kind of ſport is now prohibited. Next, on this Bank, was ſometime the <hi>Bordello</hi> or <hi>Stewes,</hi> a place ſo called of certain <hi>Stew-houſes,</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged there, for the repair of incontinent men, to the like women, of the which Privileage we read thus.</p>
               <p>In a Parliament holden at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the eight of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, it was ordained by the Commons, and confirmed by the King and Lords, That divers conſtitutions for ever ſhould he kept in that Lordſhip or Franchiſe, according to the old Cuſtoms, that had been there uſed time out of mind; Amongſt the which, theſe following were ſome, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That no <hi>Stew-holder,</hi> or his Wife ſhould let or ſtay any ſingle Woman to go and come freely at all times, when they liſted.</p>
               <p>No <hi>Stew-holder</hi> to keep any Woman to board, but ſhe to board abroad at her pleaſure. To take no more for the Womans Chamber in the week than four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pence.</p>
               <p>Not to keep open his doors upon the <hi>Holy-daies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not to keep any ſingle Woman in his Houſe on the <hi>Holy-dayes;</hi> but the Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff to ſee them voided out of the Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>No ſingle Woman to be kept againſt her will that would leave her ſin.</p>
               <p>No <hi>Stew-holder</hi> to receive any Woman of Religion, or any Mans Wife.</p>
               <p>No ſingle Woman to take mony to lye with any man, except ſhe lie with him all night till the morrow. No man to be drawn or enticed into any <hi>Stew-houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conſtables, Bayliffe, and others, every week to ſearch every <hi>Stew-houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No <hi>Stew-holder</hi> to keep any Woman, that hath the perilous Infirmity of <hi>burning:</hi> not to ſell Bread, Ale, Fleſh, Fiſh, Wood, Coale, or any Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe allowed <hi>Stew-houſes</hi> had Signs on their Fronts, towards the <hi>Thames,</hi> not hanged out, but <hi>painted</hi> on the Walls, as a <hi>Boars</hi> head, the <hi>Croſſe-Keys,</hi> the <hi>Gun,</hi> the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> the <hi>Crane,</hi> the <hi>Cardinals Hat,</hi> the <hi>Bell,</hi> the <hi>Swan, &amp;c.</hi> Ancient men of good credit do report, that theſe ſingle Women were forbidden the <hi>Rights of the Church</hi> ſo long as they continued that finful life, and were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Chriſtian burial, if they were not reconciled, before their death: And therefore there was a plot of ground called the <hi>Single Womans Church-yard,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them, far from the Pariſh Church.</p>
               <p>In the year of Chriſt, one thouſand five hundred forty ſix, the ſeven and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>Henry the</hi> eighth, this Row of <hi>Stews</hi> in <hi>Southwarke,</hi> was put down by the Kings commandement, which was proclaimed by ſound of Trumpet, no more to be priviledg'd and uſed as a common Brothel.</p>
               <p>Then next is the <hi>Clinke,</hi> a Goale or Priſon for the Treſpaſſers in thoſe parts, namely, in old time for ſuch as ſhould <hi>brabble, fray,</hi> or <hi>break</hi> the peace on the ſaid Bank, or in the <hi>Brothel</hi> Houſes; they were by the Inhabitants thereabout, apprehended and committed to this Gaole, where they were ſtreightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:95174:89"/>
Next is the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſters Houſe,</hi> or Lodging when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to this City.</p>
               <p>Adioyning to this on the South ſide thereof, is the <hi>Biſhop of Rocheſters Inne,</hi> or lodging, by whom firſt erected, it is not upon Record; but 'tis known well, the ſame of longtime hath not been frequented by any Biſhop, and lieth rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous for lack of reparations. The Abbot of <hi>Naverly</hi> had a Houſe there.</p>
               <p>Eaſt from the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſters</hi> Houſe, directly over againſt it ſtandeth a fair Church, called St. <hi>Mary, over the Rit,</hi> or <hi>Overy,</hi> that is, over the water; This Church, or ſome other in place thereof was (of old time long before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt) an Houſe of Siſters, founded by a Maiden, named <hi>Mary,</hi> unto the which Houſe and Siſters they left (as was left to her by her Parents) the over-ſight and profits of a <hi>Croſſe-Ferry</hi> or <hi>Traverſe-Ferry</hi> over the <hi>Thames,</hi> there kept before that any Bridge was builded; This Houſe of Siſters was after by <hi>Swithin,</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lady, converted unto a Colledge of <hi>Priests,</hi> who in place of the <hi>Ferry,</hi> buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Bridge of Timber, and from time to time kept the ſame in good repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; But laſtly the ſame Bridge was builded of Stone, and then in the year 1106, was this Church again founded for <hi>Canons Regular,</hi> by <hi>VVilliam Pom del l' Arch,</hi> and <hi>VVilliam Daunly</hi> Knights <hi>Normans.</hi> This <hi>Peter de Rupibus</hi> or <hi>de la Roch,</hi> founded a large Chappel of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> in the Church of St <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Overy,</hi> which Chappel was afterward appointed to be the Pariſh Church for the Inhabitants near adjoyning. This Church was again new builded in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Gower</hi> Eſquire, a famous Poet, was then an eſpecial Benefactor to that work, and was there buried on the North ſide of the ſaid Church, in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of St. <hi>John,</hi> where he founded a Chantry; He lyeth under a Tombe of Stone, with his Image alſo of Stone over him; The Hair of his Head <hi>auburne,</hi> long to his Shoulders, but curling up and a ſmall forked Beard: on his Head a Chaplet, like a Coronet of four Roſes, an habit of Purple damasked down to his feet, a <hi>Collar of Eſſes of Gold</hi> about his Neck, under his Feet the likeneſſe of three Books, which he compiled. The firſt named <hi>Speculum Meditantis,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>French;</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Vox clamantis,</hi> penned in <hi>Latine;</hi> The third, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſio Amantis,</hi> written in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and this laſt is printed; <hi>Vox Clamantis,</hi> with his <hi>Chronica Tripartita,</hi> &amp; other both in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> were never printed. Beſides on the Wall where he lyeth, there was painted <hi>three Virgins Crowned,</hi> one of the which was named <hi>Charity,</hi> holding this Device,</p>
               <l>En Toy qui es Fitz de Dieu le pere</l>
               <l>Savue ſoit, qui giſt ſoubs ceſt pierre.</l>
               <l>In Thee who art the Son of God</l>
               <l>Be ſav'd who lyes under this clod.</l>
               <p>Now paſſing through St. <hi>Mary Overies Cloſe</hi> (once in poſſeſſion of the Lord <hi>Montacute)</hi> &amp; <hi>Pepper Alley</hi> into <hi>Long Southwark;</hi> on the right hand thereof the Market Hill, where the Leather is ſold, there ſtood the late named Pariſh Church of Saint <hi>Margaret,</hi> given to St. <hi>Mary Overies</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, put down and joyned with the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and united to the late diſſolved <hi>Priory</hi> Church of St. <hi>Mary Overy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A part of this Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Margaret</hi> is now a <hi>Court</hi> wherein the Aſſizes and Seſſions be kept, and the Court of <hi>Admiralty</hi> is alſo there kept; one other part of the ſame Church is now a priſon, called the <hi>Compter</hi> in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farther up on that ſide, almoſt directly over againſt St. <hi>Georges Church,</hi> was ſometime a large and moſt ſumptuous houſe, builded by <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> Duke
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:95174:89"/>
of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, which was called <hi>Suffolk Houſe,</hi> but coming afterwards into the Kings hands, the ſame was called <hi>Southwark place,</hi> and a <hi>Mint</hi> of Coynage was there kept for the King. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> gave this Houſe to <hi>Nicholas Heth,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and to his Succeſſors for ever, to be their Inne or Lodging for their repair to <hi>London,</hi> in recompence of <hi>York Houſe</hi> near to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which King <hi>Henry</hi> her Father had taken from <hi>Cardinal Woolſey,</hi> and from the See of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then is the <hi>White Lion,</hi> a Goal ſo called, for that the ſame was a common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery for the receit of Travellers by that Sign. This Houſe was firſt uſed as a Goal within theſe hundred years laſt, ſince the which time the priſoners were once removed thence to an Houſe in <hi>New-town,</hi> where they remained for a ſhort time, and were returned again to the aforeſaid <hi>White Lion,</hi> there to remain as the appointed Goal for the Countey of <hi>Surrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next is the Goal or Priſon of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> but of what antiquity the ſame is, it appears not. We read, that the Courts of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> and <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> have oft times been removed from <hi>London</hi> to other places, and ſo hath likewiſe the other Goals that ſerve thoſe Courts, as in the year 1304, <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt commanded the Courts of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> &amp; the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> which had remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſeven years at <hi>York,</hi> to be removed to their old places at <hi>London.</hi> And in the year 1387, the eleaventh of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Robert Triſilian</hi> chief Juſtice, came to the City of <hi>Coventry,</hi> and there ſat by the ſpace of a Month, as Juſtice of the Kings Bench, and cauſed to be Indicted in that Court about the number of 2000 perſons of that Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſeemeth therefore, that for that time the Priſon or Goale of that Court was not far off. Alſo, in the year 1392, the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the ſame <hi>Richard,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> being Lord Chancellor, for good will that he bare to his City, cauſed the Kings Bench and Chancery to be removed from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> but ere long they were returned to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then is the <hi>Marſhalſey</hi> another Goal or Priſon, ſo called, as pertaining to the <hi>Marſhalls</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> of what continuance kept in <hi>Southwark,</hi> it appears not; but likely it is, that the ſame hath been removeable, at the pleaſure of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalls.</hi> And then <hi>Thieves Lane</hi> by St. <hi>Thomas Hoſpital,</hi> firſt found by <hi>Richard, Prior</hi> of <hi>Bermondſey,</hi> in the <hi>Cellerers</hi> grounded, againſt the Wall of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, in the year 1213, He named it the <hi>Almery,</hi> or houſe of Alms, for <hi>Converts</hi> and poor Children.</p>
               <p>In the year 1552, the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> having the void ſuppreſſed <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> began the reparations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for poor, impotent, lame, and diſeaſed people, ſo that in the Month of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> next following, the ſick and poor people were taken in,; And in the year 1553, on the tenth of <hi>April,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth in the ſeventh of his Reign, gave to the Mayor, Communalty and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> to be a Work-Houſe for the poor, and idle perſons of the City, his Houſe of <hi>Bridewell,</hi> and ſeven hundred Marks Lands of the <hi>Savoy</hi> Rents, which Hoſpital he had ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, with all the Beds, bedding, and other furniture belonging to the ſame, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintenance of the ſaid Work-houſe of <hi>Bridewell,</hi> and of this Hoſpital of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Southwark.</hi> This gift, the King confirmed by his Charter. The Church of this Hoſpital, which of old time ſerved for the Tenements neer adjoyning and pertaining to the ſaid Hoſpital, remaineth as a Pariſh Church.</p>
               <p>But now to come to St. <hi>Olaves</hi> ſtreet: on the Bank of the River of Thames, is the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Olave,</hi> a fair and meetly large Church, but a far larger Pariſh, eſpecially of Aliens or ſtrangers, and poor people.</p>
               <p>Next is the Bridge-Houſe, ſo called, as being a Store-houſe for Stone, Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or whatſoever pertaining to the building or repairing of <hi>London</hi> Bridge.</p>
               <p>This Houſe ſeemeth to have taken beginning with the firſt founding of the Bridge, either of Stone or Timber; it is a large plot of ground on the Bank of the River of Thames, containing divers large buildings, for ſtowage of things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:95174:90"/>
towards reparation of the ſaid Bridge. There are alſo divers <hi>Garners,</hi> for laying up of <hi>Wheat,</hi> and other Granaries for ſervice of the City, as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. Moreover, there be certain Ovens builded, in number ten, of which ſix be very large the other four being but half ſo big: theſe were purpoſely made to bake out the Bread Corn of the ſaid <hi>Grayners,</hi> to the beſt advantage, for relief of the poor Cittizens, when need ſhould require.</p>
               <p>Then is <hi>Battaile Bridge,</hi> ſo called of <hi>Battaile Abbey,</hi> for that it ſtandeth on the ground &amp; over a Water-courſe, (flowing out of Thames) pertaining to that Abbey, and was therefore both builded and repaired by the <hi>Abbots</hi> of that Houſe, as being hard adjoyning to the Abbots Lodging.</p>
               <p>Beyond this Bridge is <hi>Bermondſey</hi> ſtreet, turning South, in the South end whereof was ſometime a Priory or Abby, of St. <hi>Saviour,</hi> called <hi>Bermonds Eye</hi> in <hi>Southwarke,</hi> founded by <hi>Ailwin,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1081.</p>

               <p>In the year 1539. this <hi>Abbey</hi> was valued to diſpend by the year, 474 <hi>l.</hi> four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſhillings four pence half penny, and was ſurrendred to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, the one and thirtieth of his Reign, the Abbey Church was then pulled down by Sir <hi>Thomas Pope</hi> Knight, and in place thereof, a goodly Houſe builded of Stone and Timber, ſince pertaining to the Earls of <hi>Suſſex.</hi> Next unto this <hi>Abbey</hi> Church ſtandeth a proper Church of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> builded by the Priory of <hi>Bermondſey,</hi> ſerving for reſort of the Inhabitants (Tenants to the Priors or Abbots near adjoyning) there to have their <hi>Divine Service;</hi> this Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth and ſerveth as afore, and is called a Pariſh Church. Then in <hi>Kent</hi> ſtreet, is a <hi>Lazar</hi> Houſe for <hi>Leprous people,</hi> called the <hi>Loke</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> the foundation whereof is incertain.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Borough</hi> at a ſubſidy to the King, was uſed to yield about a thouſand Marks, or eight hundred pounds, which is more than any one City in <hi>England</hi> payeth except <hi>London;</hi> And alſo, the Muſter of men in this Borough doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in number ſurpaſſe all other Cities, except <hi>London.</hi> And thus much for the <hi>Borough</hi> of <hi>Southwarke,</hi> one of the ſix and twenty Wards of <hi>London.</hi>

            <p>The ſecond of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the Forreſt of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and the Warren of <hi>Stanes,</hi> were diſafforeſted; ſince which time, the Suburbs alſo about <hi>London,</hi> in tract of time, and, as it were, by an inſenſible augmentation, have wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully increaſed in people and edifices.</p>

            <p>The Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> were the chief Benefactors, towards the erecting of the new Church at <hi>Wapping,</hi> a Chappel of eaſe to <hi>White-Chappel:</hi> And upon a high Beam, in the midſt thereof, there is a memorable neat Inſcription, <hi>viz.

            <p>Without <hi>Algate</hi> there is a ſpacious huge Suburb, about a mile long, as far as <hi>White Chappel,</hi> and further: <hi>White Chappel</hi> was as it were, a Chappel of Eaſe to <hi>Stebunhith,</hi> now called by a ſtrange contraction, <hi>Stepney</hi> Pariſh: the Church of <hi>White Chappel,</hi> was called St. <hi>Mary Marfelon,</hi> becauſe a <hi>Frenchman</hi> having ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a rich Widow hard by and murthered her for her Wealth, the Women and Boyes ſtoned the Felon to death, as he thought to fly away.</p>

            <p>In the High ſtreet from <hi>Holy Well,</hi> there is a continual Building to <hi>Sewers</hi> Ditch, then is there <hi>Shore-Ditch, Golding-lane, Goſwell-street,</hi> then <hi>Hoxton,</hi> (vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called <hi>Hogſdon)</hi> which was once a Prebend belonging to St. <hi>Pauls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then is there in this Suburb, the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Mary</hi> Spittle, and a great Palace, called <hi>Fiſhers Folly,</hi> built by the Lord <hi>John Powlet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In former times, there was in <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> a Row of ſmall Almshouſes, built there by the <hi>Prior,</hi> which being ſuppreſſed, they were called the <hi>Rotten Rowe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then is there the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Leonard,</hi> in <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> whereof the Arch-Deacon of <hi>Pauls de jure,</hi> is alwayes Parſon; We are come now to <hi>Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields,</hi> which in former times, was but a fenny quagge, or Moore, and is now, by the induſtry and bounty of well diſpoſed Citizens, come to that perfection, and pleaſantneſs, as now we behold it in, whereof mention is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

            <p>Then is there <hi>Foreſtreet, Moore-lane,</hi> and <hi>Grubſtreet, White-croſſe-ſtreet,</hi> which is of great extent, and reacheth to <hi>Old ſtreet.</hi> From the Weſt end of <hi>Foreſtreet,</hi> lyeth <hi>Redcroſſe-ſtreet,</hi> and <hi>Beech-lane,</hi> with <hi>Golding-lane,</hi> full of ſmall Tenements.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Alderſgate</hi> Suburb is next, where the Pariſh of St. <hi>Buttolph</hi> ſtands, and little <hi>Britain</hi> ſtreet on the one ſide; then it ſtretcheth all along North, with very handſome Edifices, and a large ſtreet, as far as <hi>Barbican,</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>Long-lane</hi> on the other.</p>
            <p>This ſtreet reſembleth an <hi>Italian</hi> ſtreet, more then any other in <hi>London,</hi> by reaſon of the ſpaciouſneſs &amp; uniformity of Buildings, and ſtreightneſs thereof, with the convenient diſtance of the Houſes; on both ſides whereof, there are divers very fair ones, as <hi>Peter-Houſe,</hi> the Palace now, and Manſion of the moſt Noble <hi>Marquis of Dorcheſter:</hi> Then is there the Earl of <hi>Tenets</hi> Houſe, with the Moon and Sun-Tavern, very fair ſtructures. Then is there from about the middle of <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet,</hi> a handſome new ſtreet butted out, and fairly built by the Company of <hi>Goldſmiths,</hi> which reacheth athwart as far as <hi>Redcroſſe-ſtreet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the furtheſt point of this Suburb Northward, there was a Winde-Mill in times paſt, which being blown down by a Tempeſt, Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> firſt Wife to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> erected there a Chappel, and named it Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> which was afterwards ſuppreſſed, and the place came to be called <hi>Mount-mill,</hi> whereof the <hi>Long-Parliament</hi> made much uſe for their fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>We are going now to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where towards <hi>Smithfield,</hi> I meet with <hi>Gilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpur,</hi> and <hi>Knight-riders-ſtreet:</hi> Then is <hi>Smithfield</hi> it ſelf, which hath bin ſpoken of before, in <hi>Faringdon</hi> Ward.</p>
            <p>Without <hi>Smithfield</hi> Barres, there is St. <hi>Johns</hi> ſtreet; on the right hand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſtood the <hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> founded by Sir <hi>Walter Manny,</hi> Knight of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Edward</hi> the third.

               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:95174:91"/>
The Chievalrous and moſt devont Knight, firſt built a Chappel there, then a Monaſtery of <hi>Carthuſian</hi> Fryers, which are the ſevereſt and moſt rigid of all clauſtral Societies: this Monaſtery was called at firſt the <hi>Salutation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this <hi>Charter-Houſe,</hi> was the Monument of the ſaid Sir <hi>Walter Manny,</hi> and above twenty Knights more, beſides Ladies and other perſons of high Rank, and at the ſuppreſſion of Abbeys, this Monaſtery had 642 <hi>l.</hi> yearly Rent, a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſum in thoſe dayes.</p>
            <p>This demoliſh'd <hi>Charter-Houſe,</hi> came a while after, to the poſſeſſion of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Earl of Suffolk,</hi> Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> in King <hi>James</hi> his Raign, and the place being ſweetly ſcituated, with accommodations of ſpacious Walks, Orchards, and Gardens, with ſundry dependencies of Tenements, and Lands thereunto belonging, gave occaſion to that worthy and well diſpoſed Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Mr. <hi>Thomas Sutton,</hi> of <hi>Castle</hi> Camps, in the County of <hi>Cambridge</hi> Eſquire, but born at <hi>Knayth</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> to alter his Reſolution of erecting an Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital at <hi>Hallingbury</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> where he had firſt pitched his deſign, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe this place of the Earl, for 13000 <hi>l.</hi> firſt peny payd before the ſealing of the Conveyance; which charitable, great, and noble enterprize, was counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by King <hi>James,</hi> and his privy Councel.</p>
            <p>So having in few years raiſed up that goodly Fabrique, (though it pleaſed God to take him to himſelf, before it was quite finiſh'd) and endowed it with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent allowance, by paſſing away many goodly Mannors, he had in <hi>Lincoln, Wiltſhire, Middleſex, Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with other goodly poſſeſſions, the work was compleated, and nominated the Hoſpital of King <hi>James;</hi> which Hoſpital, conſiſted of a Maſter, a Governor, a Preacher, a Free School, with a Maſter and Uſher, 80. poor people, and 40. Schollers, maintained all by the Revenues of the Houſe, <hi>Anno</hi> 1614. on <hi>Munday</hi> next, after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day, the Captains, Gentlemen, and Officers, entred into this new Hoſpital.</p>
            <p>Now there were by Letters Pattents under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Governors appointed of this Hoſpital, whereof the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> was chief, The Lord <hi>Chancelor,</hi> and <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> The Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> the Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> the <hi>Attorney General,</hi> the <hi>Dean of Pauls,</hi> the <hi>Dean of Weſtminſter,</hi> and divers others; But the late long Parliament, inverting the order and will of the founder, did nominate others in their rooms.</p>
            <p>A little without the. Barres of <hi>Weſt Smithfield,</hi> is <hi>Charter-houſe Lane;</hi> but in the large yard before, there are many handſome Palaces, as <hi>Rutland</hi> Houſe, and one where the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadors were uſed to lodge; which yard hath lately bin conveniently railed, and made more neat and comely.</p>
            <p>Then is there St. <hi>Johns ſtreet,</hi> with <hi>Turnmill-ſtreet,</hi> which ſtretcheth up Weſt to <hi>Clarken-well,</hi> and it is vulgarly called <hi>Turnball-ſtreet:</hi> There is another Lane called St. <hi>Peters</hi> Lane, which turns from St. <hi>Johns ſtreet,</hi> to <hi>Cow-Croſſe.</hi>

Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Raign, cloſed up again part of the Quire, and ſide Walls on the Weſt ſide, and made Sir <hi>Thomas Treſham,</hi> Prior thereof; but thinking to bring the place to its firſt principles, it was ſuppreſſed again by Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> A great number of Knights of that Order, had Monuments in that Church.</p>
            <p>North from the ſaid Houſe of St. <hi>John's,</hi> was the Priory of <hi>Clarken-Well,</hi> which alſo was very ancient, being built <hi>Anno</hi> 1100.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Southward of this Lane, there is a row of ſmall Houſes, which is a mighty hindrance to <hi>Holborn,</hi> in point of proſpect, which if they were taken down, there would be from <hi>Holborn</hi> Conduit, to St. <hi>Giles</hi> in the field, one of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt riſing ſtreet in the World.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Newgate</hi> on the left hand, lyeth the <hi>Old Dayloy;</hi> and ſo down by <hi>Sea-cole</hi> and <hi>Fleet-lane,</hi> we paſſe then over the common Sewer, up to <hi>Shooe-lane</hi> and ſo to <hi>Fewter-lane,</hi> now vulgarly called <hi>Fetter-lane;</hi> but betwixt theſe two Lanes, there is another new ſtreet, butted out by the Company of <hi>Goldſmiths,</hi> called <hi>Newſtreet,</hi> where there is a knot of very handſome Buildings.</p>
            <p>Above the Barres, there was a Houſe of the <hi>Tamplers,</hi> but they removed thence to <hi>Fleetſtreet:</hi> There was alſo adjoining thereunto, the Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns</hi> Houſe, which was very ancient; for the Records ſay, 'twas built <hi>Anno</hi> 1147. But of late years, it hath belonged to the Noble Earls of <hi>Southhampton;</hi> And lately, it hath bin quite taken down, and turned to ſeveral private Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as <hi>Durham</hi> Houſe is in the Strand.

            <p>Side long of this ancient Houſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> is <hi>Newſtreet,</hi> for ſo it was called at firſt; but now 'tis called <hi>Chancery-lane,</hi> where <hi>Edward</hi> the third annexed the Houſe of converted Jews, to the Office of <hi>Cuſtos Rotulorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Curſitors</hi> Office was built by Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> Lord Keeper of the great Seal.</p>
            <p>Here alſo is the ſix Clarks Office, which is a fair convenient peece of ſtone and Brick Building newly erected, the old being conſumed by a caſual fire of late years. The Biſhop of <hi>Chiceſter, Ralph Nevil,</hi> had much ground given him thereabouts, by <hi>Henry</hi> the third, which now is become all Tenements, thick built, and quite alienated.</p>
            <p>Then is <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> very much encreaſed in building, it appertained ſometimes to the ſaid <hi>Ralph Nevil,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chiceſter,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> having bin before the Houſe of the <hi>Black-Fryers:</hi> and after the deceaſe of the ſaid Biſhop <hi>Nevil, Henry Lacy</hi> Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Conſtable of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtos</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> added much building to this place; and Sir <hi>Thomas Lovel</hi> did alſo add much thereunto, in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth's time; but now it is one of the foure Inns of Court, for the Students in the Law.</p>

            <p>There was ſomething omitted which ſhould have bin ſpoken of the Church of St. <hi>Giles</hi> of the Field, which is, that being a very ancient Church, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, that it could not be repaired, a new one was erected, partly out of the ruines of the old; which work was begun and finiſhed in two years; and a while after, the fair Brick Wall that encompaſſeth it.

            <p>From the North end of <hi>Chancery</hi> Lane, is <hi>High Holborn,</hi> which extends up to St. <hi>Giles</hi> in the Field, where the famous devout Queen <hi>Matilda</hi> did found an Hoſpital, as ſhe did Eaſtward St. <hi>Katherines</hi> beyond the Tower.

            <p>Thus have we as ſuccinctly as we could, avoiding ſuperſtuities, and unnecaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary trivial things, ſpoken of the Skirts of <hi>London,</hi> and the places thereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, without the Gates, and now,

            <p>HAving taken ſo fair a Proſpect, and finiſhed the perluſtration of <hi>London.</hi> It were a high Incivility, and a ſoloeciſm in good manners (or rather a <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle)</hi> not to give <hi>VVestminſter</hi> alſo a viſit, being ſo near and contiguous a Neighbour: It is true, that they were once above a mile aſunder; but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible coalition, and recruit of people, they came at laſt to be united, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into one continued peece, in point of poſture, though not of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And the Union with <hi>Scotland,</hi> did not a little conduce, to make this Union 'twixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>VVeſtminster;</hi> For the <hi>Scots</hi> multiplying here mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neaſted themſelves about the Court, ſo that the <hi>Strand,</hi> from mud Walls, and thatched Houſes, came to that perfection of Buildings, as now we ſee.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the City of <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> hath divers <hi>Magnalia's,</hi> which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve as exact a view as any within <hi>London;</hi> for if <hi>London</hi> of old had her Temple of <hi>Diana, VVestminſter</hi> had one to a greater Deity, which was <hi>Apollo;</hi> And ſince, (in thoſe very places); if St. <hi>Paul,</hi> hath his Church in <hi>London:</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles, hath his in <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> which was uſed to keep the <hi>Regalia's</hi> and the Crown.</p>
            <p>Add hereunto, that if <hi>London</hi> hath her <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and the <hi>Huſtings.

            <p>Moreover, in one particular, <hi>Westminſter</hi> may claim a great advantage of <hi>London,</hi> in regard as the <hi>Royal Court</hi> once was, ſo the reſidence of the Soveraign Magiſtrate is ſtill there: Inſomuch, that <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> may well glory of three things, That ſhe hath the chiefeſt Courts of Juſtice, the chiefeſt Court of the Prince, and the chiefeſt Court of the <hi>King of Heaven</hi> (for every Temple is his Houſe and Court.) Now the Abbey of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> hath bin alwayes held the greateſt Sanctuary, and randevouze of devotion of the whole Iland: whereunto, the ſcituation of the very place, ſeemes to contribute much, and to ſtrike a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kind of Reverence and ſweetneſs of melting piety in the hearts of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.</p>
            <p>But before we ſteer our courſe to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> we muſt viſit the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and the <hi>Savoy,</hi> which are liberties of themſelves, and lie (as a Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis) 'twixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without <hi>Temple-barre</hi> Weſtward, is a liberty pertaining to the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> which beginneth on the North ſide of the <hi>Thames,</hi> and ſtretcheth Weſt to <hi>Ivy-bridge,</hi> where it terminates.</p>

And again, on the North ſide, ſome ſmall diſtance without Temple-Barre, in the High ſtreet, there ſtretcheth one large middle row, or troop of ſmall Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements, partly opening to the South, and partly towards the North, up Weſt to a Stone Croſſe, over againſt the <hi>Strand;</hi> and this is the bounds of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which firſt belonged to <hi>Brian Liſle,</hi> after to <hi>Peter of Savoy,</hi> and then to the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the third did grant to his Uncle <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> all thoſe Houſes upon the Thames, which pertained to <hi>Brian Liſle,</hi> or <hi>de Inſula,</hi> in the way, or the ſtreet, called the <hi>Strand,</hi> to hold to him and his Heires, yielding three gilded Arrowes, every year in the Exchequer.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Peter,</hi> Earl of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Richmond,</hi> Son to <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Boniface</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Uncle unto <hi>Eleanor</hi> Wife to <hi>Henry</hi> the third, was the firſt Founder of the <hi>Savoy, Anno</hi> 1245. which he gave afterwards to the Fraternity of <hi>Monjoy.</hi> Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi> did purchaſe it for <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> her Son, of the Fraternity; which Duke did much augment and improve the ſtructure. <hi>John</hi> the French King was lodged there, being then the faireſt Mannor of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1381. The Rebels of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> did moſt barbarouſly burn this Houſe, with many Veſſels of Gold and Silver, which they threw into the River; all which they did out of a popular malice to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> It came afterwards to the Kings hands, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh did re-edifie and raiſe it up again, but converted it to the Hoſpital of St. <hi>John Baptiſt;</hi> yet was he content, that it ſhould be ſtill called the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and beſtowed Lands, for maintenance of 100. poor men; But afterwards, it was ſuppreſſed by his Granchild, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth: the Beds, and Bedding, with other Furniture, were given to the City of <hi>London;</hi> together, with <hi>Bridewell,</hi> to be a Work-houſe for idle perſons; and ſome of <hi>Savoy</hi> Furniture was given alſo to furniſh St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Hoſpital in <hi>Southwark:</hi> But afterwards, the <hi>Savoy</hi> Hoſpital was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and endowed with Lands, by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who made one <hi>Jackson,</hi> firſt Maſter thereof: And it is memorable, how the Mayds of Honour, and Ladies of the Court, in thoſe times, did much contribute for ſtoring it again with new Beds, and Furniture, and ſo it hath continued ever ſince: the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of this Hoſpital ſerving for a Pariſh Church, to the Neighbors thereof near adjoyning, and others.</p>
            <p>Now touching the Prerogatives, and enfranchiſements of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> let the Reader know, that <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, by his Royal Charter, and concurrence of Parliament, did ſever the poſſeſſions of the ſaid <hi>Dutchy</hi> from the Crown, And that which <hi>John of Gaunt</hi> hold for term of life, was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed to perpetuity, by the Statutes of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth: which ſeparation was made by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, in regard he well knew, that he had the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter (par Regno)</hi> by ſure and indefeſble Title, whereas his Title to the Crown was not ſo aſſured, becauſe that after the death of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, the Royal right was in the Heir of <hi>Lionel,</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> ſecond Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. And <hi>John of Gaunt,</hi> who was Father to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, was the fourth Son: therefore his policy was, to make it a diſtinct thing from the Crown, for fear of after-claps.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Edward</hi> the third, who erected the County of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to a County Palatine, and honoured the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> therewith, giving him <hi>Jura Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia,</hi> having a particular Court, The Officers whereof, were the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the <hi>Attorney,</hi> the <hi>Receiver General, Clark of the Court,</hi> the <hi>Auditors Surveyors,</hi> the <hi>Meſſenger;</hi> The Seal of the <hi>Dutchy of Lancaſter</hi> remains with the <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor;</hi> but the Seal of the <hi>County Palatine,</hi> remains alwayes in a Cheſt, in the <hi>County Palatine,</hi> under the ſafe cuſtody of a Keeper.</p>
            <p>Now, all Grants and Leaſes of Lands, Tenements, and Offices in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Palatine</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> ſhould paſſe under that Seal, and no other; but all
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:95174:94"/>
Grants and Leaſes out of the <hi>County Palatine,</hi> and within the Survey of the Dutchy, ſhould paſſe under the Seal of the Dutchy, and no other; otherwiſe ſuch Grants are voyd, <hi>ipſo facto.</hi> Though this <hi>County Palatine</hi> was a younger Brother, yet it had more honours, mannors, and Lands annexed unto it, then any of the reſt; and all this by Acts of Parliament, whereby all the Franchiſes, Priviledges, Immunities, Quittances and Freedoms, which the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> had for Himſelf and his Men, and Tenants, were confirmed.</p>
            <p>The Liberty of the Dutchy was uſed to be governed by the Chancellor, who had under him a Steward, that kept Court Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, with an Attorney of the Dutchy. There were alſo four Burgeſſes, and four Aſſiſtants, a Bayliffe, who had others under him, four Conſtables, four Wardens, that kept the ſtock for the poor, four Wardens for high wayes, a Jury of 14. Ale-cunners, which looked to the aſſiſe of meaſures, four Scavengers, and a Beadle, and the common Priſon is <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we muſt make a ſtep back towards <hi>Temple-barre,</hi> and ſo by degrees, to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> all along, we will begin with the right hand, or the North ſide, and ſo paſſe up Weſt, through a back lane or ſtreet, wherein do ſtand (as was touched before) three Inns of <hi>Chancery,</hi> The firſt called <hi>Clements Inne,</hi> in regard it is near St. <hi>Clements Church,</hi> and <hi>Clements Well.</hi> The ſecond <hi>New Inne,</hi> which was made of a common Hoſtery, about the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 7. The third is <hi>Lions Inne.</hi> This ſtreet ſtretcheth up unto <hi>Drury</hi> lane, which lane extends Northward, towards St. <hi>Giles</hi> in the Field. But now we muſt go back, as was ſaid before, towards <hi>Temple-barre,</hi> and ſo by taking the <hi>Strand,</hi> all along return by degrees to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> it ſelf, in a direct line.</p>
            <p>I have heard often of a Britiſh Prophecy, which came from an old <hi>Bard,</hi> viz. The Church man was, the Lawyer is, and the Souldier ſhall be. True it is, that Biſhops lived in the Equipage of Princes, in former times; and among other inſtances, one is, the goodly Palaces they had in and about <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter;</hi> for from <hi>Dorſet</hi> Houſe in <hi>Fleetftreet,</hi> as far as <hi>White-hall,</hi> all the great Houſes, which were built upon the Banks of the Thames, were all Epiſcopal Palaces, except the <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Suffolk-houſe.</hi> The firſt for greatneſs was <hi>Exceſter</hi> Houſe (now called <hi>Eſſex)</hi> where of the chiefeſt Founder was <hi>Edward Stapleton,</hi> Biſhop of that See, who was beheaded by the <hi>Londoners</hi> in <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> and his Body was then brought, and buried in a heap of Sand or rubbiſh, in his own Houſe near <hi>Temple-barre,</hi> in the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Edmond Luey,</hi> built the great Hall in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. The ſame was ſince called <hi>Paget-Houſe,</hi> being enlarged by <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Paget.</hi> Then was it called <hi>Leiceſter-Houſe,</hi> of <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> who was the great Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then it came to be called <hi>Eſſex-houſe,</hi> from <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was alſo a Favorite of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and beheaded in the Tower.</p>
            <p>Oppoſite to this Houſe, ſtandeth the Pariſh-Church of Saint <hi>Clement Danes,</hi> ſo called, becauſe <hi>Harold, a Daniſh</hi> King, with other of that Nation, were buried there.</p>
            <p>Then was the Biſhop of <hi>Baths Inne,</hi> or City-Houſe, builded by the Lord <hi>Thomas Seamer,</hi> Admiral of <hi>England:</hi> which Houſe, came afterwards to be poſſeſſed by the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> &amp; ſo it beares the name of <hi>Arundel-houſe:</hi> neer there adjoyning there was once a Pariſh-Church, called the <hi>Nativity of our Lady,</hi> or the <hi>Innocents of the Strand,</hi> with a fair Coemitery, or Church-yard, wherein there was a Brother-hood kept, called Saint <hi>Urſula</hi> of the <hi>Strand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near adjoyning to the ſaid Church, betwixt it and the Thames, there was an Inne of <hi>Chancery,</hi> called <hi>Cheſters Inne,</hi> becauſe it belonged to the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and ſometimes 'twas called <hi>Strand</hi> Inne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:95174:94"/>
Then was there a Houſe belonging to the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> which one of thoſe Biſhops purchaſed of the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then was there the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſters</hi> Inne or Palace, which was firſt built by <hi>Walter Langhton,</hi> Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt. And not far from that was the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſters</hi> Inne or Palace; All which <hi>viz.</hi> The Pariſh Church called Saint <hi>Mary</hi> of the <hi>Strand, Strand Inne,</hi> with the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Worceſters</hi> Houſes, with all the Tenements adjoyning, were by commandement of <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſixth, &amp; Lord Protector pull'd down, and laid level to the ground <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1549. In place whereof, he erected that large and goodly Houſe, call'd now <hi>Somerſet Houſe,</hi> which roſe out of the ruines of the Church; Therefore the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholiques obſerved, that an apparent judgement from Heaven fell upon him afterwards, being beheaded a little after; and he and his Counſel were ſo infatuated, that he forgot to call for his Clergy, which he might have claimed by the Law, and ſo ſav'd his life.</p>
            <p>Then is there <hi>Bedford</hi> Houſe, which was ſometimes the Biſhop of <hi>Carliles</hi> Inne. It ſtretched from the <hi>Savoy</hi> to <hi>Ivie</hi> Bridge, where Sir <hi>Robert Cecill</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> rayſed a large and ſtately Houſe of Brick and Timber; <hi>Worcefler</hi> Houſe lies ſideling of it, and there being a great <hi>VValnut</hi> tree there growing, which much hindred the proſpect of <hi>Salisbury</hi> Houſe Eaſtward, the Earl bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with one of the Lord <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>VVorceſters</hi> ſervants, that if he could get leave of his Lord to cut down that Tree, he would give him 100 <hi>li.</hi> the ſervant told his Lord of it, who bad him fell down the Tree and take the money; but the old Earl (there being no good correſpondence 'twixt <hi>Salisbury</hi> and him) cauſed preſently a new Brick building to be there erected, where the Tree ſtood.</p>
            <p>We come now to <hi>Durham</hi> Houſe, built by <hi>Thomas Hatfield</hi> Biſhop of that <hi>See,</hi> a very capacious Edifice, on the North ſide whereof ſtood a row of thatch'd Stables, which the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> purchaſed, and pull'd down, and erected in place thereof, the <hi>New Exchange,</hi> or <hi>Britains Burſe;</hi> which was built with wonderful celerity, for the firſt Stone thereof was layed on the tenth of <hi>June</hi> 1608, and it was fully finiſhed the <hi>November</hi> next following. The Earl did then invite King <hi>James</hi> with the Queen, to ſee his new Houſe, where after a rich banquet the King named the place <hi>Britains Burſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next beyond <hi>Durham</hi> Houſe and this new building, is another great Palace, belonging of old to the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> but afterwards it came to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> by this occaſion. When Cardinal <hi>Woolſey,</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> was Indicted in a <hi>premunire,</hi> whereby the King was entitled to all his Goods and Poſſeſſions, he among other things, ſeazed upon the ſaid Cardinals Houſe, where he then dwelled, commonly called <hi>York Place,</hi> and changed the name thereof to <hi>White-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Arch-biſhops of <hi>York,</hi> having then no Houſe in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Westminſter,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> gave unto <hi>Nicholas Heath</hi> then Arch-biſhop of <hi>Yorke, Suffolke</hi> Houſe in <hi>Southwark,</hi> lately built by <hi>Charles Brandon;</hi> which Houſe the ſaid Arch-biſhop ſold, and in lieu thereof he purchaſed the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich's</hi> Houſe, which ever ſince hath been called <hi>Yorke</hi> Houſe, though it came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the poſſeſſion of the Duke of Buckingham <hi>George Villers,</hi> who added much to the old Edifice, and would have had it called <hi>Buckingham</hi> Houſe, which name is engraven upon the watergate in great Letters.</p>
            <p>There was of old, an Hoſpitall of St. <hi>Mary Rouncival</hi> (an order which came from <hi>Navarre</hi> in <hi>Spain)</hi> by <hi>Charing-Croſſe,</hi> where a Fraternity was founded in the fifteenth of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, which was afterwards ſuppreſſed and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Tenements. Near unto this Hoſpital was an <hi>Hermitage</hi> with a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of St. <hi>Katherine</hi> over againſt <hi>Charing-Croſſe,</hi> which Croſſe was erected by <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt to the honor of his Queen (as is ſpoken elſe-where) <hi>Eleanor,</hi> and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:95174:95"/>
it was a goodly Monument, which was utterly deſtroyed by the fury of the <hi>long Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Weſt of this Croſſe ſtood ſometimes another Hoſpital called St. <hi>James,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of two Hides of Land in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Margaret</hi> in <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> and founded by the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> for 14 Siſter-Maidens that were Leprous; then were there added eight Brethren to miniſter Divine Service there. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, there was a great addition of Land made to this Hoſpital, and <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt granted a Fair to be kept there every year.</p>
            <p>This Hoſpital being ſurrendred to <hi>Henry</hi> 8. the Siſters were allowed Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons during their lives, and the King erected there a Mannor Houſe, with a Park annexed, encompaſſed about with a Brick Wall. But before we advance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Northward towards <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> we muſt make a ſtep backward to Saint <hi>Martins</hi> Church and Lane, where on the Weſt ſide there are many gentile fair Houſes in a row built by the ſame Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> who built <hi>Britains Burſe,</hi> but ſomewhat before. Then have we <hi>Bedford Berry,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Coven Garden,</hi> becauſe there was a large <hi>Convent,</hi> or Monaſtery there in times paſs'd, where there are many good ſtructures, cloyſtered underneath ſome of them, with a large <hi>Piazza</hi> or Market place, and a Church that bears the name of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which, though within the Precincts of Saint <hi>Martins</hi> Pariſh, yet by Act of Parliament, it is now exempted.

            <p>From theſe Gates we paſſe in a direct Line to Kings ſtreet; on one ſide where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of paſſing through St. <hi>Stephen</hi> Alley is <hi>Canon Row,</hi> (but now though very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly calld <hi>Channel Row)</hi> ſo called becauſe it belonged to the Dean and Canons of Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> Chappel, who were lodg'd there, but now they are all turn'd to be temporal habitations.</p>
            <p>Then we come to <hi>Woolstaple</hi> now the common Market place of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> In the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, we read that the Staple being at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Pariſhioners of Saint <hi>Margarets,</hi> and Merchants of the Staple builded the ſaid Church of new. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, had ſix Wool-houſes within the Staple at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which he granted to the Dean and Canons of Saint <hi>Stephens.</hi>

Near to this place, was of old, the Chappel of St. <hi>Anne,</hi> where the Lady <hi>Margaret Henry</hi> the ſevenths Mother, erected an Alms-Houſe for poor women, and it was called <hi>Eleemoſynary,</hi> and now <hi>Almory,</hi> or <hi>Ambry,</hi> becauſe the Alms of the Abbey were there diſtributed to the poor: And there <hi>Iſlip</hi> Abbot of <hi>VVeſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> ſet up the firſt Preſs of Book-printing that ever was in <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1471.

            <p>THis Church is famous, eſpecially by reaſon of the <hi>in auguration</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture</hi> of the Kings of <hi>England. Sulvard</hi> writeth, that there ſtood ſometimes a Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> in that place, and that in the daies of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> it fell down with an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake; out of the remains whereof, <hi>Sebert</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſt-Saxons,</hi> erected ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which being by the <hi>Danes</hi> overthrown, Biſhop <hi>Dunſtane</hi> re-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified, and granted it to ſome few Monks. But afterwards King <hi>Edward</hi> ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Confeſſour,</hi> with the tenth penny of all his Revenues, built it a new for to be his own Sepulture, and a Monaſtery for <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks, endowing it with Livings and Lands, lying diſperſed in divers parts of <hi>England.</hi> But liſten what an Hiſtorian ſaith, who then lived. <q>The devour King deſtined unto God that place, both for that it was near unto the famous and wealthy City of <hi>London,</hi> and alſo had a pleaſant ſcituation amongſt fruitful fields, and green grounds, lying round about it, with the principal River running hard by, bringing in from all parts of the World, great variety of Wares; and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of all ſorts to the City adjoyning; But chiefly for the love of the <hi>Chief Apoſtle,</hi> whom he reverenced with a ſpecial and ſingular affection. He made choice to have a place there for his own Sepulchre: and thereupon comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that of the Tenths of all his Rents, the work of a noble Edifice ſhould be taken in hand, ſuch as might beſeem the <hi>Prince</hi> of the Apoſtles: To the end (as the <hi>Annales</hi> have it) that he might procure the propitious favour of the Lord, after he ſhould finiſh the courſe of this tranſitory life, both in regard of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Piety, and alſo of his free Oblation of Lands and Ornaments, wherewith he purpoſed to endow, and enrich the ſame. According therefore to the Kings
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:95174:96"/>
commandement the work was nobly began, and happily proceeded forward: neither the charges already disburſed, or to be disburſed, were weighed and regarded, ſo that it might be preſented in the end unto God and Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and made worth their acceptation.</q> Thus the words of the old Record run.</p>
            <p>Touching the Form of that ancient building, we read in an old Manuſcript Book, that the principal plot or ground-work of the building was ſupported with moſt lofty Arches, caſt round with a four ſquare work, and ſemblable joynts. But the compaſſe of the whole, with a double Arch of Stone on both ſides is encloſed with joyned-work, firmly knit and united together every way. Moreouer, the Croſſe of the Church which was to compaſſe the mid Quire of thoſe that chaunted unto the Lord, and with a twofold ſupportance, that it had on either ſide to uphold and bear the lofty top of the Tower in the midſt, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply riſeth at firſt with a low and ſtrong Arch; then mounteth it higher, with many winding ſtairs, artificially aſcending with a number of ſteps: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a ſingle Wall it reacheth up to the roof of Timber, well and ſurely covered with Lead. But after an hundred and threeſcore years, King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, ſubverted this Fabrick of King <hi>Edwards,</hi> and built from the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a new Church of very rare Workmanſhip, ſupported with ſundry rowes of Marble Pillars, and the roofe covered over with ſheets of Lead: a piece of work that coſt fifty years labour in building; which Church the <hi>Abbots</hi> enlarged very much toward the Weſt end; and King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh for the burial of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Children, adjoyned thereto, in the Eaſt end, a Chappel of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble artificial elegancy, The Wonder of the Worlde, as <hi>Leland</hi> calleth it: for a man would ſay, that all the curious and exquiſite work that can be deviſed, is there compacted; wherein is to be ſeen, his own moſt ſtately magnifical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, all of ſolid and maſſie Copper.</p>
            <p>This Church, when the Monks were driven thence, from time to time, was altered to and fro with ſundry changes. Firſt of all, it had a <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Prebonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi> ſoon after one <hi>Biſhop</hi> and no more, namely <hi>T. Thurlbey,</hi> who having wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the Church Patrimony, ſurrendred it to the ſpoil of Countiers; and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, were the Monks with their Abbot ſet in poſſeſſion again by Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and when they alſo within a while after, were by authority of Parliament caſt out, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> converted it into a <hi>Collegiate</hi> Church, or rather into a Seminary and Nurſe-Garden of the Church, appointing twelve Prebendaries there, and as many old Souldiers paſt ſervice, for Alms-men, fourty Schollars, who in their due time are preferred to the Univerſities; and from thence ſent forth into the Church and Common-weale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Over theſe they placed D. <hi>Bill</hi> Dean, whoſe Succeſſor was <hi>Gabriel Goodman,</hi> a right good man indeed, and of ſingular integrity and an eſpecial Patron of Literature.</p>

The remains whereof, are the Chamber wherein the King, the Nobles, with the Councellors, and, Officers of State, do aſſemble at the High Court of Parliament; and the next unto it, wherein anciently they were wont to begin the Parliaments known by the name of St. <hi>Edwards painted Chamber,</hi> becauſe the Tradition holdeth, that the ſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> therein dyed.</p>
            <p>Adjoyning unto this, is the <hi>White-Hall,</hi> wherein at this day, the Court of <hi>Requeſts</hi> is kept; beneath this is that Hall, which of all other is the greateſt, and the very <hi>Praetoriuns,</hi> or Hall of Juſtice, for all <hi>England,</hi> In this, are the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Courts; namely, The <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> The <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery;</hi> and in places near thereabout, the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> the <hi>Exchequer, Court of Wards,</hi> and Court of the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter, &amp;c.</hi> In which at certain ſet times, (we call them <hi>Termes)</hi> yearly Cauſes are heard, and tryed: whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King <hi>Henry</hi> the third his dayes, the Court of Common Law, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Juſtice, was unſetled, and alwayes followed the <hi>Kings Court;</hi> But he in the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> made a Law in theſe words, <hi>Let not the Common Pleas follow our Court, but be holden in ſome certain place;</hi> which notwithſtanding, ſome expound thus, That the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> from thenceforch be handled in a Court of her own, by it ſelf a part, and not in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> as before.

For, her Husbands wounds infected with the poyſon, and which, by reaſon of the malignity thereof, could not be cloſed and healed, ſhe day by day, licked with her Tongue, and ſucked out the venomous humor, which to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:95174:97"/>
her was a moſt ſweet Liquor, by the vigour and ſtrength whereof, or to ſay more truly, by vertue of a Wives ſingular fidelity, ſhe ſo drew unto her, all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the poyſon, that the wounds being cloſed, and cicatrized, he becam perfectly healed, and ſhe caught no harm at all; what then can be heard more rare, what more admirable then this Womans faithful love? That a Wives Tongue thus annoynted, as I may ſo ſay, with faith and love to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhould from her well beloved, draw thoſe poyſons, which by an approved Phyſitian, could not be drawn; and that which many, and thoſe right exquiſite Medicines effected not, the love only, and piety of a Wife performed: Theſe are the words of the ancient Record.</p>
            <p>But we muſt not paſſe by the <hi>Mewſe</hi> ſo ſleightly; that place was called ſo of the Kings Faulcons there kept, which in former times, was an Office of high eſteem; But <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, having his Stablings at <hi>Lomeſberry,</hi> (now called <hi>Blomeſberry)</hi> which was then a Mannor in <hi>Holborn,</hi> it fortuned, that the ſame was conſumed by fire, with Hay and Horſes; whereupon, the <hi>Mewſe</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and made fit for the Kings Stables, which hath continued ever ſince, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving divers additions from time to time. But now we are, according to the method of our Diſcourſe, ſummoned to appear at <hi>Westminſter-Hall;</hi> But I had almoſt pretermitted one ſignal thing, which belongs to the great Dome or Temple of <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey,</hi> which is the great priviledge of Sanctuary it had within the Precincts thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church, the Church-yard, and the Cloſe, whereof there are two; the little, and the great Sanctuary, vulgarly now called Centry; from whence it was not lawful for the Soveraign Prince himſelf, much leſſe, any other Magiſtrate, to fetch out any that had fled thither, for any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: which Prerogative, was granted near upon a thouſand years ſince, by King <hi>Sebert,</hi> then ſeconded by King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and afterwards confirmed by <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Confeſſor, whoſe Charter I thought worthy the inſerting here, the Tenor whereof, runs thus, in the modern Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Edward <hi>by the Grace of God, King of</hi> Engliſhmen, <hi>I make it to be known to all Generations in the VVorld, after me, that by ſpecial Commandment of our holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pope</hi> Leo, <hi>I have renewed, and honoured the holy Church of the bleſſed Apoſtle, St.</hi> Peter <hi>of</hi> Weſtminſter; <hi>and I order and eſtabliſh for ever, that what Perſon, of what eſtate or condition ſoever he be, and from whence ſoever he come, or for what offence, or cauſe it be, either for his refuge into the ſaid holy place, he be aſſured of his life, liberty, and Limbs. And over I forbid under pain of everlaſting damnation, that no Miniſter of mine, or any of my Succeſſors, intermeddle themſelves with any the Goods, Lands, or poſſeſſions of the ſaid perſons, taking the ſaid Sanctuary; For I have taken their Goods and Livelihoods into my ſpecial protection. And therefore I grant to every each of them, in as much as my Terreſtrial power may ſuffice, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of freedom of joyous liberty; and whoſoever ſhall preſume, or doth contrary to this my grant, I will, he loſe his name, VVorſhip, Dignity and Power; and that with the great Traytor</hi> Judas, <hi>that betrayed our Saviour, he be in the everlaſting fire of Hell. And I will and ordain, that this my Grant, endure as long as there remaineth in</hi> England, <hi>either love or dread of Chriſtian name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Record may be ranked among the moſt ancient of the Land. About what time, King <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> did renew it, he removed St. <hi>Margarets</hi> Church, which before was within the Abbey, to the place where now it ſtands.</p>

            <head>Of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and all the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls of Juſtice, which have their motion therein; And firſt of the High Court of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving viſited God Almighties Houſe, we will now take a view of the chief <hi>Praetorium</hi> of Great Britain, which is <hi>VVeſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and of the Courts of Judicature, which are thereunto annexed; And firſt, of the Court <hi>Paramount,</hi> the high national Court of Parliament: vvhich great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel vvas uſed to be the Bulwark of our liberties, the boundary and bank vvhich kept us from ſlavery, from the inundations of Tyrannical encorachments, and unbounded <hi>VVill-Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this High Court, there was uſed to be ſuch a <hi>Co-ordination</hi> of power, ſuch a wholſome mixture 'twixt <hi>Monarchy, Optimacy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> I mean, 'twixt Prince, Peers, and Commonalty, during the time of conſultation, that of ſo many diſtinct parts, by a rare co-operation and unanimity, they made but one Body Politique (like that ſheaf of Arrowes in the Fable;) they made but one entire concentrical peece; and the reſults of their deliberations, but as ſo many harmonious Diapazons ariſing from the touch of different ſtrings. And what greater mark of freedom can there be to a people, then to be lyable to no Lawes, but what they make themſelves? to be ſubject to no Contribution, Aſſeſment, or pecuniary Levies whatſoever, but what they vote, and voluntarily yield unto themſelves. For in this great compacted <hi>Body politick,</hi> there be all degrees of people repreſented; The Yeoman, Marchant, Tradeſman, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick, have there their incluſive Votes, as well as the Gentry and Freeholders, in the perſons of their Truſtees, <hi>viz.</hi> their Burgeſſes and Knights.</p>
            <p>The Clergy alſo, which make a conſiderable part of the Common-wealth, were uſed to have their Repreſentatives there, not only in the perſons of the Biſhops (which at the firſt conſtitution, were the prime Parliament, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo many Ages) but in the Convocation which was an Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, fairly choſen to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Soveraign ſuper-intendent Councel an Epitome of this Iland only; but it may be ſaid, to repreſent the whole Univerſe, according to the primitive conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Soveraign Prince</hi> was as the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Nobles</hi> the fixed <hi>Starres,</hi> the Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Judges,</hi> and other Officers, that were wont to go with Meſſages 'twixt both Houſes, to the <hi>Planets:</hi> The <hi>Clergy</hi> (when there was a Convocation Houſe, as was ſaid before) to the <hi>Element</hi> of fire: The <hi>Commons</hi> to the ſolid body of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the reſt of the Elements.</p>
            <p>He who hath bin converſant with the Chronicles of this Iland, will finde it hath bin her fate, to be four times conquered; but the <hi>Scot,</hi> never till now of late. Theſe ſo many Conqueſts, muſt needs bring with them, many tumblings and toſſings, many diſturbances and changes in Government; yet I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that notwithſtanding theſe various tumblings, <hi>England</hi> retained ſtill the form of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and ſomething there was alwayes, that held an Analogy with the great Aſſembly of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The firſt Conqueſt was made by <hi>Claudius Caeſar,</hi> at which time it may be ſaid, that the <hi>Standard</hi> of the Croſſe came in together with the Roman Eagles; 'tis well known, how the Roman governed. He had his <hi>Comitia,</hi> which bore a
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:95174:98"/>
reſemblance with our Convention in Parliament, the place of meeting was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>praetorium,</hi> and the Lawes which were enacted, were called <hi>Plebiſcita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Saxon</hi> Conqueſt ſucceeded next, in which were the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> governed by Parliament, though it was under other names, as <hi>Michel Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, Michel Sinoth,</hi> and <hi>VVitenage Mote.</hi> There are Records near upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, of theſe Parliaments, in the Raigns of King <hi>Ina, Oſfa, Ethelbert,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The third Conqueſt was by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and they governed alſo by ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſemblies, in the Raign of <hi>Canutus</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Then came the <hi>Norman,</hi> whoſe Succeſſors did revive, and ratifie the way of governing by Parliament, witneſs <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which was uſed to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Foundation of the Engliſh liberty; and it may be compared to divers outlandiſh graffs ſet upon one ſtock: for the choyſeſt of the <hi>Britiſh, Roman, Saxon, Daniſh,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Lawes, being cull'd and pick'd out, and gathered as it were in one bundle, out of them the foreſaid grand <hi>Charter</hi> was extracted: the eſtabliſhment whereof, was a work of a Parliament: Now by an ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it was enacted, That all Statutes are repealed, which are againſt <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or <hi>Charta de foreſta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor are the Lawes of this Iland only, and the immunities of the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Parliament; but all the beſt policed Countries of <hi>Europe</hi> have the like. The <hi>Germans</hi> have their <hi>Diets:</hi> The <hi>Dane</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> their <hi>Rich-daghs.</hi> The <hi>Spaniard, las Cortes;</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Aſſembly of the three Eſtates,</hi> though it hath bin for many years diſcontinued.</p>
            <p>And touching <hi>England,</hi> the Parliament was uſed to be the principal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whence the Soveraign Prince derived his happineſs and ſafety. It was the great Conduit-Pipe, which conveighed unto him the Peoples bounty and love. It was the trueſt Looking-Glaſſe, wherein he diſcerned their affections and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.</p>
            <p>In Parliament, the Soveraign Prince uſed to appear, like the Sun in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,</hi> in the altitude of his glory, in his higheſt <hi>Royal State,</hi> as the Law tells us.</p>
            <p>But we will go now more particularly to work, and treat of this great <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Conncel,</hi> according to the firſt conſtitution, and eſtabliſhment thereof.</p>
            <p>This Court conſiſteth of the Kings Majeſty ſitting there, as in his Royal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Capacity, and of the three Eſtates of the Realm, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Lords <hi>ſpiritual Arch Biſhops</hi> and Biſhops, being in number twenty four, who ſit there by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in reſpect of their Counties, or Baronies parcel of their Biſhopricks, which they hold alſo in their <hi>politick</hi> Capacity; And every one of theſe, when any Parliament is to be holden, ought, <hi>Ex debito juſtitiae,</hi> to have a writ of Summons. The Lords <hi>Temporal</hi> Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, who ſit there, by reaſon of their Dignities, which they hold by Deſcent or Creation; and likewiſe, every one of theſe being of full age, ought to have a writ of Summons, <hi>ex debito juſtitiae;</hi> for they are called <hi>Parliamentary Barons.</hi> The third Eſtate is the <hi>Commons</hi> of the Realm, whereof there be Knights of ſhires, or Counties, Citizens of Cities, and Burgheſſes of Burghes. All which are reſpectively elected by the Shires or Counties, Cities and Burghes, by force of the Kings Writ, <hi>Ex debito juſtitiae,</hi> and none of them ought to be omitted; and theſe repreſent all the Commons of the whole Realm, and truſted for them, and were uſed to be in number, near upon 500.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>King</hi> and theſe three Eſtates, were the great Corporation or Body politick of the Kingdom; but they were to ſit in two Houſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the King and Lords in one Houſe, called the Lords Houſe, and the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes in another Houſe, called the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:95174:99"/>
The Commons are in Legal underſtanding, taken for the Franck Tenants, or Freeholders of the Counties. And whoſoever is not a Lord of Parliament, and of the Lords Houſe, is of the Houſe of the Commons, either in perſon, or by repreſentation, partly coaugmentative, and partly repreſentative.</p>
            <p>Of this Court of Parliament, the Soveraign Prince by the Law is <hi>Caput prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium &amp; finis,</hi> the head, beginning, and ending. And as in the natural body, when all the ſinews, being joyned in the head, do unite their forces together, for the ſtrengthening of the body, there is <hi>ultimum potentiae;</hi> ſo, in the politique Body, when the King and the Lords ſpiritual, and temporal, Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, are all by the Kings Command aſſembled and joyned together, under the Head in conſultation for the common good of the whole Realm, there is <hi>ultimum ſapientiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, it appears in a Parliament Roll, that the Parliament being called, as hath bin ſaid, <hi>Commune Conſilium,</hi> every member of the Houſe being a Counſellor, ſhould have the three properties of the <hi>Elephant;</hi> which are Firſt, That he hath no Gall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he be inflexible, and cannot bow.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That he is of a moſt ripe and perfect memory; which properties, as there it is ſaid, ought to be in every Member of the great Councel of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to be without Gall, that is, without malice, rancor, hear, and envie, In the Elephant, <hi>Melancholiae tranſit in nutrimentum corporis,</hi> every galliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination (if any were) ſhould tend to the good of the whole body, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he be conſtant, inflexible, and not to be bowed, or turned from the right, either for fear, reward, or favour; nor, in judgement, reſpect any perſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, of a ripe memory, that they remembring perils paſt, might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent dangers to come, as in that Roll of Parliament it appeareth.</p>
            <p>The Prince <hi>de adviſamento conſilii</hi> (for ſo be the words of the Writ of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) reſolving to have a Parliament, doth out of the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> ſend out Writs of Summons, at the leaſt forty dayes before the Parliament begins: every Lord of Parliament, either ſpiritual, as Arch biſhops, and Biſhops; or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, as Dukes, Marquiſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, and Barons, Peers of the Realm, and Lords of Parliament, were uſed to have ſeveral Writs of Summons.</p>
            <p>And all the Judges of the Realm, Barons of the Exchequer of the Coif, the Kings learned Couſnel, and the Civilians Maſters of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> are called to give their aſſiſtance and attendance, in the upper Houſe of Parliament; but they have no <hi>Voices</hi> in Parliament, being only miniſterial; and their Writs differ from the Writs to the Judges; for their Writs be, <hi>Quód interſitis Nobiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum &amp; cum caeteris de Concilio Noſtro,</hi> (&amp; ſometimes <hi>Nobiſcum</hi> only) <hi>ſuper prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſis tractaturi, veſtrumque conſilium impenſuri;</hi> But the Writ to the Barons is, <hi>Quód interſitis cum praelatis, Magnatibus &amp; proceribus, ſuper dictis negotiis trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taturi, veſtrumque Conſilium impenſuri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, in every Writ of Summons to the Biſhops, there is a clauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them to ſummon theſe perſons to appear perſonally at the Parliament, which is in theſe words, <hi>premonientes Decanum &amp; Capitulum Eccleſiae veſtrae Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicenſis, ac Archidiaconos totumque clerum veſtrae Dioces, quod iidem Decani &amp; Archi diaconi in propriis perſonis ſuis, ac dictum capitulum per unum, idem<expan>

                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>

            <p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:95174:99"/>
And theſe are called <hi>Procuratores cleri,</hi> and many times have appeared in Parliament, as ſpiritual Aſſiſtants, to conſider, conſult, and conſent, <hi>ut ſupra;</hi> but had never voyces there, becauſe they were no Lords of Parliament; And this Aſſembly was called the <hi>Convocation-Houſe,</hi> which the laſt King continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (after the diſſolution of the Parliament) and the Biſhops comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them to conſult, and make <hi>Canons,</hi> the next Parliament proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their proceedings as irregular, and prejudicial to the priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>Obſervable it is, what difference there was in the Writ, whereby the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Lords were ſummoned, and that whereby the temporal Lords were called. The <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Barons were required by the Kings Writ to be preſent, <hi>In fide &amp; dilectione quibus nobis tenemini,</hi> In the faith and <hi>love</hi> you are bound to us; But the ſecular Lords were ſummoned to appear, <hi>In fide &amp; homagio, quibus nobis tenemini.</hi> In the faith and <hi>homage</hi> you are bound unto us; Now touching the Commons, their Writ or Summons to the Sheriff runs thus.</p>

            <p>This Commiſſion or Writ, is the foundation, whereon the whole fabrick of the power, and duty of both Houſes of Parliament is grounded.</p>
            <p>The firſt Houſe is to parley, or have conference, and to treat and conſult with the King, the other Houſe is to do and conſent only unto what the other ſhall ordain.</p>
            <p>This was the Law and uſage in former times; but what is the power of the Commons in theſe dayes now that the Government is altred, and caſt into another mould, (the Houſe of Peers being diſſolved) it is not the intent of this Diſcourſe to determine.</p>
            <p>At the return of the Writs aforeſaid, the Parliament could not begin, but by the Royal preſence of the King, either in Perſon, or by Repreſentation: By Repreſentation two wayes, either by a <hi>Gardian</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by Letters Patents under the Great Seal, when the King was <hi>in remotis,</hi> out of the Realm; or by <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> under the Great Seal, to certain Lords of Parliament, repreſenting the Perſon of the King, he being within the Realm, but abſent in reſpect of ſome infirmity.</p>
            <p>On the firſt day of the Parliament, the King himſelf, or moſt commonly, the Lord Chancellor, or Keeper, in the preſence of the Lords and Commons, did ſhew the cauſes of the calling of his High Court of Parliament; but the King might have appointed any other to be his Prolocutor, in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Then the Commons are to chooſe their Speaker; but in regard, that after their choyce, the King might refuſe him; for avoiding of time and conteſtation, the uſe was as in the <hi>Conge deſlire</hi> of a Biſhop, that the King doth recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a diſcreet and learned man, whom the Commons elect; but without their Election, no <hi>Speaker</hi> can be appointed for them, becauſe he is their mouth, and intruſted by them, and ſo neceſſary, that the Houſe of Commons cannot ſit without him: therefore a grievous ſickneſs is a good cauſe to remove him, as in <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> Raign, <hi>John Chervy</hi> Speaker, was for ſickneſs diſcharged, and Sir <hi>John Dorewoold</hi> choſen in his place; but ſickneſs is no cauſe to remove any Knight, Citizen, or Burgeſſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Speaker</hi> being voted in the Houſe, was preſented to the King, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed, he made a ſupplication, conſiſting of three parts.</p>

               <item>Firſt, That the Commons in Parliament might have free ſpeech.</item>
               <item>Secondly, That in any thing he ſhould deliver in the name of the Commons, if he ſhould commit any error, no fault ſhould be imputed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, That as often as neceſſity for his Majeſties ſervice, and the good of the Common-wealth ſhall require, he may by the directions of the Houſe, have acceſs to his Royal Perſon.</item>

            <p>Any of the Peers, by the Kings leave, may abſent himſelf, and make a proxy to another Lord; but a Knight, Citizen, or Burgeſs, cannot make a <hi>Proxy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is elected, and intruſted by multitudes of people. And it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, though one be choſen for one particular County or City, yet when he is returned, and ſits in Parliament, he ſerveth for the whole Common-wealth.</p>

There belongs to Parliament, a <hi>Prorogation,</hi> or <hi>adjournment,</hi> which differ in this: A <hi>Prorogation</hi> Preſuppoſeth a <hi>Seſsion,</hi> and then ſuch Bills as paſſed in either Houſe, or by both Houſes, and had no Royal aſſent unto them, muſt at the next Aſſembly begin again; for every Seſſion in Parliament, is in Law a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parliament; but if it be but adjourned, then there is no Seſſion.</p>
            <p>When a Parliament is called, and doth ſit, and is diſſolved without any Act paſſed, or judgement given, it is no <hi>Seſsion</hi> of Parliament, but a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetion.</hi>

            <head>OF THE COVRT OF THE KINGS-BENCH, THE <hi>Royalleſt</hi> Court in the Land; Now called, The <hi>Upper Bench.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> preſuppoſe the King to be the Fountain and Oracle of Juſtice, and to have ſpecial inſpirations from Heaven to that purpoſe; therefore all the Tribunals of Judicature, were uſed to be <hi>ambulatory</hi> with his Court, and He was wont to ſit in Perſon in the <hi>Upper Bench,</hi> which is the Supreme Tribunal of the Land.</p>
            <p>The Juſtices in this Court, are the ſoveraign Juſtices of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> Goal-delivery, Conſervation of the Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Realm.</p>
            <p>In this Court the Kings of this Realm have ſat, as being the higheſt Bench, and the Judges of that Court on the lower Bench at his Feet; but Judicature only belongeth to the Judges of that Court, and in his preſence they anſwer all Motions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Juſtices of this Court are the ſoveraign Coroners of the Land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where the Sheriffs and Coroners may receive appeals by Bill <hi>à fortiori,</hi> the Juſtices of this Court may do it: ſo High is the authority of this Court, that when it comes and ſits in any County, the Juſtices of <hi>Eire,</hi> of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> Goal-delivery, they which have <hi>Conuſance, &amp;c.</hi> do ceaſe without any writing to them; But if any Indictment of Treaſon or Felony in a Forain County, be removed before certain Commiſſioners of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> in the County where this Court ſits, yet they may proceed, becauſe this Court (for that this Indictment, was not removed before them) cannot proceed for that offence; But if any Indictment be taken in <hi>Midd.</hi> in the vacation, and after this Court ſit in the next Term in the ſame County (if this Court be adjourned) then may ſpecial Commiſſioners of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> &amp;c. in the interim proceed upon that Indictment; but the more uſual way is by ſpecial Commiſſion. And this was reſolved by all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Wincheſter, Anno 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Jacobi Regis,</hi> in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> and others, and ſo had it been reſolved, <hi>Mich.</hi> 25 and 26 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Arden</hi> and <hi>Somervile,</hi> for this kind of ſpecial

            <p>There have been for a long time, and ſtill there are great Complaints for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Suits in Law, and it were a wholſome and happy thing, could it be prevented: but becauſe a Diſeaſe cannot be cured without knowledge of the Cauſe, it is to be obſerved, that there be ſix Cauſes of the increaſe of them, whereof two be general, the other four particular; The general be Peace, and Plenty; The particular, 1. The diſſolution of ſo many Monaſteries, Chante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the diſperſing of them into ſo many ſeveral hands. 2. The ſwarm of Informers. 3. The number of Concealors. 4. The multiude of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneys.</p>
            <p>For the firſt general; In the Reign of <hi>E. 3. R. 2. H. 4. H.</hi> 5. and part of the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 6. in reſpect of the wars in <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; in the reſidue of the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 6. &amp; in the Reign of <hi>E.</hi> 4. in reſpect of the bloody &amp; inteſtine Wars, &amp; in almoſt continual Alarms within the bowls of this Kingdom, between the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> &amp; <hi>York,</hi> there could not be ſo many Suits in Law, as ſince this Kingdom hath enjoyed Peace, which is the firſt general cauſe. Peace is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Plenty, (which is the <hi>2d</hi> general cauſe) and Plenty the Nurſe of Suits. In particulars, by the diſſolution of Monaſteries, Chanteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and diſperſing of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon the Statutes made concerning the ſame (there being ſuch a confluence of Eccleſiaſtical poſſeſſions) there aroſe many queſtions, and doubts, whereupon Suits were greatly increaſed. 2. Informers and Relators raiſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Suits, by Informations, Writs, &amp;c. in the Kings Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on penal Statutes, many whereof were <hi>obſolete,</hi> inconvenient, and not fit for thoſe daies, and yet remained as ſnares upon the Subject, ſo as the Subject might juſtly ſay with <hi>Tacitus, Priùs vitiis laboravimus, nunc legibus.</hi> 3. Concealers; <hi>Helluones</hi> that endeavoured to ſwallow up Cathedral Churches, and the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical poſſeſſions of Church-men, and the Livings of many others of the Kings Subjects. Laſtly, the multitude of Atturneys, more than is limited by Law, is a great cauſe of encreaſe of Suits.</p>
            <p>Touching the jurisdiction of this Court, which was uſed to be called the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> it is of a larger extent of power, and more incontroulable than any other Tribunal: for the Law preſums, that the King is there ſtill in Perſon.

The ſtyle of the Court of the Kings Bench is <hi>Coram Rege,</hi> (as hath been ſaid) and the ſtyle of this Court of Chancery is <hi>Coram domino Rege in Cancellaria,</hi> and <hi>Additio probat minoritatem;</hi> And in this Court, the Lord Chancelor or the Lord Keeper is the ſole Judge, and in the Kings Bench there are four Judges at the leaſt.</p>
            <p>This Court is <hi>Officina Juſticiae,</hi> out of which all original Writs, and all Commiſſions which paſſe under the Great Seal go forth; which Great Seal is <hi>Clavis regni,</hi> and for thoſe ends this Court is ever open.</p>
            <p>And this Court is the rather alwaies open, for that if a man be wrongfully impriſoned in the Vacation, the Lord Chancellor may grant a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and do him Juſtice according to Law, where neither the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> nor <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas,</hi> can grant that Writ, but in the term time; but this Court may grant it either in Term time or Vacation: ſo likewiſe this Court may grant Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at any time, either in Term or Vacation: which Writs of Prohibition are not retornable, but if they be not obeyed, then may this Court grant an <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment,</hi> upon the Prohibition retornable, either in the Kings Bench or Common Place.</p>

            <p>Having ſpoken ſomewhat of this Court's ordinary Jurisdiction, ſomething ſhall be ſaid of the extraordinary proceedings thereof, according to the Rule of <hi>Equity, ſecundum aequum et bonum,</hi> or according to the dictates of Conſcience; for the Lord Chancelor, or Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>Keeper of the Kings Conſcience,</hi> for mitigation of the rigour of the Common Law. Yet this Court of Equity proceeding by Engliſh Bill, is no Court of Record; therefore it can bind but the <hi>Perſon</hi> only, and neither the <hi>State</hi> of the Defendants Lands, nor property of his <hi>Goods,</hi> and Chattles; therefore if the Lord Chancelor impoſe any fine, it is void in Law, he having no power but on the <hi>Perſon</hi> only.</p>
            <p>Yet the Lord Chancelor or Keeper, is ſole Judge both in this Court of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in the Court concerning the Common Law; but in caſes of weight or difficulty, he doth aſſiſt himſelf with ſome of the Judges: and no greater excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be taken hereunto, than in caſe of the Lord <hi>Steward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> being ſole Judge in tryal of the Nobility, who alſo is aſſiſted with ſome of the Judges.</p>
            <p>Touching this Court of Equity, the ancient Rule is, that three things are to be conſidered in a Court of Conſcience; <hi>Covin, Accident, and Breach of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> All Covins, colluſions, frauds, and deceits, for which ther's no remedy by the ordinary courſe of Law. <hi>Accident,</hi> as when the ſervant of an Obligo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IN times paſs'd, the Courts and Benches, or Banks of Juſtices (as was touched before) followed the Kings Perſon whereſoever he wert, as well ſince the Conqueſt as before: which thing being found chargeable and cumberſome; The ninth of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, it was reſolved, that there ſhould be a ſtanding place appointed, where matters ſhould be heard and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; And the Court of the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> was the firſt that was fix'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in tenures of Lands, and civil Actions uſed to be pleaded; And it is one of the Statutes of <hi>Magna Charta, Quod Communia placita non ſequantur Curiam noſtram ſed teneantur loco certo,</hi> That the Common Pleas follow not our Court, but be kept in a certain place. Now, <hi>Pleas</hi> are diſtinguiſhed into Pleas of the Crown, as Treaſon and Felony, with miſpriſion of Treaſon and Felony, (which belong to the Upper Bench) and to Common or Civil Pleas, whereof this Court takes Cognizance: This Court therefore is call'd, the <hi>Lock and Key</hi> of the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and the Judges there ſitting had need to be more knowing, and learned than any other; for here all Reall Actions whereupon Fines and recoveries, the common aſſurances of the Land do paſſe, and all other reall Actions by original Writs, are to be determined, as alſo of all Common Pleas mixt or perſonal, in divers of which the Kings Bench, &amp; this Court have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current authority; But regularly this Court cannot hold Common Plea in any Action, real, mix'd or perſonal, but by Writ out of the Chancery and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnable to this Court; yet this Court in ſome caſes may hold Plea by Bill without any Writ in the Chancery: as for, or againſt any Officer, Miniſter, or priviledged Perſon of this Court. This Court alſo, without any Writ may upon a ſuggeſtion grant <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> to keep Temporal as well as Eccleſiaſtical Courts, within their bounds and jurisdictions, without any Original, or Plea depending; for the Common Law, which in thoſe caſes is a Prohibition of it ſelf, ſtands inſtead of an Original.</p>
            <p>The Chief Juſtice of this Court, is created by <hi>Letters Patents</hi> during the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Prince, and ſo are the reſt of his Aſſociats, but none is capable to be conſtituted a Judge here, unleſſe he be a <hi>Sargeant</hi> at Law of the degree of the <hi>Coif.</hi> The juriſdiction of this Court is general &amp; extendeth throughout <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>THe Authority of this Court is of Original Jurisdiction, without any Commiſſion.

The greateſt Officer of all is the Lord <hi>Treaſurer.</hi> In this Court are heard, thoſe that are <hi>Delators</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> in popular or penal Actions, having thereby part of the profit aſſign'd unto them by the Law. In this Court, if any queſtion be, 'tis determined by the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> by twelve men, and all Subſidies, Taxes, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes by account; For in this Office the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of the Counties do attend upon the execution of the Commandements of the Judges.

            <p>This Court is divided into two parts, <hi>viz. Judicial accounts</hi> called, <hi>Scaccarum computorum,</hi> And into the <hi>Receit of the Exchequer,</hi>

            <p>The prime Officer of this Court, as was mentioned before, is the Lord high <hi>Treaſurer</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who receives a <hi>White Staff</hi> from the King; But in former time he had this Office by delivery of a <hi>Golden Key.</hi> Then there is <hi>Cancellarius Scaccarii</hi> the Chancelor of the Exchequer, who keepeth the Seal: Then you have the chief <hi>Baron,</hi> and his Aſſociates, whereof one, though he ſits there, yet he hath no voice; therefore he was uſed to be call'd by way of Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, <hi>Baron Tell-clock,</hi> yet he takes the ſame Oath that others do, he hath a Fee of 100 Marks <hi>per annum,</hi> At daies of <hi>prefixions,</hi> he hath to do with the Sheriffs Accounts, he can take Recognizances; but he hath not the Robes, nor any ſuffrage upon the Bench in point of Judicature; And that nickname Baron <hi>Tellclock</hi> came up firſt in Baron <hi>Southertons</hi> time, who when he felt the Chimes ring in his Stomach towards dinner, he was us'd to tell chief Baron <hi>Tanfield, My Lord'tis twelve a clock.</hi>

Now, it is to be obſerv'd, that albeit the <hi>Barons</hi> are the ſole Judges of the Exchequer Court, yet the Lord Treaſurer is joyn'd with them, in keeping of the Records. The Lord Treaſurer hath alſo granted him by Patent under the great Seal, <hi>Theſaurarium Scaccarii Regis Angliae,</hi> which of ancient time, as the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> hath it, was a diſtinct Office by it ſelf.</p>

The Original inſtitution of the <hi>Pipe Office</hi> was taken from a Conduit of water, which was conveyed by Pipes into a Ceſtern which lay in a Court: or as water is derived from many Fountains Springs, by Aquaeducts into a Ceſtern Houſe, and from thence into ſeveral Offices of the ſame: ſo this golden and ſilver ſtream is drawn from ſundry Courts as Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Juſtice, and other Springs of Revenue reduc'd and collected into one Pipe, and thereby conveyed into the Grand Ceſtern of the Princes receit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore, all Accounts and Debts to the Crown, are delivered and collected out of the Offices of the Kings <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> and Treaſurers Remembrancer, and ſo drawn, and put in charge in the Pipe. There be five Auditors of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Royal within the ſurvey of this Court, and their Office is, to take Accounts of the Kings Receivers, Sheriffs, Eſcheators, Collectors, and Cuſtomers, and to audite and perfect the Account; But an Auditor cannot allow any Licence or Grant, in regard he knoweth not whether it be good this belongs to the Barons; Neither can the Auditor put any thing in Charge, his Office being only to take and audite Accounts. There is the Auditor of the Preſts, whoſe Office it is to take the Accounts of the <hi>Mint, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Barwick,</hi> and of all other impreſted or moneys advanc'd before hand.</p>
            <p>Then is there the Auditor of the Receits, which is an Office very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and conſiſting of many parts; For firſt, he is a kind of Filazer; for he fileth the Tellers Bills, and entreth them. Secondly, he is a Remembrancer, for he gives the Lord Treaſurer a certificate of the money received the week before. Then he is an Auditor, for he makes Debenturs to every Teller, before they pay any money, and takes and audites their Accounts. Beſides all this, he keepeth the black Book of Receits, and the Lord Treaſurers Key of the Treaſury, and ſeeth every Tellers money lock'd up in the new Treaſury. Of thoſe Tellers there are four, and their Office conſiſts in four duties.</p>

            <p>In the Exchequer Chamber, all caſes of difficulty, either in the Kings bench, or the Common Pleas, were uſed to be debated, argued, and reſolved by all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> and the Exchequer <hi>Barons.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Treaſurer</hi> of the Kings Chamber, and the Keeper of the privy purſe, with ſuch domeſtick Offices of the Kings Houſe, are not ſubject to this Court of Exchequer.</p>
            <p>This Court was firſt erected for the particular profit and ſervice of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince; And this profit is mediat or immediat; Immediat, as of Lands,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:95174:106"/>
Rents, Franchiſes, Hereditaments, Debts, Duties, Accounts, Goods, Chattels, and other profits, and benefits whatſoever due unto the Soveraign Prince. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, as the priviledge of the Officers, and Miniſters of the Court; for two things do principally ſupport the juriſdiction of a Court (as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> hath it) firſt the preſervation of the dignity thereof, and then the due attendance of the Officers and Miniſters of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The chief Baron is created by Letters Patents, and the Office is granted, <hi>Quamdiu ſe bene geſſerit,</hi> wherein he hath a more fixed eſtate, it being an eſtate of life, than the Juſtices of other Benches have, who are <hi>durante beneplacoto;</hi> And in like manner are the reſt of the Barons, conſtituted with the Patents of the Attorney General and Solicitor.</p>
            <p>There is a Court called the Court of Equity in the Exchequer Chamber. The Judges of this Court are the Lord Treaſurer, the Chancelor of the Exchequer, and the Barons; Their juriſdiction is as large for matter of Equity, as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the Exchequer have for the benefit of the King by the common Law, but if in either Court they hold any Plea that doth not concern the profit of the King, there lieth a Prohibition.</p>
            <p>To conclude, there are ſeven Courts that belong to the Exchequer. 1. The Court of Pleas or of the Barons. 2. The Court of Accounts. 3. The Court of Receits. 4. The Court of the Exchequer Chamber, being the Aſſembly of all the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for matters in Law. 5. The Court of Exchequer for Errors in the Court of Exchequer. 6. A Court in the Exchequer Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for Errors in the Kings Bench. 7. The Court of Equity, ſpoken of a little before.</p>
            <p>But touching all the Officers, either coordinate or inferior, that belong to the Exchequer, and the Revenues Cuſtomes, &amp; perquiſits of the Soveraign Prince, they are very many, &amp; far more in number than in any other Court as was tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before; yet nothing ſo numerous as thoſe Financiers, and ſwarm of other Officers which belong to the Revenues of <hi>France,</hi> which are ſo many that their fees being payed there comes not a <hi>Quardecu</hi> in every Crown clearly to the Kings Coffers, which is but the fourth part: But there is one publick advantage in it, that thouſands of younger Brothers, and others, have a hanſome ſubſiſtance, to carry themſelves hereby in the garbe and equipage of men.</p>

            <head>OF THE COURT <hi>OF</hi> ADMIRALTY.</head>
            <p>HAving thus made ſome inſpections into ſo many Courts, we muſt not pretermit the <hi>Court of Admiralty;</hi> for <hi>Great Britain</hi> being an Iſland which makes the Sea, and Woodden Caſtles, to be her chiefeſt Conſervators: the Court of <hi>Admiralty</hi> may be ſaid to be more pertinent and neceſſary to her, then to divers other States: therefore the Lord High Admiral is by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> one of the four Officers of the Crown, with the Lord Chancelor, the Lord Treaſurer, and Lord privy Seal. Some hold the Etymology of <hi>Admirall,</hi> to come from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifieth <hi>Salſugomaris,</hi> the ſaltneſs of the Sea; others derive it from <hi>Ammir,</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> word, which ſignifieth a King, or Emperor; And ſome would have it to come from the low Dutch, <hi>Aen-meer-all,</hi> which ſignifie, <hi>on the Sea all,</hi> The Reader, according as his own judgement leads him, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to which he pleaſe; for I know of none that have poſitively aſſerted, which is the trueſt.</p>
            <p>But to know the nature and juriſdiction of this Court, it will conduce very much, if we inſert here certain grievances which the Lord Admiral preſented in the <hi>8th</hi> year of K. <hi>James,</hi> concerning <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> granted by the Judges of the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> againſt the Juriſdiction and Prerogatives of this Court, with the anſwer which the Judges returned to every point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Objection was, that whereas the cognizance of all Contracts, and other things done upon the Sea, belongeth to the Admirals juriſdiction, the ſame are made tryable at the common Law, as if they had bin done in <hi>Cheapſide</hi> and ſuch places.</p>
            <p>The Judges of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> anſwered, that by the Lawes of the Realm, the Court of the Admiral hath no cognizance, power, or juriſdiction of any manner of Contract, plea, or querele, within any County of the Realm, either upon the Land or the water; but every Contract, Plea, or querele, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things ariſing in any County of the Realm, either upon the Land, or the water; and alſo Wrecks of the Sea, ought to be tryed, diſcuſſed, determined, and remedied by the common Lawes of the Land, and not before, or by, the Admiral or his Lieutenant, in any manner; ſo that it is not material, whether the place be upon the water, <hi>intra fluxum &amp; refluxum aqua,</hi> or whether it be upon any other water within the precincts of a County. But the ſaid Judges acknowledged, that of Contracts, pleas, and quereles, made upon the Sea, or any part thereof, which is not within any County, from whence no tryal can be had by twelve men, the Admiral hath, and ought to have juriſdiction. And no preſident can be ſhewed, that any Prohibition hath bin granted for any plea, contract, or querele, concerning any Marine cauſe, made or done upon the Sea, taking that only to be the Sea, wherein the Admiral hath his juriſdiction, which is before deſcribed by Law to be out of any County.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:95174:107"/>
2. The ſecond Objection was, that when actions are brought to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, upon Bargains and Contracts, made beyond the Seas, wherein the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law cannot adminiſter juſtice; yet in theſe caſes, prohibitions are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, in prejudice of the Court of Admiralty.</p>
            <p>The Judges anſwer, that Bargains and Contracts made beyond the Sea, wherein the common Law cannot adminiſter juſtice, do belong to the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Marſhal; For the juriſdiction of the Admiralty, is wholly confined to the Sea, which is out of any County; but if any Indenture, Bond, or other ſpecialty, or any Contract, be made beyond the Seas, for doing of any act, or payment of any money, within this Realm, or otherwiſe, wherein the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law can adminiſter juſtice, and give ordinary redreſs: In theſe caſes, neither the Conſtable nor Marſhal, nor the Court of Admiralty, hath any juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: therefore when that Court hath proceeding, in derogation of the common Law, prohibitions have bin iſſued out, as by the Law they ought.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Objection was, that whereas time out of minde, the Court of Admiralty hath taken ſtipulations for appearance, and performance of the acts and judgements of the ſame Court, It is now affirmed, by the Judges of the common Law, that the Admirals Court, is no Court of Record, and therefore not able to take ſuch ſtipulations: hereupon, prohibitions are granted, to the utter overthrow of that juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>The Judges anſwered, that the Court of the Admiralty, proceeding by the courſe of the Civil Law, is no Court of Record, and therefore cannot take any ſuch a recognizance as a Court of Record may. And for taking Recognizanſes againſt the Law of the Realm, we finde, that prohibitions have bin granted. And if an erroneous ſentence be given in that Court, no Writ of Error, but an appeal before certain Delegates do lye, which proves, 'tis no Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Objection was, that Charter parties, made only to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon the Seas, are daily withdrawn from that Court by prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The Judges anſwered, That if the Charter party be made within any City, Port-Town, or County of this Realm, although it be to be performed, either upon the Seas, or beyond the Seas, yet it is to be tryed and determined by the ordinary courſe of the Common Law, and not in the Court of the Admiralty, And therefore, when that Court hath encroached upon the common Law, in that caſe, the Iudge of the Admiralty, and party there ſuing, have bin prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and oftentimes the party condemned, in great and grievous dammages, by the Lawes of the Realm.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth Objection was, that not withſtanding the clauſe of <hi>Nou obſtante ſtatuto,</hi> which hath foundation in his Majeſties Prerogative, and is current in all other grants; yet in the Lord Admirals Patent, 'tis ſaid to be of no force, to warrant the determination of the Cauſes, committed to him in his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Patent, and ſo rejected by the Iudges of the common Law.</p>
            <p>The common Lawyers anſwer, that without all queſtion, the ſundry Statutes which declare the juriſdiction of the Court of Admiralty, and wherein all the Subjects of the Realm have intereſt, cannot be diſpenſed with, by any <hi>non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante ſtatuto;</hi> and therefore not worthy of any anſwer; but by colour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Court of Admiralty hath, contrary to thoſe Acts of Parliament, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon the Juriſdiction of the common Law, to the intolerable grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Subjects, which hath oftentimes urged them to complain, in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ordinary Courts of juſtice in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> for their relief in that behalf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſixth Objection was, that to the end that the Admirals juriſdiction, might receive all manner of empeachment, and interruption, the Rivers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the firſt Bridges where it ebbeth and floweth, and all the Creeks and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:95174:107"/>
Ports are by the Iudges of the common Law, affirmed to be no part of the Sea, nor within the Admirals juriſdiction, and thereupon, prohibitions are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily awarded upon actions depending in that Court for Contracts, and other things done in thoſe places, notwithſtanding, that by uſe and practiſe, time out of minde, the Admirals Court hath had juriſdiction, within ſuch Ports, Creeks, and Rivers.</p>
            <p>The Judges anſwer was like to their firſt, And 'twas further added, that for the death of a man, or mayhm in thoſe two caſes, only done in great Ships, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hovering in the main ſtream only, beneath the point of ſome Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers nigh unto the Sea, and no other place of the ſame Rivers, nor in other cauſes, but only in thoſe two, the Admiral hath cognizance. But for all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, Pleas, and Quereles, made or done upon a River, Haven, or Creek with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any County of this Realm, the Admiral without queſtion hath no juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for then he ſhould hold plea of things, done within the Body of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are tryable by verdict of twelve men, and meerly determinable by the common Law, and not within the Court of the Admiralty, according to the Civil Law; for that were to change and alter the Lawes of the Realm in like caſes, and make thoſe Contracts, Pleas, and Quereles, tryable by the common Law of the Realm, to be drawn off <hi>ad aliud Examen,</hi> and to be ſentenced by the Iudges of the Admiralty, according to the Civil Law.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ſeventh Objection was, that the Agreement made <hi>Anno</hi> 1575. between the Judges of the Kings Bench, and the Court of the Admiralty, for the more quiet and certain Execution of Admiral Iuriſdiction, is not obſerved as it ought to be.</p>
            <p>The Iudges anſwered, that the ſuppoſed Agreement, mentioned in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, hath not as yet bin delivered them; but having heard the ſame read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Majeſty; they anſwer'd, that for ſo much thereof, as differeth from theſe anſwers, it is againſt the Lawes, and Statutes of this Realm: therefore the Iudges of the Kings Bench, never aſſented thereunto, as was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The eighth Objection was, That many other grievances there were, which in diſcuſſing of theſe former, would eaſily appear worthy of Reformation.</p>
            <p>To this the Judges anſwered, that this Article was ſo general, as no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar anſwer can be made thereunto, only it appeareth, by that which hath bin ſaid, that the Lord Admiral his Officers and Miniſters principally by colour of that <hi>Non obſtante,</hi> and for want of learned advice, have injuſtly encroached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the common Lawes of this Realm; for which the marvel is the leſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Lord Admiral his Lieutenants, Officers, and Miniſters, have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all colour, intruded upon the Right and Prerogative due to the Crown, in that they have ſeized and converted to their own uſe, Goods and Chattels, of infinite value taken at Sea; and other Goods and Chattels, which in no ſort, appertain unto his Lordſhip, by his Letters Patents, wherein the ſaid <hi>Non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante</hi> is contained; and for which, he and his Officers, remain accountable to his Majeſty; And they now wanting, in this time of peace, cauſes apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to their natural juriſdiction, do now encroach upon the juriſdiction of the common Law, leſt they ſhould ſit idle, and reap no profit.</p>
            <p>They added further, That touching their proceedings in granting of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions concerning any of the ſaid <hi>Articles,</hi> two things were to be conſidered of, firſt the <hi>matter,</hi> then the <hi>manner;</hi> touching the matter, nothing hath bin done therein, by the Court of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but by good Warrant of Law, and former judicial Precedents; And for the manner, they granted none in the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation time, nor in their Terme time, in any of their Chambers, nor in the Court in the Terme-time, <hi>ex officio,</hi> but upon motion made in open Court, by learned Councel; and after a day prefixed, and warning given to the adverſe party, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:95174:108"/>
Hereupon they proceeded, to prove and confirm their anſwers, by three kind of Authorities in Law.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, By Authority of High Court of Parliament.</item>
               <item>Secondly, By Judgement, and judicial Precedents.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, By Book-Caſes.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Concerning the Acts of Parliament, they urged the Statute of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Admiralls and their Deputies, ſhall not meddle from henceforth, with any thing done within the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>but only with things done upon the Sea, according to that which hath been duly uſed in the time of the Noble King</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Grandfather to</hi> Richard <hi>the ſecond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the ſecond proof by Judgements, and <hi>Judicial Precedents,</hi> and the third by <hi>Book-Caſes,</hi> they alledged divers Caſes, which are to be ſeen in that great light, and laborious Champion of the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in the third part of his <hi>Inſtitutes;</hi> But, the Reſult of all which the Iudges of the Common Law driv' at, was, that the Court of Admiralty, was to take no Cognizance, nor had power to determine any thing that had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhould give occaſion of Plea, upon any Waters, either freſh or ſalt, that were within the Precincts of any County; but it was tryable by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of <hi>England,</hi> and by the Empanelment, and Verdict of twelve men, which is not the way of Tryal of the Civil Law, by which the Admiralty is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
            <p>By this notable claſh, and conteſtation 'twixt the Iudges of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> and the <hi>Lord Admiral,</hi> the Reader may learn what the extent of the Authority of that Court is, and that the juriſdiction of the Admiral is confined to the high Sea.</p>
            <p>In times paſt, there were diſtinct Admirals, in point of power, as we read in <hi>Richard</hi> the ſeconds Raign, the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was Admiral of the North; and the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> Admiral of the Weſt: who were to receive the Subſidy of Poundage and Tonnage, for the garding of the Seas.</p>
            <p>Among other Prerogatives, which belonged to the Lord Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> one was to erect <hi>Beacons</hi> upon the Maritim Coaſts; which word, is derived from the old <hi>Saxon,</hi> or <hi>Dutch Becnam,</hi> which ſignifieth, to give a ſigne, as we uſe the word, to <hi>becken at</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p>Before the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> there were but ſtakes of Wood, ſet upon high places, which were fired, upon the diſcovery of any enemies; but in his time, pitched Barrels were ſet up; and by the Law of the Land, whoſoever fired a <hi>Beacon, commits Felony,</hi> unleſs there were Authority and juſt cauſe for it.</p>
            <p>In other Countries they are called <hi>Phares,</hi> which are no other then <hi>ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> or maritime monitory fires, which ſerve for two ends, as well to direct Sea faring men, as to fore-warn the approach of an Enemy; which with ſuch wonderful celerity, give the whole Land an Alarum, and ſo puts them in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of defence.</p>
            <p>But there are three main matters, whereof the Lord Admiral is to take Cognizance, which are <hi>Flotſan, Jetſan,</hi> and <hi>Lagan:</hi> whereof the firſt is, when a Ship is ſunk and periſhed, and the Goods floating upon the waters: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is <hi>Jetſan,</hi> when in ſtreſſe of weather, or other occaſions, the Goods are thrown over-board. The third is, when Goods are tyed to a Cork, or Cable, and may be found again; But the Court of Admiralty, hath not to do with <hi>Wrecks;</hi> for then the Goods are depoſited in the cuſtody of the Officers of the next Town, where, if the Proprietor come within a twelve moneth and a day, he may claim them by Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:95174:108"/>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth did conſtitute by Charter, <hi>John Holland,</hi> Duke of <hi>Exceter,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> his Son, to be <hi>Admirallos Angliae:</hi> But the Iudges of the Common Law, held that Charter to be invalid; and the Reaſon they alledged, was, that that Charter being of a <hi>Judicial</hi> Office, it could not be granted to two.</p>
            <p>When the former conteſtation happened 'twixt the Court of <hi>Admiralty</hi> and <hi>Weſtminster-Hall,</hi> they were choyſe powerful men at that time, who ſwayed as <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Common Law,</hi> as Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> Iudge <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge,</hi> and <hi>Hubbard,</hi> which made them carry the Bucklers from the <hi>Civilians,</hi> at that time; But there were ſome learned Treatiſes publiſhed afterward, to vindicate the Right of the <hi>Civil Law;</hi> which, without controverſie, hath more in it of natural equity, and reaches of pure Reaſon, then any other: It is the Product of that mighty Monarchy of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who though they conquered by the <hi>Lance,</hi> yet they conſerved by their <hi>Lawes,</hi> ſo many vaſt diſtant Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Nations, which they had ſubdued, leading ſo many people Captive by their <hi>policy,</hi> as much as by their <hi>Proweſſe;</hi> And indeed, the <hi>Civil Law</hi> is fitted for the general Affaires of mankind, and for all Nations; For though every particular ſtate hath ſome few municipal Lawes peculiar to it ſelf: yet no where beyond the Seas is there any profeſſion or Science of Law but of the <hi>Civil;</hi> nor are there any other ſtudied in <hi>Univerſities.</hi> Only in <hi>England</hi> there are <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> which are equivalent to an <hi>Academy,</hi> where <hi>lex Terrae,</hi> or the common municipal Law of the Land is ſtudied, and Graduates proceed, and are made therein accordingly, which is no where elſe; But the <hi>Civil Law</hi> extends to all man-kind. And, if regard be had to the Univerſity of humane Reaſon, it is no where ſo narrowly diſcuſſed, and eventilated, and the judgement rectified by clear notions: Moreover, there is nothing, of what nature ſoever it be but the <hi>Civil Law</hi> hath ordained a means to bring it to a Tryal, either by giving a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall action in the caſe, or a general one releeving by ordinary remedies; or if thoſe fail, by ſuch as are extraordinary, helping the Clyent, <hi>Jure actionis,</hi> or <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio Judicis.</hi> Yet there was one notable Example of one buſineſs, that not only cauſed a claſh 'twixt the <hi>Civilian,</hi> and <hi>Common Lawyer,</hi> but puzzel'd them both, ſo that neither could try it. It was, that one <hi>Peacock,</hi> ſtruck <hi>Lacy in alto Mari,</hi> and the Ship landing at <hi>Scarborough, Lacy</hi> dyed a little after, of the ſtroke that was given at Sea: there was a great conteſtation, whether the Court of Admiralty, or the common Lawyer, ſhould try <hi>Peacock;</hi> but it was found, that the cogniſance hereof belonged to neither, ſo the party eſcaped without condemnation.</p>
            <p>But now we will reſume the thred of our Survay of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and add to that which hath bin already ſpoken of the <hi>Great Hall,</hi> which as it hath bin, and continueth ſtill the uſual place of pleadings, and miniſtration of Juſtice; ſo it was in former times, the principal Seat, and Palace of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the Conqueſt; for here the Feaſts of Coronation, and other ſolemn Feaſts, as that of <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> were kept: It is recorded, that at the day of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, <hi>Henry</hi> the third commanded his Treaſurer, <hi>William de Haverhull,</hi> to cauſe 6000. poor people to be fed at <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> upon the Kings account; <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> the Kings Brother, <hi>Anno</hi> 1243. being married to <hi>Cincia,</hi> Daughter to the Counteſſe of Provence, kept his Bridall Feaſt at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall,</hi> where, the ſtory ſaith, there were three thouſand diſhes of meat, ſerved in at dinner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rich.</hi> the ſecond having repaired the Great Hall which had bin burnt by a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful fire, kept his <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> there, in a moſt ſumptuous manner, with Juſtings, and running at Tilt, where there was ſuch a huge confluence of People, that for divers dayes, there were ſpent 26. fat Oxen, and 300 Sheep. The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wore a Gown of Cloth of Gold, garniſhed with precious ſtones, which was valued at 3000 marks, a mighty ſum in thoſe dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:95174:109"/>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> keeping his <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> invited <hi>Ralph Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> with all the Aldermen, to a Feaſt on <hi>Twelf day,</hi> The King, the Queen, and ſome Ambaſſadors, ſate at the Marble Table, 60. Knights and Enquires, ſerved in the Kings meat, which conſiſted of 60. diſhes, and the Queen as many. The Mayor was ſerved with 24. where after ſundry ſort of diſports, he ſupped alſo, and it was break of day, before He, and the Aldermen returned by Barges to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Parliaments alſo were uſed to be kept frequently at <hi>Weſtminster-Hall,</hi> and one was kept in <hi>Richard</hi> the ſeconds time, which proved fatal unto him; for he was depoſed there, notwithſtanding, that he had bin the greateſt Repairer of that Hall, when it had bin deſtroyed by fire. For it hath bin the hard deſtiny of this Great Hall, to ſuffer many times the fury of fire; but the laſt that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, was in the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths Raign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1512. at which time, a great part of the Palace was conſumed which was never re-edified ſince; ſo that the Kings Courts, have bin from that time, ſometimes at <hi>Baynards</hi> Caſtle, then at <hi>Bridewell,</hi> and ſince at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> called before, <hi>York place,</hi> as hath bin ſaid before.</p>
            <p>In this great Palace at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> there was St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Chappel, which was built by King <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelf; It was repaired and enlarged by <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and 38. perſons were appointed there to ſerve God, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Dean,</hi> 12. ſecular Canons, 13. Vicars, 4. Clarks, 6. Choriſts, a Verger, and a Keeper of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who had endowments, and Houſes built them near the Thames: there were alſo, Lodgings aſſigned them, 'twixt the Clock-houſe, and the Wooll-Staple, called the <hi>Weigh-houſe:</hi> He alſo built for their uſe, a ſtrong Clochard, in the little Sanctuary, covered with Lead, where there were three great Bells, which uſually rung at Coronations, and Funeralls of Princes, which gave ſuch a huge ſound, that 'twas commonly ſaid, they ſowred all the drink in the Town; but now there's ſcarce any marks left of that Clochard.</p>
            <p>This Chappel of St. <hi>Stephens,</hi> at the ſuppreſſion in <hi>Henry</hi> the eights time, was valued to diſpend one thouſand eighty five pounds; and in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixths time it was made to ſerve as a Parliament for the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> who formerly were uſed to ſit in the <hi>Chapter-houſe</hi> of the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before the Great Hall, there is a large Court, called now the new Palace, where there is a ſtrong Tower of Stone, containing a Clock, which ſtriketh on a great Bell every houre, to give notice to the Judges, how the time paſſeth; when the wind is <hi>South South-Weſt,</hi> it may be heard into any part of <hi>London,</hi> and commonly, it preſageth wet weather: The <hi>Dean</hi> of St. <hi>Stephens,</hi> was uſed to have the keeping of this Clock, having ſix pence every day out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> for keeping the <hi>Kings Clock,</hi> or Great <hi>Tom</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt now make a ſtep Southward, before we leave <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſome further devotions to the old Abbey, the prime Sanctuary of the Land; whereunto belongs another very ancient priviledged place, and Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of St. <hi>Martin le Grand,</hi> hard by <hi>Aldorſgate</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> whereas formerly was ſaid, there was of old a fair and large Colledge of a <hi>Dean,</hi> and ſecular Canons or Prieſts, founded by <hi>Ingelricus</hi> 1056. and confirmed a little after by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, as appeareth by that ample Charter he gave thereunto, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> Termes then uſed, I thought worthy the inſerting here, and it runs thus.</p>

            <p>Touching the hard <hi>Saxons</hi> word of this Charter, the Reader is referred to thoſe worthy perſons, who made additionals to Mr. <hi>Stow,</hi> where he ſhall find them explain'd; For many Ages, this Saint <hi>Martin le Grand</hi> continued by it ſelf a place of as great priviledges, as <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> or <hi>Beverlay,</hi> which were counted the chiefeſt in the whole Land; But <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> annexed it at laſt, to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of St. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which claims Title ever ſince, to the free Chappel, the Priviledges, and Sanctuary thereof, and hath enjoyed it, without controlement or queſtion.</p>
            <p>And now before we bid a farewel to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> we will acquiant the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in brief, with the modern Civil Government thereof; Now as <hi>London</hi> is divided into 26. <hi>Wards,</hi> ſo <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> is partition'd to 12. for the which, the <hi>Dean</hi> of the <hi>Collegiat Church,</hi> was wont with the high <hi>Steward,</hi> to elect 12.

            <p>HAving hitherto rambled up and down the ſtreets of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and pryed into every corner thereof; having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to fetch Her from her very <hi>Cradle,</hi> (which may not be improperly ſaid; for we found Her at firſt a Grove of <hi>Wood)</hi> and ſo attended Her all along, to that marvellous degree of perfection, ſhe is now arrived unto, by inſenſible Coalitions of people, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Trade, and encreaſe of Structures: We will now, for the better illuſtration of things, and further enlightning of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, make a Compariſon or Parallel twixt Her, and other great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the World, which are accounted Cities of the <hi>firſt Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;</hi> for as the <hi>Starres</hi> in Heaven are diſtinguiſhed by degrees of Magnitude, ſo are <hi>Cities</hi> on the Earth: Or, to deſcend lower, as there are <hi>Ships</hi> of the firſt, ſecond, and third <hi>rate;</hi> ſo there are <hi>Cities,</hi> Now among thoſe various wayes, which tend to convey knowledge to the underſtanding, &amp; rectifie ones judgement, Examples, Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and <hi>Parallels</hi> conduce much thereunto; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> was the firſt that preſcrib'd this way, who, as t'was ſaid of him, by giving <hi>life</hi> to ſo many noble <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> after their deaths, gave himſelf the <hi>longeſt</hi> life; ſo it may be ſaid, that by his <hi>Parallels,</hi> he made himſelf <hi>parallel'd.</hi>

to entail upon man-kind for his manſion, and to hold it (for himſelf and his Heirs) <hi>in Capite,</hi> from <hi>Him;</hi> I ſay this Maſſe of Earth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by ſome, to a <hi>Camels</hi> back, in regard of the bunchy unevenneſs of it; by others, to a <hi>Libbards</hi> skin, in regard of the ſundry heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous parts, and variety of Habitations: By others, to a great piece of Embrodery, enchaſ'd up and down, whereof the moſt boſſie, and richeſt compacted parts are Towns and Cities, where People are linked in a nearer bond of love, and lead a more civil courſe of life; For <hi>Urbanity,</hi> and <hi>Civility,</hi> derived their names firſt from thence.</p>
            <p>Theſe Compariſons are leſſe wide, and more ſignificant, then that which <hi>Lucian</hi> makes, when, by way of drollery, he makes the greateſt <hi>Cities</hi> upon Earth, to appear like ſo many <hi>Birds Neaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Catholique truth, wherein all Chronologers, &amp; Antiquaries, do unanimouſly concur, that in the non-age of the World, man-kind had no other Habitation then Woods, Groves, and buſhy Queaches, which they fenc'd about with Hardles made of twigs, and looſe Stone-walls, to defend them from the invaſions of wild and ravenous Beaſts; ſome lived in Grotts, and concavities of Rocks, to ſhelter themſelves from the inclemency, and rigor of the Air: Inſomuch, that all men were <hi>Troglodites</hi> at firſt, as there are many Nations, who are houſed ſo to this day, making themſelves holes and hollowes, in Rocks, and ſandy dry grounds, as we find in this Iland ſome of thoſe Troglodites, both in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and <hi>Bridge-north.</hi> Then by degrees, they made themſelves ſmall Huts: from Huts, they came to build Houſes, and ſo to cohabit in Hamlets: and thence ſprung up Towns and Cities.</p>
            <p>The firſt of any fame, was that ſtupendous City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the great Hunter, and enlarged by that notable <hi>Virago, Semiramis:</hi> which was girded about with Walls, 200. foot high, and fifty broad, whereof the Circuit was 300 Furlongs; ſhe had alſo 300. Turrets upon the Walls, which were of ſuch a latitude, that Chariots might go upon them; and if old Hiſtorians may oblige us to a belief, there were three hundred thouſand men that were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the building thereof; ſhe continueth ſtill, a vaſt and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing City, called by the Turks <hi>Bagdat; Aſia,</hi> being the moſt <hi>Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi> Countrey on this ſide the Hemiſphere, as it was firſt peepled, for <hi>Adam</hi> was that Countreyman, ſo Towns, Cities, Caſtles, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and other Buildings, firſt began to be erected there; and indeed, all other knowledge, beſides <hi>Architecture,</hi> came firſt from thoſe parts, being next Neighbors to the riſing Sun: The Indian <hi>Brachmans,</hi> or <hi>Gymnoſophiſts,</hi> were the firſt ſcientifical men, and Students of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; The Perſian <hi>Magi</hi> were her next Students: Then ſhe croſſ'd the red Sea, and came to <hi>Memphis</hi> among the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> whence ſhe ſteered down the <hi>Nile,</hi> and got over the <hi>Aegean</hi> Seas to <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whence ſhe took wing to <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence ſhe clammer'd ore the <hi>Alps</hi> to <hi>France, Germany, Great Britany,</hi> and other <hi>North-weſt</hi> Climats.</p>

the greateſt: we will inſtance only in the City of <hi>Quinzay,</hi> who arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to her ſelf, the name of the <hi>Celeſtial City,</hi> whereof divers modern Authours do write portentous things; and truly, he muſt have a ſtrong Faith, who will believe them: She is the chief City of the Empire of <hi>China,</hi> lying under the ſame Climate as <hi>Venice</hi> doth, with whom ſhe hath a great reſemblance, being built upon the South ſide of a huge Laque; ſhe hath in length about forty miles, in latitude thirty, and one hundred and twenty miles in circumference; ſhe hath above a thouſand Bridges, ſome whereof are ſo high, that Ships under ſaile, may paſſe under them: Her Houſes are of Stone and Earth; the loweſt whereof, is five ſtories high, of marvellous beauty and ſtrength: She hath many magnificent Temples, but one next the Royal Palace, of a ſtupendious ſtructure, being of that altitude, that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent is threeſcore and fower marble ſtairs: There are an incredible number of fair Palaces in her; among which, after that of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, thoſe of the ten Governours, are the ſtatelieſt, and among them that of the Captain of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the Center of the City, ſtands the Imperial Court, which is fenc'd about with ſeven Walls, whereof every one is garded by ten thouſand Souldiers, the Palace is ten miles in Circuit, and hath fourſcore great Halls; but that where the great Councel ſits is four ſquare, and hath Windows and Gates looking towards the four parts of the Heaven, Eaſt, Weſt, North and South, where officers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that have buſineſs, do enter, according to the ſcituation of the Countrey, whence they come, there being above threeſcore ſeveral Kingdoms, under the Dominion of the Emperor, and every one hath a particular Hall and Councel, where they deliberate, touching the Government of every Kingdom. 'Tis ſuch a raviſhing voluptuous place, that there are objects to pleaſe and charm all the five ſenſes, The eyes are fed in beholding the goodly Structures, Gardens, and Trees which are up and down: The Eares by hearing, the chirping of the Birds, and ſweet murmure of the waters; The <hi>ſmell</hi> is feaſted with odoriferous ſent of flowers, and other rich perfumes; The <hi>Taſte</hi> by moſt delicate fruits; And the other ſenſe, by moſt beautiful, and raviſhing Women, which are able to tempt a Stoick, having by their rowling large eyes, and other poſtures, extraordinary wayes of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement. There was a computation made of above a million of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes within her, ſo that allowing ten to a Family, there be ordinarily about ten Millions of humane ſouls that breath within the City; They are very rich in their Habits, and there is not much difference in the Clothes of male and female, only the women have more diverſity of colours; blew and red are the commoneſt, but black is never worn: There be Birds there, of ſuch a wonderful bigneſs, that they will take up a whole Mutton alive, up into the Air, and ſometimes a man in Armor.</p>
            <p>There are abundance of <hi>Elephants, Dromedaries, Camels,</hi> and other huge Beaſts, that do their work; And all Animals, both volatil, and terreſtrial, are there, of a bigger ſize and proportion, then any where

elſe, by ſpecial influences of the Heavens: It is incredible, what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Nations do reſort thither for Traffique and Commerce, as all the <hi>Indies, Cathay, Tartary, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Perſia;</hi> They are rare <hi>Artiſts;</hi> for 'tis thought, that Guns and Printing were there invented thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years agoe; their Characters, and way of reading, being not either from the left hand to the right, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> uſe; or from the right hand to the left, as the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and all the Dialect thereof, as the <hi>Arabian, Perſian,</hi> and others, but perpendicular down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: There is one Law amongſt them, that conduceth much to make them ſuch exquiſite Artiſans, which is, that the Sonnes are alwayes of their Fathers Trade, whereby they come to have a more natural dexterity, genius, and aptitude to the Trade, and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents train them therein more induſtriouſly, and diſcover unto them all the myſteries thereof.</p>
            <p>Touching the rare <hi>China</hi> Diſhes and Cups they make, the maſſe of Earth, whereof they are moulded, uſeth to be buried in lumps, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bowels of the Earth, ſometimes a hundred years before they fall to work upon it, and ſuch a maſſe of aged Earth is the common Patrimony, that Parents uſe to leave their Children: In fine, they pretend to ſo much ſagacity, wit, and induſtry, that 'tis a ſaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that They only have two eyes, the <hi>Europaeans</hi> one, and all the reſt of the World is blind.</p>
            <p>They have ſuch a high opinion of their King, that they think he is deſcended of the race of ſome <hi>demy-God,</hi> and ſo adore him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>They believe there is ſome Divinity in his blood, inſomuch, that he never marries any, but either his own Siſter, or Daughter, or next a kin, for fear of ſtaining the Royal Blood; He is ſeldom ſeen open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he hath a private place, when his Councel ſits, whence he may hear whatſoever is agitated, and he ſignifieth his pleaſure invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly through certain hollow Trunks, and he gives audience to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors alſo in that manner.</p>
            <p>We will now over the Red Sea to <hi>Afrique,</hi> and take a ſhort tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Survay of the <hi>Gran Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> a City alſo of a huge Gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique ſtature, being near upon forty miles compaſſe, having five and thirty thouſand <hi>Meskeetos,</hi> that is, Churches and Chappels: There are in her four and twenty thouſand noted ſtreets; ſome whereof are two miles in length, every one is locked up in the night, with a dore and Chains at each end: There is a huge number of Horſmen, under the command of ſo many <hi>Saniacks,</hi> which watch and gard the Town all the year long, to the number of eight and twenty thouſand men, for fear of the incurſions of the wild <hi>Arabs:</hi> the cauſe of the vaſtneſs of <hi>Gran Cairo</hi> is, that there are three Cities incorporated into one, that is, old <hi>Memphis, Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Elkhaire;</hi> for there was another City hard by, called <hi>Babylone,</hi> but by encreaſe of Trade, and new concourſe of people, the <hi>Soldans</hi> and <hi>Mammalucks</hi> reduc'd all three to one entire City: which would be a pittiful poor place, did not the River of <hi>Nile</hi> give her a yearly viſit from the Mountains of the

Moon, about the Sommer Solſtice, and retire again about eighty dayes after.</p>
            <p>We will now croſſe the Greek Seas to Europe, and take a quick view of moſt of thoſe Cities, which are of the firſt magnitude; for indeed, this <hi>Parallel</hi> aymes only at the <hi>Euroaean</hi> Cities; And it will be found by any impartial Reader, that <hi>London</hi> needs not vail to any of them, if regard be had.</p>

            <p>But to proceed the more methodically in taking a view, to this purpoſe, though ſhort and curſory of the greateſt Cities in <hi>Europe,</hi> we will begin Eaſtward at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> called of old <hi>Bizantium,</hi> and now <hi>Stambole</hi> by the <hi>Turks,</hi> being the chief Court or Port, as they terme it, of the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> the word being derived from Faith and Plenty: 'Tis true, ſhe is plac'd in a fit, and advantageous poſture, to be Commandreſſe of the World, ſhe was raiſed by a <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and loſt by a <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (both of them, the Sonnes of <hi>Helens)</hi> about a thouſand years after; but touching her ſite, ſhe hath on the one ſide, the <hi>Pontus,</hi> or black Sea, and the <hi>Marmora,</hi> or <hi>Helleſpont</hi> on the other: the mouthes of which Seas are ſo narrow, that no paſſage can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

            <p>We come now to <hi>Italy,</hi> and firſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> which though in circuit ſhe be yet about as big as <hi>London;</hi> yet in point of people, ſhe may be called a Wilderneſs, in compariſon of her: She is alſo far inferior for Traffique and Wealth; as alſo for temperature, and wholſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Air, that of <hi>Rome</hi> being not ſo healthy, which ſome impute to the burning of ſtubble, for fertilizing the bed of the Earth; others, to the ill-favour'd vapors that come from divers ſubterranean hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that remain up and down, out of the ruines of old <hi>Rome;</hi> for <hi>Rome</hi> at preſent, may be called but a <hi>Skeleton</hi> of the old; or like a tall man, ſhrunk into the skin of a <hi>Pygmey,</hi> being compared to that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous ſtature ſhe was of, in <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> his time, who leaves it upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that ſhe was fifty miles about, and had above four hundred thouſand free Citizens; and conſequently, about four millions of ſouls with in her boſome, as ſome infer; She then made the <hi>Ocean</hi> to do homage unto the <hi>Tyber,</hi> ſhe made <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Afrique,</hi> feudetaries to <hi>Europe;</hi> but ſhe who daunted the World, yielded to the Lawes of <hi>Time,</hi> who gives all great Cities a ſpace of growing, of ſubſiſtence, and of declination; But a wonder it is, how ſo much of her is left, conſidering, that from <hi>Brennus</hi> the <hi>Britain,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> ſhe was eight times ſack'd, whence it may be inferr'd, that there is an extraordinary providence, that ſeems to watch over her. For as ſhe ſubſiſted before by the <hi>Pike,</hi> the <hi>Pen</hi> may be ſaid now to ſupport Her, I mean her <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Courts, which cauſeth a great confluence of people to reſort thither, from all corners of the Earth: Inſomuch, that the number of ſtrangers in <hi>Rome,</hi> may be ſaid to exceed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Natives, becauſe ſhe is accounted the <hi>Communis Patria,</hi> and chief Randezvouze of all Chriſtians, in regard of the reſidence of the chief Biſhop, in whom every Catholique claimes an Intereſt: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that <hi>Rome</hi> may be ſaid to be more beholden to <hi>Shepheards,</hi> then to any other profeſſion; for as a <hi>Shepheard</hi> was her <hi>Founder,</hi> ſo a <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard</hi> is ſtill her <hi>Preſerver.</hi>

The next City of the firſt magnitude in <hi>Italy,</hi> is <hi>Milan,</hi> which of all other Towns, may be ſaid to have this ſingularity, to have no Suburbs; 'Tis true, She may pretend much for Her <hi>Dome,</hi> her <hi>Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> and <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> with number of excellent Artiſans; yet who is well acquainted with both places, will find that <hi>London</hi> is not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to her, in any of theſe fower things; And for other particulars, as ubiquitary Traffique, by Sea as well as Land, for multitude of people, and divers other things, pointed at before, <hi>Milan</hi> comes ſhort of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> 'tis true, ſhe hath many things to glory of, as her wonderful ſituation, that ſhe was born a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that ſhe hath continued a <hi>Virgin</hi> near upon thirteen hundred years, having been never raviſh'd by the aſſaults of any enemy, (though ſome out of malice would make her a <hi>Concubine</hi> to the great <hi>Turk).</hi> She may alſo glory of her great <hi>Arſenal,</hi> and that ſhe hath the <hi>Sea</hi> for her <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;</hi> yet if one go to multitude of Inhabitants, to the magnitude of both Cities, to number of Corporations, with other particulars poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at before, <hi>Venice</hi> will not diſdain to vail to <hi>London;</hi> But touching the laſt thing She glorieth of, <hi>London</hi> may claim as much intereſt in the <hi>Sea</hi> as ſhe, if regard be had to <hi>Maritime</hi> Dominion and Naval power.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, while <hi>Venice</hi> is ſteeping and pickling in <hi>Salt-water, London</hi> ſports her ſelf upon the banks of a freſh ſtately River, which brings into her boſom, all the <hi>Spices</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the <hi>Treaſures</hi> of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> the Gems of the <hi>South,</hi> and the rich Furs of the <hi>North.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Genoa,</hi> though ſhe be a proud City, yet ſhe ſtands not upon her own legs, but ſhe ſubſiſts moſt by the King of <hi>Spains</hi> money, by being a Sceal to convey it by <hi>Cambio</hi> to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and elſe-where, having little of her own to trade withall; whereas <hi>London</hi> hath native ſubſtantial Commodities of her own, and is far ſuperior to her for bigneſs, and number of ſouls, with other advantages.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>Florence,</hi> there is beauty enough to be ſeen there, but ſhe may partly thank <hi>London,</hi> that ſhe is ſo fair, by the Trade ſhe bears to <hi>Ligorn,</hi> of late years.</p>

            <p>Touching <hi>Sicily,</hi> there is <hi>Palermo,</hi> the reſidence of the Viceroy, a jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neat City, which may glory of one thing, that neither <hi>London,</hi> nor any other City in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> hath the like, which is a fair ſpacious uniform ſtreet, of above a mile long; Next to which, is that of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>

               <hi>Vienna</hi> the Imperial Court is of an extraordinary bigneſs, being fenced about with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Walls, which <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt rear'd up for his Ranſome: It is alſo well peopled; ſo is <hi>Prague.</hi> Which though the latter be made up of three Cities, yet they both come ſhort of the City of <hi>London</hi> in amplitude, and number of people, with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther properties mentioned before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Germany</hi> hath divers fair Cities, that may take place amongſt them of the firſt magnitude, as <hi>Mentz, Colen, Frankfort, Strasburg, Norimburg, Auſpurg, Magdenburg,</hi> and others, which though they beat a Land Trade, being mediterranean Cities, and abound with wealth, and numbers of Artiſans, yet they are inferior to <hi>London,</hi> for many reſpects.</p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>Hans,</hi> and imperial Towns, there are divers of them large, wealthy, and full of Trade, as <hi>Lubeck, Danzick,</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh</hi> the biggeſt of them, which owes much of her proſperity to the Staple of the <hi>London</hi> Marchant Adventurers, who are there ſetled; but there's none of theſe Cities, though they be threeſcore more in number, that will preſume to compare with <hi>London,</hi> in any of thoſe twenty properties before mentioned.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>Copenhagen</hi> in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Stockholm</hi> in <hi>Swethland,</hi> they come far ſhort; nay, if you go more Northward, upon the white Sea, as far as the gran <hi>Moſco</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Ruſsias</hi> Court, which is a huge woodden City, and inviron'd about with a treble wall to ſtop the incurſions of the <hi>Tartar,</hi> you will find it inferior to <hi>London,</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe twenty particulars.</p>
            <p>Touching Low <hi>Germany,</hi> or the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which is one of the greateſt Countries of Commerce in Chriſtendom; 'tis true, there are there many Noble Cities. Among others, the City of <hi>Gant</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which for bigneſs, bears the Bell of all the Cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> being computed to be twenty miles in circuit, which makes the <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> twit the <hi>French,</hi> by ſaying <hi>Nous auons un Gant qui tiendra Paris dedans,</hi> We have a <hi>Glove</hi> (meaning <hi>Gant,</hi> which is a Glove in <hi>French)</hi> that will hold <hi>Paris</hi> within it; yet for number of humane ſouls, this great City is but a kind of Deſart, being compared to <hi>London. Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> is a Noble City, both for her Cittadel, and Fortifications, which are ſo vaſt, that two Coaches may go abreſt upon the Walls; She
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:95174:114"/>
may compare with any other City, ſhe was in former times, one of the greateſt Marts, this ſide the <hi>Alps:</hi> Inſomuch, that <hi>Guicciardin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that after the <hi>Intercurſus Magnus</hi> was eſtabliſhed betwixt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the Trade 'twixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> came to above twelve Millions yearly; But upon the Revolt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Provinces from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> when Secretary <hi>Walſingham</hi> told <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that he would give both the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King ſuch bones to gnaw, that might ſhake both their teeths in their heads; meaning thereby, the Revolt of the <hi>Hollander</hi> from the one, and the kindling of the <hi>Ligue</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> I ſay, when theſe tumults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, <hi>Amſterdam</hi> may be ſaid to have riſen up out of the ruines of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which Town is come, in leſſe then fourſcore years, and by a ſtupendous courſe of Commerce and Negotiation, to be one of the greateſt Marts of the World, being before, one of the meaneſt Towns of the firſt magnitude in <hi>Holland;</hi> but ſhe is ſwoln ſince, twice if not thrice as big as ſhe was: Inſomuch, that ſhe may be ſaid to give the Law to all the reſt of the united Provinces, and to ſmell rank of a <hi>Hans Town,</hi> or little Common-wealth of her ſelf. Among other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, this may be imputed to the Trade of the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, which is appropriated unto Her, and to a mixture with the Jewes, who have there two Synagogues: yet is this freſh great Mercantile Town, much inferior to <hi>London,</hi> almoſt in all things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in point of populouſneſs, as may be conjectured out of her weekly Bills of Mortality, which at the utmoſt, come but to about threeſcore a week; whence may be inferred, that <hi>London</hi> is five times more populous; for the number that dies in Her every week, comes commonly, to near upon three hundred.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in point of Wealth, <hi>Amsterdam</hi> comes ſhort of <hi>London;</hi> for when Sir <hi>Ralph Freeman</hi> was Lord Mayor, it was found out by more than a probable conjecture, that He, with the 24. Aldermen, his Brethren, might have bought the Eſtates of one hundred of the richeſt Bourgemaſters in <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> Then, for ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Site, and ſalubrity of Air, ſhe is ſo far inferior to <hi>London,</hi> that her Inhabitants may be ſaid to draw in Fogs, in lieu of free Air, the Countrey being all marſh and mooriſh about Her; ſo that <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is built as it were in a bog, or quag; for in their fabriques, they are forced to dig ſo deep for a firm foundation, by ramming in huge Piles of Wood, that the Baſis of a Houſe, doth often times coſt more then the ſuperſtructure.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Amſterdam</hi> hath neither Conduit, Well, or Fountain of freſh water within her, but it is brought to her by Boats; and they waſh with Rain water, which every Houſe preſerves in Ciſterns, to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Touching the River of <hi>Texel,</hi> that brings her in all Commodities ſhe is nothing comparable to the <hi>Thames,</hi> in point of ſecurity of ſayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſweetneſs of water: touching the firſt, they ſay there ſtood a Forreſt of Wood in times paſt, where now the <hi>Texel</hi> makes her bed, which could not be cut down ſo clean, but there are divers ill favoured
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:95174:115"/>
Trunks, and ſtubs of Trees, ſtill found under water, which is a great annoyance to Ships.</p>
            <p>There are in the United Provinces, many jolly Towns beſides, which may be ranked among them of the firſt magnitude, eſpecially <hi>Utrecht,</hi> which hath the face of an ancient ſtately Town, &amp; ſubſiſts more by her ſelf: the reſt grow great, and flouriſh in Wealth, Buildings, and People, by having ſome peculiar ſtaple Commodity appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them, as <hi>Amſterdam</hi> hath the Trade of the Eaſt and Weſt Indies aſſigned Her, (as was formerly mentioned). <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> hath the Staple of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth; <hi>Dort,</hi> of the <hi>Rheniſh-Wine,</hi> and <hi>Corn</hi> that comes from <hi>Germany; Haerlam</hi> hath a Charter for <hi>Weaving</hi> and <hi>Knitting; Leyden</hi> is an Univerſity; The <hi>Hague</hi> ſubſiſts by the reſidence of the <hi>Hoghen Moghen,</hi> the Councel of State; <hi>Middleburgh</hi> in <hi>Zeland,</hi> by the Staple of <hi>French</hi> Wines; <hi>Trevere,</hi> by the <hi>Scots</hi> Commodities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but none of theſe bear any proportion with the City of <hi>London,</hi> who trades in all theſe ſeveral Commodities together, and hath particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Corporations accordingly, with many more.</p>
            <p>We will now hoyſe up Sayl for <hi>France,</hi> which alſo hath divers Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the firſt Magnitude, as <hi>Rouen</hi> in <hi>Normandy, Bourdeaux</hi> in <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogny, Tholouſe</hi> in <hi>Languedock,</hi> with the other five Courts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as alſo <hi>Amiens</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> and the City of <hi>Lions,</hi> and <hi>Marſeilles:</hi> the one whereof, ſubſiſts by her <hi>Bank;</hi> the other, by being the chief Arſenal of the <hi>French</hi> Gallies; but none of theſe will offer, I think, to compare with the City of <hi>London,</hi> nor any of thoſe Towns that ſtand upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> whereof there are many gentile ones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paris</hi> I confeſs, may be capable of ſome Compariſons with <hi>London,</hi> for which ſhe hath many helps, as being a <hi>Citè, Villè &amp; Univerſitè, a City,</hi> a <hi>Town,</hi> and an <hi>Univerſity;</hi> as alſo the chief reſidence of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, and the Parliament.</p>
            <p>But lets go a little to particulars. And firſt, to the populouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of both Cities; They ſay in <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Pariſhes of Saint <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> and Saint <hi>Innocent,</hi> have above one hundred thouſand Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants in them alone: and that by the laſt Cenſe that was made there, was near upon a million of humane ſouls, found in the City and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of <hi>Paris.</hi> It may be ſo, but we ſhall find in the enſuing Diſcourſe that <hi>London</hi> hath more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for magnitude: 'tis true, that <hi>Paris</hi> hath the advantage of an <hi>Orbicular</hi> figure, and ſo is more capacious. But by the judgement of thoſe Mathematicians, who have obſerved both Cities; if <hi>London</hi> were caſt into a Circle, ſhe would with all her dimenſions, be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as big as <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>Loure,</hi> 'tis true, that it is a vaſt fabrick, and the like is not found in <hi>London;</hi> but it is the only Court the French King hath in <hi>Paris,</hi> whereas in <hi>London</hi> there are fower Royal Seates, with two Parks annexed to one; I hope the <hi>Baſtile</hi> will not offer to compare with the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> nor the River of <hi>Seine</hi> with the <hi>Thames;</hi> much leſſe I believe, will <hi>Paris</hi> offer to make any compariſons with <hi>London,</hi> in point of Traffique, and Societies of Noble adventuring Marchants,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:95174:115"/>
who trade on both the Hemiſpheres; nor of her Provoſt with the Lord Mayor of <hi>London.</hi> I allow <hi>Paris</hi> to have rich <hi>Banquiers,</hi> but they are moſt of them ſtrangers, and not Natives.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I think <hi>Paris</hi> would be loth to compare with <hi>London</hi> for neatneſs of ſtreets, or for ſweetneſs of ſite; for <hi>Paris</hi> hath ſcarce any verdure about her, but the <hi>Proclere;</hi> whereas <hi>London</hi> hath moſt delightful Fields round about Her, of a deeper greene, not ſo fading as that of <hi>France:</hi> and touching ſtreets, the dirt and crott of <hi>Paris</hi> may be ſmelt ten miles off, and leaves ſuch a tenacious oily ſtain, that it is indelible, and can never be waſhed off; 'tis confeſſed, that <hi>Paris</hi> hath waters of a ſingular vertue, for the die of Scarlets; but 'tis as well known to the World, what extraordinary Vertues the <hi>Thames</hi> water hath for many things. Ask the <hi>Hollander,</hi> and he will tell you, there is no ſuch water to fatten Eeles, and all ſorts of Fiſh. <hi>Thames</hi> water Beer bears the price of Wine, in many places beyond the Seas. And the <hi>Portugalls</hi> have found of late, ſuch vertue in that water, that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it away by whole Tuns, to <hi>Liſbon.</hi> I might enlarge my ſelf further, in ſhewing what advantage the City of <hi>London</hi> hath of <hi>Paris,</hi> but I will ſuſpend my Diſcourſe till I proceed a little further, only I will conclude this Paragraffe with this one Objection, that <hi>London</hi> hath far better blood in her Veins, then <hi>Paris,</hi> I mean a greater number of wholſom Springs, Conduits, Aqueducts, and Sources of ſweet waters, whereof <hi>Paris</hi> hath not ſo many. And now there comes into my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, a facetious paſſage, between <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> and the <hi>Provost</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> touching thoſe waters; which happened thus. The King had appointed the <hi>Suiſse</hi> Ambaſſadors, whereof there were many in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to be lodged in the City, and that plenty of the beſt Wines ſhould be provided for them; The Ambaſſadors having lain long upon the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> and drunk daily very deep, and being at laſt diſmiſſed. The <hi>Provoſt</hi> made an humble Remonſtrance to the King, how the City had ſo long time win'd the Suiſſe Ambaſſadors, and their numerous retinue, which put Her in ſome Arreares, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he humbly prayed, in the name of the City, that his Majeſty would be pleaſed to give leave, that a ſmall Tax might be laid for a while upon the Water-pipes and Ceſterns of freſh Waters, for the diſcharge of thoſe Arrears for Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The King pleaſantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Ventre de Saint Gris,</hi> there muſt be ſome other way found out to do this; for <hi>'Twas our Saviour only, that could turn water into Wine, therefore he would not preſume to attempt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus rambled up and down the World, and caſt ſome few glances upon the moſt renowned Cities; and having pointed before, at twenty properties, wherein <hi>London</hi> may well compare with any of the greateſt Cities in <hi>Europe,</hi> we will now more particularly, treat a little of thoſe properties, and take them all ſingle, as they are ranked.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is, Conveniency of Situation, and ſalubrity of Air, wherein the wiſdom of the old <hi>Britains</hi> our Anceſtors, in point of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the place, and the benignity of the Heavens, in point of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:95174:116"/>
influences and temperature, have made <hi>London</hi> as happy as any other City under the vaſt Canopy of the Heavens; ſome ſay, that that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is beſt ſituated, which reſembleth a <hi>Camels</hi> back, who hath protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berancies, and bunches, ſo a City ſhould be ſeated upon riſing grounds, or ſmall Hillocks; It is the poſture of <hi>London;</hi> for ſhe is builded upon the flanks, ſides, and tops of divers ſmall Hillocks, lying near the Banks of a Noble River, and being encompaſſed about with delightful green Medows, and Fields on all ſides; and ſhe is in ſo fair a diſtance from the Sea, that no danger of forren invaſion can ſurprize her, but ſhe muſt have notice before: The nature of her Soyl s ſandy, which is wholſomoſt for Habitation, and conduceth much o goodneſs of Air, the barrenneſs whereof, is made prolifical by art.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Touching the ſecond property, which is a method of ſtrict, and punctual Government, ther's no City goes beyond her, or indeed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls her, take night and day together; for there is not the leaſt miſdemeanor, or inconvenience that can be; but there be Officers in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very corner of the City to pry into them, and find them out; but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, the <hi>Wardmote Inquest,</hi> which are to be men of repute, and known integrity; They by vertue of their Office inquire, if any man outlawed, or indited of Treaſon, or Felony, lurk within the Ward; They inquire if the publique peace be any way diſturbed, or broken; They enquire of all offences, and dammages done to the River of Thames, and make a ſpeedy preſentment of them to be redreſſed; They inquire after Riotors, diſſolute perſons, and Barrators, walking by nightertayle, without light at unſeaſonable houres.

the common charges of the City, when he is required. They inquire, if any conceal the Goods of Orphans, whoſe Ward and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage belong to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen. They inquire, if any Officer, by colour of his Authority, do extortion to any man, or be a promoter, or maintainer of quarrels againſt right, or take car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and arreſt victual unduly. They inquire, if any Boat-man, or Ferriman take more then is due for his Boat-hire.</p>
            <p>They are to inquire, if any pourpreſtures be made upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ground of the City by Land, or water, as in Walls, Pales, Stoops, Grieces, Doores, or Cellars; or if any Porch, Pent-houſe, or jetty be too low, in letting of Paſſengers that ride, or Carts: They are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that Pentiſes, and jetties, be at leaſt the heighth of nine feet, and that the Stalls be not but of two foot and a half in breadth, and to be flexible, and moveable, <hi>viz.</hi> to hang by Jewmews or Garnets, ſo that they may be taken up, and let down.

They are to inquire in Shops and Houſes of Chandlers, and others which ſell by weight, that all their Scales be right, and according to the Standard; as alſo, that all Yards and Ells, be of their juſt length, and that none do ſell by <hi>Venice</hi> weights.

               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:95174:117"/>
The Ward-mote Inqueſt, by vertue of their Office, are bound to ſearch into all theſe enormities, and to meet once a moneth, or oftner, if need require to that purpoſe. And whoſoever doth judiciouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe ſeveral heads, will find, there's nothing wanting to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a City, or the people thereof in the wayes of neatneſs, ſafety, and induſtry, or for the advancement of Vertue, and ſuppreſſion of Vice.</p>
            <p>By theſe particulars, with what hath bin ſpoken of formerly, in the Body of this Book, the Reader may obſerve, how exact the City of <hi>London</hi> is in her <hi>Urban</hi> Government.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

What a goodly Spectacle it is to behold the Lord Mayor, and the Companies atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him in ſo many dainty Barges, when he goes to be ſworn in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> and what brave ſhews there are attending him by Land, at his return? what a plentiful ſumptuous Dinner, conſiſting of ſo many huge Tables, is provided for him? what a variety of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Officers wait upon him perpetually, whereof, with the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer,</hi> there are five of them Eſquires by their places, as was hinted before? what a comely ſight it is to ſee the Lord Mayor, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, and Aldermen, going in their Robes upon Feſtivals to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church of Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> though they who ſtand not ſo well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the preſent Government, ſay, that he goeth in now at the <hi>wrong end</hi> of the Church: what a goodly ſight it is, when he goeth upon <hi>Eaſter</hi> Holidayes, to the <hi>Spittle,</hi> with the Sword, and Cap of Maintenance going before him? How his Robes are fitted for the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> to <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> he weares <hi>Violet</hi> fur'd; from <hi>Whitſontide</hi> to <hi>Michaelmas, Scarlet</hi> lined: And for diſtinction among the Aldermen, they who have bin Lord Mayors, have their Cloaks lined with changeable Taffata; but thoſe that have not, with green Taffata; what great places of truſt are committed to the Lord Mayor, as the keeping of the great Bridge in repair, which hath ſuch large Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues belonging unto it, with a particular ſtately Seal, which of old, had the Effigies of <hi>Thomas of Becket,</hi> (a <hi>Londoner</hi> born) upon it, with this Inſcription in the name of the City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Me quae te peperi, ne ceſses, Thoma, tueri;</hi> But the Seal was altered in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths Raign: what a great truſt is it for the Lord Mayor to have the conſervation of the Noble River of Thames, from <hi>Stanes</hi> Bridge, till She diſgorgeth her ſelf into the Sea? How ſtately is he attended, when he goes to take a view of the River, or a Swan-hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? and lately, what a Noble addition was it for the Lord Mayor to have a Park of Deer of his own ſo near the City, to find him ſport, and furniſh him with Veniſon? what an Honour is it for the Lord
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:95174:118"/>
Mayor to be accounted the <hi>firſt</hi> man of <hi>England,</hi> upon the death of the Soveraign Prince. As when King <hi>James</hi> was invited to come, and take the Crown of <hi>England, Robert Lee,</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> was the firſt man who ſubſcribed, and then the Officers of the Crown, with the chief Noblemen after him. The Recorder of <hi>London</hi> alſo, is <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Conſiliarius Angliae,</hi> and is priviledged to plead within the Barre. The Lord Mayors of <hi>London</hi> have bin called ſometime, to ſit at the Councel Table, as Sir <hi>John Allen</hi> was in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time, with others, (which <hi>Allen,</hi> gave that rich Collar of Gold, which the Lord Mayors uſe to wear) and the Aldermen his Brethren, were uſed to be called <hi>Barons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We are come now to <hi>Regulation</hi> of Trade, wherein <hi>London</hi> is not inferior to any City whatſoever, witneſs (among others) what pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Lawes, Reſtraints and Cautions the <hi>Marchant Adventurers,</hi> who trade in the Golden Fleece of <hi>England, viz.</hi> in Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, have propos'd to themſelves, as likewiſe all other Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in like manner, for the improvement of that particular Trade, and preſerving it from confuſion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Touching variety of <hi>Artiſans, London</hi> yields to no other, 'tis true, that mingling with <hi>Forreiners,</hi> hath much advantag'd her in this kind; but 'tis obſerved, and confeſſed by all Nations, that though the <hi>Londoners</hi> be not ſo apt to invent; yet when they have got the Invention, they uſe alwayes to <hi>improve it,</hi> and bring it to a greater <hi>perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Touching Corporations, Halls, Fraternities, Guilds, and Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, <hi>London</hi> hath not her Fellow: witneſs the twelve Honourable Companies; out of one of which, the Lord Mayor is yearly choſen. The ſeveral Societies of thoſe, who venter abroad in all parts of the habitable Earth, as far as the Antipodes. And threeſcore Companies of Citizens beſides; whereunto the new Company of <hi>Coachmen,</hi> is lately added, who have their Halls, their regular Orders, and Officers accordingly; And touching all ſorts of Artificers, and variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious wayes to improve all kind of Manufactures, and thereby gain an honeſt Livelihood, and ſo enrich the place. <hi>London</hi> may be called a <hi>Hive of Bees,</hi> (as formerly was touched) or a <hi>Hill of Ants,</hi> which have bin alwayes made the Emblems of induſtry, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Touching plenty, and abundance of all kinds of Proviſion, as Fleſh, Fiſh, Fowle, Fruits, Fuel, variety of Drinks, and Wines, with any other Commodity, that conduceth to pleaſure and delight, as well as neceſſity, <hi>London</hi> may glory to be as well ſerved, as any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under Heaven. A knowing <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſaid, that he thought <hi>Eaſtcheape</hi> Shambles alone, vends more Fleſh in the year, then all the Court of <hi>Spain. Gaſcon</hi> Wines drink better in <hi>London,</hi> then in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and ſo do all other, provided they be not ſophiſticated. Nor doth <hi>London</hi> abound with all things ſo plentifully, for the <hi>belly</hi> alone, but alſo for the <hi>back,</hi> either to keep it warm, or make it gay; what varieties of woollen Stuffs there are in every Shop, with broad Cloth equal to the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:95174:118"/>
price of Silk, being come to that heighth of perfection, that ſome hath bin made of ten pounds a yard in price; But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have now got the art of making our Stuffs and Cloths, by thoſe fooliſh giddy headed Puritans that pretended to fly for perſecution of their Conſciences, whereby they have done their own Countrey no little miſchief in this particular, as in many things beſides.</p>
            <p>But in point of plenty, it may be well avouch'd, that no <hi>Oppidan</hi> Magiſtrates on Earth, go beyond the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and the two Sheriffs, for conſtant Hoſpitality all the year long: The time was, that the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> feaſted four Kings at once. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that of all other places in the Iland, thoſe Verſes of <hi>Michael,</hi> the <hi>Corniſh</hi> Poet, may be moſt verified of <hi>London.</hi>
               <q>

            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Concerning wholſom, clear waters, as 'twas ſaid before that <hi>London</hi> hath good blood in her Veins, by thoſe many Aqueducts, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits, and conveyances of freſh waters, to ſerve for all uſes, ſo ſhe hath good Veins in her Body, by thoſe rivulets, Springs, and Sources ſhe hath within and about Her: What an Herculean work was that, to bring the River of <hi>Ware,</hi> to run through her ſtreets, and refreſh all her Houſes. And what an ingenious fabrick is lately rear'd up in the Thames, to furniſh the <hi>Strand, Drury Lane,</hi> the <hi>Convent Garden,</hi> and all the new Houſes thereabouts, with convenient proportions of freſh water.</p>
            <p n="9">9. For <hi>Univerſality of Trade,</hi> there is no Countrey upon the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Earth, no Seas that any of the Winds blow upon from the <hi>Artick</hi> to the <hi>Antartick</hi> Pole, from the riſing to the ſetting Sun, but <hi>London</hi> by her Navigations, findes them out, and ſo barters, and brings all kind of Commodities; what goodly Veſſels doth ſhe ſend forth, to croſſe the Line to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> and the bottom of the <hi>Streights,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions: As alſo to the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, how ſhe flyes ore the vaſt <hi>White</hi> Ocean, to <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> and to hunt the great <hi>Leviathan</hi> in <hi>Groenland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How her Marchants and Factors are more reputed, and have grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter priviledges every where, then any other, particularly in the huge Hanſe City of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. In point of ſolid and uſeful Wares ſhe hath of her own, what a ſubſtantial Commodity, and of what high eſteem, all the World over is her <hi>Cloth,</hi> her Kerſies, and divers other kinds of Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len manufactures; together with her <hi>Lead</hi> and <hi>Tin,</hi> how ſhe turns the firſt to Silk, and Cloth of Tiſſue, the laſt to Gold and Silver; what rich returns ſhe makes of her Fiſh, from all the Catholick Countries? What large Ware-houſes, and ſpacious fair Shops ſhe hath of all mercantile Commodities? And touching her Royal Exchange, thoſe of <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> have but baubling Pedlery Wares, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of hers. Inſomuch, that a wager was offered once to be laid,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:95174:119"/>
that <hi>Craſhawes</hi> Shop alone, was able to buy all thoſe in the <hi>Buſse</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. For ſtrength defenſive and offenſive, for Arms of all ſorts, for Artillery, Ammunition, for Arſenals and Docks on both ſides the River, for Caſtles and Block-houſes, <hi>&amp;c. London</hi> is not inferior to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; She hath twelve thouſand Trained-Band-Citizens, perpetually in a readineſs, excellently armed; which when Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> ſaw in a Muſter one day in Saint <hi>James</hi>'s Fields, and the King asking him what he thought of his Citizens of <hi>London;</hi> He anſwered, That he never ſaw a Company of ſtouter men, and better Arms in all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; but he had a ſting in the Tayl of his diſcourſe; for he told the King, that although his Majeſty was well pleaſed with that ſight at preſent, he feared, that thoſe men handling their Arms ſo well, might do him one day a miſchief, which proved true; for in the unlucky Warres with the long Parliament, the <hi>London</hi> Firelocks did him moſt miſchief.</p>
            <p>In times paſſed, the City of <hi>London</hi> hath ſent out ſtrong Fleets to ſcoure, and ſecure the four Seas from depredations, and Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. And if in the year 1293. ſhe was able to ſet forth a Fleet of ninety five Ships, as it ſtands upon Record, what would ſhe be able to do now, if ſhe were permitted?</p>
            <p>Moreover, If in King <hi>Stephens</hi> Raign, as another Record hath it, ſhe raiſed 60000. Foot, and 20000. Horſe for Land Service, how many more were ſhe able to do now in caſe of neceſſity, that being compared to what ſhe was then, were to compare a Gyant to a dwarf? But beſides theſe ſeveral kind of ſtrengths, and Arms, there's no place ſo well furniſh'd with <hi>Amonition de bouche,</hi> as the <hi>Frenchman</hi> hath it, with munition for the mouth, <hi>viz.</hi> with Magazines of <hi>Corn,</hi> and Arms againſt Famine, as <hi>London</hi> is; for beſides that at <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> and the <hi>Bridge-houſe,</hi> how many Halls have Store-houſes of this kind?</p>
            <p>There's no place alſo better armed againſt the fury of the fire; for beſides the pitched Buckets that hang in Churches and Halls, there are divers new Engines for that purpoſe. But it had bin wiſhed, that the Proclamations of the two laſt Kings for building with <hi>Brick,</hi> had bin obſerved by <hi>London,</hi> for beſides that, it had made Her leſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to caſual fyrings, it had conduced much to the beauty of her Streets, and uniformity of Structure.</p>
            <p n="12">12. For healthful corporal Recreations, and harmleſs paſſe-times, <hi>London</hi> may go in the Van, to any place that I ever ſaw yet. Go and walk in her Fields, you ſhall ſee ſome ſhooting at long marks, ſome at Buts; ſome bowling upon dainty pleaſant Greens, ſome upon Bares; ſome wreſtling, ſome throwing the Barre, ſome the ſtone, ſome jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome running, ſome with their Dogs at Ducking ponds; ſome riding upon Nags, ſome in Coaches to take the freſh Air, ſome at Nine-pins, ſome at Stool-ball, though that ſtradling kind of Tomboy ſport be not ſo handſome for Mayds, as Forreiners obſerve, who hold,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:95174:119"/>
that danſing in a Ring, or otherwiſe, is a far more comely exerciſe for them.</p>
            <p>Within the City, what variety of Bowling Allies there are, ſome open, ſome covered? there are Tennis Courts, Shuffle-Boards, playing at Cudgels, Cock-fightings, a ſport peculiar to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and ſo is Bear, &amp; Bull-baytings, there being not ſuch generous Dogs, and Cocks any where elſe.</p>
            <p>Go to the River, what a pleaſure it is to go thereon, in the Summer time, in Boat or Barge? or to go a <hi>floundring</hi> among the Fiſhermen? There was in former times a ſport uſed upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> which is now diſcontinued: it was for two Wherries to row, and run one againſt the other, with ſtaves in their hands, flat at the fore-end; which kind of Recreation, is much practiſed among the <hi>Gondolas</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time was, that Stage-playes, and Fencing, were much uſed in <hi>London:</hi> The Hiſtory ſpeaks of a Play, <hi>Anno</hi> 1391. performed by the Pariſh Clarks of <hi>London,</hi> at the <hi>Skinners Well,</hi> beſides <hi>Smithfield,</hi> which continued three ſeveral dayes: the <hi>King, Queen,</hi> and the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent.</p>
            <p>And of another, in the year 1409. which laſted eight dayes, the ſubject was touching the Creation of the World, whereunto the Court, and Nobility were invited: But thoſe kind of Stage-playes, were turned after to Tragedies, Comedies, Hiſtories, and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes; for repreſenting whereof, there were more theaters in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> then any where elſe; And it was a true obſervation, that thoſe comical, and tragical Hiſtories, did much improve, and enrich the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, they taught young men witty Complements, and how to carry their Bodies in a handſome poſture: Add hereunto, that they inſtructed them in the ſtories of divers things, which being ſo lively repreſented to the eye, made firmer impreſſions in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, They reclaimed many from Vice and Vanity; for though a Comedy be never ſo wanton, yet it ends with vertue, and the puniſhment of vice.</p>
            <p n="13">13. For a ſtately <hi>Cathedral Temple,</hi> and <hi>Dome</hi> of devotion, the time was, that <hi>London</hi> did not yield to any City under the Sun in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church being eſteemed by all Nations, to be one of the eminenteſt, and viſibleſt Temple, one of the moſt glorious Piles of Stones under Heaven, taking all the dimenſions, together with the chearful conſpicuous <hi>Site</hi> thereof, being near the Center of the City, and upon a riſing ground; Being alſo founded upon <hi>Faith's,</hi> by having a large Church of that name truckling, as one may ſay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Chancel; Add hereunto, what a comfortable Object it was, to behold above twenty miles diſtance, round about, this goodly Structure, rayſing it ſelf above the reſt, and ſerving as it were for a <hi>Creſt</hi> to the whole City; But now this famous Fabrick, which was accounted the greateſt glory of <hi>London,</hi> is become her greateſt ſhame; For many Forrainers, (who are none of thoſe that place any inherent
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:95174:120"/>
Sanctity in ſenſeleſs inanimat ſtones) have bin overheard to ſay, that <hi>Pauls Church</hi> in that poſture ſhe now is, is the ſaddeſt ſight, and moſt ruthful Spectacle upon the Surface of the whole Earth; nay, ſome have bin heard to ſay, that whereas a <hi>Stable</hi> became once a <hi>Temple</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> a Temple among us hath bin made a Stable; nay, they went further, not ſticking to ſay, that as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was born in a <hi>Stable,</hi> ſo <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is like to be born in a Stable in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time was, that <hi>London</hi> was uſed to have a greater care of this <hi>Temple,</hi> when a ſolemn <hi>Act</hi> of the Lord Mayors, and Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel paſſed, which ſtands yet upon good Record, to this effect, and ſtands ſtill in force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For aſ much as the material Temples of God were firſt ordained for the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and devout Aſſembly of people, there to lift their hearts, and lawd and prayſe Almighty God, and to hear his Divine Service, and his holy Word, and Goſpel, ſincerely ſaid, ſung, and taught, and not be uſed as Markets, and other prophane places, or thorow faires, by carriage of things: And for that of late years, many of the Inhabitants of the City of</hi> London, <hi>and other people repairing thither, do commonly uſe, and accuſtom themſelves very unſeemly, and unreverently (the more the pitty) to make their common carriage of great Veſſels full of Ale and Beere, great Baſkets full of Bread, Fiſh, Fleſh, and Fruit, and ſuch other things, Fardels of Stuffe, and other groſse Wares, and things, through the Cathedrall Church of Saint</hi> Pauls, <hi>and ſome in leading Moyles, Horſes, and other Beaſts, through the ſame unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, to the great diſhonour, and diſpleaſure of Almighty God, and the great grief alſo, and offence of all good people, Be it therefore for remedy and Reformation thereof, ordained, enacted, and eſtabliſhed, &amp;c. That no perſon, either free or forren, of what eſtate or condition ſoever, do at any time from henceforth, carry or convey, or cauſe to be carried, and conveyed through the ſaid Cathedrall, any manner of great Veſſel, or Basket with Bread, Ale, Beer, Fiſh, Fleſh, or any other like thing or things, upon pain of forfeiture, or looſing, for every ſuch his or their offence, three ſhillings four pence; for the ſecond, ſix ſhillings eight pence; for the third, ten ſhillings; And for every other offence, after ſuch third time, to forfeit ten ſhillings, and to ſuffer two dayes and two nights impriſonment, without Bayl or Mainprize, The one moyety of all which pains and penalties, ſhall be to Christs Hoſpital within</hi> Newgate, <hi>and the other half, to him that will ſue for the ſame, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Court of Record within the City, by Bill, original Complaint, or Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be commenc'd, or ſued in the name of the Chamberlain of the ſaid City for the time being, wherein no Eſſoyne, or wager of Law, for the Defendant ſhall be admitted, or allowed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Such was the Reverence, that <hi>London</hi> ſhewed her Cathedral Church, not long agoe, which may be ſaid, to look now like the hulk of a great weather beaten Ship, that had croſs'd the <hi>Line</hi> eight times, forward and backward, to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> and lies rotting upon the Carine: ſuch is the condition of this ſtately Church, which is like to be buried ſhortly in her own ruines, and ſo become a heap of rubbiſh;
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:95174:120"/>
and then how <hi>bold London</hi> will look, let them judge, who have taken a judicious proſpect of Her.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there's another Reaſon, that may induce <hi>London</hi> to prevent this; for if <hi>Pauls</hi> were down, She forfeits the name of a <hi>City;</hi> for all Lawyers concur in this opinion, that there can be no <hi>City,</hi> without a <hi>Cathedral Church;</hi> t'is but a <hi>Village</hi> without one, or a <hi>Town</hi> at moſt: therefore <hi>London</hi> hath great cauſe to wiſh, that thoſe unlucky Sciſmaticks had never bin born, who firſt brought <hi>Pauls</hi> Church to this pittiful paſſe; for it may well be ſaid, that all thoſe caſual fires which ſhe ſuffered, (whereof there were many) did not do her as much miſchief, as the fatuous fires of ſome fanatical Zelots have done; as one ſaid alſo of the <hi>Houſe of Peers,</hi> that the <hi>Long Parliament</hi> was more deſtructive unto it, then the <hi>Powder-plot</hi> had bin, if it had taken effect.</p>
            <p>Touching particular appropriated places for the ſervice of God. We know there were ſuch from the beginning. As ſoon as <hi>Noah</hi> got footing on dry ground, he erected an <hi>Altar,</hi> which was in lieu of a Church, the Patriarks had theirs; then from <hi>Altars,</hi> they came to have <hi>Arks,</hi> and ambulatory <hi>Tabernacles;</hi> and we read, what a conceit of holineſs was carried towards them: Then <hi>Salomon,</hi> by Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Heaven, did build a fix'd, and ſtanding material <hi>Temple;</hi> And we well know, how highly our Saviour himſelf was incenſed againſt the money changers, and others, who prophan'd that place; and what ſharp reprehenſions his Apoſtle gave afterwards to thoſe, who uſed to eat and drink in thoſe places which were appointed for devotion.</p>

And in all the ten Perſecutions, which happened by intermiſſions, we may read, how that by the Edicts of the Emperors, the Oratories or Churches of the Chriſtians, were to be in ſome places burnt, in others, demoliſhed. And in the laſt perſecution under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> the Hiſtory ſaith, that a great number of ancient Edifices, and Churches of the Chriſtians were deſtroyed; And obſervable it is, that one of thoſe Primitive Fathers, compares the <hi>Churches on the ſhore, to ſafe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors in the Sea,</hi> which ſurely muſt be interpreted, to relate to the <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and not to the <hi>perſons</hi> only.</p>
            <p>Hiſtories alſo ſpeak plainly, how in the firſt and ſecond Century after Chriſt, in the <hi>perſecution</hi> that was in <hi>Perſia,</hi> many goodly <hi>Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> of the Chriſtians were deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>By theſe ſhort diſquiſitions into the Ages of the World and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it appears, that among the Patriarks, there were <hi>holy places</hi> that had an Analogy with Churches, which continues among the <hi>Jewes</hi> ever ſince: And touching Chriſtians, there were Oratories, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate ſacred places, from the very infancy of the Goſpel, which ſerved as a general Rendezvouz to celebrate Divine ſervice all along from the Apoſtles time, through the three Centuries of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church: therefore they muſt be poſſeſſed with a ſtrange ſpirit of contradiction, and prophaneſs, who make no account of thoſe peculiar Houſes, which pious devout ſouls have appropriated, rea'rd up, and dedicated to the ſole ſervice of Almighty God, but hold all places promiſcuous, and indifferently proper for that uſe.</p>
            <p>It may juſtly be doubted, whether ſuch ſordid poor narrow ſouls, who ſo malign the beauty, the holineſs, and decencies of Gods Houſe here in the Church <hi>militant,</hi> will ever be admitted to behold the glory of the Church <hi>Triumphant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, having preſumed to ſpeak ſo much of <hi>Londons</hi> great Temple (than which there is not a more conſpicuous Object upon Earth, except the Mount <hi>Olympus,</hi> which is ſaid to bear up Heaven); and having with a true ſenſe of ſorrow ſet forth the ſad condition thereof, my prayers are, that it would pleaſe God to put it into the hearts, and move the ſpirits of thoſe worthy Patriots, who are now aſſembled to mend all breaches in the Common-wealth, to propoſe ſome way for preſerving this ancient great viſible Ornament from tumbling down: And there is a fair opportunity offered to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for if thoſe irregular New Buildings be queſtioned (whereof there are by computation, above a hundred thouſand pop'd up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe forty years), It would, moſt humbly under favour, be very proper to employ part of the Tax upon thoſe Houſes, to repair Gods Houſe.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Touching a Noble <hi>Bridge,</hi> and a Navigable <hi>River,</hi> ſpoken of before, <hi>London</hi> is not inferior to any other City whatſoever: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt, what a large Rent hath it to preſerve it ſelf? what a vaſt Magazine of Corn is there alwayes in the Bridge-houſe, againſt a dearth? what a number of Officers, that look to the reparations
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:95174:121"/>
thereof, are handſomly maintained thereby, and ſome of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of good quality?</p>
            <p>Touching the ſecond, the River of <hi>Thames</hi> hath not her fellow, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard be had to the ſtraightneſs and length of her courſe running from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> without many meanders, her convenient diſtance from the Sea, to prevent ſurprizals, the chearfulneſs of the Soyl on both ſides, the wholſomneſs of her water, which makes the beſt-Beer in the World, &amp; is tranſported by forrein Nations for other uſes; the variety of her Fiſh, the fatneſs of her mud; If regard be had alſo to thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Maſts, which are perpetually upon her, the variety of ſmaller Woodden bottoms plying up and down, the ſtately Palaces that are built on both ſides of her banks ſo thick, which made divers forrein Ambaſſadors affirm, that the moſt glorious ſight in the World (take water and land together) was to come upon a high Tide from <hi>Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,</hi> and ſhoot the Bridge to <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. For number of humane ſouls, breathing in City and Suburbs; <hi>London</hi> may compare with any in <hi>Europe,</hi> in point of populouſneſs: the laſt Cenſe that was made in <hi>Paris,</hi> came under a million; but in the year 1636. King <hi>Charles</hi> ſending to the Lord Mayor, to make a ſcrutiny, what number of <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> and <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> there were in the City, he took occaſion thereby, to make a Cenſe of all the people; and there were of Men, Women, and Children, above ſeven hundred thouſand that lived within the Barres of his juriſdiction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; and this being one and twenty years paſſed, 'tis thought, by all probable computation, that <hi>London</hi> hath more by the third part now, then ſhe had then. Now, for <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>Petty France,</hi> the <hi>Strand, Bedford Berry,</hi> St. <hi>Martins Lane, Long Acre, Drury Lane,</hi> St. <hi>Giles</hi> of the Field, High <hi>Holborn, Grayes Inne Lane,</hi> St. <hi>Jones,</hi> and St. <hi>Georges ſtreet, Clarken well,</hi> the out-lets of <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>Whitecroſse-ſtreet,</hi> the out-lets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Barres of <hi>Biſhopſgate, Alderſgate,</hi> and <hi>Southwark</hi> Barres, beyond the <hi>Tower, &amp;c.</hi> take all theſe places, with divers more, which are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, and one entire peece with <hi>London</hi> her ſelf, I ſay, take all theſe Buildings together, there will be found by all probable conjecture, as many Inhabitants at leaſt, as were found before within that compaſs, where the point of the Lord Mayors Sword reacheth, which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount in all, to a million and a half of humane ſouls: Now, one way to know the populouſneſs of a great City is, to obſerve the Bills of Mortality, and Nativities every week. I think, there is no ſuch Cuſtom in <hi>Paris;</hi> but for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which is a very populous Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile place, the ordinary number there, of thoſe that go weekly out of the World, is but fifty, or thereabouts, and about ſo many come into the World every week; But in <hi>London,</hi> the common Weekly Bills come to near upon 300. that come in, and about ſo many that go out of the World, though the laſt years general Bill made twice as many to go out, as came in; for it gives account of fourteen thouſand and odd that dyed, and but ſeven thouſand chriſtened; but this may be imputed (the more's the pitty) to the confuſion of Sectaries, which ſwarm ſince the long Parliament, as <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and others who uſe
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:95174:122"/>
not to chriſten their Children, a ſad ſtory to tell, ſo that there were many thouſands born, which were not baptized, and whereof the Bill ſpeaks not.</p>
            <p>Touching the form and ſhape of <hi>London,</hi> it may be aptly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a <hi>Lawrel leaf,</hi> which is far more long then broad; and were <hi>London</hi> round, as <hi>Paris</hi> and other Cities are, ſhe would appear more populous, by a more often encounter of the paſſengers.</p>
            <p>Concerning the length of <hi>London,</hi> take all Buildings that are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous one to another from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> from the utmoſt point of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> to the utmoſt point beyond the Tower, ſhe may be well thought to be near upon five <hi>Italian</hi> miles in <hi>longitude,</hi> and about half ſo much in <hi>latitude,</hi> and in Circuit, above twelve miles. 'Tis true, that the Suburbs of <hi>London</hi> are larger then the Body of the City, which make ſome compare her to a <hi>Jeſuites Hat,</hi> whoſe brims are far larger then the Block, which made Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador to ſay, as the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> was diſcourſing with him, upon his return from <hi>England,</hi> of the City of <hi>London.</hi> Madam, <hi>I believe there will be no City left ſhortly, for all will run out at the Gates to the</hi> Suburbs; <hi>and for the</hi> Men, <hi>I think they are gone by this time into the Country, for I left them all booted and ſpur'd when I came away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But touching the amplitude, and largeneſs of <hi>London,</hi> whereas <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, to put a Complement upon <hi>Paris,</hi> ſaid, that ſhe might be called a <hi>Province,</hi> rather then a <hi>City,</hi> this term may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter befit <hi>London,</hi> who is a <hi>County</hi> of her ſelf.</p>
            <p n="16">16. From proportions and <hi>quantity,</hi> we will now go to the <hi>quality</hi> of the perſons ſhe hath produced from time to time: whereof there have been great numbers of moſt gallant and generous, moſt wealthy and worthy, moſt eminent and munificent brave men, who had ſouls as large as their ſubſtance, I mean ſuch that received, either their firſt being, or well being from Her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Quint</hi> was uſed to glory, that he was a Citizen of <hi>Ghent,</hi> having bin born there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> in anſwer to a Letter of the King of <hi>Spains,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had enumerated above a ſcore of Soveraign Titles, ſtiled himſelf only <hi>Henry, Roy de France, &amp; Bourgeois de Paris. Henry</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and Burgeſſe of <hi>Paris.</hi> But <hi>London</hi> hath greater cauſe to glory in this point, for <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, a <hi>Britain</hi> born, was her Child. And a foul miſtake it was in Him, who writ the Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> when in his Epiſtle Dedicatory he ſaith, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was the Son of <hi>Helena,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, (being pure <hi>Britiſh);</hi> for the name of <hi>Engliſh</hi> was not then in the World, nor did the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whence the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are derived, take foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great <hi>Britain,</hi> but a long time after.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Fabian</hi> the famous Chronologer was Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> and born there; what a number of moſt munificent Benefactors hath <hi>London</hi> had among her <hi>own Natives,</hi> beſides thoſe whom ſhe bred; what a Noble uſeful Structure is <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> built at the ſole charge of Sir <hi>Simon Eyre</hi> Draper, and Lord Mayor of <hi>London?</hi> what a worthy Foundation is St. <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> built by Sir <hi>Thomas White,</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> who was Benefactor alſo to <hi>Briſtoll, Reading,</hi> and above <hi>twenty Towns</hi> beſides? what a bountiful Benefactor was Mr. <hi>William Lambe,</hi> free of the Company of <hi>Clothworkers?</hi> what a world of charitable deeds, did he do in Town and Countrey? what a Noble ſoul had Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham</hi> Mercer, and Marchant, who built the <hi>Royal Exchange, Greſham Colledge,</hi> with another great Countrey Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in <hi>Middleſex;</hi> what a notable Benefactor, was Mr. <hi>Thomas Howel,</hi> bred in his youth in <hi>Spain,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>London,</hi> who was one of the greateſt Benefactors of the Company of <hi>Drapers,</hi> and, beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other large acts of charity, he hath left ſuch means to <hi>Drapers</hi> Hall, that if any Mayden can derive her ſelf from the right linage of <hi>Howel</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> the ſaid Hall is to give her 21 <hi>l.</hi> towards her portion; and this to continue for ever; what a free large Soul had Mr. <hi>William Jones,</hi> Marchant, and free of the <hi>Haberdaſhers,</hi> who in <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where he was born, did build a fair <hi>Free School,</hi> with very large allowance to the Maſters; he was Benefactor alſo to <hi>Hamborough, Stoad,</hi> and divers other places at home and abroad. To theſe two <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> we will add a third, which is Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton,</hi> Goldſmith; what a hazardous, expenceful mighty work, did he perform, in bringing <hi>Ware-</hi>River to run through the ſtreets of <hi>London?</hi> what an infinite univerſal benefit doth accrue thereby, to the whole City and Suburbs? how often did this great deſign take heat and cold, what faintings and fears, what oppoſitions did it break through, before it was perfectly finiſhed?</p>
            <p>What a large noble Soul had Sir <hi>Baptiſt Hicks,</hi> Lord Vicount <hi>Campden?</hi> what a number of worthy things did he in his life, and at his death, both for the advancement of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Juſtice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Campden,</hi> in the County of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> he repaired, and adorned God Almighties Houſe, and reard another for the poor, before he built any for himſelf; He founded alſo there, a very commodious <hi>Market-houſe,</hi> and having done many things more for the publick
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:95174:123"/>
good in that place, he erected afterwards, a ſtately Palace for his Poſterity, though the hard fate of the times, and the fury of the Warre hath half deſtroyed it: He was alſo a great Benefactor to the Churches, and the poor of <hi>Hamsted,</hi> and <hi>Kenſinton,</hi> to St. <hi>Bartholomewes,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> Hoſpitals in <hi>London,</hi> to all the Priſons; as alſo to St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Church in the old <hi>Jury:</hi> He purchaſed divers <hi>Impropriations,</hi> and beſtowed them upon the Church in divers counties; He was at the charge of erecting a convenient <hi>Seſsion-houſe,</hi> for the Juſtices of <hi>Middleſex</hi> to meet, in the middeſt of St. <hi>John's ſtreet,</hi> which is called <hi>Hicks Hall,</hi> and will ſo be called to all poſterity. All theſe great lights he carried before him, and at his death he gave a World of Legacies, and divers Penſions to pious Miniſters and others, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed a great ſum to be diſtributed among all his Servants.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak of all thoſe Noble <hi>Londoners,</hi> who have done glorious things, both for Church and State, in point of piety, ſtately Structures of divers natures, for the publick good, and deeds of charity, would make a large Volume of it ſelf. I will conclude for the preſent, with a late worthy man, one Mr. <hi>John Walter,</hi> who was Clark of <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers Hall,</hi> who, having reſolved with himſelf, when he had attained a competent ſubſiſtence for himſelf and his Children, to employ the reſt every year, for charitable uſes, which he did conſtantly for many years: He built two Hoſpitals near <hi>London,</hi> and it was a great while before the Founder of them was known. He uſed to ſend a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bread to be diſtributed among the poor, to divers Churches; and it was not known, who ſent it, till he was dead, and that he was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. It is thought by a computation that was made, that he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed above ten thouſand pounds to charitable uſes of all ſorts, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publick, and he was ſo free from vain-glory, that his greateſt care was to do them in ſuch a manner, that his left hand ſhould not know what his right hand did; And in his ſtudy after his death, there was a bag of 800 <hi>l.</hi> in Gold, with a label in paper upon it, <hi>This is none of mine, but the poor's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, for Prerogatives, Enfranchiſements, Immunities, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Liberties, for Hoſpitality, and plentiful treatments; as alſo for Antiquity, the City of <hi>London</hi> comes not in the arrears to any.</p>
            <p>Touching the laſt, 'tis true, there are ſome Cities in the Eaſt, that have the ſtart of her in point of time, yet <hi>London</hi> was built 354 years before <hi>Rome,</hi> which is a fair Age.</p>
            <p>Touching the ſecond, ſome call <hi>London,</hi> a <hi>lick-peny,</hi> (as <hi>Paris</hi> is called by ſome, a <hi>pick-purſe)</hi> becauſe of feaſtings, with other occaſions of expence and allurements, which cauſe ſo many unthrifts among Countrey Gentlemen, and others, who flock into her, in ſuch exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive multitudes; but this muſt be imputed not to the place, but to the perſons; for one may live in <hi>London</hi> as frugally, if he hath wit to make uſe of it, as in any other City whatſoever.</p>
            <p>T'is true, that the prizes of all things uſe to be enhanc'd by conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and ſwarms of people, which a judicious Forreiner obſerving in <hi>London,</hi> ſaid, that ſhe bore no proportion with the Iland, but might
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:95174:123"/>
ſerve a Kingdom thrice as big, and that <hi>England</hi> may be rather ſaid, <hi>to be in London, then London in England,</hi> which made ſome compare her to the <hi>ſpleen,</hi> whoſe over-ſwelling, make the reſt of the body lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; but it might be anſwered, that <hi>London</hi> is rather like the <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,</hi> which digeſts the wealth of the Land, and after a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, diſperſeth it again in wholſom nutriment to all parts.</p>
            <p>Touching the third, <hi>viz.</hi> freedom and immunities, there's no City hath more.</p>
            <p>In the Raign of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, it was enacted, That the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>London</hi> were to enjoy their priviledges, and franchiſes, <hi>licet uſi non fuerint, vel abuſi fuerint,</hi> whether they were not us'd or abus'd, notwithſtanding any Statute to the contrary, as the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> hath it in his <hi>Inſtitutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Lawes of the Land, <hi>London</hi> is called ſometimes <hi>Camera Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, Reipublicae Cor, &amp; totius Regni Epitome,</hi> the Kings Chamber, the heart of the Common-wealth, and compendium of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſometimes ſhe is called <hi>Caput Regum &amp; Legum,</hi> The head of Kings, and of Lawes; nay, ſome of the Roman Emperors in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, called her <hi>Auguſta,</hi> which is a name alwayes of magnificence and State.</p>
            <p>And now will I take leave of the Noble <hi>Auguſta,</hi> or City of <hi>London,</hi> concluding with this hearty wiſh, couch'd in theſe two Hexameters, and relating to her proportion, or ſhape, which is a <hi>Laurel leaf,</hi> as formerly was ſaid.</p>
