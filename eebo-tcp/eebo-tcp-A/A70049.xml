         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter's</hi> LETTER To
his Reverend Clergy within the County and
<hi>Dioceſs</hi> of <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>VVith ſome ſhort and genuine Animadverſions vpon it.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving received in a Letter from a Perſon of Eminent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who is pleas'd to Honour
me with his particular Friendſhip and eſteem, That of
this Right Reverend Biſhop; and being aſſured from him,
upon the Teſtimony of a Clergyman of that <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> who
has one of the Originals, (for it ſeems there were ſeveral
of them ſent abroad) that it was an exact Copy, I was mightily pleaſed
with his great kindneſs in it, and upon reading it ſeveral times over, I
thought it very well worthy of many good Animadverſions.</p>
            <p>Indeed I could have wiſhed this Labour had been ſaved me by a more
Ingenious and habile Pen; for then not only I my ſelf ſhould have got
conſiderable Improvement by the learned remarks that muſt needs have been
made on it, but the publick would no doubt have teſtifyed greater acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments,
and have given their juſt applauſes, according to <hi>Cicero</hi>'s opinion,
<hi>Habet enim juſtam venerationem quicquid excellit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But having waited thus long, and finding none ſo generouſly inclined
as to beſtow his ſerious thoughts this way for common good and benefit;
I conceived it would not be altogether ungrateful to the world if I ſhould
venture at it; and, rather than have all loſt, preſent you with my ſhort
and natural Reflections upon the Letter that followes.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>To the Rectors, Vicars, and others within the County and <hi>Dioceſs</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,
James</hi> by Divine permiſſion Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> ſendeth greeting.</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHereas the Knights and Principal Gentlemen of the County, (in
purſuance of his Majeſties Writ for calling and holding a Parliament
at <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> upon the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> next coming) have met together
and reſolved and pitched upon Collonel <hi>Samuel Sands,</hi> to ſtand as a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate
to be elected for one of the Knights of the Shire to ſerve in the ſaid
Parliament; We taking into Conſideration his conſtant, known, and ſteady
affection, loyalty, and fidelity to the Crown and Church of <hi>England,</hi> do
recommend him to You as a Perſon that will be firm and faithful to the
Intereſt of the King, the true Proteſtant Religion, and the Common good
of the People of this Realm; And we do earneſtly deſire You to give your
ſuffrages for him, and to ingage ſuch as are qualified in your Pariſhes to
do the like, upon <hi>VVedneſday</hi> next, being the third of <hi>September;</hi> and thus
leaving You wholly to your freedom in the other part of your choice, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62693:2"/>
confiding in your filial and hearty compliance in this, we recommend You
to God's Holy Protection, and remain,</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>Your Affectionate Friend and Brother
<hi>James</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
                     </signed>
                  </closer>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>THis is the Letter <hi>Verbatim</hi> as it came to my hands; and how kindly
it is written for advancing the Intereſt, or but maintaining the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
liberty and property of the more inferiour Commons, you ſhall in
part ſee by and by.</p>
            <p>But before I come to take notice of the Letter it ſelf, I think it will
not be very improper here by the way to obſerve, how much that diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
party from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I mean, the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> is taxed
for <hi>going</hi> (as they ſay like <hi>Satan) to and fro in the Earth, and for walking
up and down in it</hi> to make their parties for Elections; what tricks and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations
they uſe to gain <hi>Proſelites;</hi> and eſpecially in this late Election
for our <hi>Metropolis,</hi> the City of <hi>London,</hi> where they ſaid, as I my ſelf heard
it, there were three of their chiefeſt Miniſters particularly, but whom they
would not name, that made it their great buſineſs to run from houſe to
houſe to ſecure Votes for a Worthy member and Patriot of it, whom
another party, under the <hi>Vizar</hi> and <hi>Maſquerade</hi> of Church of <hi>England</hi> men,
would fain have ſet beſide the Cuſhion; when as, for I have made as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
an Inquiry into it as poſſibly I could, not one of them has ſtirred
in it any further than perchance accidental common Converſation has brought
them on; but, as I believe the party who affirm'd it only vapoured, and
would fain have blackened them, if his ſilly word would have been credited;
ſo, on the other hand, put the caſe it had been ſo, they had done nothing
but what they could have produced a very good preſident for, from this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which was a long time <hi>Antecedent</hi> to the Election here, and I hope none
will be ſo ſpiteful as to hit their own ſelves a box o'th' ear in blaming them
for their Conformity to the Church, but will be rather glad to ſee that they
will in any thing come over to it, and take their Meaſures from it.</p>
            <p>For my part, I am ſo much a Lover of unity and peace, and ſo impatient
of whatſoever looks like faction, or dividing Intereſts, that I ſhould be one
of the firſt to caſt a ſtone at that man that ſets himſelf to make a party:
for, if we are free-born, let's injoy our priviledg, and not ſuffer our ſelves
to be cullied and ham-ſtring'd by every formal <hi>Fop</hi> that perhaps either has
a hank upon us, or elſe has got the knack to talk more oylily than our ſelves.
I would have my judgment my own, and would chooſe where I pleaſe,
and not give another man the power to ſay he has got me in his pocket, and
he can ſhake me <hi>like a Dog in a blanket.</hi> But now to my Subject.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all I think it is very eaſy to remark, that the <hi>Knights</hi> and
<hi>Principal Gentry</hi> of a <hi>County,</hi> when any Important Affair of the <hi>State</hi> is
to be mannaged, (as is this of <hi>Electing Parliament-men)</hi> do meet together,
and in their <hi>private Cabals,</hi> do conſult and reſolve among themſelves how
the matter ſhall determine, and which way they will have things to go;
and after this, then they pitch upon ſuch ways and means as they judg moſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62693:2"/>
proper to be conducive to thoſe Ends: and here in this caſe that we have
before us, You ſee they take this courſe; ſo that by this mean, if any would
have a particular faction or party, be it about buſineſs of either <hi>Church</hi> or
<hi>State,</hi> carryed on; it is only to make your intereſts with theſe great <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alls</hi>
of their <hi>reſpective Shires</hi> or <hi>Districts,</hi> by bribes of Money, preferments to
high places, or by getting honours to be conferred on them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when
you have once brought them over to you, and made 'em your own, you
may <hi>ſleep on, and take your reſt,</hi> as it is ſaid in another caſe, for they know
how to do your work well enough without any further troubling them.</p>
            <p>And when they have concluded the matter thus by themſelves, it is as
obvious to any conſidering man as the former, that they then go, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the Right Reverend their Biſhop with what they have done, <hi>and
pray in aid</hi> to him, that he would graciouſly pleaſe to inform the <hi>Clergy</hi>
over whom he preſides, with their <hi>project;</hi> and by an <hi>expreſs</hi> to let them
know, how agreeable it is to his Lordſhip, how good in it ſelf, and how
honourable it will be for them to be ſeen in, and advance the cauſe; and
not only that they themſelves would ſtir in it, but recommendations muſt
be made to them, that they do all they can <hi>to ingage ſuch as are qualified
in their Pariſhes,</hi> to lay their Shoulders to the work, and according to
their power to influence all others of their acquaintance <hi>junctis viribus</hi> to
do the like.</p>
            <p>And therefore becauſe the Knights and principal Gentlemen in a County
have pitched upon ſuch a one, (be he never ſo deſerving a perſon, or never
ſo otherwiſe, that is nothing to the purpoſe) as for inſtance, to be a Member
of <hi>Parliament,</hi> he muſt of neceſſity be the man: ſo that as I take it, (and
I would not willingly miſtake the point) this is to exclude the Commonalty
abſolutely to have a hand in the choice; for they muſt not dare to give a
Negative Vote if they ſhould be injoined to ſtand up for ſuch or ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
perſon; and by this means they are caſhiered of that power and
liberty, and that property that they have, to appear in the behalf of
another perſon, whom they may think to be better qualified, or however,
whom they may like better, and otherwiſe would chooſe, if they were not
beforehand ſo ingaged.</p>
            <p>But further, by leaving them to their freedom in the other part of their
choice, (as is here mentioned) doth imply a Reſtraint upon them and that,
deſpotically, or magiſterially, for the firſt; by which means, if commonly
practiſed by other Biſhops, the <hi>Parliament</hi> may make an Act to exclude the
Clergy from voting, as they did thoſe that had Leaſe-lands, nay Copy-holds
of Inheritance; preſuming they would be byaſſed by their Lords of
their Eſtates to vote which way they pleaſed, for fear of a black reckoning
when they came to renew. Beſides, if they do reſtrain them for one, as
here you ſee it is plainly proved <hi>de facto,</hi> why may they not by the ſame
right and juſtice lay a reſtraint on them for both: And how can they then
be ſaid indeed to be our repreſentatives, when poſſibly they may not be
thoſe perſons whom we would have to repreſent us, but are ſuch as the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62693:3"/>
Knights and principal Gentlemen of the County, together with the Biſhop
and his Clergy, will impoſe upon us, and make us to ſtand by, for fear of
worſe circumſtances to befal our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>By his confiding in their filial and hearty compliance,</hi> he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the reſtraint as to the firſt vote: That is, methinks, as much as to ſay,
we will oblige you to chooſe one ſuch man as we would have you, and to be
made a mouth of by us in that particular, and we will <hi>give you freedom in
the other part of your choice;</hi> we will put the wheadle on you as for the other,
you ſhall ſeem wholly to elect him, though he be fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ordained to be the
man, by our ſelves at our private Cabinet-board: for, to be ſure, if you are
once ſo far prevailed upon as to yield to their Judgments in one, you tacitely
do acknowledg that you have not underſtanding, and be not fit enough of
your ſelves to make a wiſe and ſafe choice without their previous direction,
and ſo conſequently will be eaſily led away to give your ſuffrage for any
other, whom perhaps ſome of the ſlie pretenders to your party, (if that
may be called ſo, which is only a diſintereſſed affection to ſerve you Country)
may be their ſecret order and impulſe loudly bawle out for, and cry up;
ſo that in one ſenſe there will be a reſtraint upon you as for both, though
knowingly it ſhall appear but for one, and to that it plainly ſeems you muſt
comply.</p>
            <p>Moreover, which to me looks like a Paradox, for it is <hi>contradictio in
adjecto;</hi> he expects from them a filial or ſon-like obedience, and yet he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
himſelf their Brother; he would have them blindly to pay him the
duty of Children, but he does not ſtile himſelf their Father: indeed he is
their right Reverend Father in God to ſuperintend them in ſpiritual affairs,
and in Divine Myſteries; but I do not very well underſtand, how it is his
<hi>Province</hi> to charge them with the cares of <hi>State,</hi> how he can <hi>ingage</hi> them to
run up and down after all <hi>ſuch as are qualified in their pariſhes,</hi> and get Votes
for the beloved <hi>Candidate;</hi> but yet this they are obliged to do, if they
mean to ſhow their filial reſpect to their honour'd elder Brother; for here's
their Injunction; and, <hi>litera ſcripta manet,</hi> ſhould they prove obſtinate and
reſtive, and offer to diſobey the precept, this hand-writing would no doubt
riſe up in judgment againſt them, and render them inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>This is by no means to reflect upon that Worthy Gentleman, whom this
Letter has a relation to; for all perſons I can hear of, that have any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him, give him deſervedly a moſt honourable mention; and
I cannot in the leaſt imagine but that the qualified Electing perſons would
voluntarily have given him their voice to be one of their Repreſentatives,
without the Solicitations and ingagements of their Clergy to them. But
this is to ſhow by what ways and artifices Men may get to be choſen, and
to leave it upon a <hi>dubitatur in Lege,</hi> how far ſuch things are juſt and
rightful.</p>
