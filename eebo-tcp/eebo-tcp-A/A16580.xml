         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat there is and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hath ben with God, euen before the world was made, an election in chriſt, of al thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhalbe ſaued, many places i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures do teach: as to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Eph. 1. rom. 8. 9. 11. 1. Theſ. 1. Math. 20. 22. 24. Mark. 13. Tit. 1. Act. 13. Philip. 11. Luke. 10 18. Apoe 3. 13. 17. 21. 22. Ihon. 6. 8. 10. 13. 17. And almoſt euery where in the new teſt a ment. In no caſe therfore it maye be denied of anye y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is godly, although be cannot attaine to gods wiſdome Iuſtice, and mercye in it, For that <note place="margin">Erod. 33.</note> were to ſee goddes fore partes. We muſt graunt it therefore becauſe the word of god doth not onely teach it, but alſo it ſtandeth with the very na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture of god, that to him not onelye men, but all thinges alſo that haue ben or ſhalbe for euer, i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al creatures are not onelye certaine, but ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb facs="tcp:18851:119"/>
that they cannot but be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, &amp; ſerue his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: for els god were not god, if any thing were, hath ben, or could be withoute his knowledge, yea certain knowledge: which knowledge in god maye not be ſeparated of anye man from hys wiſedome, &amp; ſo not from his wil, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we wold make two gods, as did the manichees, one the authour of al good, and another the authour of all euel, both which (ſay they) were eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall &amp; without beginninge. Which their opinion is deueliſhe &amp; againſt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> word of god moſt manifeſtly, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che affirmeth in many places that there is no mo gods but one, or any other that haue power to do good or euill abſolutly, or of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. But leſt ſome men which are to curious ſhould hereout gather, that then all thinges come by fatall neceſſitie, as the Stoikes thought, or by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and coaction, as other thinke, and therefore ſaye they, all goddes preceptes requiring that whiche we cannot doe, are in vaine: I thynke
<pb facs="tcp:18851:119"/>
it good to ſpeake ſome thing hereof.</p>
            <p>Fyrſte the Stoikes opynion is to be condemned as concerninge fatall <note place="margin">Againſt the Stoikes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſitie.</note> neceſſitie, for that it tyeth and byn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth god to the ſeconde cauſes, and maketh hym, which is a moſt free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gente, bounde and tyed, ſo that he cannot worke but as the ſeconde cauſe mouethe hym. For they did Imagyne a perpetuall connexion and knyttinge together of cauſſes by a perpetuall order whiche is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in nature, where as we ſhoulde certaynelye knowe that it is God whyche is the ruler and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter of all thynges, whyche of hys wyſedome hathe foreſene and determyned all thynges that he wyll doe, and nowe of hys po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer doeth in hys tyme putte the ſame in executyon, accordinge as he hathe decreed wyth hym ſelfe. Herein to tarye anye longer I nede not, for that I thinke there be none nowe whiche bee of this opynyon, to attrybute thinges to fortune, a word vnſemly for Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18851:120"/>
Secondly, that al things are done by coaction or compulſion, is falſe and oute of goddes prouidence and predeſtination cannot be gathered or maintained, for there muſte be a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce put betwen neceſſity and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtreint. All things that haue bene done, be or ſhalbe, in conſideration of gods prouidence, as it is with god, are of neceſſitie, but yet not of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraint: As for example you ſhall ſee that neceſſitye is one thinge and conſtrainte is an other thing. God is good of neceſſitie, but who now will ſay then that he is ſo by coaction or enforced therto? The deuil is naught of neceſſitie, but not by coaction. Good men do wel of ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſitie, but not by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pulſion. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men do euyll of neceſſitye, but not of conſtraint. A thinge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is done willi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly, is not to be ſaid to be done by conſtraint. God is good willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not by compulſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The deuil is naught willinglye, but not of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing. Good men do good willing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, but not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrainedly. Wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe tranſgreſſe willinglye, but not
<pb facs="tcp:18851:120"/>
compelled. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is playne, though al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs be done of neceſſitie, yet are they not of compulſion and enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By reaſon wherof, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wilbe diligent in lookinge hereon, may ſe matter enough to purge god from being the authour of all euyll or of any euyll: although he be the authour of all thinges and of al ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whiche are to be conſtrued accordinge to the will of the doers: and ſo maye we ſee one Action to be both good &amp; euill in reſpecte of gods will and Sathans will. For in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as a thing is done accordinge to gods wil, the ſame is good, for his wil is good. And in aſmuch as a thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g is done according to Sathans wil, it is euil becauſe his wil is euil.</p>
            <p>But now to the third thing, that is, whether gods precepts requiring that which is not in our powers, be fruſtrate or no, although al thinges are done of neceſſitie and by goddes prouidence. To the vnderſtandinge hereof .ii. things are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered. Firſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt thinke of god, not as he is in hym ſelfe, but as by hys
<pb facs="tcp:18851:121"/>
word he teacheth vs. Secondly, the ſtate of man before his fall is to be compared with the ſtate of man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, as he is nowe broughte into this world. For the firſte, although it be moſt true that to god al things are ſo certaine as before is ſpoken: yet in that god hath opened to vs by his worde ſo much of his will as we ſhuld w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diligence ſerch and obſerue, we maye not thinke otherwiſe, but that whatſoeuer is done agaiſt that worde, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame is ſinne &amp; euell in him whoſoeuer he be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> doth ther againſt: although the ſame tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god doth &amp; can vſe to ſerue his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce accordingly. Of which prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we may not otherwiſe iudge, then hys word geueth vs leaue, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is, we muſt doe nothinge to ſerue it, but as hys word teacheth. If Adam had ben ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hereby, then he had not eaten y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> aple: for in that he obeyed not the word of god, which he knewe, eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may perceane, that he dyd not eate the aple to obey gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whiche he knewe not. So that eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, Adams fal to be ſinne and
<pb facs="tcp:18851:121"/>
euill, and he him ſelfe with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authour therof, god not allowyng or approuinge the euell. which is to be conſtrued accordinge to the will of the doer, which will in Adam was naught, although the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion god turned to ſerue his prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, therby ſetting forth his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful wiſdome, power, &amp; goodnes: whereat we ought rather w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to wonder, then by wandering further then beſemeth vs, to cal into queſtion, why god did ſo. Whiche why, no man is able to vnderſtand, &amp; therfore we ſhuld bidde our buſye braine ſyt downe, and not to couet a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gaine to be like to god as Adam did, and therfore he fel ſo foule as he did.</p>
            <p>For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond mans ſtate, I meane before his fal, &amp; his ſtate nowe, thus let vs think, namely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after his Image, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, endewed man w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſoule immortal, wiſe, rightuoꝰ, &amp; holy: for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Image of god is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the body, which man hathe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men with the beaſtes of the earth, but it is from abone and of goddes brething. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Adam tranſgreſſing
<pb facs="tcp:18851:122"/>
gods precept, did not according as he ſhould and might haue done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he ſhould not haue done, and mighte haue auoided, if that he had not receiued the perſuaſion and counſel of the Serpente. Which god permitted him to doe, thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that perfect Iuſtice, wiſedome and holines, is not nor cannot be in any creature, which is not god alſo, and therefore Chriſt being god was made man, that in man there might be this perfection and iuſtice, which is in Chriſt oure lord, and in Adam we could neuer haue had. Which wiſedome of god we ſhall Ioyefully one day behold, yf we will nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine our buſye braine and curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, from ſerching further then we ſhould doe. But to returne ageine, Adam (I ſay) being made after gods Image, which he receiued for vs al, to haue deriued the ſame vnto vs all by naturall propagation, by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the commaundements, loſt and mangled ſo the ſame Image of god in himſelf and in vs all, that for mortalitie came death, for wyſdome
<pb facs="tcp:18851:122"/>
came foliſhenes, for rightuouſnes came vnrightuouſnes, for holynes came corruption, concerning goddes Iudgement and in goddes ſight: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there remained in him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerninge mans Iudgement and the ſight of the worlde, life, wiſedome, rightuouſnes and holynes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which all we by propagation doe from our mothers wombe receiue: ſo that we may well ſee our ſtate now to be far from the ſtate, we had before Adams fal, and therfore gods law requireth nothinge of vs but that which was in our nature before the fall, whiche we ſe is impoſſible for vs to paye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and yet god not vniuſt, in that he aſketh of vs nothing therby but the ſelfe ſame thinge whiche he gaue vs in our creation. The lawe then and the preceptes of god were geuen after the fal of man, not that man ſhould thereby get life, and the thinge whiche was loſte by ſynne (for the bleſſed Seede was promiſed for the recouerig hereof, and to him that partained) but that man by it might know ſinne, and what he had
<pb facs="tcp:18851:123"/>
loſt, therby to deſire more deeply the promiſed ſeede, by whome as we be receaued, ſo our euills be not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and that we being renued by his holy ſpirit and newe ſeede, ſhuld as newe borne babes deſire, and by will beginne to do the lawe of god, which after our deliuerance fourth of thys corrupte bodie and man of ſynne by death, we ſhall without all let fully accompliſhe, &amp; at the length receiue the bodye, to be ſpirituall (as Paull ſaieth) and holye, ready to obey and ſerue the ſpirit, as an helper rather then an hynderer. Oh happye daye when wilt thou appeare?</p>
            <p>By this whyche I haue alreadye ſpoken, I thinke the diligent reader may ſe, how that there is election of gods children, &amp; how that gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence ſtretcheth it ſelfe to al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſo that al things in reſpect ther of come of neceſſitie, but yet nothing therby to be done by conſtraint and enforcement: wherthroughe god is ſene to be the authour of al things &amp; yet of no euil or ſinne.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of man before his fall &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:18851:123"/>
after, with the cauſe of gods lawe &amp; precepts geuen to man, I haue brei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly touched. Nowe it reſteth that I ſhould ſpeake ſome thing of frewil, what it is, and howe farre we maye graunte that man hath free wyll.</p>
            <p>That this may be vnderſtand: as I would haue the ende wherefore god gaue his law to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to get therby eternall life which apperteined to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> promiſed ſede, but to ſhewe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what ſinne is &amp; what by ſyn he loſt, that he might by his vnhabilitie be driuen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier of very neceſſity, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> promiſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, and ſo by him to receyue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit, wherethrough being regenerate he might learne to loue the lawe, to take it as a directorie &amp; rule to liue by, and to hedge in his old man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> controlinge: this geare (I ſaye) as I would haue it conſidered, yf we wil vnderſtand mans frewill, ſo would I haue this marked, namely the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixte the life whiche we loſte &amp; had in our firſt creation, and now haue by byrth before regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In our firſte creation we had a
<pb facs="tcp:18851:124"/>
life, not only w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the creatures, but al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo with god, whiche life vtterly Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loſt, as he declareth by the runnyng awaye to hyde him ſelfe from god. And this he loſt for vs alſo, aſwel as for him ſelfe: in reſpect whereof the ſcripture calleth vs deade. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this life therefore that is with god, we haue no wil at al, much leſſe any frewil. For how can a dead man haue any wil? The will therfore we haue, is onely for this life and with men, that is, it is not good and free but in reſpect of men: and in this life in reſpecte of god and life with him, all our will is as we are, euen dead: yea and the wil we haue for this pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſente life, if a man will conſider the god of this world, and howe we are his ſlaues by birth and continually tyll we be regenerate, and how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy our affections are to ſerue his pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe, I thinke none will ſaye other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe but that mans will vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is none otherwiſe fre, then plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth his maiſter, who muſte needes ſerue ſpite of his head, our god: and therefore all to be done by gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
<pb facs="tcp:18851:124"/>
as I ſaied before, withoute any imputation of euill to our good and moſt holy father. Yea but (ſaith one) what frewill hath man that is regenerat? This wil I briefly ſhew when that I haue ſpoken of Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which precedeth regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: from whom we may diſcerne it, but not deuide it, no more then heat from the fyre.</p>
            <p>Iuſtification in ſcripture is taken for the forgeuenes of oure ſinnes, &amp; conſiſteth in the forgeuenes of oure ſinnes. This is onely gods worke &amp; we nothing els but patientes &amp; not agentes. After this worke, in reſpect of vs and our ſenſe, commeth regene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration, which altogether is goddes worke alſo. For as to our firſt byrth we bring nothinge (bring quoth I? yes we bring to let it, many things but to further it nothing at al) ſo do we bring nothing that can helpe to our iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as S.

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ods fore ſight is not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cauſe of ſynne or excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable neceſſitie, to him that ſinneth. The dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned therefore haue not nor ſhall haue any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe becauſe god foreſeing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through their own ſinne, did not drawe them as he doth his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecte, vnto Chriſte. But as the electe haue cauſe to thanke god for euer for his greate mercies in Chriſt: ſo the other haue cauſe to lamente their owne wilfulnes, ſinne and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of chriſt, whiche is the cauſe of their reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; wherin we ſhuld loke vpon reprobation: as the onely goodnes of god in Chriſt is the cauſe of our election and ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherin we ſhuld loke vpon gods election. He that will loke vpon god or any thing in god<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſimplie and barely as it is in god, the ſame ſhalbe ſtarke blynde. Who can ſee godes goodnes as it is in god? Who can ſee his Iuſtice as it
<pb facs="tcp:18851:127"/>
is in him? If therfore thou wilt loke vpon his goodnes, not only loke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hys workes, but alſo vpon hys word: euen ſo if thou wilt loke vpon his iuſtice do the like. Then ſhalte y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſee that election is not to be loked on but in chriſt, nor reprobation but in ſinne. When the ſecond cauſe is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, ſhuld not we think that they are to curious y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wil runne to ſearch the firſt cauſe, further then god doth geue them leaue by his worde? The which firſt cauſe, becauſe they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, therfore do they deny it. God be mercyfull vnto vs for hys names ſake, &amp; geue vs to loue &amp; lyue his truth, to ſeeke peace &amp; purſue it. Becauſe god of his goodnes, for the comfort of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and certaintie of their ſaluation, doth open vnto them ſome thinge the fyrſte cauſe of their ſaluation, that is, his goodnes before the beginning of the world, to be loked vpon in Chriſt, a man maie not therfore be ſo bold as to wade ſo <note place="margin">marke this well and be not to curious.</note> in condempnation further then god reueileth it. And for as muche as he hathe not reueiled it but in ſynne,
<pb facs="tcp:18851:128"/>
therfore let vs not loke on it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Seke to be deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſynne and feare not reprobation: but yf thou wilte not, thou ſhalte fynde no excuſe in the laſt daye. Say not but thou art warned.</p>
