            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is guided by <hi>Prudence,</hi> which doth gouerne the life of man with ſuch reaſon, as ſhee is euer carefull for the welfare of the body, by curbing thoſe paſſions of the mind, which are vehement and vnruly: by her the mind is made capable of honeſt actions, and beautifull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours, and like a prouident gouerneſſe, ruleth ouer concupiſcence &amp; flouds of luſts, which would elſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the puritie of the minde. A potion to purge the ſoule, an Antidote againſt pride, and a valiant tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ouer flaming deſires, not like <hi>Aetna,</hi> too hotte, or <hi>Caucaſſus</hi> too colde: but is content betweene both, and reioyceth in it.</p>
            <p>If the bodie be not dieted with moderation, it will proue a ſtubborne ſeruant to the ſoule, vnfruitfull, fit for nothing but thorny cogitations, the greateſt enemies to the ſpirituall powers that can be, for the fleſh pampered in delicates, or kept ſhort of her naturall needments, is effeminated, corrupted, and weakened, and many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes be gotten, which are all ſtaid by a meane and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate dyet and the boyling luſts of the bodie aſſwaged.</p>

I may liken them to fawning curres, that neuer barke till they bite: or a gaye painted coffer, full of toades and venemous beaſts: So in like manner many of theſe bookes haue glorious outſides, and goodly titles: as if when a man tooke them in hand, he were about to read ſome angelicall diſcourſe: but within, full of ſtrong ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, tempered with ſweete honey: now while the minde is occupied in reading ſuch toyes, the common enemie of man is not idle, but doth ſecretly inſnare the ſoule in ſecuritie.

Now what is to be found in theſe bookes? but filthineſſe and groſſe ignorance; as for learning, there is none to be found in them, which neuer came neare the ſhadow of learning themſelues, and as little wit, but a fewe fine words of luſt, which are chiefly ment to bend the minde to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe: yet are they led with this vaine ſuppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if they haue bin luld a ſleepe but one night on the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes lap, are able to publiſh any thing with well deſerued commendations: and I muſt needs ſay, that I my ſelfe haue read in them, and taken great delight in their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh lyes; but ſurely I could neuer find either goodnes or wit, vnles Vice be <hi>Vertue,</hi> or to tel a bawdie tale be wit.</p>
            <p>Neuertheles, I would not haue any man think, that I inueigh againſt, or diſcommend Poetrie; for in al ages it hath bin thought neceſſarie: but only againſt thoſe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Poeſie, who vnder the name &amp; title of Poets, foiſt<note place="margin">Modeſt Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> in their wanton &amp; laſciuious verſes. The true vſe of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie ſtandeth in two parts; the one in teaching the way to <hi>Vertue;</hi> the other to moue with delight therevnto: for honeſt delight ſtirreth vp men to take that goodneſſe in hand, which otherwiſe would bee loathſome &amp; vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: ſo that when it is bent to a good end, and euery thing laide out in his due annalligie, with ſome ioy the affections are thereby inuoked to a ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to imitate that goodneſſe wherevnto it is moued. Thoſe bookes that both delight and perſwade with learned diſcretion, &amp; out of which ſome wholſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cument may be extracted, though it be ſimple, yet is it praiſeable. Diſdaine not (ſaith the wiſe Heathen) the
<pb facs="tcp:5408:53"/>
ſimple labour of an other, though thou beeſt neuer ſo great; eſpecially if he ſpeake good words. Againe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the diuerſitie of mens minds, and how diuerſly they are diſpoſed, all honeſt delight is not to be diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, becauſe euery man may finde both pleaſure &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: for as I ſay, by a pleaſant diſcourſe the minde is more chearefully carried, both to read &amp; meditate, to muſe and ſtudie, &amp; the memory more willing to holde that it hath conceiued: So that Poetrie is no other thing, but a liuely preſentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of things ingeniouſly diſpoſed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Vertue</hi> is painted out with ſuch freſh colours, that the mind is inflamed with her excellent properties.</p>
            <p>Now whoſoeuer ſhall diſcent from this true vſe, is no Poet, but a vaine babler: for what are all theſe ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous tales, &amp; bawdie verſes? do theſe moue to <hi>Vertue</hi> with honeſt delight? nay doo they not rather ſtirre vp bawdrie and beaſtlineſſe? for are they not full of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme and ribald ſpeeches, to ſtirre vp the mind to ſhady idleneſſe? is this Poetrie? verily they are as vnworthy the name of Poets, as <hi>Chirrillus,</hi> who had nothing to grace his verſes by, but onely the name of <hi>Allex.</hi>

Anon colde winter grew on, and tooke from the Graſhopper her wonted moiſture, bereft him of his piping, and with his ſhackle hammes weakely skips too and fro, and beeing pincht wth hunger, and drencht with ſhewers, went for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to the Ant, her olde acquaintance, and entreated ſome teliefe, but the litle worme demaunded what ſhe had done all the Sommer time, ſhe could not prouide for Winter? The Graſhopper anſwered with a hollow voyce, ſhe ſung to delight the paſſenger: then now you may daunce quoth ſhe, to eaſe your hunger. With this the Graſhopper yeelding to the weathers extremities, foodeleſſe, comfortleſſe, and ſuccourleſſe, died without remedie: alluding by the alligorie to ſuch idle and lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie meacocks, who ſpend the Sommer of youth in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, that when the winter of olde age commeth, are forced to want and feele the ſtormes of penurie, and languiſh by inferred pouertie.

is good to ſeeke for thoſe things that may bring ioy and comfort to olde age.

Oh what goods and poſſeſſions did my friends leaue me, which are prodigally waſted? how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten did they ſeeke to reclaime me with good counſell if I had bene gracious? and thoſe vices that muſtered about my young yeares, how ſoone might I haue ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt them? but then being young and fooliſh, am now olde and beggerly: to whom ſhall I communicate my griefe, that will yeeld ſuccour? all my laments are boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, relentleſſe, and pittileſſe: what a heauie reckening haue I to make, waſting ſo many idle houres in eating,

            <p>Drunkenneſſe is no inbred nor inherent ſinne, but procured by cuſtome and bad company, it corrupteth the ſoule, ſucketh out the iuice of the body, withereth

the beautie, drieth vp the ſinewes, and like a canker cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodeth and deuoureth vp all good motions, making that body which ſhould be a holy temple, a habitacle and dwelling houſe for the diuell: for being ouerladen with wine &amp; gluttonie, the body is ſo much broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that as a holy Father ſaith, it is a wonder that thoſe bodies made of earth and clay, become not myre and dyrt: it ſtirreth the mind to whoredome, for like twins they are neuer a ſunder: <hi>Sine cerere &amp; baccho friget venus,</hi> without wine and belly-cheare luſt would be aſſwaged, incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of conceit: for you ſhall neuer ſee a drunkard ſo wel aduiſed to aske counſell, or with patience marke good documents, but either fleere and laugh it out, or be fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and quarelſome: and therefore Father <hi>Cate</hi> was wont to ſay, it was loſt labour to talke of <hi>Vertue</hi> to the belly, for that it hath no eares to heare, becauſe their looſe life maketh religion loathſome to their cares. This wine-waſhing licour giueth ſuch ſcope and libertie to the tongue, as it rowleth vp and downe reſtleſſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying the whole world with vnneceſſarie prattle, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into all degrees, cenſuring all men, and laying out that openly, which modeſtie would conceale, powring it into the boſome of his pot-mate: for the tongue of a drunken man, is the clozet of his heart; and that which a ſober man thinketh, a drunkard ſpeaketh. And as by a noiſe of crowes, one may gheſſe where carrion is, ſo a flocke of drunkards may be found by their words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo inflamed with the fume and ſtrength of the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, as it is impoſſible to keepe ſilence.

And as <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith, wine diſtracteth the wits of a wiſe man withvoluntary madneſſe, and his grauitie is vtterly quenched with indiſcretion. A drunken man is ſo prolixious and talkatiue, as he moleſteth all his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: if he be in company with a ſober man, he wearieth him with talke: if he come to the ſicke, he grieueth him more then his ſickneſſe: if in a ſhip among paſſengers, he annoyeth them more then the waues of the ſea: ſo that wherſoeuer he commeth, he is troublous and irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>

            <p>And though a drunkard recouer himſelfe againe, yet the effect doth ſtill remaine, leauing ſuch a ſlyme behinde, as defileth both body and ſoule: yet not a fewe are rocked a ſleepe in this brutiſh deſire: but ô
