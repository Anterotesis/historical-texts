            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WEre Patrons bound to Defend Books they never ſaw, as Seconds are, to Fight Men they never heard of, I ſhou'd not have Preſum'd to have made You a Dedication; for I am Oblig'd to tell the World of my Misfortune.
<pb facs="tcp:45220:3"/>
You never ſaw one Line of theſe Elegies, and ſo are abſolutely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engag'd from all Inadvertencies, Faults, and Follys, of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoever. And tho' Men are generally as fond of the Iſſues of their Brain, as thoſe of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and partially give it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without Fault; I am not ſo Conceited of mine, as to think I have writ without Miſtakes, tho' there is none that I know of.</p>
                  <p>You may remember, in <hi>July</hi> laſt, when I made you a Viſit about <hi>Peterborough,</hi> I told you I had ſome Papers of this Nature in ſome Friends Hands in Town and wiſh'd I had had em then, to have taken your Thoughts: Not
<pb facs="tcp:45220:3"/>
long after, I received them, and had no reaſon to alter my Deſign of Publiſhing 'em, at one time or another: Then I ſhow'd them to ſome of my Acquaintance in the Countrey, and ſeveral Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in the ſame Opinion, I took up this ſtill deſperate Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Printing. It has been a Humour in all Ages, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve never ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal as now, for Men to think it a Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from their own Character, to give another Man his; and when <hi>Homer</hi> has been Burleſqu'd, <hi>Virgil</hi> Traveſtied, <hi>Waller</hi> Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticis'd on, and <hi>Cowley</hi> Condemn'd, no Body muſt take it ill. <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> was a Man of Admirable
<pb facs="tcp:45220:4"/>
Wit, and his Writings will Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a Reſpect, 'till our Poets are inſpir'd. <hi>Waller</hi> indeed writ with more Art, and was the firſt of our Countrey-men that Affected that agreeable Smoothneſs, which with his large Share of Wit, makes his Poems perpetually Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But thoſe that Rail for no other Deſign than to be thought Critiques, are fond of a Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they are not able to maintain: And tho' they are a great part of Mankind, they are of ſo different a Complexion from the better part of Mankind, that they have as little Reſpect as Modeſty, and it's no Reflection to be out of their Favour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45220:4"/>
When I firſt began theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, the only Motive to me was my Diverſion, and to Perſue the Deſign of Entertaining my ſelf, I Chooſe this way of Imitation, which admits of more Liberty: And tho' the Alterations are not great, nor many, yet they are too many for a ſtrict Tranſlation. Beſides this, I had another Reaſon, which Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail d with me, more than my Eaſe, and that was <hi>Ovid</hi> s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Senſe of his Misfortunes, in a hundred places of his Elegies: He is ſo Melted with his Sorrows, that his Complaints diſcover a Weakneſs, which is better hid. <hi>Ovid</hi>'s was indeed a very hard Caſe as could be, and it's no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:45220:5"/>
if the Affection he had for his own Countrey, the paſſionate Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for his Wife, and Family, together with the dreadful Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the barbarous People he was going to, if all theſe ſhockt his Reſolution, and made him write his Fears; and it is rather to be wiſh'd he had done it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer, than to be wonder'd he did it at all.</p>
                  <p>The true Occaſion of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as far as I can learn, has been a laſting Secret, and men of his own time could but Gueſs; the moſt probable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture to me, is, that he ſuffer'd not ſo much for his own Fault, as Caeſar's, that he was Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:45220:5"/>
of ſomething that made Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar uneaſie; I don't think it was any Familiarity with <hi>Livia,</hi> or <hi>Julia,</hi> that gave him <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s <hi>Diſpleaſure,</hi> and thoſe Verſes,
<q>
                        <l>Cur aliquid vidi? cur noxia lumina feci,</l>
                        <l>Cur imprudenti cognita culpa mihi eſt.</l>
                     </q>
ſignify no more, than that he was unfortunately Privy to ſome diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Action of Caeſar's, and he durſt not truſt him at home. Had his Crime been of ſo high a Nature, as to have wrong'd him in his Wife, or Daughter, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not been Puniſhment enough: And had it been <hi>Livia,</hi> he durſt not ſo much as have mention'd her; but we find him
<pb facs="tcp:45220:6"/>
in the ſecond Book of his Elegies, which he writes to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> particularly commending his <hi>Livia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Livia ſic tecum ſociales impleat annos,</l>
                     <l>Quae niſi te, nullo conjuge digna fuit,</l>
                     <l>Quae ſi non eſſet, caelebs te vita deceret,</l>
                     <l>Nullaque, cui poſſes eſſe maritus, erat.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>But this is ſtill Conjecture, and all the Proofs that can be Amaſs'd of either ſide, amount to no more; and therefore I ſhall leave the Reader to his Liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretending to determine from any of 'em. But whatever was the Occaſion of his Baniſhment, he was Treated with great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect by thoſe of his own time, and his Writings have been
<pb facs="tcp:45220:6"/>
judg'd very Fortunate, by thoſe of ſeveral Ages ſince. The two <hi>Seneca's, Marcus</hi> and <hi>Lucius, Velleius Paterculus, Quintilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Cornelius Tacitus, Martial, Statius Pampinius, Angelus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litianus, Eraſmus, Julius Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> theſe and a great many more have all intereſted themſelves in the Commendations of <hi>Ovid,</hi> and are more than Common Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritys.</p>
                  <p>And now <hi>SIR,</hi> if you can find any thing in the following ſheets that may Divert you, when Tired with, or Indiſpoſed for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Studies, I ſhall have the greateſt part of my Deſign, and
