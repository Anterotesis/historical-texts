            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll Scripture commeth from one fountaine, which is the spirit of God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Scripture is fit to perfect the man, of God. But as in <hi>Paradise,</hi> though there were one Fountaine, yet it was diuided into foure Riuers, whose waters were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly rellished, according to the nature of the soile through which they passed: Or as in an Instrument of Musike, though one winde giue a generall sound, yet by the diuersitie of the Pipes and Organs, the Tones are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So the holy Scriptures, inspired by one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, haue an accidentall difference, according to the nature of the Pen-men of the facred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">Prologe in Iobum.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Hence is it that <hi>Gregorie</hi> compared some
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27483:3"/>
Scriptures to <hi>Iacobs</hi> hasle rods; partly pilled, and partly couered: other Scriptures to <hi>Achabs</hi> house of Iuory, without any couering.</p>
            <p>The Scripture that I haue read, is of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sort, which craueth your attention whilst it is enterpreted: craueth your affection when it is applied: And iustly doth it craue both; the Holy Ghost ioyning together <hi>Ima summis,</hi> the highest and the lowest things, as <hi>Leo</hi> speaketh. The first proposition being of <hi>Death.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Life. Death,</hi> of all things the most ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. <hi>Life,</hi> of all things the most comfortable.</p>
            <p>To leaue an impression in you, I will compare them to the two remarkeable <hi>Trees</hi> in <hi>Paradise.</hi> The first is as the <hi>Tree</hi> of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good &amp; euill. The second, as the <hi>Tree</hi> of immortalitie. The first the experimentall <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Death.</hi> The second as the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both of these haue a double consideration.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>tree</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> you may consider. First the bitter <hi>roote,</hi> which is <hi>sinne,</hi> and the euill <hi>fruit,</hi> which is <hi>death,</hi> the <hi>wages</hi> of <hi>sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>tree</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> you may consider the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>roote,</hi> which is Gods gift; and the happy <hi>fruit,</hi> which is <hi>eternall life by Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>

               <hi>Sinne</hi> the <hi>roote</hi> of <hi>death. Death</hi> the <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>sin.</hi> The <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>roote</hi> of <hi>life.

               <p>The first is Sinne, which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth define to be the breach of Gods law. A law so much vrged by the iustice of God, that our <hi>Sauiour Christ</hi> proclaimeth that heauen and earth shall passe away, but one iod or title shall in no wise passe from the law, til all be fulfilled. One <hi>Iod,</hi> which is but a letter amongst the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, as the graine of Mustard seed, the least of all letters, but one point (.) of a letter. From whence the <hi>Rabines</hi> haue obserued, that God changing the name of <hi>Sarai</hi> to <hi>Sara,</hi> tooke one <hi>Iod</hi> from her name; which that it might not be taken from the Law, he added one <hi>Iod</hi> to <hi>Osheah,</hi> and called him <hi>Iehoshuah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Law so vrged that S. <hi>Paul</hi> repeates the sentence of God in a language of fear &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Cursed is euery man that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to doe them.</hi> VVe are (<hi>bound</hi>), we are (<hi>All</hi>) bound, all to (<hi>Doe</hi>) to doe (<hi>All,</hi>) all to (<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi>)

               <p>This is the sentence of God against <hi>Sinne:</hi> against <hi>euery Sinne:</hi> against the least <hi>Sinne:</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a <hi>sinne</hi> of <hi>Thought,</hi> or <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>Degree,</hi> or <hi>Delight,</hi> or <hi>Desperation,</hi> or <hi>Omission.</hi> God hath concluded <hi>All Sinne</hi> to be the <hi>Roote of Death</hi> and destruction.</p>

                  <note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>in corpore:</hi> VVhen the vnwilling soule is manacled to the body. The first expressed in the young man. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 22. to whom Christ sayd, <hi>Let the dead burie the dead.</hi> A strange speach; for a man would thinke that the dead were more fit to be buried, then to burie: But therefore was it deliuered by Christ, that euery Christian man may know, <hi>That a sinners body, is but the breathing Sepulchre of a sinners soule.</hi> The second expressed in <hi>Lazarus: Iohn</hi> 11. 39. <hi>Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he hath bin dead foure daies.</hi> VVhose body in life is a beautifull caske of Iuory, within foure daies after the soules departure, is nothing else but a stinking and loathsome carrion. The third expressed in <hi>Diues, Luke</hi> 16. 24. <hi>Hee prayed to Father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> therefore he had a Soule: <hi>He had a tongue to be cooled;</hi> therefore he had a Body.</p>
               <p>That wretched man may know that this is euerlasting Death, when soule and body are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27483:6"/>
coupled together with euerlasting chaines of sorrow, that they may be sensible of their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse torment.</p>
               <p>But howsoeuer these three deaths are the wages of <hi>sinne,</hi> yet there is a difference in the manner: For the death of the <hi>soule</hi> is the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of sinne,</hi> as an act of order: The death of the <hi>body,</hi> as an act of iustice: The death of <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>body</hi> as an act of proportion.</p>
               <p>First, there is order in disorder. Mans disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: God doth order. You read <hi>Exodus</hi> 7. 13. that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardned his owne heart; before God hardned the hart of <hi>Pharaoh. Durities est hominis peccatum, obduratio iudiciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dei:</hi> they are the words of <hi>Caluin,</hi> vpon the third vers, which I purposely alledge. <hi>Hardnesse of heart is mans sinne; hardening of the heart is Gods iudgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You read in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 9. 10. that God gaue to <hi>Saul</hi> an other heart. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 26. <hi>Samuel</hi> said to <hi>Saul, Thou hast cast away the Lord, &amp; the Lord hath cast away thee.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>The spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an euill spirit from the Lord troubled him.</hi> So you see that <hi>Saul</hi> first resisted Gods spirit, before God sent vpon <hi>Saul</hi> an euill spirit. In the very root of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; <hi>Adam</hi> first sinned, and then God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:27483:7"/>It is the Conclusion of <hi>Augustine,</hi> which shal conclude this point. <hi>Ad bonum prior est voluntas Creatoris, ad malum prior est voluntas Creaturae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods will in goodnes, is the first efficient.</p>
               <p>Mans wil in wickednes is the first deficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinne</hi> goes before, and <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>soule</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in order as the <hi>wages</hi> of <hi>sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Bodily-death,</hi> when the <hi>soule is</hi> brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed out, as it was breathed in; when the <hi>body</hi> which was composed of dust, is resolued into dust, is the <hi>wages</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> as an act of Iustice.

that euery body composed of contrary ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, disposed into contrary humors, must at length haue a naturall date of corruption.

               <p>If then <hi>Philosophers</hi> giue probable reason of this difference, because they say, <hi>Forma coeli tollit contradictionem materiae:</hi> The forme of heauen taketh away all contrariety, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues them in an euiternity.

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:27483:8"/>Examine then the cause of naturall death, which is the decay of radicall humor: If then the eating of the tree of life, did not, <hi>as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meate, onely refresh the body,</hi> but as a <hi>Celestiall cordiall, did repaire the naturall sappe of the body,</hi> then no question but the <hi>Angells</hi> sword that kept our first <hi>Parents</hi> from the tree of <hi>life,</hi> brought vpon <hi>them,</hi> brought <hi>vpon vs, Legem moriendi,</hi> as the Fathers speake, the Law of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>destruction.</hi> This is Gods iustice, when man defaced Gods image in his soule, to take away the power of the soule.

               <p>And yet behold, wee are prodigall of our liues, to spend them vpon Harlots, as the young-man in the Gospell, who after his surfetting with his droues of Harlots, could not any way be satisfied amongest the heards of <hi>Hoggs.</hi>

               <p>In the 5. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> verse. 3. There lay a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of impotent folk at the poole of <hi>Bethesda:</hi> Some blinde, some halt, some withered. So
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:27483:11"/>
many sicke, so many sinners. It is plaine by <hi>Christs</hi> words: <hi>Sinne no more, least a worse thing come vnto thee. Sinne no more:</hi> Therefore hee sinned before: therefore he sickned, therefore <hi>Iezabell</hi> died, therefore all the world shall be dissolued.</p>
               <p>It is the wicked mans curse, that <hi>Hee shall not liue out halfe his dayes.</hi> VVhy, doth God alter his decrees? Surely no; But man hauing a generall period of <hi>Life,</hi> by naturall constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if sicknesse within, and casualties without doe not take away life, hee may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the yeares of his Fathers. But wicked men pull vpon themselues <hi>ordinary rottennesse,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary iudgements: They liue not out halfe their dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude. <hi>Why will you die, O you house of Israell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man is so fearefull at his Death, as the Carnall man that is Prodigall of his life.</hi> But if this were all, the <hi>Epicure</hi> would doe well enough. Hee would say of his <hi>Death; Quando mors est, nos non sumus, quando nos su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, mors non est:</hi> VVhen <hi>Death</hi> is, wee are not; VVhen wee are, <hi>Death</hi> is not. There is therefore another <hi>Death</hi> which imprisons
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27483:12"/>
a damned <hi>soule</hi> in a tormented <hi>body.</hi> VVhere <hi>Death</hi> is, and <hi>Man</hi> is. <hi>Vbi anima est non viuendi causa sed dolendi:</hi> VVhere, saith S. <hi>Austen,</hi> the <hi>soule</hi> is not to giue comfort of <hi>life;</hi> but to giue the sence of eternall <hi>Death.</hi> The apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which <hi>Death,</hi> hath drawne water out of rocks, and clouen iron hearts in sunder. It is the excellent speech of <hi>Luther. Qui nouit quid sit certare cum formidine aeternae mortis, in sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum fletibus nullos excessus reperiet:</hi> Hee that knoweth what it is to striue with the feare of eternall <hi>Death,</hi> shall finde no strangenes in the affected passions of the <hi>Saints</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You read of <hi>Peter</hi> that he wept bitterly. Of <hi>Ieremy</hi> that he was drunke with wormewood. Of <hi>Mary</hi> that washed <hi>Christs</hi> feete with teares. Of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he caused his bed to swim. Of <hi>Ionas,</hi> that hee cried out of the belly of hell. Their hearts whilest they sinned, were like frozen snowballs: when they melted with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of eternall fire, they thawed out at their eies, and caused a flood of teares.</p>
               <p>It is obseruable in <hi>Christs</hi> prayer, <hi>Luk. 13. 34. Father, forgiue them, they know not what they do.</hi> In the <hi>Conuerts</hi> prayer, <hi>Act. 2. Men and brethren, Quid faciemus,</hi> what shall we do? VVhen they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27483:12"/>
crucifie, they know not what they doe: when they heare they haue crucified, they know not what to doe.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this point, with another pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate meditation: That a sorrowfull soule apprehending the wrath of God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit punishment due to <hi>sin.</hi> Such a sinner goeth to heauen by the very gates of hell; his sighes,<note place="margin">Luther.</note> as pillars of smoake perfumed with myrhhe, ascend vp into the presence of God, to implore mercy, being fully assured in the middest of all his feares, that howsoeuer <hi>Eternall Death is the wages of sinne,</hi> yet that the <hi>Gift of God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Tree of life,</hi> the <hi>Roote</hi> whereof is the <hi>Grace and gift of God by Iesus Christ:</hi> The <hi>Fruit eternall Life, and happinesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of these the time will not permit to speake largely; and yet no Tongue can speake <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Roote,</hi> we may first obserue that it is a <hi>Gift. Death</hi> is <hi>wages, no Gift. Life</hi> is a <hi>Gift,</hi> and <hi>no Wages. Wages</hi> supposeth <hi>Demerrit. Gift</hi> supposeth <hi>no Merit.</hi> If it bee a <hi>Gift,</hi> then is it not <hi>deserued.</hi> If it bee <hi>Deserued,</hi> then is it no <hi>Gift.</hi> In one word S. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath concluded
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27483:13"/>
it. <hi>Sufficit ad meritum scire, quod non sufficiant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita:</hi> It is sufficient to know of <hi>Merits</hi> that there is no sufficiency of our <hi>Merits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Gift</hi> then it is: but not <hi>euery Gift.</hi> A <hi>gift</hi> it is, but not <hi>euery way</hi> a <hi>Gift.</hi> For first; It is <hi>Donum Dei,</hi> the <hi>Gift</hi> of God; to make a <hi>distinction</hi> from mens <hi>Gifts.</hi> And next it is <hi>per Iesum Christum,</hi> by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to <hi>distinguish</hi> it from the <hi>common Gifts</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> First: It is the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> not the <hi>Pharises Gift. Math.</hi> 28. <hi>They gaue large gifts to the Souldiers,</hi> to equiuocate &amp; lie artificially: <hi>Say that whilst wee slept his Disciples stole him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> But the <hi>Gifts</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are not giuen to <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt vs,</hi> but to <hi>amend vs.</hi> It is no <hi>Pharises Gift.</hi> Neyther is it <hi>Dionysius Gift,</hi> to rob the temple, that they may build an Hospitall. The <hi>price</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> was such a <hi>Gift</hi> to buy the <hi>Potters field</hi> to burie strangers, but it is the <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> vntill this day.</p>
               <p>God takes not life from one, that hee may giue it to another. <hi>Our Saluation is not builded vpon the Angels Damnation:</hi> But in the due order of causes, hee would haue all to be saued.</p>
               <p>It is not <hi>Iacobs Gift,</hi> for feare of <hi>Esau,</hi> to pacifie <hi>Esaus</hi> wrath. <hi>For whether we liue, we liue vnto the Lord, or whether we die, we die vnto the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is not any <hi>mans gift,</hi> which is subiect to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,</hi> for the <hi>vnthankefulnesse of the receiuer:</hi> For the <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>life</hi> in the <hi>Saints</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> hath this power, that as it giueth <hi>Happinesse,</hi> so it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>thankfulnes.
