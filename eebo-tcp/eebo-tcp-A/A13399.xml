            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

AGesilaus that great kyng of the Lacedemonians, when he was asked, by what meanes a manne myghte attayne to haue an honeste name amonges men, Aunswered: If he speake that is beste, and do that is most honeste. What thynge coulde be spoken more briefly? and agayn, what more absolutely?</p>
               <p>He was accustomed to say, that the office of a capytayne is agaynst rebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to vse hardynes, and agaynste his liege subiettes gentylnes,</p>

Afterwarde he brought theym bothe forthe into the Gyldhall before all the citizens, and caused to be layde there certayne delycate meates, &amp; also by them thornes and breres: forthwith he put forth an hare.

Assuredly, the thynge that Lycurgus dyd in his citye, is of euery howsholder to be done in his house, and of euery gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure in his flocke. Nature (I woll well) is a thynge of great myght and efficacye, but surely institution or brin gynge vp, is moche myghtier, whiche is hable to amende, reforme &amp; streygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a croked and euyll nature, and to turne the same into a good nature.

               <p>Furthermore in those tymes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stytie of maried women was so greate and they so farre of, frome the lite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, whiche afterwarde they fell to, that at begynnynge the synne of ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoutrie was thougth impossyble euer to haue chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced amonges them.

               <p>Demaunded why he inacted a law that in tymes of warres, they shulde oftentymes chaunge theyr tentes and pauylyons: To the entent, ꝙ he, we maye hurte oure ennemies the more. The Lacedemonians bycause they were nymble and lite, remeued with no great busynes theyr oost: where as theyr enemies coulde not do the same, without theyr great inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, and also with longer respyte: for as moche as they caryed about with them so ma my baggages and burthens.</p>

Demaunded why he ordeyned that the Lacedemonians shuld make their sacryfyce and oblation with small and chepe thinges. Bicause, ꝙ he, we shuld neuer want wherwith to honour god. Who wolde not saye, but that in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne worshyppynges of god, all roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie and sumptuouse magnyficence is lyttell ynough?

                  <pb facs="tcp:11697:9"/>
SOcrates the Atheniense a great philosopher, and of moste pure liuynge, was wont to teache, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men oughte to absteyne from meates that wolde prouoke the man not hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie to eate, &amp; from drynkes that wold allure, the not thurstye to dryncke.</p>
               <p>He sayd, the veste sawce is hungre, for as moch as it bothe best sweteneth all thynges, and is of no coste. And therfore he him selfe dyd euer eate and dryncke with swetnes, bycause he byd neyther of them, but when he hungred and thursted.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he accustomed him selfe to beare hungre and thurste. For at what tymes other men coueted moste to dryncke, then wold he neuer drynke of the fyrst cuppe that was fylled. And when he was demaunded, why he dyd so, he aunswered, bycause he wold not accustome hym selfe to folow his affec tions and Iustes.


<pb facs="tcp:11697:10"/>
He sayd, those that excercysed them selfes to chastnes of liuyng, and sobre diette, had both farre more pleasure &amp; lesse sorowe, then they that with moste a doo sought all the pleasures of the worlde: for as moch as the pleasures of intemperate persons, besydes the torment of theyr conscience, besydes theyr euyll name and pouertie, where vnto they be at lengthe broughte, do bryng for the most parte euen to their bodies also more peyne then pleasure. On the contrarie parte, the thynges that be beste, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same be made also most pleasaunt, if thou acquayntest thy self with them.</p>
               <p>He sayde, it was an hyghe reproche for a man by seruynge and obeynge wylfully his inordinate pleasures, to make hym selfe suche one as no man wolde be glad to haue for the drudge or slaue of his house.</p>
               <p>When he was admonyshed by his


<pb facs="tcp:11697:10"/>
frend, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the feastyng of his gestes, he made very sklender prouysyon: he answered, yf they be good men, it shall be ynough, yf not, more then ynough.</p>
               <p>The same Socrates when he was asked, why he hym selfe dyd not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the comon welth, syth he knewe beste howe to gouerne it, answered, that he is more profytable to his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie that maketh many good gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the same, then he whiche go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth it well hym selfe.</p>

               <p>He sayde it was farre vnfyttynge, that where as no man professeth or practyseth any handy craft w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out his great shame, onles he hath lerned it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet to the gouernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, men be admytted &amp; appoynted which neuer employed their wyttes to lernyng.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:11697:11"/>
He was accustomed to saye, that no possessyon is more precyouse, then a trewe and good frende to a man, nor that no greatter frute or pleasure can be any other where taken. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sayde, that many men do ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwartly and clene out of ordre, which beare more greuously the losse of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, then the losse of theyr frende, and whiche crye they haue loste the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite that they haue conferred and gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for nothynge, where as in dede they haue with the same gotten them a frende better than any golde.</p>
               <p>He was wont to saye, that he moste resembleth god, whiche nedeth fewest thynges, for as moche as god nedeth nothynge at all.</p>
               <p>He sayde, many lyued to eate and drynke, but he contrarily dyd eate and drynke to lyue, for as moch as he vsed these thynges not for pleasure, but for the necessitie of nature.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:11697:11"/>
Suche as bought dearly thynges ouer tymely rype, he sayde despayred, that they shulde not lyue tyll the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed tyme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rypenes of thynges were come. Elles it were great folye to bye thynges bothe worse, and also dearer, where as shortly after, a man may bye the same bothe better and for lesse price. Thus he euermore called backe agayne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> desyres of men voyde of reason, vnto sobre iugement.</p>
               <p>Also he vsed to saye, he that hath begon a thyng hath halfe done: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge halfe the worke is done of hym, that hath ones set vpon it. For there be many that in taryenge and takyng a breath, what is best to do, spende all theyr lyfe vaynly.</p>
               <p>Demaunded of a certayne yonge man, whether he iudged it better for hym to marye a wyfe, or not to marye. He answered: Whether so euer thou dost, thou shalte surely repente. Syg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieng,

that bothe syngle life and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so wedlocke haue theyr incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and displeasures, whiche to beare a manne, muste fyrste arme and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare hym selfe.

Wedlocke agayn hath these, contynuall care, dayly complayntes, vpbraydynge of that she broughte, the heuy lookes of her kynsfolke, the pratlyng tonge of thy mother in lawe, Cukkoldemakynge, the vncertayne proufe of thy chyldren, and other innu merable inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities. Wherfore here is no such choyse, as is betwene good and euyll, but suche as is betwene the heuyer and the lyter inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities.</p>
               <p>He wolde haue menne craue of god nothynge but good thynges without further addition, where as the people


<pb facs="tcp:11697:12"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly craue ryche maryages, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, honoures, kyngdomes, longe life, as thoughe they wolde appoynte god what he oughte to do. But god knoweth beste what is good for vs, &amp; what not.</p>
               <p>He wolde that mennes sacryfices, shulde stande them in very lytell or no thynge, bycause god as he nedeth not mennes thynges, so he wayeth rather the myndes of the offerers, then the ry ches. For ellys where as the naughty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>este persons do moste flowe in riches, it were very euyll with mankynde, yf god delyted more in the sacryfyces of the euyll personnes, then in the sacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyces of good men.</p>
               <p>Lyke as we commytte the makyng of pyctures or ymages, sayde So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, vnto them whome alredye we knowe to haue made verye godly pyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so we oughte to admytte none

               <p>Walkyng about through the mar ket, when he espyed the great multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of merchaundyse, and thynges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were solde / he thus was wonte to saye with hym selfe. Oh how many thynges be here, that I haue no nede of, but other men be vexed in mynde, thynkyng thus: howe many thynges do I lacke. Socrates reioysed with hym selfe, that lyuynge accordynge to nature, and accustomynge hym selfe to fewe thynges, he neyther coueted nor yet neded gold, purpull, precyouse stones, gorgyouse hanginges, and the reste of ryche mens delytes, whyche, he was wont to saye, were more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarye for the playenge of tragedies or enterludes, then for the behoufe of mans lyfe.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:11697:13"/>
He sayde, knowledge was the beste thynge a man coulde haue, &amp; agayne ignoraunce the worste thynge, for as moche as who so euer dothe any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryghtuose thynge, dothe the same by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knoweth not what his duytie is towarde euery man. And they that be stronge of harte, be therfore so, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they knowe that suche thynges ought to be done, whiche the common sorte of people iuge to be eschued, and they that be intemperate personnes, are herein deceyued, that they thynke those thynges to be swete, pleasaunt, and combly, whiche be nothynge so in dede. Wherfore the beste thyng in the world (he sayd) is the knowlege what thynges ought be desyred, and what to be eschued.</p>
               <p>To such as maruayled, why he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed of good maners euer, &amp; neuer of the planetes and heuenly bodyes, as the other philosophers were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed,


<pb facs="tcp:11697:14"/>
he answered. Those thynges that be aboue vs, perteyne nothynge vnto vs.</p>
               <p>When on a tyme as he went in the stretes, a lewde felowe gaue hym a blowe on the cheke, he answered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge elles but that men knewe not, when they shulde come out with theyr salettes on theyr heddes.</p>
               <p>The same Socrates, when a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let spurned hym on the shynnes as he walked, &amp; his frendes that were with hym meruayled he suffred the iniurie so pacyently. What wolde ye haue me do ꝙ he, they mouynge hym to haue the felowe to the lawe. It were a mad nesse ꝙ he, yf when an asse shuld hytte me on the shynnes, ye wolde saye vnto me, haue hym vnto the lawe. He put no dyfference betwene an asse and a brutyshe man furnysshed with no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and he thought it a great shame, man not to suffre that thynge of man


<pb facs="tcp:11697:14"/>
whyche he wolde suffre of abrute beast.</p>
               <p>He was wont to monishe his frend Eschines, whiche was pressed with po uertie, that he shulde borowe of his owne selfe, and shewed hym the waye how, by withdrawyng from hym selfe superfluouse meates and other thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, accordyng to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prouerbe <hi>Magnum uectigal parsimonia,</hi> Sparyng is great rentes or reuenues. Certes, the moste redy waye to encrease a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes substaunce is, to abate his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses.</p>
               <p>Socrates whenne he hadde suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his wyfe Xantippa a longe season skowldynge within the house, and at laste for werynesse wente and satte hym before the dore, she beynge more out of pacyence by his quyetnes and gentle sufferaunce, streyghte out of the wyndowe powred downe a pysse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowle vppon his hedde.


<pb facs="tcp:11697:15"/>
At whiche thynge, whenne the neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and the passers by hadde good game, Socrates also hym selfe smy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, sayenge. I easyly gessed that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so great thunderynges, we shulde haue rayne.</p>
               <p>When his frende Alcibiades mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyled y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he coulde suffre in his house so shrewed and skouldynge a woman, as was his wyfe, Xantippa, I ꝙ he, am longe sithens so accustomed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all, that I am no more greued; than whenne I heare the noyse of the whele, that draweth the water vp out of the welle.

               <p>Demaunded the same questyon at an other tyme, he aunswered: She teacheth me at home pacyence, that I

               <p>Socrates mette Xenophon in a cer tayne lane, and whenne he behelde the yonge man to be of a verye good natu rall disposition and wytte, he held out his staffe and stopped hym, that he coulde not passe / wherat when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong man steyed, he asked hym where sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye merchaundyse were made &amp; sold, whiche comonly men do vse. Where vnto when Xenophon had redily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, he demaunded, where menne were made good. When the yongma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made answere, that he knewe not.

And hadde it not ben better Plato, that thou also had deste shewed me of this, betwene the and me secretly? Thus moste wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyly he repreued hym of the same fault in hym selfe, that he founde in an other.</p>
               <p>Demaunded what was the pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypall vertue of yonge men. Truely ꝙ he, that they attempte nothynge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer moche. Signifieng that the heate of youth can vnnethes suffre them to kepe measure in thynges.</p>
               <p>Lettres which comenly men thinke were inuented to helpe the memorye, he sayde, by occasyon dyd moch hurte the memorye. For in olde tyme menne when they harde a thynge woorthy to

But after that the vse of lettres was founde oute, whyle they truste to theyr bokes, they haue not soo greattely studyed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prynte the thynges in theyr mynde, whiche they haue lerued. Thus it commeth to passe, that the exercyse of the memorye set aparte, the knowlege of thynges is not so fresshe and redy, as it hath ben, and euery man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nowe moche lesse then in the olde tyme they dyd, sythe that so moche we knowe, as we beare in mynde.</p>
               <p>He sayde, that men oughte to obey the lawes of the realme or cytte, but women oughte too obey the rytes,

vsages and maners of theyr husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des with whome they lyue. Certes, the rule of the wedded woman is the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, and she liueth ryghtly yf he be obedyent to the publique lawes.</p>
               <p>Unto Euclides who was very stu dyouse of sophisticall subtilties, he fayde. O Euclides, thou mayste well vse the companye of Sophisters, but the companye of men thou canste not vse.

PHilip kynge of Macedonie, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Alexander the greate, a manne of no small wytte, and a greate conquerour, When on a tyme he had purposed to take a stronge ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle and holde, and his espyes hadde shewed hym that it was very hard for hym to brynge to passe, yea and impos syble: He asked them whether it were so harde, that an asse laden with golde myght not come vnto it. Meanynge that there is nothynge so stronge, but with golde it maye be wonne.</p>
               <p>There were some of his foreyn sub giettes whom he hadde founde not ve ry trustie, which complayned and toke the matier heuely, that his seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes called them traytours.

Meanyng that in very dede they were traytours. Uplandyshe and homely persons can not qualifie, but call eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thyng by the proper name.</p>
               <p>He counsayled his son Alexander, that such as were of any authoryte in the common weale, as well the good as the euyll, he shuld make them his fren des, and that he shulde vse the good, and abuse the euyll. Certes, the chiefe feate of kynges is to reiecte none, but to applye all mens seruyces to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profyte.</p>
