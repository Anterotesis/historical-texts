            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His small Book hopes for thy <hi>Acceptance,</hi> meerly for its <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Plainness,</hi> which I have chiefly stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died all along; a <hi>plain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> being fittest upon <hi>plainness of Heart.</hi> I am not ignorant of the various &amp; excellent Tractates up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Subject;</hi> unto which

               <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Variation</hi> of <hi>Method</hi> is super added, which I hope you will find in this piece in hand.</p>
            <p>Moreover there are such swarmes of litigious <hi>Books of Controversies,</hi> which scorch up all true Love and Zeal, and greatly grieve such as <hi>love Peace,</hi> that may perhaps make such Discourses as this concerning the Vitals of <hi>genuine Piety,</hi> to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry necessary. For certainly if our ends were <hi>Right,</hi> and our <hi>Hearts Upright</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100513:3"/>
with our God; if Christian Magistrates, Ministers, and People were plainly and truly bent to promote the Honour, Love and Fear of God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable wayes of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we should soon <hi>agree,</hi> or else charitably <hi>indulge</hi> one another in these <hi>lesser</hi> things; 'Tis <hi>Hypocrites</hi> on all sides that make our <hi>wound incurable.</hi> Surely where the <hi>Mind</hi> is <hi>sound,</hi> and the <hi>Heart sincere</hi> in the <hi>Main,</hi> grains of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance should be granted
<pb facs="tcp:100513:4"/>
for some <hi>Errors</hi> of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and <hi>Failings</hi> in the Conversation; lest we deal with others, as we would be loath to be dealt with, either by God or Men. The Consideration hereof, as also of the <hi>scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of sincere Christians, to the <hi>plenty</hi> of Hypocrites in the world, may make some Tolerable <hi>Apology</hi> for this small <hi>Tract;</hi> which I do most earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend, first to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and then to your <hi>diligent</hi> perusal.

Read and think, and read and pray, and then through his Grace it shall be useful to you. <hi>And I beseech you for the Lord Jesus sake, and for the love of the Spirit, strive together with me, in your prayers to God for me</hi> a miserable sinner, that I may be <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and Useful</hi> till I dye, whereby you will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly recompence these Indeavours of</p>

An excellent practise: What a comfort would it be for you to read how good your <hi>God</hi> was to your <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Grandfather,</hi> that are dead and gone?

There is another word of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and that is, <hi>Singleness of heart, Acts</hi> 2. 46. <hi>They did eat their meat with gladness, and singleness of heart,</hi> that is, with a cordial chearfulness and bounty: And to this referrs that, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 34. <hi>When thine eye is single</hi> (when thy heart is singly bent to honour and serve God, then the whole life will relish of that principle) <hi>the whole body will be full of light:</hi> but if the <hi>heart double</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> will be no way <hi>uniform</hi> with men. And this is taken to be the meaning of the <hi>Oneness of heart</hi> promised, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. whereas the hypocrite hath <hi>an heart, and an heart, and an heart, and an heart,</hi> for every lust an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100513:13"/>
heart. <hi>A double minded man is unstable in all his wayes.</hi> He is unresolved in the <hi>end</hi> he drives at, and so unfixed in his <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> that tend thereunto. Now the upright mans heart is one, he goes all one way, he is what he seems, one intention, one delight, one face, one tongue; in a word, he is all <hi>but one man, Psalm</hi> 103. 1. <hi>Bless the Lord, O my soul, and ALL that is within me praise his holy Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to this purpose is the <hi>fourth</hi> word, that signifies uprightness and that is <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 4. <hi>And if thou wilt walk before me, as</hi> David <hi>walked, in Integrity of heart and in uprightness.</hi>—And that is when <hi>all</hi> the soul in <hi>every</hi> faculty is resolv'd, and bent for <hi>God</hi> and his glory. In an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite the <hi>Judgment</hi> is against the <hi>Will,</hi> the <hi>Conscience</hi> against the <hi>Affection,</hi> the <hi>Reason</hi> against the <hi>Appetite,</hi> but in the upright, all the faculties agree, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine within themselves, and the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is onely outward, against a <hi>common enemy. He</hi> is a <hi>whole man,</hi> for the <hi>whole will</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>So then you see an upright man is a <hi>True hearted, a sincere-hearted, a single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, and a whole-hearted man.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning <hi>uprightness of heart,</hi> we must assert, that it is not so much a <hi>distinct Grace,</hi> a grace by its self, as it is <hi>all Grace,</hi> tis that which stamps a <hi>Reality</hi> on every other grace: Without it, <hi>Nec amanda est ipsa Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas, nec ipsi Fidei fidendum, nec bene speran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum de ipsa spe.</hi> We cannot <hi>believe</hi> our <hi>Faith,</hi> nor <hi>love</hi> our <hi>Love,</hi> nor <hi>hope</hi> well of our <hi>Hope</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p>Uprightness and Watchfulness are <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> graces, of a general necessity; the former, to wit, Uprightness, to the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of Grace, and the latter, to wit, Watchfulness, to the <hi>Preservation</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi> of Grace. And belike on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, sincerity is called <hi>a Girdle, Ephes.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>having your loyns girt about with truth.</hi> Religion is to many as a <hi>Cloak,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100513:14"/>
(though it will prove the dearest Cloak that ever was worn) which they can <hi>put on</hi> abroad, when it serves their <hi>purposes,</hi> and <hi>put off</hi> at home when it troubles them in their <hi>lusts;</hi> but now sincerity is like a <hi>Girdle,</hi> that ties it close to us. This makes all our Garments sit close to us, and to be <hi>ungirt</hi> here is to be <hi>unblest.</hi> And may be thus described.</p>
                  <p>Uprightness of heart is that <hi>Grace, or gracious temper, whereby the soul is unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly resigned to God, and heartily bent to walk with him without guile.</hi> In short, when one is <hi>A man after Gods own heart:</hi> for Truth is nothing but an agreement of things with their first <hi>Principles,</hi> so that the <hi>Heart</hi> agreeing plainly with the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is an upright heart.</p>
                  <p>The same thing is meant by an <hi>Honest heart, Luke</hi> 8. 15. that is resolved to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry squarely towards <hi>God;</hi> as there in the hearing of Gods Word, when the heart is clearly carried with the stream of Gods will, without <hi>Exception</hi> or <hi>Dissimulation.</hi> As you know an honest man is ruled and swayed by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> in a business, without squinting at his own opinions and ends, even so an upright heart honestly yields his Reason and Will captive to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100513:14"/>
                     <hi>Will of God,</hi> though it cross his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and ends. And thus <hi>he is a man after Gods own heart,</hi> is as like him (humane frailty considered) <hi>as ever he can look.</hi> Now this blessed Uprightness may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,</p>

The <hi>Ground</hi> and root of Uprightness of Heart, stands in the total Receiving of Christ by the Heart, and the total Resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Heart unto him.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>To be <hi>content</hi> of a Christ, because of some present need of him is one thing, is nothing, if that be all: but to <hi>chuse him</hi> as the <hi>fairest of ten thousand,</hi> and that with an intire heart; to have Mind, Will, Conscience and Affection, all of a mind, and this mind to be set on <hi>Christs yoke</hi> as well as his <hi>Crown,</hi> his <hi>Spirit</hi> as well as his <hi>Merit,</hi> his <hi>Rule</hi> as well as his <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> here goes the upright heart: whereas an hypocrite he hath some <hi>fancy</hi> for <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> but will not have him, this pleases him, but that likes him not, and so he dodges endlesly, and parles with him through the window, but bolts the door, and keeps him out for ever. O that ever an holy, just, and offended <hi>God,</hi> should follow such miserable sinners with a

bleeding <hi>Christ</hi> in his arms and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver such wretches should put a refusal upon him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There must be a <hi>total Resignation of the heart unto the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> wherein you do cordially, deliberately, and freely give up your souls and bodies to him and to his service; which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ingageing the heart to approach to the Lord, Jer.</hi> 30. 21. <hi>Who is this that inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his heart to approach unto me, saith the Lord?</hi> And thereupon that happy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is drawn in the next verse; <hi>ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</hi> Who is this, saith God?

when you were children little, and your not revoking it, doth assert it; but now we come for your hearts thereunto. Where's the Mind, the Conscience, the Will?

You are the Lords by your <hi>Christian</hi> names already, O when will you be his by your <hi>surname</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>This is the Gospels great design, this is our errand here, we come for you and are loth to go without you.

storm is preparing. The Ordinance of God replanted again, and now if it hit right, and a breach be made upon the will, then <hi>Christ</hi> is victor, the City is won, and the sinner yields.

                  <p n="1">1. An Upright heart is <hi>Single without Division.</hi> Unto an hypocrite, there be <hi>Gods many, and Lords many,</hi> and he must have a heart for each: but to the upright there is but <hi>one God the Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> and one heart will serve them both. He that fixes his heart upon the Creatures, for every Creature he must have an heart, and the <hi>dividing</hi> of his heart <hi>destroyes</hi> him, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 2. worldly profits knock at door, he must have an heart for them; carnal pleasures present themselves, he must have an heart for them also; sinful preferments appear, they must have an heart too; <hi>Necessariorum numerus parvus, opinionum nullus.</hi> Of <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100513:17"/>
objects, the number is <hi>few,</hi> of <hi>needless</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, the number is <hi>endless:</hi> The upright man hath made choice of God and hath enough.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>single Christ</hi> is enough for a <hi>single heart;</hi> hence holy <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 86. 11. <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite my heart to fear thy Name,</hi> Let me have but one heart and mind, and let that be thine. As there are thousands of <hi>Beams</hi> and <hi>Rayes,</hi> yet they all meet and center in the <hi>Sun;</hi> so an upright man, though he hath a thousand thoughts, yet they all (by his good will) meet in <hi>God. Subordinate ends,</hi> he hath many, to procure a livelihood, to preserve his credit, to provide for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but <hi>Supreme</hi> end he hath none, but <hi>God</hi> alone. Hence, that <hi>Steadiness</hi> in his Resolutions, that <hi>Undistractedness</hi> in his holy duties, that <hi>Consistency</hi> in his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that <hi>Evenness</hi> in the frame of his Heart, which miserable hypocrites cannot attain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An Upright Heart is <hi>Sound without Rottenness,</hi> Psal. 119. 80. <hi>Let my heart be sound in thy statutes, that I may not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> The <hi>more</hi> sincerity the <hi>less</hi> shame. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity is the great author of confidence. Every frost shakes an unsound body, and every tryal shakes an unsound soul. An upright man hath not alwayes so <hi>pure</hi> a colour as an hypocrite may have, but his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100513:18"/>
colour is <hi>natural,</hi> it is his own, it is not painted, his constitution is firm. The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites beauty is borrowed, the fire of tryal will melt it off.</p>
                  <p>An Upright man hath his infirmities, his diseases, but his new nature works them out, for he is sound within. A lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie overspreads the hypocrite, but he hides it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 2. <hi>He flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.</hi> He endeavours to hide himself from <hi>God,</hi> more from men, most from himself; he would fain be in with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self howsoever, and this trade he drives, <hi>till his iniquity be found to be hateful.</hi> But now an Upright man, he is alwayes sifting and trying himself; am I sound? am I right? are my services rightly done? are my <hi>infirmities</hi> consistent with <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity?</hi> and the like. An upright Saint is like an <hi>apple</hi> with <hi>rotten specks,</hi> but an hypocrite is like the <hi>apple</hi> with a <hi>rotten core.</hi> The sincere Christian hath here a speck of passion, and there of worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and there of pride; but cut him up, anatomize him, he is sound at heart, there <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> live and reign. Now an hypocrite is like an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is smooth and lovely on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, but rotten within: His words exact,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100513:18"/>
his duties devout, his life blameless, but look within, and his heart is the sty of sin, the den of Satan.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. An Upright heart is <hi>Pure without Mixture.</hi> Not absolutely pure, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is reserv'd for heaven, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that pollution and base mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that constitutes an hypocrite. Though his hand cannot do all that <hi>God</hi> bids, yet his <hi>heart</hi> is sincere in all he doth. His soul is bent for perfect purity, and so he hath his name from that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart.</hi> In his words he sometimes fails, and so in his thoughts and deeds; but open his heart and there is a love, a desire, a design and an indeavour after real and absolute puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Not <hi>legally</hi> pure, that is, free from all sin; but <hi>Evangelically</hi> pure, free from the <hi>reign</hi> of all sin, especially of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, which is so flatly contrary to the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> And in this sence the upright man is the <hi>Scripture Puritan,</hi> and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> further from hypocrisie than any other man. He is really glad that God is the searcher of hearts, for then he knows, that he will finde his name and nature in his own.</p>
                  <p>And yet, the most upright man in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100513:19"/>
world hath some hypocrisie in him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 9. <hi>Who can say I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</hi> but this he detects, resists, and hates, and so it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>denominate</hi> him an hypocrite in this world, nor <hi>damn</hi> him for one in another. His <hi>ends</hi> are generally purely at the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, his <hi>frame</hi> of <hi>heart</hi> and thoughts pure, and generally better than his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side; the farther you trace him the better he is. Pure from dishonesty in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, purer yet in his family from all appearance of evil, purer still in his closet, and purest in his heart: though there be sin there, yet there is also there an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy against it, that it mingles not with it.</p>
                  <p>The hypocrite <hi>chooses</hi> sin, the upright man would have no sin if he could <hi>choose.</hi> The <hi>Traveller</hi> (its true) meets with dirt in his way, but he keeps it off as well as he can, mingles not with it, and if he be soil'd, he rubs it off as soon as may be: but the <hi>swine</hi> delights in it, cannot be well without it. 'Tis just so between the upright man and the hypocrite. The most upright Saint on earth, is bemir'd with sin sometimes, but he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign it in the morning, nor sleeps he with it at night; but an hypocrite he designs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100513:19"/>
it, he delights in it, he is never so well contented as in sin. In a word, the hypocrite may <hi>avoid</hi> sin, but no man can <hi>abhor</hi> sin save the upright man.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. An Upright man is <hi>Perfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire without Reservation, Psal.</hi> 37. 37. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> you may see them both at once. His heart is intirely devoted to the will and wayes of God. The hypocrite he hath ever some exceptions and reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Such a <hi>sin</hi> I must not leave, such a <hi>grace</hi> I cannot love, such a <hi>duty</hi> I will not practise; thus far I will yeild but no farther, thus far I will go, it is consistent with my carnal ends, but all the world shall not perswade me farther. The <hi>Judgement</hi> of the hypocrite will drive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his <hi>Will,</hi> his <hi>Conscience</hi> beyond his <hi>Affections,</hi> he is not intire, his heart is parted, and so he is off and on. The Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man hath but one <hi>Happiness,</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>t is the injoyment of God; but one <hi>Rule,</hi> and that is his holy Will; but one <hi>Work,</hi> and that is to please his Maker; and thereupon he is intire and certain in his choice, in his desires, in his wayes, and contrivances. And though there may be some demurs in his <hi>prosecution</hi> of his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100513:20"/>
main business, yet there is no hesitancy and wavering between two <hi>objects,</hi> for he is intirely fixt and resolv'd therein, and so may be said to be perfect and intire, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing.</p>
                  <p>There is in every hypocrite some one <hi>Fort,</hi> or strong hold, that hath never yielded to the soveraignty and empire of Gods will: Some lust castles it self in the will, but where integrity enters, it brings <hi>every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.</hi> Lord, saith he, I am wholly thine, do what thou wilt with me, say what thou wilt to me, write what thou wilt upon me, <hi>Other Lords have had domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over me, but by thee onely will I make mention of thy name, Isa.</hi> 26. 13. here is the upright man.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. An Upright heart is <hi>Plain without Guile, Psal.</hi> 32. 2. <hi>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no Guile.</hi> Here is a blessed word indeed. Alas! we have great and many iniquities, were it not happy for us to be as if we had never sinned? why; <hi>non-imputation</hi> will be as well for us, as if there had been <hi>no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression;</hi> sins <hi>remitted</hi> are as if they had not been <hi>committed:</hi> The debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100513:20"/>
crost as good as if never entred. But who is this blessed man? <hi>In whose spirit there is no Guile,</hi> that is, 1. no <hi>fundamental</hi> guile; that hath not deceitfully covenanted with his God. 2. That hath no <hi>approved</hi> guile, to approve and yeild to any way of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; that doth not juggle with God or men, or with his own Conscience; that hides not his Idols under him, when God is searching his Tent, but as it follows there <hi>verse</hi> 5. acknowledges, and hates, and leaves his sin.</p>
                  <p>When the Upright man confesseth his sin, his heart akes and he is deeply trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it, he dissembles not: the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite proclaims <hi>open</hi> war, but maintains <hi>secret</hi> intelligence with his lusts. When the upright man prayes for any grace, he earnestly desires it, and he takes pains to compass it too, for he is in good earnest, and dissembles not: The hypocrite is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid in his prayers to be taken at his word, for he loves not the image, or grace of God at all. And so in every thing else, there is nothing but guile in him, he that will dissemble with <hi>God,</hi> will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble with any <hi>man</hi> in the world. See the wide difference between <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David. Saul</hi> is charged with a fault, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 14. lie denies it, the charge
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100513:21"/>
is renewed, <hi>verse</hi> 17. still he minces the matter, looks for fig-leaves to cover all. But plain-hearted <hi>David</hi> is another man; he is charg'd and he yields, one prick opens a vein of sorrow in his heart, he tells all, he makes a <hi>Psalm</hi> of it, and therein concludes this, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 6. <hi>Behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts.</hi> The plain-hearted man, sayes <hi>God,</hi> is for me, <hi>with the upright man I will shew my self upright.</hi>

O Sirs, what change hath there been on your spirits? what fear, and love, and sanctity is there in your hearts? look to this, or else you will break like bubbles. And then it follows, <hi>Whose praise is not of men, but of God,</hi> that is, whose aim, and whose honour it is not to be prais'd of men, but of <hi>God.</hi> The Upright man trades in <hi>Invisible</hi> things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The upright man studies to obtain invisible Graces. Psal.</hi> 45. 13. <hi>The Kings daughter is glorious within.</hi> In the <hi>hidden man of the heart,</hi> is the beauty of an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man. To be drest with the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>meek</hi> and quiet spirit, with a compos'd and serious spirit, with a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

and believing spirit. Ah beloved! how like are many of us to the <hi>River</hi> which <hi>Athenaeus</hi> mentions, whose upper waters are sweet, but brackish at the bottome; like fine clothes, silk without and canvas within: a smooth carriage, and an unpolish'd uncircumcis'd heart; the upright man would not be so. He looks not at things that are seen, but at things that are not seen. Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are the study and ambition of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Christian. The hypocrite may be forward for unsanctified <hi>Gifts.

2. <hi>The Upright man studies to perform in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Duties.</hi> There is an <hi>Outside</hi> and an <hi>Inside</hi> in Religion. The <hi>bended knee,</hi> that's the outside in prayer; <hi>The broken heart</hi> that's the inside: To <hi>hear Gods word,</hi> that's the outside; To <hi>meditate of it,</hi> that's the inside: To <hi>read</hi> each day two or three Chapters in the Bible, that's the outside; to <hi>feel</hi> the efficacy of it that's the inside; To <hi>reprove another</hi> that's the outside; but to <hi>watch</hi> over thine own heart, that's the inside: To draw out thy <hi>purse</hi> to a poor man, that's the outside; but to draw out thy <hi>heart</hi> in pitty to him, that's the inside of the duty. The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may, and oft doth excell in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the upright man is diligent and careful in the latter. He can pray in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and is no stranger to Self examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Meditation, Ejaculations, and Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies these <hi>retired acts</hi> of Religion, nay in these is his Excellency; he is a Saint in secret, the holiest alone, a busie man in an Ordinance. He wrestles as well as makes supplication, and <hi>sweats</hi> at that which others <hi>sleep</hi> at. The <hi>Pharisee, Luke</hi> 18. had the larger Oration, but the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> had the more penitent heart. The <hi>Scribe</hi> might have more dealing with the <hi>Law,</hi> but the Apostle <hi>delighted in it, in

As you know its the Tradesmans custom, all his wares shall be vendible and good, but behind in his Warehouse and Closet are his choicest things: Even so the upright man, he will be exact and diligent in all his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and visible duties, but his Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces they are within. He performs invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Duties.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The upright man studies to conquer invisible Sins:</hi> Those that he might go to his grave with, and no body aware of them; yet these he labours to rout Horse and Man. An hypocrite on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>prunes</hi> off the sins that will <hi>shame</hi> him, but <hi>nourishes</hi> the sins that will <hi>damn</hi> him. Open drunkenness, uncleanness, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, profaneness, these an hypocrite disdains; but mean while he lives perhaps in some of these secretly, or at least he takes no pains to subdue proud, wanton, envious, and other inward motions that do as much war against the soul, as other sins.

It was <hi>Tertullians</hi> cry, <hi>Ad leonem extra, potius quam ad leonem intra.</hi> The upright man knows, that as the filthiness of the <hi>flesh</hi> will may make him a <hi>beast,</hi> so the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness of the <hi>spirit</hi> will make him a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> and therefore he assaults his invisible sins.</p>

And as no sin is so <hi>dear</hi> as to ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with him, so no sin so <hi>small,</hi> but his stomack rises at it; and hence it is that the upright man hath not so wide a swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as other men of large and strained Consciences, and so meets with many an hypocrite in his dish; because he would hate the <hi>Appearance of Evil,</hi> as he hates the <hi>Appearance of the Devil,</hi> but still he hates his <hi>own</hi> sins more than others, and those as much as any, which no body sees but himself.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He loves All his Duty,</hi> he is neither <hi>afraid</hi> to know, nor <hi>ashamed</hi> to own all his duty: By this the Lord measures In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>And if thou wilt walk before me, as</hi> David <hi>thy Father walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee.</hi> Here's the just Standard of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For can the holy, wise, and just <hi>God</hi> appoint any thing unreasonable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable for his own creature, his dear child to perform? Alas! <hi>All his wayes are mercy and truth,</hi> and all his Laws tend to his servants good. What harsher Law in appearance than that <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 29. <hi>If thy right eye, if thy right hand offend thee, pluck it out, cut it off.</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:100513:25"/>
And yet if any of you had an <hi>eye</hi> that were alwayes leading you into pits and precipices, to drown and destroy you, would not you have it out? if you had an <hi>hand</hi> that were alwayes running into the fire, and you could not keep it out, would not you hack it off? why, it is no other eye or hand, the Gospel hath a quarrel with, but those that would lead into ruine, run you into hell: and how reasonable and necessary is it to be rid of such? The upright man is convinced of this, and so he knows nothing in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but what he likes. Some things may grate upon his carnal appetite, yet he loves them dearly. Now an hypocrite is quite another man, like a sorry <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> in a hard Chapter, he skips over the <hi>hard</hi> words, and makes nothing of them; whereas the well taught Scholar, will spell, and labour at them, and rather ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a whipping, than skip over them: So is it between the hypocrite and the upright in the duties of Christianity. An hypocrite runs smoothly on in divers Religious exercises, till he meets with some <hi>costly, hard,</hi> or <hi>hiddén</hi> duties, and there he stands stock-still; he considers that there is no credit or profit, but only pains or peril, to be got, and presently
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100513:25"/>
skips over these hard words, and neither loves nor obeyes: whereas the upright man finding his duty, bides by it, dwells upon it, and will deny <hi>himself</hi> ere he will deny his <hi>duty.</hi> If <hi>God</hi> will have me love mine enemies, I will love them: <note place="margin">V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

An hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may have some <hi>fits</hi> of Piety, but they are adventitious, they flow from some outward cause, and accordingly they last but for a while; and when that cause ceaseth, (suppose some sharp judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fear'd or felt, some qualm of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or shallow Sermon-sickness) then a cold fit follows, as bad or worse than before: alas, it is praeternatural, it was no habit, but the upright man hath a constant heat, <hi>he fears alwayes</hi> and maintains <hi>constant</hi> duty, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep <hi>equal</hi> heat therein.</p>
                  <p>And here's the difference between the <hi>inconstancy</hi> of an upright man and of an hypocrite; the <hi>inconstancy</hi> of the hypocrite is in the <hi>Substance</hi> of the duty it self; one while he prayes, another while he

restrains prayer; one while he is strict and cautious; and shortly loose and careless; whereas the upright man keeps on in the course of his duty, though he cannot do it alwayes alike; he prayes, and would not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The hypocrite makes a <hi>Cloak</hi> of his Religion, which he puts on, and off, as it serves his purpose; the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man wears it as his every day cloathes, and puts not off his integrity, till he dye. There may be some <hi>Parentheses</hi> in his holy course, wherein vanity and sin may be written, (too many of these God knows in the best mans heart and life) but still the <hi>sentence</hi> runs current; the sence and scope of his heart runs Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: whereas on the contrary, the full sence of an hypocrites heart is to please or promote himself; though there may be some parentheses of Religion, no part of the scope of his soul: you have their character, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 36, 37. <hi>Nevertheless they did statter him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues: for their heart was not right with him,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100513:27"/>
neither were they steadfast in his Covenant.</hi> No greater sign of a rotten heart, than a fundamental unstedfastness in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>God,</hi> when a man is rul'd by times and companies to shew good or evil, this mans heart is not right with <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its true, a tempest may bend the boughs of a living tree, or perhaps the tree it self, if the storm be great; but they return to their straightness, they come to themselves, but the rotten sticks and branches are broken and overturn'd; just so, some strong temptation may drive an upright man out of his honest way, but he soon returns, and by <hi>mending</hi> his pace, makes <hi>amends</hi> for his stumbling. Three <hi>Scriptures</hi> give the upright man his <hi>character,</hi> concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Proverbs</hi> 28. 14. <hi>Happy is the man that feareth alwayes.</hi> To be <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes afraid</hi> looks like a miserable life among men; but to have a <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king eye,</hi> and <hi>careful heart</hi> for fear of sin, is no more a misery, than to walk, or ride, with a vigilant regard to prevent a fall. This fear is not troublesome or vexatious at all, he's an happy man that uses it, and no wise man will count the other hapy for going, running, riding without fear

or wit in danger every moment to break his bones. Again, <hi>Hos.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Keep mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and judgement, and wait upon thy God continually.</hi> The whole life of a sincere Saint is a continual waiting upon God; whatever his work be, whoever his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, wherever he goes, whenever he eats or drinks, yet in all these he waites upon his God, and serves the will of his heavenly Father. And agreeable to this is the other passage, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 17. <hi>Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long.</hi> Most emphaticall both for the <hi>duty</hi> commanded, and for the <hi>term</hi> of the duty, both most apposite to set out an upright man.

And then, this <hi>all the day long,</hi> not only a fit of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at thy prayers in the morning and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother at night, but work and walk, eat and drink in it all the day long, yea all thy life long, which is but a long day.</p>
                  <p>The Religion of an hypocrite is like a <hi>tireing horse,</hi> which may go apace in the morning, and shew much mettal for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100513:28"/>
a while; but the upright man, though more <hi>soberly,</hi> yet goes more <hi>constantly;</hi> and in this sense that is most true, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>He that walks uprightly, walks surely.</hi> You shall finde this man with savoury thoughts in his heart <hi>at noon,</hi> with Ejaculations at his work, and there is a coherence between his duties and his life. In a word, and so I'le end this point, the Upright man hath <hi>four Walks</hi> towards God, which will set him forth to the life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The upright man walks <hi>Before God. Gen.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Walk before me, and be thou perfect,</hi> or upright. And that is whereby the upright man <hi>habitually</hi> alwayes, and <hi>actually</hi> as much as in him lies, <hi>Sets the Lord alwayes before him;</hi> and still thinks, and speaks, and acts, as if he lookt on, weighing not only the <hi>matter</hi> but the <hi>manner,</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> of his wayes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting himself still to his God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>As of sincerity as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</hi> Happy for ever that Minister, that can call God to record on his soul, that as no <hi>errours</hi> corrupt his Doctrine, so no <hi>base ends</hi> corrupt his heart; but that he preaches
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100513:29"/>
                     <hi>Christs</hi> will sincerely, as if the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self look'd on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The upright man walks with <hi>God.</hi> So <hi>Enoch, Gen.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>And Enoch walked with God.</hi> That is, so to live, as if the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God</hi> were in person walking with <hi>you on Earth,</hi> or as if you were walking with <hi>him in Heaven.</hi> If God should visibly walk with you on earth, as he was a while with <hi>Abraham,</hi> O with what humility, sanctity, watchfulness, love, and fear would you continually live? what an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and serious regard would you have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him? much more if you were to walk a while with him in Heaven: what a frame would you there be in? why this sence hath walking with God, which no man hath skill in save the upright man; he is constantly religious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The upright man walks <hi>After God, Deut.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and obey his voice.</hi> Where he can see his God walk before him, like a dutiful child, he will, though not <hi>aequis passibus,</hi> walk after him as fast as he can. This was the praise of <hi>Caleb, Numbers</hi> 14. 24. <hi>that he followed God fully.</hi> That
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100513:29"/>
word <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> makes every <hi>Thou shalt</hi> of his, and every <hi>Thou shalt not,</hi> acceptable to an upright man. Come sayes God, here's a work I must have done, here thou must give, here forgive, here's a Saint must be loved for his own sake, here's a sinner must thou love and pity for my sake. Ready (Lord) saith the upright man, by thy Grace it shall be done, this is to follow God fully, this is to walk after God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The upright man walks <hi>Like God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 6. <hi>He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.</hi> Now, how did our <hi>Lord, Jesus</hi> walk when he was upon earth? why, a mirrour and pattern of all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, justice, charity, meekness, self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. Think often when you are eating, how did Christ order his meales? do I give thanks like him? discourse at table like him? think often when you are hearing and praying; did he hear and pray in such a manner as I do? How would he carry himself among such neighbours? how would he instruct and guide this Family? how would he bear and improve these reproaches, wants and troubles? how would he appear for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100513:30"/>
God is in such company? how would he sanctisie the Sabbath? how would he deal with such parents, such children, if he were in my place? how quiet, when provok'd? how chast, when tempted? how just and true in his dealings? how cautious of others names, and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his own estate? Put him often into your case and remember, if ever you will <hi>live with him,</hi> you must <hi>live like him.</hi> And by this fruitful and good life you shew, <hi>that God is upright, and that there is no unrighteousness in him, Psal.</hi> 29. <hi>last:</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This uprightness of life cannot be without that uprightness of heart.</hi> It loseth in truth its name and nature for want of a <hi>principle.</hi> For that which is truly good must have all its causes, which this wants. It is a common <hi>experiment,</hi> that water
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100513:32"/>
will not ascend above its spring without a violence upon nature; and it is as true, that no mans actions can carry a <hi>higher level</hi> than the <hi>fountain</hi> of them; so that to make the life upright, you must begin at the heart, and <hi>first make the Tree good and then the fruit will be good also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Uprightness of Life is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act agreement of a mans words and actions with an honest and upright heart.</hi> When the life is the <hi>picture</hi> of the heart, and there is a blessed harmony between the frame of the soul within, and the course of the life without; when a man doth not frame his life, to gratifie the company, or serve the times he lives in, or the corrupt humours of other, or any carnal ends of his own, but his heart is sincere, and so are his words and deeds. Not that we expect an absolute exactness here; the uprightest man on earth hath enough to humble and afflict him; but for the main, there is no known ordinary and willing swerving of his course from his frame within, or of that from the holy will of God. And herein also we shall consider, 1. Its Essence. 2. Its Object.</p>

Prov.</hi> 28. 6. 18. <hi>Better is the poor that walketh in his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, than he that is perverse in his wayes, though rich.</hi> The word for <hi>wayes</hi> in both places is <hi>Dual,</hi> and intimates <hi>two wayes.</hi> An hypocrite is a man with two wayes. The one he goes in, the other he seems to go in. The poor upright man hath but one way, and that's better than them both. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our Conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our Conversation in the world.</hi> When this Apostle was traduc'd by men, yet this afforded him not only <hi>content,</hi> but <hi>joy,</hi> to wit, <hi>the testimony of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> An hypocrite may have <hi>quiet</hi> in his Conscience, but an upright man hath a <hi>Testimony</hi> in his Conscience: He carries every where <hi>Letters Testimonial</hi> in his bosom. And why all this joy? that we have had our conversation <hi>in simplicity.</hi> As our <hi>ends</hi> have been <hi>single</hi> in preaching
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100513:33"/>
the Gospel, so our Lives have not been <hi>double:</hi> The drift of our preaching and lives hath been the same: Happy that Preacher that can here subscribe his hand.</p>
                  <p>This Simplicity of an upright man, makes him sometimes the <hi>Subject</hi> of loss, and sometimes the <hi>Object</hi> of scorn. <hi>Job</hi> 12. 4. <hi>The just upright man is laughed to scorn,</hi> and many a <hi>Simpleton</hi> he is called; yet he goes on and carries it in the end. His great consideration is, <hi>What is my duty,</hi> according to that <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 25. <hi>Let thine eyes look straight on, and let thine eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids look straight before thee.</hi> That is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out squinting at events, or how it will please, or whom it will lose, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to live and dye in his duty. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake me not, as if <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> could not dwell together; certainly they may and ought. His simplicity only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the <hi>subtlety of the Fox,</hi> which stands in being cunning <hi>to do</hi> mischief, not the <hi>wisdom of the Serpent,</hi> which stands in carefully <hi>avoiding it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Uprightness of Life stands in Purity. Prov.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>The high-way of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, is to depart from evil.</hi> His usual <hi>road</hi> is as far from the <hi>broad way</hi> as ever
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100513:34"/>
he can: and his care herein sometimes carries him rather too far, upon which account his Conscience breeds more scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples then other mens, that can swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any thing that comes to hand: but his integrity in other things apologizeth for him to all wise men, and at least brings him off with peace and comfort. And this very thing hath brought upon very many of these upright men, the badge of <hi>a Puritan,</hi> which is by too many appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to subvert sincere holiness, and to cast an <hi>odium</hi> on downright Christianity, and the practise of that we all profess. Sure I am, the <hi>Scripture</hi> opens Heavens gates to none, but those whose lives are pure and holy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 4. <hi>Who shall ascend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hill of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart, &amp;c.</hi> Hence, the upright man dare not mingle with those vain fooleries, vitious excesses or suspicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations that men of devasted Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are drowned in; nor can all the good nature that's in him, nor importunity of neighbours, or kindred, draw him to such company, or courses that would sting his Conscience when he should sleep; except God leaves him to himself sometimes, to try and humble him.</p>

3. <hi>This Uprightness of Life, shines in the perfection of his Life.</hi> Understand a <hi>Perfection of parts;</hi> each part of him is sincere. See that, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 14. <hi>Fearfulness hath surprized the hypocrite: who among us shall dwell with devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings?</hi> that is, stand before the holy just and upright <hi>Jehovah:</hi> who can approach him, when he executes <hi>judgements</hi> here, or passes final <hi>sentance</hi> hereafter? when all hypocrites shall be in a fright, when their cobweb-coverings shall fall off, and they must stand naked, (like so many <hi>cheats</hi> on a pillory) before God, Angels and Men: who then shall stand with comfort and confidence? Mark <hi>verse</hi> 15. <hi>He that walketh righteously,</hi> (his feet walk uprightly) <hi>and speaketh uprightly,</hi> (carries an upright tongue) <hi>despises the gain of oppressions</hi> (keeps an upright <hi>heart</hi> in him) <hi>that shakes his hands from hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bribes,</hi> (both his hands are upright too) <hi>that stops his ears from hearing of bloud)</hi> his ears are tipt with integrity) <hi>and shuts his eyes from seeing evil,</hi> (he looks with an upright <hi>eye.)</hi> Thus you see he is upright all over. Let him deal with friends or enemies, with godly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, with wise or foolish, you may
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100513:35"/>
trust him, for he stands in awe of his God, and of Himself. He hath not <hi>one</hi> heart for his Religion, and <hi>another</hi> for his bargains and calling: but studies the <hi>Scripture</hi> and drives his life into it, as near as he can. This is to obey Gods voice <hi>Indeed.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exo. 19. 5.</note> And from this perfection flows an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent evenness of conversation, so that Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> motto well becomes his life, <hi>Semper eadem,</hi> Still the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>This Uprightness shines in the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his life.</hi> There are few <hi>Criticisms</hi> in the life of an upright man. He's plain and that's his prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 11. <hi>Lord lead me in a plain path,</hi> that's my desire. He hath no quirks, or tricks of legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. If he cannot <hi>stand</hi> by plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he'l <hi>fall</hi> by it: when he trades and bargains, though he be discreet and careful, yet he is plain: When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves a fault or advises, he is sober, wise and affectionate, but still he is plain: his discourse and Sermons though elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet still plain. Among his very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies though he be cautious and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet there he is plain also: <hi>Lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies.</hi> He is like <hi>Him,</hi> that wisht his body were made of <hi>Chrystal,</hi> that his sincerity might
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100513:35"/>
be transparent. Such was that <hi>Martyr,</hi> whom the persecutors requir'd to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his companion, whom they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting, promising to him his own life for the discovery, and so either by <hi>denying</hi> his knowledge of the place of his friends abode, or by <hi>betraying</hi> it, he might have saved his own life; after a little pause, breaks out into these words, <hi>Mentiri non possum, prodere nolo,</hi> I cannot lye, and I will not betray him; and so laid down his life, to save one of the Brethren. Here was an upright man, that would not tell a lye to save a life, that had rather <hi>dye</hi> than <hi>lye.</hi> He will be plain, though he suffer for it. But how generally is this plainness banisht out of the world? eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man almost walking in a vain shew, disguizing their intentions, looking one way and rowing another, that the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks</hi> are not more distant, than most mens intentions are from their Actions. And so I come to the <hi>Object</hi> about which this uprightness of life is conversant.</p>

                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>He walketh uprightly and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the truth in his heart.</hi> His heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting a good matter, and thereof his tongue is the pen of a ready writer. And indeed that is the genuine use of words, to be the interpreters of the heart and mind. And therefore that is a black brand set on our <hi>Neighbour Nation,</hi> that they use not to sing as they prick, nor to read as they write, nor to speak as they think; which if true, would render their society more intollerable, than the brutes themselves. The upright man perhaps cannot speak <hi>elegantly</hi> but he can speak <hi>truly;</hi> he cannot <hi>flourish</hi> his letters, but he can write a plain <hi>Secretary;</hi> and his words you may believe, more than others oathes. If you would see a fuller view of him as who would not delight in such
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100513:36"/>
asight? these <hi>Foyles</hi> will set him off.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>An upright man is a greater hater of Flattery.</hi> He cannot abide to be either <hi>active</hi> or <hi>passive</hi> in it. He rather desires to know the worst of himself than to hear the best; for that <hi>open rebuke is better than secret love,</hi> and he knows that unjust <hi>praises</hi> are more dangerous than unjust <hi>slanders.</hi> And then for others, if he might get all the Town by it, he cannot give <hi>flattering Titles to any man,</hi> or extol any thing in any body, for his own ends. How fair an opportunity had <hi>Micaiah,</hi> to have gain'd his liberty, and the favour of two potent <hi>Kings,</hi> if he could have sooth'd <hi>Ahab</hi> in his vanity? but prison or no prison, he could not flatter. How easily might <hi>Paul</hi> have come off before <hi>Foelix,</hi> with a smooth oration, if he had learn'd to have courted him and his <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silla</hi> with a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> of praise? but he rather chose to speak of <hi>Temperance, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Judgment to come;</hi> so to save them, rather than sooth them in their sins.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, he loses many an one by this plain dealing, whom he might have kept by his flattery; but these are better lost,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100513:37"/>
than kept, <hi>Job</hi> 32. 22. <hi>I know not, saith Elihu, to give flattering titles, in so doing my Maker would soon take me away.</hi> These acts are below a <hi>man,</hi> much more below a <hi>Christian;</hi> and generally there is <hi>unsoundness</hi> in the heart, or <hi>baseness</hi> in the ends of those that use them. Its true, a man may without any breach in his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness, give another his due praises, when there is just occasion so to do; but to exceed bounds herein, and that out of any base design, of procuring the like again, or for worldly profit, is very far from true sincerity. A <hi>false</hi> heart and a <hi>flattering</hi> tongue usually go together. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 23. <hi>Burning lips and a wicked heart, are like a potsheard cover'd over with silver dross.</hi> No man so likely to have a tongue, and a tongue, as he that hath an heart, and an heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>An upright man is a great hater of Lying.</hi> A sin that is directly contrary to the nature of <hi>sincerity.</hi> I may not inlarge upon the kinds or aggravations of this sin: whole Sermons, yea Volumes are little enough to overthrow it, it is so <hi>common</hi> and so <hi>dangerous.</hi> If a lye will save their credit, few will lose it; if a lye will gain any thing, few will sit down
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100513:37"/>
by loss; if a lye will shelter one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers anger, thousands will venture the displeasure of the <hi>Eternal God,</hi> before that of a silly worm; and chuse to have their <hi>Head</hi> broken, that their <hi>Helmet</hi> may be spared. O the woful havock of mens Consciences by this sin! now an upright man abhors a lye, he knows that the <hi>God of truth</hi> desires <hi>truth in the inward parts,</hi> and hath in him a particular Antipathy to this sin. Dress it in what clothes you will, call it a <hi>jesting</hi> lye, an <hi>officious</hi> lye, what lye you will; he likes it not, his heart rises against it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 163. <hi>I hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor lying,</hi> two words for failing, to shew his great hatred of this sin. Be it with him or against him, the upright man will speak the truth. Whereas an hypocrite as he is nothing else but a <hi>Lye,</hi> so he can swallow them as fast as occasion serves. Poor man! thou wouldst not speak it, if the man that stands by thee saw into thy heart, and how darest thou speak it, when the holy and true God sees into thy heart, and can choke thee with thy dissembling words?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>An upright man hates all Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and mental Reservations.</hi> That is,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100513:38"/>
he speaks his words in a sense that he would have them construed in, and keeps no part of a sentence in his mind, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what he pronounced with his mouth, especially with an intent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure another. Such was that jugling trick we read of <hi>Cydias,</hi> that being betrusted by <hi>Archetimus</hi> with a sum of mony, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards flatly denies it. There being no witness to prove the truth, <hi>Cydias</hi> is summon'd to his Oath before the Altar, and a great Assembly; he quilts the mony in his staffe, and going to take his Oath, gives <hi>Archetimus</hi> his staffe to hold the while, and then confidently swears he had given him back his money: But this deceit lasted not long, for <hi>Archeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> seeing his perjury, in a rage throws down his staffe; it breaks and the fraud is found. And such is the usual issue of such Equivocations. The upright man hath no skill at this; he knows if the plain truth will not bear him out, these cunning shifts never can. My brethren, it beseems not the plain-heartedness of a Christian to speak like the <hi>Delphian Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> to be understood in two contrary sentences.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> themselves would not so much as hear those <hi>Embassadors</hi> that were
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100513:38"/>
painted, saying, how shall we believe them whose very face and looks do lie? An upright man if he do not speak <hi>all his heart,</hi> yet will speak <hi>according to his heart.</hi> He loves not to walk with a dark lanthorn, much less to deal with false lights but plain genuine are his expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without, and fair and candid is his heart within.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>An upright man greatly hates pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise breaking,</hi> whether it be to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>men.</hi> A great note of integrity in <hi>Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah, Judg.</hi> 11. 35. <hi>I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot go back</hi> It was a rash vow, but conscience of the obligation brake all other considerations, which in his case might have been many, and he chose rather to have his very <hi>heart</hi> broken, than his <hi>word.</hi> It is enough for a subtile <hi>Polititian,</hi> to have <hi>Distinctions</hi> and <hi>Evasions</hi> ready to help himself out of the straightest bonds, the upright man delights not <hi>after vows to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well advised every man should be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he binds himself in any thing to the <hi>Lord,</hi> but when his soul is fast, let him be very well advised, how he releases
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100513:39"/>
himself: for there is nothing doth more prostitute the Conscience, and utterly undo men, than being fast and loose with God in sacred vows and promises.</p>
                  <p>The same abhorrence hath the upright man of breaking his word <hi>with men;</hi> and thereupon his <hi>word</hi> is as good as his <hi>bond.</hi> If he bids so much for a commodity, he seldom shrinks but gives it; if he bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his prejudice, yet <hi>he changes not:</hi> the scarceness of the thing, the rising of the market cannot prevail with him, to rescind his punctual agreement; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he gain or lose, he will not lose his honesty nor his reputation. O what a <hi>Golden age</hi> would return unto us, if men were but <hi>plain</hi> in their dealing, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in their performances? and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy is it for a man, a Christian man to be so vile, that no body can believe him, nor trust him. How will that <hi>Atilius Regulus</hi> rise up in judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn this generation, who being priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and assur'd of his own death, if he fail'd in his negotiation; was set at liberty to effect a peace at <hi>Rome,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the single security of his own word, to return if he fail'd to procure it: but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100513:39"/>
such was his <hi>publick spirit,</hi> that he effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually disswaded his <hi>Countrymen</hi> from a peace, assuring them of a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; and such the <hi>integrity of his spirit,</hi> that after this, he fairly return'd and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of a cruel death, rather than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe his word. Ten thousand <hi>pities</hi> such heroick acts should be lost, for want of a right principle; and ten thousand <hi>shames,</hi> that Christians should break their word <hi>for a groat,</hi> while Pagans will not do it <hi>for their lives.</hi>

                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:100513:40"/>
by <hi>favour,</hi> or <hi>driven</hi> by fear besides his duty.

The upright <hi>Physician</hi> will rather go with an empty purse, than torture either the body or purse of his Patient without cause.

                  <p>Thus uprightness like a silver thread is drawn through the whole course of the sincere Christian: and he that is upright, is upright <hi>every where:</hi> And that I may set out this holy course by its most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Opposites,</hi>

1. <hi>An upright man is a great enemy to Craftiness or Subtlety.</hi> Though he stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to be <hi>Wise,</hi> yet he delights not in Cunning.

But it cost him many a sweating day, and many a frosty night: <hi>Guile</hi> and <hi>guilt</hi> go hand in hand, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Thy mouth utters thy iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</hi> Carnal policy was never friend to inward piety; <note place="margin">Concilia callida pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But there is a culpable <hi>Temporizing</hi> when a man hath so master'd his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and reduced it to that ready <note place="margin">Like <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> who was nam'd <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripus</hi> for his ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

How far the blast of temptation may, for a time, bend or bow a sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, or how long, no man can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: the best are frail enough, and they who are most censorious of others warpings, would perhaps fall more foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they lived under their temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but this base obsequiousness is no part of the mans uprightness, when the snare is broken, the sincere man will come to himself, and there abide.</p>

that famous <hi>Roman,</hi> that one might perswade the <hi>Sun</hi> from its course, as soon as divert him from his upright and honest dealing. Such is our upright man in office, blind to faces, deaf to cries, and dead to threats and promises.</p>
                  <p>And then for <hi>Commutative</hi> justice and dealing between man and man, you have his character before; he indeavours to cleave an hair, and doth <hi>exercise himself to have alwayes a Conscience void of offence, towards all men, Acts</hi> 24. 16.

                  <p>And thus you see his Profession and his Practise are in the same tale. God helps him to spin an even thread throughout. He is the same in the <hi>camp</hi> below, for the main, as in the <hi>mount</hi> above, and there is a looking-glass in his words and actions, through which you may see his heart. Its true, this unbyassed and stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast course occasions him often much trouble in the world, and he goes for a singular, a precise, an obstinate man with them that know him not.

Uprightness is a character written out of mans sight and reading; why thus, where ever you find a mans words and wayes upright, you are bound to think his heart is upright also. This is the Law of <hi>Charity,</hi> this is the Law of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> But what will be the end of him?

               <p>THat with an upright man, God will shew himself upright, is evident, For</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is agreeable to his Nature, Psal.</hi> 25. 8. <hi>Good and upright is the Lord.</hi> He is an upright God, and therefore loves Uprightness. How can he chuse then but shew himself upright to an upright man? Simplicity is Gods first <hi>Attribute,</hi> and Simplicity is the upright mans chief <hi>Property;</hi> there must needs therefore be a singular kindness between these two.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100513:46"/>
was upright, and <hi>God</hi> though he was long, yet he was sure in rewarding him; So to <hi>Caleb,</hi> so to <hi>Job,</hi> so to <hi>David,</hi> to all: no man can come out, and charge <hi>God</hi> with neglect, or unfaithfulness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him herein.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is agreeable to his Honour and Interest.</hi> It is a Princes Honour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to stick to his faithful and upright servants, or else he will quickly have none such about him. He would rather lose a <hi>World</hi> than lose his <hi>Honour;</hi> and therefore in this <hi>Psalm</hi> he is brought in, overturning the earth rather than leave upright <hi>David</hi> to his Enemies. If fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and kindness will win him servants, Satan shall have but a few. He can boldly implead all the world, much more his people, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>O my people what have I done unto thee? testifie against me.</hi> He would scorn to deal by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as Satan doth, drive them into a snare, and there leave them; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise them a <hi>World,</hi> and pay them with an <hi>Hell.</hi>
               </p>

as you may see, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 34. <hi>For the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctifie themselves, than the Priests.</hi> Here were upright <hi>Levites,</hi> yet not sufficiently purified, but <hi>Hezekiah</hi> obtained for them a pardon of course, for they had done what they could, and the Lord had mercy on them.

Compare <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David, Saul</hi> had foolishly (at most covetously) spared <hi>Agag,</hi> and a prey, and he is cast off for it and loseth his kingdom. <hi>David</hi> defiles the Wife, and then kills the Husband, and he is spar'd: he is, its true, sorely beaten, but not turn'd out of doors. Again, take <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judas. Judas</hi> through covetousness <hi>betrays</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and <hi>Peter</hi> through fear <hi>denyes</hi> and <hi>forswears</hi> him. <hi>Judas</hi> is sent by the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows into Hell, and <hi>Peter</hi> is receiv'd into mercy. And why this different dealing?
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100513:48"/>
why, <hi>David</hi> was in the bent of his heart upright before God, and <hi>Saul</hi> in the bottom of his heart was for himself; <hi>Peter</hi> resolved to lose his life before he would forsake his Saviour, and <hi>Judas</hi> never fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him but for the bag. And therefore the Lord graciously pardons the unwilling infirmities of his people, for he sees the integrity of their hearts. As a faithful Husband is more satisfied with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed failings of his poor Wife, than with the studied observances of an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teress; so the Lord our God he can better connive at, and bear with the <hi>mourn'd</hi> for infirmities of his dear children, than with the <hi>fain'd</hi> compliance of rotten hypocrites.</p>

Directing him in his Doubts.</note> to the upright man, <hi>In directing him in his doubts, Prov.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>The integrity of the upright shall guide them.</hi> Many an upright man is under great doubts, and knows not what to believe or what to do. Arguments and pleas on both hands, <hi>Great men</hi> on one side, and <hi>Good men</hi> on another, (for seldom are they both on a side) likely reasons court his Assent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. The commands of <hi>men</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times countermanded by his <hi>Conscience,</hi> and he wants parts, learning, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>cleave an hair,</hi> and state the case exactly, either of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Fact.</hi> Now in this case, when he hath us'd the means of resolution, that he is capable of, <hi>the integrity of the upright shall guide him.</hi> His plain honest heart is neither suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of more evil to be in men, or things, then evidently appears; nor on the other side, doth he study extricating <hi>Salvo's,</hi> or subtle evasions to sleep with a whole skin, and salute the upper party: but according to his best knowledge,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100513:59"/>
he fixes his faith and orders his actions by the <hi>Rule of Gods Word,</hi> which he knows will best bear him out.</p>
                  <p>An upright man sometimes meets with <hi>Doubts in matters of Faith;</hi> but herein he stands fairest for that promise, which Christ hath made, <hi>to lead his into all truth.</hi> Though his integrity may not secure him from <hi>Error,</hi> that it will not; yet 'twill secure him from being an <hi>Heretick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath <hi>Doubts</hi> sometimes about things to <hi>be done;</hi> towards God in his Worship, towards men in his Life. In the former, he studies the will of God in his Word, knowing that nothing which is offered to him, will please him, unless directed by him.

                  </p>
                  <p>And lastly, he is perplexed with some <hi>Doubts</hi> about the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and the <hi>salvation of his Soul;</hi> but here also his Integrity so guides him, that he is far from presuming, though he be loth to despair, and the Lord gives him <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> from his <hi>Sincerity,</hi> though he want the joyes from <hi>Assurance.</hi> And is not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100513:59"/>
uprightness a choice Jewel to lay claim to this guidance? <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 8. <hi>Good and upright is the Lord, therefore will he teach sinners in the way.</hi> This conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a poor sinner in the way, flows from his <hi>Goodness and Uprightness,</hi> and therefore as long as there is a drop of goodness, or a dram of uprightness in God, the penitent sinner shall never lack a guide. And to this refers that promise, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 21. <hi>Of a voice behind you saying, this is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand or to the left;</hi> alluding (as some think) to a <hi>Schoolmaster</hi> promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Scholar over the shoulder, how he should pronounce his words, when he (poor child) is puzzled and knows not what to say: even so will <hi>God</hi> lead his upright ones in the way <hi>that he shall chuse,</hi> when they are in the dark; and you shall find that Scripture true, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 6. <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness keepeth him that is upright in the way: But wickedness overthroweth the sinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Resolve then in such cases, after you have us'd the means of illumination, as <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> in another, <hi>O Lord, I know not what to do, but mine eyes are unto thee.</hi> I perceive the blindness of <hi>my eyes,</hi> but

thou seest the uprightness of <hi>my heart,</hi> I would do thy will if I knew it; <hi>teach me thy way, and I will walk in thy truth:</hi> consider my weakness, and neither leave me in perplexing doubts, nor suffer me to erre from thy will. And be sure God will not forsake thee, for it is plain that many an honest heart is preserved in the way of truth, when many of great, but unsanctified parts, have fallen into damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing errors: <hi>With the upright man he is us'd to shew himself upright.</hi>

The Lord Jesus will come <hi>with his thousands of Saints, Jude</hi> vers. 15. <hi>to convince the ungodly world of all their hard speeches, which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</hi> See here you implacable wretches, this is the man, this the woman, whom you condemn'd for hypocrites; they were <hi>praying</hi> for you, while you were <hi>cursing</hi> them; I knew their uprightness and will now declare it, <hi>Thus shall it be done to those I delight to honour,</hi> and you must go

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>This Doctrine proclaims the Equity of God.</hi> To an upright man he will shew himself upright; why then his wayes are equal. Though <hi>clouds and darkness be round about him,</hi> [his wayes be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den] yet <hi>Judgment and Righteousness are the habitation of his Throne,</hi> [they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes holy, just and equal.] <hi>Psal.</hi> 97. 2.

unequal, <hi>Psal.</hi> 99. 4. <hi>The Kings strength</hi> (and who is that but God?) <hi>loveth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou doest establish equity.</hi> So he doth by his <hi>Rule</hi> and by his <hi>Example.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore whatever his dealing is with you or others, that he <hi>is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Subject cannot alwayes see the <hi>Reason</hi> of his Princes method, no nor a child his fathers; but when they come to the knowledge of them, they <hi>magnifie</hi> what before they were ready to <hi>miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue:</hi> Even so perhaps you understand not the wayes of God towards you or his Church; but <hi>be silent before him,</hi> for you shall see at the long run, that with <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness doth he judge the world, and the people with equity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>This Doctrine pronounces the Misery of all hypocrites.</hi> For it follows by the <hi>Rule of contraries,</hi> that with such <hi>froward</hi> pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>God will show himself froward.</hi> He that walks contrary to <hi>God,</hi> shall have God to walk contrary <hi>to him.</hi> The way of hypocrisie, as well as of impenitency, is a way of contrariety to God, whose holy Law the hypocrite casts behind his back; it is a way of contrariety to Jesus Christ, his <hi>Prophetical Chair,</hi> his <hi>Priestly

Cross,</hi> and his <hi>Kingly Throne;</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God will walk contrarily unto them.

                     <hi>froward is carried headlong.</hi> He that will wrestle with God, shall feel it first or last.</p>
                  <p>The vain hypocrite hopes to over-reach God, to carry his contrivance cleanly; but let him not be deceived, for <hi>God is not mocked: as a man sows, so shall he reap, Job</hi> 8. 14. <hi>His hope shall be cut off, and his trust shall be a spiders web.</hi> You see a spiders web to be a very curious work, but its <hi>original</hi> is from a spiders bowels, and its <hi>design</hi> to catch poor flies; and though she be as secure in it as in a castle, yet when the Broom comes, down they go. The thread that an hypocrite spins is very <hi>fine,</hi> but it hath no higher principle than <hi>Self,</hi> nor greater end than to <hi>deceive.</hi> And though he bless himself in his heart, and sit like a Queen in the web that he hath spun, yet when Gods besome comes, down he falls into Hell, and great is the fall of him.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> He is one that hath no <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the <hi>Nature</hi> of Religion, and yet hath an <hi>Affectation</hi> of the <hi>Name,</hi> and Reputation of Religion: That professes the hatred of sin, and yet cordially loves it: That pretends to love piety, and yet inwardly distasts it; this is an hypocrite and woe be to him. The <hi>keenest</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the <hi>sharpest</hi> Judgments, the <hi>hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test</hi> Torments are the portion of his cup.

Alas!

If holiness be bad, why do you pretend it? If it be good, why do you abhor it? What man of reason will put on the shape of one he hates, when thereby he

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> They judge of thee by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Charity,</hi> but God will judge thee with the judgment of <hi>Verity:</hi> They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can, nor will, nor dare be censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but do guess thee to be <hi>sound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> because thou art <hi>smooth without.</hi> Their great work lies in <hi>assuring</hi> their own salvation, and not in <hi>questioning</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and so thou maist go by them to hell unsuspected as <hi>Judas</hi> did by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; they never dream'd of his hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100513:71"/>
but rather suspected themselves, but this made not his case the safer.</p>
                  <p>And then that you love the people of God, will be difficult to be proved. You like their company (perhaps) for some <hi>natural, moral,</hi> or <hi>acquired</hi> excellencies in them; they are well temper'd, civil, learned, intelligent, or perhaps of some use or stead for you; but alas! you hate their holiness, and <hi>least</hi> like them when they are in their <hi>most</hi> religious frame. You care not for their talk of <hi>Heaven,</hi> when you are pleas'd with their <hi>news</hi> or discourses upon things on <hi>earth.</hi> He that loves an holy man for his Sanctity, loves them all as far as they are holy, and so the holier the person is, the <hi>better</hi> you will love him.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. Singular Obedience. <hi>I have perform'd abundance of Duties, and have forgone divers Sins, and have continued so to do a great while, and can an hypocrite do so?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Is there no <hi>known Duty</hi> that lies by you undischarged? and do you <hi>delight</hi> in the duties you perform, as well as <hi>do</hi> them? do the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Law please you, as well as the <hi>Promises</hi> of the Gospel? And do you live in no <hi>known sin</hi> with purpose, pleasure and perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100513:71"/>
its true, an <hi>hypocrite will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes call upon God,</hi> but its hard to say how long he may; certainly, while any of his base ends draw him on. Indeed when sharp troubles come for Religion, then generally such are weary of it, and utterly <hi>deny</hi> that which they never <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in.</hi> Canst thou now say in the midst of thy multiplied duties, that thou hadst rather <hi>do them,</hi> than not <hi>do them?</hi> Dost thou only <hi>use</hi> prayer, or <hi>chuse</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Dost thou only <hi>avoid</hi> sin, or <hi>abhor</hi> sin? That is something, or else that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee, Luke</hi> 18. shall be justified, as soon as thou.</p>
                  <p>Object. 3. Quiet of Conscience: <hi>My own heart condemns me not, that is most privy to my own estate, and would be (sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) most faithful to me in this weighty case; nay, it is more against an hypocrite, than any other sinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Remember that a <hi>Conscience pacified,</hi> is not alwayes a sign of a <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence purified.</hi> If Conscience be not <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> it will <hi>see;</hi> if it be not <hi>bribed,</hi> it will <hi>speak;</hi> if it be not <hi>brawny,</hi> it will <hi>feel:</hi> but if it have been curb'd and silenc'd, and sinn'd against, it may let you alone (even as <hi>God</hi> doth) and never <hi>bark</hi> till it <hi>bite,</hi> and make its teeth to meet.

                  <p>And yet if one should refer it to thee, Dost thou think in thy very Conscience, that thou art an upright Saint, and a sincere servant of <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> Dost thou not know that by thy self, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with integrity of heart? what is that which makes thee tremble at death? in a fright at thunder, in pain at a searching Sermon? afraid at the reading or hearing of any sisting marks or signs? And then for bearing a great hatred to hypocrites, that's nothing, for one proud man may hate another for standing in his light, and rotten hearts are usually most suspicious and censorious of others.

III. A <hi>third</hi> sign of an upright man is, <hi>He willingly obeys God.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>And thou Solomon my Son, serve thou the God of thy Fathers, with a perfect heart, and a willing mind.</hi> What he does, his will is in it. He will do <hi>what</hi> he can, yea <hi>more</hi> than he can. An hypocrite doth more than he <hi>would.</hi> He <hi>acts</hi> not, but is <hi>acted</hi> by profit, credit, and the like; and when this wind blows not, he stands as the Windmill, stock still. Love to God oyls the wheel of obedience, and then a man <hi>runs the way of his Commandments, when the Lord hath inlarged his heart, Psal.</hi> 119 32. <hi>Amor meus, pondus mcum.</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for ever that man, whose principle of motion is <hi>within.</hi> An hypocrite he hath no hearty good will to the very duties he performs; he prays, but he hath no good will to prayer; he gives, but his will is another way, his <hi>obedience</hi> is against his <hi>mind;</hi> his <hi>interest</hi> draws him one way, his <hi>mind</hi> goes another; and what a wretched life must he live, the <hi>generality</hi> of whose visible actions go against the <hi>frame of his mind,</hi> and so neither God, nor himself hath <hi>pleasure</hi> in them? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath and doth.</hi> Try your selves therefore; do you
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100513:80"/>
find that your wills are prest for God? do you obey your Master, as your servants should obey you, <hi>with good will, doing service as to the Lord, and not to men?</hi> 'Tis true, you will find <hi>another Law,</hi> another <hi>will</hi> drawing the other way, but if you can say with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward man,</hi> your hearts are upright: you grieve for your unwillingness, you bring your wills to every ordinance, and use the means to make them better; and cordially desire to do his <hi>will on earth, as it is done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> The crossness of your will is your greatest burden; and you are getting ground herein, are you not? then your case is good.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The <hi>fourth</hi> Character of an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man is, <hi>He can Judiciously appeal to God. I call God to record on my soul,</hi> saith <hi>Holy Paul.</hi> And this not only in a <hi>crowd,</hi> and before others, but in <hi>secret</hi> in his closet. After consideration of the Law of God, and after the survey of his own heart, an upright man (if there be no <hi>eclipse</hi> upon his spirit) can appeal to the all-searching God, in his closet, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uprightness of his heart; and this I think few hypocrites can reach to do. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> could say, <hi>John</hi> 21. 17. <hi>Lord
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100513:80"/>
thou that knowest all things, thou knowest I love thee.</hi> I appeal from Satan and the World to thee, whether I do not love thee above all the world, and above my self; if my heart were open'd, whether thou wouldst not find <hi>Jehova,</hi> and <hi>Jesus,</hi> and <hi>Holiness to the Lord,</hi> written there. The just man dare appeal to the severest Judge, and a sincere Saint to an all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing <hi>God. Psal.</hi> 139. 23, 24. <hi>Search me, O Lord, and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts; And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</hi> So if you can say, <hi>Lord,</hi> look at me every way, try me by the light of thy word, search me to the quick, I appeal to thee, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est I am <hi>Gold,</hi> not <hi>Gilded,</hi> I am thine, thy <hi>Name</hi> is on me, and thy <hi>Nature</hi> is in me, thou that knowest all things, knowest I love thee: No plainer sign of a cheat, than unwillingness to come to tryal; but he that dare bring his heart to the most trying <hi>Books,</hi> to the most searching <hi>Ministers,</hi> to the all-searching <hi>God,</hi> is sound at heart, and a Saint with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.

V. The <hi>fifth</hi> mark of an upright man is, <hi>He trades not in Presumptuous sins. Psal.</hi> 19. 13. <hi>Keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins, let them not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over me. Then shall I be upright</hi>—The <hi>Tyranny</hi> of sin is one thing, the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> of sin is another. It is the opinion of Divines, that though a child of God may have a <hi>Darling sin,</hi> one sin to which he is more inclin'd then another; yet he hath not a <hi>Reigning sin,</hi> that is, (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they mean) no sin hath the <hi>absolute</hi> command of the whole soul: no, there is a seed of God in a sanctified heart, that cannot so yield to sin. So that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the sin of an upright man and another, lies not so much in the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and kind of the <hi>sin committed,</hi> as it lies in the <hi>heart</hi> of a <hi>sinner.</hi> That may be an <hi>Infirmity</hi> in one, that is a <hi>grosser sin</hi> in another. A <hi>less</hi> sin chosen, is worse than a <hi>greater</hi> sin <hi>fallen</hi> into without choice: a less <hi>allowed,</hi> than a greater <hi>disallowed.</hi>

VI. The <hi>sixth</hi> and last Character of an upright man is, <hi>He keeps himself from his own iniquity.</hi> You have this in the <hi>next verse but one</hi> before the <hi>Text. I also was upright before him:</hi>—prove it—<hi>I kept my self from mine iniquity.</hi> Every man hath some sin of his own. We are <hi>capable</hi> of every sin, but we are not <hi>inclin'd</hi> to every sin. Our <hi>constitutions</hi> usually do chuse our darling sin, our condition of life or calling may nurse it up. This Sin is the tryal of our sincerity. An hypocrite chides it before folks, but keeps it under his tongue, cordially favours it, and so makes provision for it; in effect prefers it before Christ and Heaven. 'Tis this sin that sends most men to hell. They'l part with many; but <hi>skin for skin,</hi> yea soul and all will a man give for the life of this. And there is no wickedness too great to wade through to the fruition of it.</p>
                  <p>Now an upright man, had at his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, the deepest prick in this vein. The <hi>dearer</hi> the <hi>sin,</hi> the <hi>dearer</hi> it costs in <hi>Repentance:</hi> and thereupon he keeps a jealous eye upon it, and is whetted also with an holy revenge against it, for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing such a <hi>God</hi> as now he finds him to be, and for hindring so much the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his soul; that he mainly hates this
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100513:82"/>
sin, and indeavours to prevent and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it. He <hi>most</hi> hates it, though he can <hi>least</hi> vanquish it. And thereupon he faithfully makes use of all the <hi>means</hi> he knows to mortifie it, and carefully avoids all <hi>occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> that may further it, he grieves bitterly for his relapses into it, and gives no rest to his God, or his soul, till he see the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of it; he is resolv'd to dye in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, before he will make a peace.</p>
                  <p>Now feel your <hi>Pulse</hi> for the Lords sake, and deceive not your own souls. These <hi>signs</hi> will state your case, if you will but prove your own selves. The <hi>explication</hi> of them is ours, the <hi>application</hi> of them is yours. Do not <hi>shut</hi> the book, till you have <hi>opened</hi> your hearts, and found either the name of a <hi>Saint,</hi> or an <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> Why do you retreat? It is not your <hi>enemy,</hi> but your <hi>Physician</hi> that is at door. To try your case can do no hurt. If all be right, you may have the <hi>comfort;</hi> if all be naught, <hi>yet</hi> you may have a <hi>cure.</hi> Rush not blindfold into Hell. Put us not to our best skill in describing Characters, and then let them alone as you found them, for want of pains. If this work not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member we have told you that the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sign of an hypocrite is, he <hi>dare not come to tryal.</hi>

Doubt. 5. <hi>The Deceitfulness of the heare;</hi> this is so great, that after all my tryal I may be mistaken; there are lamps that may delude a man even to the gates of Heaven.

                     <hi>Resol.</hi> 1. <hi>Though the Heart be deceitful in its self, yet it is discernable by the help of Gods spirit. Jer.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>I the Lord search the heart;</hi> and he can and will lead every diligent self-searcher into the darkest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners thereof. God and man together may find out it. Indeed a carnal careless eye sees it not, but he that <hi>would</hi> know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>shall</hi> know himself. No man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived herein, but he that is willing to be deceived.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Your holy jealousie as it is a good Sign of uprightness, so it is a good Antidote against hypocrisie.</hi> He that detects a cheat, is not then of his party; and he that knows he hath a <hi>Proteus</hi> to deal with, will be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant over him. He that hates and bewails hypocrisie, and most in himself, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dye an hypocrite.</p>
                  <p>And therefore be of good comfort ye upright ones. Your matter shall stand, your tenure is good, notwithstanding the suits commenc'd against it. These <hi>shaking

fits</hi> do but confirm your health. The greatest tempest hurts not the tree that's well rooted, its roots will spread the more. The pinching trying Frosts streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the sound man, and every thing doth good to <hi>him that is good and upright in his heart.</hi> However you may be reputed or used in this world, whatever condition concludes you here; yet in Life, in Death, in Judgment, and in Eternity, <hi>Integrity</hi> will be a <hi>Cordial.</hi>
