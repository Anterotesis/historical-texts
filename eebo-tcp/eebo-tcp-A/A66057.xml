            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Length of dayes is in her right hand, and in her
left hand Riches and <hi>HONOR.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Her wayes are wayes of Pleasantness, and all her
Pathes are Peace.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe chief Design of the Wise
man in this Text, is, to set
forth the many great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
that belong to <hi>Religion;</hi>
In order to which, he doth here E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerate
those five Principal things, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54914:3"/>
must contribute to a Compleat state of
Happiness in this World, namely,
<hi>Health,</hi> and <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Honor,</hi> and
<hi>Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>Peace;</hi> And asserts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, that they are the proper
effects of that wisdome which consist's
in being Religious.</p>
            <p>This he expresses by way of <hi>Allegory,</hi>
representing Wisdom (as is usual for
other Virtues) in the shape of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or Queen, with her Armes extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in the Posture of Directing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
her Followers; Holding in her
right hand the Blessing of <hi>Health,</hi> or
<hi>length of Dayes,</hi> the great Promise of the
<hi>Law,</hi> to which the Precedence of the right
hand is therefore given, because it is
amongst all Worldly Blessings, the
greatest and most desirable; That, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, a Man cannot enjoy any thing
else, nor so much as his own self: <hi>Length
of dayes is in her right hand.</hi> And then,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54914:3"/>
for those other things, which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Men do so much covet and
labour after, <hi>Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Reputation;</hi>
these likewise are at her Disposal, and
must proceed from her Gift; <hi>And in her
left hand Riches and Honor.</hi> And, as
for the <hi>Cheerfulness</hi> of our Conditions,
he affirms, that the truest Pleasure must
be found in those wayes that are directed
by Her; <hi>Her wayes are wayes of Pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
And because there are several
things, which have some present delight
in them,<note place="margin">Prov. 5. 4.</note> seeming to <hi>drop as the Hony-Combe,
and to be smoother then Oyle;</hi> And
yet upon tryal, do prove in the issue,
<hi>bitter as Wormwood, and sharpe as a two-edged
Sword;</hi> therefore 'tis added, that
her wayes are not only <hi>pleasant,</hi> but
they are likewise Safe and Quiet: <hi>All
her Paths are Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That these things are the effects of
Religion, is here only affirmed, which, to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54914:4"/>
them who believe the Authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
is evidence sufficient: But, it were
easie to prove this, concerning each of
them, by all other kinds of evidence, of
which such matters are capable.</p>
            <p>I purpose at this time to Treat only
concerning the Third of them, namely
<hi>Honor;</hi> as being the most proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for this Presence and Auditory. And
that this can only be attain'd by Religion
and Virtue, I doubt not but to prove,
with so much strength and perspicuity
as shall be sufficient to convince any one,
who will but attend and consider.</p>
            <p>In order to this, I shall first endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to state the true Nature of <hi>Honor,</hi>
and to shew wherein the most proper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it doth consist; 'Tis an equivocal
word, and is capable of various sences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Sometimes 'tis used to denote
<hi>worthy and creditable Parentage;</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
derived from such Ancestors as have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54914:4"/>
been famous in their Generation for some
eminent Virtue or Exploit: Wherein
there is this benefit, that a Man hath
great Examples in his own Family, and
so much the stronger Obligation not to
degenerate from them: But it shews ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what such a Man should be, then
what he is; and, to a Person that is not
Virtuous, doth prove a Prejudice ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then an advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sometimes 'tis used to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
<hi>Titles of Place and Dignity,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the various orders and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Nobility in several Nations:
But, this kind of Honor depending meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the Princes Favour, must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be wholly extrinsical, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
can have no more due to it, then
a meer <hi>External</hi> respect. Such persons
may challenge from us, that we should
give them their due Titles, and demeane
our selves towards them with that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54914:5"/>
and Ceremony as becomes their
Quality: But then, as to <hi>inward</hi> esteem
and affection, they can demand no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
a share of this, then according as their
real worth and virtue shall require. The
Royal Stampe upon any kind of <hi>Mettal,</hi>
may be sufficient to give it an <hi>Extrinsick</hi>
value, and to determine the Rate at
which it is to pass amongst Coynes, but
it cannot give an <hi>Intrinsick</hi> value, or
make that which is but <hi>Brass</hi> to be
<hi>Gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, there are some Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and Relations of Men, to whom an
Inward Veneration is due, though the
Persons themselves should not be Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
Namely, <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi>
and <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>Benefactors;</hi>
who, having somewhat of a Divine
<hi>Stampe</hi> and <hi>Impress</hi> upon them, may
therefore challenge from us, that we
should demeane our selves towards them,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54914:5"/>
both with such an <hi>Outward</hi> Respect, as
may become their <hi>Places,</hi> and with such
an <hi>Inward</hi> Respect too, as may be sutable
to that <hi>Image</hi> which they bear, our
<hi>dependance</hi> upon them, and <hi>Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to them. But then, we cannot be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to think such Persons Good Men,
unless we have some Evidence to believe
them to be so, or at least, not to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
So that they are beholding to
something extrinsical to their Persons,
namely, to their Callings and Relations,
for that Honor which is paid to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The word <hi>Honor</hi> is sometimes
used for that Esteem and Reputation
which a Man hath in the World, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
amongst Vertuous Persons; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which sence 'tis defin'd by
<hi>Tully</hi> to be <hi>Consentiens Laus bonorum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tuscul.</hi> Q. 2.</note> the
Concurrent Approbation of Good Men;
when those, who are best able to Judge
of real worth, shall both think and speak
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54914:6"/>
well of others, this is properly Honoring
of them. And in this sence (which is
the most proper notion of the words) it
is one of the greatest blessings that this
World can afford; much to be preferrred
before Riches, or Pleasures, or Life it
self. <hi>A good Name is rather to be chosen
than great Riches, and loving kindness, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Silver or Gold,</hi> Prov. 22. 1. One
that is a Generous, Virtuous Man, will
choose to dye, rather than do any thing,
that may expose him to Infamy: St.
<hi>Paul</hi> was of this Mind;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 15.</note> 
               <hi>It were better
for me to dye, than that any should make my
Glorying void.</hi> There have been some
Wise Men, who have neglected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refused
that other kind of <hi>Honor,</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Titles of Dignity, as conceiving
more of Burden and Temptation in it,
than of real Advantage; But, no Man,
in his Wits, did ever despise a good
Name, unless such profligate dissolute
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54914:6"/>
Wretches, as did either despair of, or
resolve against, doing any thing, that
might deserve it. 'Tis not easie to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
up the many Advantages that belong
to this kind of <hi>Honor:</hi> 'Tis <hi>Power,</hi> ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
a Man to do things great and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
to be useful to his Friends and
his Country: 'Tis <hi>Safety,</hi> and doth give
a Man such an interest in the esteem
and affection of others, as will make them
concern'd for his Welfare, ready to
stand by him and assist him in any kind
of Danger; which are so great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
that whosoever shall wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
them, must needs be render'd very
contemptible.</p>
            <p>Having thus <hi>Explained</hi> the proper
Notion of <hi>Honor,</hi> I proceed in the next
place to <hi>Prove,</hi> that Religion and Virtue
is the only meanes for the attaining of it:
This I shall endeavour to do by <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and by <hi>Reason,</hi> and by <hi>Experience,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54914:7"/>
which are all the kinds of Arguments,
that such matters are capable of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By <hi>Testimony.</hi> The Scripture
doth abound in divers Assertions and
Promises to this purpose: Such as are
Religious, are stiled the <hi>Excellent of the
Earth,</hi> Psal. 16. 3. and said to be <hi>more
excellent than their Neighbours,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54914:7"/>
               <hi>The Wise-man speaking of Religion,
saith, that</hi> it shall be an ornament of Grace

<hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 13.<note place="margin">Iohn. 12. 26.</note> 
               <hi>He hath said,</hi> Those
that honor me, I will honor, 1 <hi>Sam. 2.
30. And certainly, he, who is the King
of Kings, must needs be the Fountain of
Honor, and able to dispose of it as he
pleases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, because such persons, as are no
friends to Religion, may have but a small
esteem for the Authority of Scripture;
Therefore to these I would suggest the
concurrent Opinion of Wise Men in all
former Ages. Though the antient <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54914:8"/>
were divided into various Sects,
and differ'd very much from one another
in several Opinions; yet, in this, they have
all agreed, that Honor is due only to
Virtue, and doth not properly belong to
any thing else. It would be tedious to
enumerate the several sayings to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
out of <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Tully, Seneca,</hi>
and the other Antients: And certainly,
that Man must needs have a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
conceit of his own Abilities,
who dares prefer his private Opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the General Consent of Wise Men
in former Ages, such as have been
counted the greatest Masters of Reason,
and most eminent for their Knowledge
and their Wisdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I proceed in the next place
to confirme this by the Principles of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
That Religion and Virtue is the
cause of <hi>Honor.</hi> There may be a two-fold
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54914:8"/>
cause of things
<list>
                  <item>Moral,</item>
                  <item>Natural.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>That is said to be the <hi>Moral</hi> cause,
which doth dispose a Man to such a
Condition, upon the Account of Fitness
and Desert, and in this sence <hi>Honor</hi> is the
<hi>Reward of Virtue;</hi> There is an equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
right, a sutableness and congruity,
that good Men should be loved and
esteemed, and vitious Men exposed to
shame: <hi>As Snow in Summer, and as Rain
in Harvest, so is Honor unsutable for a
Fool,</hi> Prov. 26. 1. The intermixing of
Winter and Summer, would not cause a
greater disorder in the <hi>Natural</hi> World,
than the cross disposal of <hi>Honor</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
would in the <hi>Moral</hi> World.
And hence is it, that the Lawes of all
Nations and Governments, have owned
it as a point of Policy, to excite their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54914:9"/>
unto Virtuous and worthy Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by this Motive of <hi>Honor,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr
them from Vitious Courses, by the
consideration of the shame and contempt
which belongs to them.</p>
            <p>That is said to be the <hi>Natural</hi> cause of a
thing, which doth by its own immediate
efficacy produce the effect; and in this
sence likewise is Virtue the cause of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi>
The Fire doth not more naturally
produce heat, than Goodness doth
Love and Esteem; Which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
very plain, if we consider, That
<hi>Inward</hi> Honouring is nothing else, but
the Believing a Man to be Worthy and
Virtuous; and the Testifying this by
our Words and Actions is <hi>Outward</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring.
Now, nothing can be more
evident, then that the best means for one
to be thought good, is to be so.</p>
            <p>A Man may excell in Strength, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Riches, Learning, Wit, which are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54914:9"/>
all commendable things, and will contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to a Mans esteem; But, if we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
such a one to be notoriously Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
This esteem will not be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with Love, but with Fear, Hate, and
Envy; because such a one hath by these
things so much the greater advantage of
doing Mischief in the World: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the other side, though a Man
should be destitute of all these other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
without any Nobility in his
Ancestors, but of a small Estate, a low
Condition; yet, if we believe him to be
a truly. Virtuous Man, it cannot be, but
that we must pay a Veneration to him.</p>
            <p>All things whatsoever have some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Standard, whereby the Goodness
of them is to be Measured; namely,
their sutableness unto that chief end, for
which they are designed. We do not
therefore account a <hi>Ship</hi> to be good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis curiously painted and gilded,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54914:10"/>
or carved and inlayed, but because 'tis
fitted for all the purposes of Navigation,
which is, the proper end and use of a Ship:
Nor do we therefore account a <hi>Sword</hi> to
be good, because it hath a rich Hilt, and
an Embroidered Scabbard, but because
it is fit for the proper use of a Sword,
which is to cut: They are the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
of <hi>Seneca,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sen. Ep. 76.</note> speaking of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
<hi>In homine quoque, nihil ad rem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet,
quantum aret, quantum foeneret, a
quam multis salutetur, &amp;c. sed quam bonus
sit.</hi> It should be so likewise in our esteem
of Men, who are not so much to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
by the Grandeur of their Estates or
Titles, as by their inward goodness.</p>
            <p>Every Man is endowed with a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
principle, inclining him to a state of
Happiness, and hath in some measure,
both an Ability to judge of, and a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and liberty for applying himself
unto, those Duties, which are the proper
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54914:10"/>
meanes for the promoting of this end:
And this being the peculiar difference of
the Humane Nature, therefore a man
is not upon any other account to be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
praised or blamed, but according to
the right or wrong use of this natural li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
And consequently as a Man
doth find, either in himself or others, a
constant and firm resolution, to make a
right use of this, so should he propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
his esteem accordingly; Preferring
this <hi>Inward</hi> Greatness, this Rectitude of
Mind, whereby a Man is resolved in
every condition to do that which shall
appear to be his Duty, before any <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
Greatness whatsoever.</p>
            <p>There are two kind of Virtues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all the rest, which are by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
consent esteemed Venerable, and
such as do advance the Reputation of
those who are endowed with them;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54914:11"/>
namely
<list>
                  <item>Wisdome,</item>
                  <item>Courage.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Because they have a more intrinsick
rise, and do less depend upon External
advantages, but seem rather to be rooted
in the Inward Frame and Temper of
Mind; and withal, are most beneficial
both to our Selves and Others: The
former signifying a Man to have those
<hi>Intellectual</hi> Abilities, which are proper to
his kind, whereby the Humane Nature
is to be distinguished from other things:
The other, because it argues a Rectitude
in the <hi>Will,</hi> and a Power to subdue the
Passion of Fear, which is most natural
to our present state of Infirmity; and
withal doth support a Man against Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
and inable for those two Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of Doing and Suffering as he ought.
And, for this Reason, the Vices that are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54914:11"/>
opposite to these, are amongst all others
counted the most shameful; There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no greater Reproach to be cast upon
any one, then to be esteemed a Fool, or a
Coward.</p>
            <p>Now a Man that is Irreligious can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
justly pretend to either of these
Virtues.</p>
            <p>1. For <hi>Wisdome.</hi> This is so essential
to Religion, that in the Scripture-phrase
(especially in the Writings of <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Solomon)</hi> they boty go under the same
<hi>Name,</hi> and there is very good reason
why it should be so; because there is
such an intimate agreement between the
<hi>Natures</hi> of them: The <hi>Philosopher</hi>
doth define Wisdome to consist in an
ability and inclination, to make choice of
the right <hi>Meanes</hi> in the prosecution of
our true <hi>End.</hi> And nothing can inable
a Man for this but Religion, both as
to the <hi>Subordinate</hi> End of <hi>Temporal</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54914:12"/>
in this World; but chiefly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to that great and <hi>Supreme</hi> End of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
Happiness in the World to come.</p>
            <p>2. And then for <hi>Courage,</hi> 'Tis not
possible for a Man to be truly Valiant,
unless he be withall truly Religious: He
may be bold and daring, and able (in a
fearless manner) to rush upon any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
but then he must stifle his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
from considering what the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of things may be, what shall
become of him hereafter, if he should
miscarry. There being no man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
so totally free from the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of a future state, but that
when he is serious and considerate, he
must be startled with Doubts and Feares
concerning it: So that there cannot be
any rational, sedate, deliberate courage,
but only in such, as have some good
hopes of a better Estate in the other
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54914:12"/>
World; And, 'tis Religion only that
can inable a Man for this.</p>
            <p>3. I proceed to the Third kind of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to this purpose, from <hi>Experience;</hi>
By which, I mean that Practical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which every man may attain by
his own Observation of the usual course
of things in the World: And, by this,
it will appear, that no kind of persons
have been more highly Reverenced in
the Hearts and Consciences of others,
then those that have been most eminent
for their Virtue and Religion; which
hath been alwayes true, both with respect
to Publick Communities, and Private
Persons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For <hi>Nations;</hi> If we consult
the Stories of former times, we shall
find that saying of <hi>Solomon</hi> constantly
verified, That<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Righteousness doth exalt a
Nation, but Sin doth prove a reproach
to it:</hi> And more especially the sin of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54914:13"/>
and Prophaness; As this doth
increase in any Nation, so must the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and Reputation of that Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.
The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was then
at the highest, as to its Name and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
when it was so as to its Virtue; when
they were most punctual in observing
the Rites of their Religion, (though
that were a false way of Worship,) most
Heroical in their Justice, Courage, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
Gratitude; then it was that they
deserv'd to Govern the World, and to be
had in greatest Honor above all other
Nations: And not only <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
two Heathen Writers, who, upon
that Account, might be thought more
partial; But St. <hi>Austin</hi> also and <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
two of the Fathers, do ascribe the
flourishing of that Empire, when it was
at its height, to the Religion, and Piety,
and Vertue of those times; And, as
they did afterward degenerate from this,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54914:13"/>
so did they decline likewise in their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Honor.</p>
            <p>2. Thus also hath it been with
<hi>particular persons;</hi> Amongst the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi>
What Elogies do we find in the
Honor of <hi>Socrates, Aristides, Cato, Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus?</hi>
The latter of which, though but
a poor Slave, had yet such a Veneration
paid to his Memory, that his Earthen
Lampe by which he was wont to Study,
was, after his Death, sold for 3000
Drachms.</p>
            <p>Nor was it otherwise amongst the
<hi>Christians;</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> were but poor
Fishermen, Illiterate Mechanicks; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> were but of mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
much Opposed and Persecuted in
the World; And yet these Men, during
the time of their lives, were highly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced
amongst those that knew them;
and since their Deaths, what can be
more Glorious then that Renown which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54914:14"/>
they have amongst Men, when the
greatest Kings and Princes will not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
their Names without Reverence;
when whole Nations are willing to set
apart, and to observe Solemne Dayes and
Festivals in Honor of their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>And, as it hath alwayes been thus
formerly, so I appeale to every mans
breast, whether it be not so now; Let
them but examin, what their Inclinations
are towards such Persons, whom they
believe to be truly Virtuous: Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to such amongst them as are their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Acquaintance</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> but
likewise to <hi>Strangers,</hi> nay to very <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi>
whether they do not esteem, and
love them, and will well to them.</p>
            <p>I shall crave leave to speak briefly to
two <hi>Objections,</hi> that may be made, against
what I have been Proving.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54914:14"/>
I. <hi>The Scripture saith (speaking
of good Men, That</hi> the World shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
and persecute them, and speak all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of evil against them: <hi>Our Saviour
himself was</hi> despised and rejected of Men;
<hi>And his Apostles were</hi> used as the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
and off-scouring of all things.<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To these two things may be said by
way of <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It cannot otherwise be expected,
but that when a New Religion is to be
set up, men must be highly concern'd in
their opposing of it, and of those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it: And the fore-cited Texts do
particularly relate to this very case; when
<hi>Christianity</hi> was first introduced into the
World, and to be propagated by the
Sufferings of those that Professed it;
which being an <hi>exempt case,</hi> and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the usual course of things,
therefore these Texts are not equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licable
to other Times and Places, when
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54914:15"/>
and where the True Religion hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and Kings prove Nursing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Those that knew our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and his Followers, did highly Honor
them: And, as for others that were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of them, and not sufficiently convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of their goodness, 'tis no wonder
that they used them accordingly. The
most vitious person that is, if he doth
either know, or have reason to think ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be Virtuous, must of necessity pay
to him an Inward Reverence; Because
'tis not in any mans power, so farr to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
violence to his own Faculties, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
any thing against his Evidence.
'Tis true indeed, men have a greater
power over their <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> then
they have over their <hi>Beliefe;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they may call, and use such a one as
they please, they may revile, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
him; And, in this sence, <hi>Honor est in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54914:15"/>
honorante:</hi> But, even in so doing, they
seem to pay a Veneration to <hi>Religion</hi> it
self, whil'st they are fain to disguise it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Names of Hypocrisie, Heresie,
Superstition, thereby to justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their opposing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> It appears by the Experience of
all Ages, that Vitious Men are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
had in Honor.</p>
            <p>To this it may be Answer'd.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>External</hi> Honor may be due to
them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Internal</hi> Honor may be given to
them, by such as do not know them. The
meer Opinion of being Virtuous, must
of necessity have the same advantage in
this respect, with <hi>Real Goodness;</hi> The
main difference is, that it is not like to last,
because it is almost Morally impossible,
for a Man, who doth only dissemble Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
to stand always upon so strict a guard,
as not to be discover'd. If it be said, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54914:16"/>
men, who are Notoriously Vitious, are
sometimes applauded, and Cry'd-Up for
their Vertue; It may be Answer'd, That
this cannot be so truly stiled <hi>Honoring</hi> as
<hi>Flattering;</hi> The proper Notion of which
doth consist in giving undue Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;
Nor, will any contribute to it,
but vile Sycophants, the worst kind of
Enemies, and the most Incompetent
Judges of real worth: Such only being
fit to give true Praise, who are themselves
Praise-worthy.</p>
            <p>Now, if this be the true state of the
Case I have been speaking to; That the
generality of Wise and Considerate
Men, in all former times, have attested to
this Truth, if the Reason of the thing
require that it must be so; And, if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
accordingly from Common Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
to be so; If the most Material
Objections against it, may be so plainly
and fully satisfied, then there can be no
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54914:16"/>
sufficient Reason to doubt, of the truth of
this Proposition; That Religion and
Vertue is the most proper meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Interest of Honor, which is
the thing I was to prove.</p>
            <p>I shall crave leave to suggest two things
by way of <hi>Application,</hi> and I have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> This may convince men of
Folly, who seek for <hi>Honor</hi> by any other
Meanes. The great Instances which
are commonly given, of Mens being
<hi>Fooles,</hi> is, from their Chusing such
Meanes, as are altogether insufficient
for the End they Design: As the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to make a <hi>Blackamore</hi> White
by washing of him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, the using
of such Meanes, as are not only insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for, but opposite unto, and Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of the End they Propose; this is a
degree above <hi>Folly,</hi> and may be stiled
<hi>Madness:</hi> 'Tis as if a Man should
run into the Water to dry himself, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54914:17"/>
into the Fire to coole himself; And yet
this is the Case of many Men in the
World, who propose to themselves such
Courses, for the Promoting of their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>
as are most Destructive of it; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Prophaness, and Contempt of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Despising that which other Men
stand in Awe of; by which they think
to get the Reputation of <hi>Wit,</hi> and of
<hi>Courage;</hi> Of <hi>Wit,</hi> by pretending to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
more deeply into the Nature of
things, and to understand them better
then others do; not to be so easily impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon, as other Credulous People are.
Of <hi>Courage,</hi> by their not being so easily
scared at the Apprehension of Danger at
a distance.</p>
            <p>But, the Plain Truth is, such Persons
do hereby prove themselves to be both
<hi>Fooles</hi> and <hi>Cowards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fooles,</hi> In mistaking their great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
in making choice of such meanes, as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54914:17"/>
can never promote the End they Design;
There being no kind of Men that are
more exposed (whatsoever they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
may think of it) to Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
and Hatred, than those that seek
for Credit by despising of <hi>Religion.
Fools,</hi> in venturing their <hi>future Estates</hi>
and their <hi>Souls,</hi> upon such hazards, as
all Mankind would Cry-out-upon
for the most Palpable Folly and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
if they should do the like, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their <hi>Temporal Estates,</hi> or their
<hi>Bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cowards,</hi> In being more afraid of
little Dangers, because they are <hi>present,</hi>
than of greater, because they are <hi>future,</hi>
and at a distance: As that Soldier, who
doth more dread the present danger of
Fighting, when he is oblig'd to it, than
the future danger of suffering <hi>Martial</hi>
Law for runing away, may justly be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54914:18"/>
esteemed a notorious Coward; So may
that Man who is more afraid of a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
inconvenience, by incurring the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
and displeasure of his loose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
to whom he would be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
than of a <hi>future</hi> Mischief from the
Judgement of God.</p>
            <p>No Man will esteem another to be
truly Valiant, because he is not afraid
to do such vile unworthy things as will
expose him to the displeasure and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Civil Magistrate; Much less
should he be so Accounted, for daring
to do such things, as will in the issue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him to Divine Vengeance.</p>
            <p>For Men of no real worth to expect the
esteem and affection of others, as it is very
<hi>unequal</hi> on their parts, requiring Brick
without Straw; So neither is it <hi>Lawful</hi> nor
<hi>Possible</hi> for others to allow it them: Not
<hi>Lawful,</hi> because it is as well a mans duty
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54914:18"/>
               <hi>to contemn a vile Person, as to Honor
those that fear the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 15. 4.</note> Not <hi>Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
because men must necessarily Judge
according to the most prevailing Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
nor can they esteem such a one
to be worthy, whom they know to be
otherwise, any more than they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that to be White and Streight,
which they see is Black and Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If these things be so, it
will hence follow, that men who have
any Sence of <hi>Honor,</hi> should, by these
considerations, be excited to a Love of
that, which is the only Meanes to it,
namely, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> Those of
Slavish Sordid Spirits, may be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
perswaded by the consideration of
<hi>Gaine;</hi> But, no <hi>Motive</hi> can be more
powerful with Noble and Generous
<hi>Mindes,</hi> than that of <hi>Honor.</hi> That man
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54914:19"/>
takes very ill measures of things, who doth
not make it one of his principal cares to
keep his Name unspotted; It being no
easie matter to recover a Forfeited Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
            <p>Such Profligate Wretches, as are
without any sence of <hi>Honor</hi> or <hi>Shame,</hi>
may justly be esteemed the Publick
<hi>Pests</hi> and <hi>Mischiefs</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and
such as ought to be Banished from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, as being the Common
Enemies to Government and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Of all sorts of Men, there lies a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
Obligation upon them that are in <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Places,</hi> to preserve their Reputations
clear and without blemish: A Private
Person is not so much concern'd to look
after <hi>Publick Fame,</hi> as that Man is, who
is ingag'd in <hi>Publick Imployment.</hi> He,
that can abundantly satisfie himself, with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54914:19"/>
the Conscience of well doing, while he
is in a <hi>Private Station,</hi> if once he be called
to any such Imployment, where he must
be Useful to others by his Authority; 'Tis
most fitting then, that he should seek the
Aid of <hi>Opinion,</hi> and <hi>Publick Esteem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis this which Rules the World,
and Stamps upon Things the Rates at
which they are to pass.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in this World that
we can Propose to our selves of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
benefit, than the Love and Esteem
of Good Men; I have shewed before
that it is <hi>Power,</hi> 'tis <hi>Safety:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all the Advantages which we have
by it <hi>whilst we live,</hi> 'tis one of those
things, that will <hi>abide after us,</hi> when
we are gone out of this World; And,
for that reason a special regard is to
be had to it: And, the more Wise
any Man is, the more Care will he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54914:20"/>
take to transmit a Grateful Memory
of himself to future Times; And,
since he must be Spoken of after his
Departure, he will take Care that he
be well Spoken of, that his Name may
be as a Precious Ointment, leaving a
Perfume behind it; That Men may
<hi>Rise up at the mention of it, and call
him blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall shut up all, with that Affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Exhortation of the eloquent</hi> Apostle,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. Finally Brethren, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
things are Venerable, whatsoever
things are Lovely, whatsoever things are
of good Report, If there be any Vertue,
if there be any Praise, think of these
Things. And the Peace of God, which
passeth all understanding shall keep your
Hearts and Minds through Iesus Christ.</p>
