            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gal.</speaker>
               <l>IT is high-colour'd, ſhews the blood's inflam'd,</l>
               <l>Yet pretty clear. Th' Evil may well be nam'd</l>
               <l>Without offence. Somthing I find of waight</l>
               <l>Sink to the Deep; which Miſt-like, riſes ſtraight,</l>
               <l>And clears again. I cannot rightly call</l>
               <l>This a Diſtemper, when I judge of all.</l>
               <l>Gentlemen, help a little, look with me,</l>
               <l>Whoſe Water judge you this I caſt to be?</l>
               <l>You know not. No? Nor ſhall I tell in haſt,</l>
               <l>Leſt then perhaps the man himſelf be caſt,</l>
               <l>More than his Water. This I freely ſay,</l>
               <l>The Poets Water 'tis that made the Play.</l>
               <l>And yet no Water-Poets. The Play then,</l>
               <l>Is high, and clear, and deep, and clear again,</l>
               <l>Juſt as the Poets Water. Who indeed.</l>
               <l>Had he not been a <hi>Patient</hi> forc't to bleed,</l>
               <l>Had never Poetiz'd. By this I know <stage>He looks on the Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <l>He's rendred Poet from this Comick Shew.</l>
               <l>He courts you all by me, and recommends</l>
               <l>His Jeſuit in the Play, to you as Friends.</l>
               <l>For him abroad: He gives you notice how</l>
               <l>The Dev'l himſelf is turn'd Jeſuit now.</l>
               <l>Yet thus declares; He quarrels not with all,</l>
               <l>Only with Deviliſh and Pragmatical</l>
               <l>Church-Empericks. As he is, be you mild:</l>

                     <p>Madam, <hi>See Senior</hi> will not be dropping or dropping on his part. I have learn'd exactly to kneel upon one Knee, and to draw part of my long Rapier in my publick Devotions, to ſignifie my readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to defend the truth: to praiſe the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and modeſty of the Inquiſition, though it be cruel above the Gallies: to pretend fulneſs from a Bunch of Grapes, and a Clove of Garlick, beyond what all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of <hi>England</hi> afford. I often pray to the powers in Heaven, but I ſwear by them oftner. My heart is moſt zealous towards the She-Saints above; but I am yet more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98827:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſervent towards the pretty hearts beneath, and if they fail, the Beaſt fals even to my deſires. I more love the Image in holy things, than the Subſtance: I can be cruel to the raiſing of horrour and trembling in the hearers, as I have been in the <hi>Indies:</hi> and leave the Jeſuits to colour and cover it with a godly reaſon; as ſomthing may be ſtudied in the favour of all things, though never ſo barbarous and horrid: I can bring torturing whips for <hi>England</hi> in a Navy, and delegate the Jeſuits to forge that I brought them to whip and diſcipline my ſelf in the Raptures and Ecſtaſies of my Devotion: I am a true ſervant to the Jeſuits in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motnig of their ends; but I falſly forget that the end ſhould be good, and the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agreeable: I work miſchief ſlowly, but ſurely: I ſhall perform incomparably more: Let this ſuffice to be ſpoken.</p>

                     <p>Madam, you will not find me empty; a man ſo near the Fountain-head and ſo wax-like to the Impreſſion of high things: I abound with all the poſſible garbs of Devotion, and with Bell-concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos to garniſh them: My Soul is enticed forth every day at my ears, and I am carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly out of my ſelf, with the Muſick of the Churches; but I direct little atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the thing ſignified: I have a Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio of women in my thoughts: but the for Boy waits there as moſt delicious: May it pleaſe your Madam-ſhip; the Turk him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is not ſo frolick in this kind of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as I am. I ſtile my ſelf much an admirer and honourer of the Jeſuits: but for the ancient Father of the Society in the <hi>caſa profeſſa;</hi> he is <hi>the man</hi> in my breaſt: I dure let him looſe to combate with the old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelf in Matcheveliſm: I own the holy Monuments of the good men in old time; and thoſe are abundantly ſufficient to ſave me: to the which I add a few dull and ſcanty Devotions; As, once in a hundred years I convert a <hi>Jew,</hi> and perhaps a whore when ſhe is rotten, old, and paſt pleaſure: I paſs and repaſs many godly Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the Inquiſition; but I ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert any there, except it be into aſhes by fire: and if any man prevent me by death, I make a flame-offering of his car caſe, as I did of <hi>Spalato</hi>'s in <hi>Campo di fiori;</hi> and that believe me, Madam, was a fat one, I had a godly <hi>Engliſh</hi> Friend, who came from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> the other day, and there mournfully complain'd with much of your ſpirit, that he had been horribly perſecuted by the wild and ſavage <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and in the Rant of his Tavern-devotion, came head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long down the Tavern Stairs, and broke his neck, beyond the skill of the Bone-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; ſo his hypocritical mouth was ſtopt. It belongs to this Story, Madam, that a devout <hi>Spaniard</hi> came a while ago into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with intention to convert it, as having heard that the people were wild, and liv'd in Woods, and Caves of the earth: but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and by moſt plain and manifold experience finding it otherwiſe, he fairly, but not ſoftly, return'd from thence wiſer than he came. Truly, Madam; we do hatch &amp; patch together many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; godly Stories in <hi>Italy,</hi> which though they be ſomwhat near to good ends, are very wide of truth; and yet good Ends muſt be fought by <hi>proportionable means,</hi> and Truth wants not the helping hand of Falſhood to ſupport it: I am your Vaſſal at hand to act the reſt.</p>

                     <p>Madam, I do not implunge my ſelf over head and ears into Devotion; becauſe as the <hi>Veretians</hi> and other high-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Eagle-wing'd <hi>Italians,</hi> I have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of the Atheiſt within me: but I can play the devout fool prettily and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhly at ſet times: And of all Nations, I do you moſt humble ſervice, Madam.

ſuch a changeling and phantaſtical dreſs, ſuch a Pedlars-pack of Ribbands, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with an outward form of Devotion, is the top and top-gallant of Hypocriſie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the modes and numberleſs number of Faſhions, that never <hi>Flanders-</hi>Horſe was ſick of ſo many, in <hi>benevolous Conjunction</hi> with Godlineſs, pencil forth and give Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie in her full ſplendor. Afterwards, the Complements <hi>a la mode de France,</hi> which multiply words beyond limit, and above Arithmetick, and recount to a Lady her both inviſible and impoſſible Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they meet in the ſame point with a ſcarlet Tincture of Piety, degenerate into perfect Hypocriſie. Madam, I pretend to Valour and a generous heart: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when I was a Boy in long coats, I rode upon a Bear, as our honorable cuſtom is in <hi>Paris,</hi> led by the Bear-hood to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Door; and thence it came, as the ſpeech of the Vulgar goes, that I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be afraid afterwards of man or beaſt. And in <hi>Paris,</hi> the Captains of our Train'd Bands are for the greateſt part Taylors, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, as I am, not only becauſe they rode upon Bears when they were in Coats and bare behind, but alſo becauſe they are nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at their weapon, and to put them in mind of going through-ſtitch with their work when they fight: And yet, I confeſs to you, Madam, that when I am well bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a <hi>Spaniard</hi> or an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> I cry <hi>Mon dieu, Mon dieu:</hi> and this is Hypocriſie too, though of a lower Orb. We plead all with one mouth againſt the Inquiſition; but <hi>par ma Foy,</hi> we have a <hi>French</hi> Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Paris,</hi> otherwiſe call'd the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> which is not parallel'd by either <hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition: And is it not exalted and ſublimated Hypocriſie, when we bear a ſuperlative name near to him above the world, as if we were moſt abſtracted from the world; and yet we teach the world, and all the Phantaſmes and lying Legends of the world to all the world. Madam, I am old excellent in the practiſe of a ſingular vertue which the preciſe part of people call Lying: Indeed I can ſcarce tune my mouth to ſpeak Truth: And I can ſwear ſuch Oaths, as would bliſter an ordinary mans ears: I am very quick and pliable at ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and then I can ſalve it, daub it, and guild it over with a Lye: To tell all, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all my power: For the reſt, I reſt your <hi>Tres-humble</hi> and reſtleſs <hi>Serviteur,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Kickſhaw,</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</p>

Hereticks are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs, Iron-breaſted, Rock-hearted, and people of hardned and petrified Bowels: There is no ſeed, no footſtep of Mercy in then; only perhaps now and then certain arreptitious emications and Star-twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of natural, moral, and old-<hi>Roman</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. If any of theſe, walking in the painted Galleries of their Imagination, fancy they do works of mercy, when they do thus and thus becauſe others have done ſo and ſo before them, they miſcarry; For their Mercy is as their Belief, is beleper'd by it; and the ſtream cannot be cleaner, clearer, higher than the Fountain, or the Branch purer and more generous than the Root.

                     <p>The Jeſuits here have ſet me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Lock and Key, and curtain'd all the Windows. I have no benefit of Light, but in one corner, where a little Ray peeps in upon a Picture. And the Picture repreſents the <hi>Hollanders</hi> as having taken a Ship, wherein were many Jeſuits, and thrown
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98827:13"/>
them overboard into the Sea: but in vain, for the Jeſuits lie all upon the Surface of the water, with their faces looking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably towards Heaven, and cannot ſink, but are all ſuſtain'd by Miracle: It is ſtrange that the Jeſuits being men ſo weighty in worth, ſhould now be ſo light, and not worth their weight either in Gold or ought elſe. I hear likewiſe, that they uſe dark Chambers, and Pictures preſenting Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, to ſad and tragical ends: It is whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd by their own Pupils here. This my preſent Employment they call their <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe:</hi> And it was impos'd upon me in my entrance, to ſearch my Inwards whether I have a Call to be a Jeſuit or no. I do not like theſe quotidian and ubiquetary Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; nor this warping of divine things to ſelf-ends. Hypocriſie haunts me ſtill: The Picture, Image, or the Repreſentation in a Looking-glaſs, that ſhews a Face leſs than it is, may happily be like the Face it ſhews, and ſymmetrical with it; but the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, Image, or Picture that ſwels up the Face, and allows it greater, except it be wrough ſo for the ſuppliance of what is loſt by diſtance, attempts above it ſelf, is monſtr ous, and cannot be like its Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type; becauſe Proportion is retain'd in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations which are leſſer than the life, but in ſuch as are greater, the Compoſition is diſcompos'd, and the Proportion ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd. <stage>He opens the Lock.</stage>

                     <p>Father, I did not take up this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as thoſe who were born of Parents ſteering this way; and agreeably educated; who therefore ſuck ſo ſtrongly, that they draw bloud in place of Milk, and promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſwallow all, becauſe their Friends were all of the ſame Feather. I embraced it upon a pious and vertuous account. I may as well bring the Arctick and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick, the two Poles of the world together, as enforce my heart to cloſe with impudent Falſhood, with fallacy that is pellucid and tranſparent. You may drop this, if you pleaſe, into your own heart like <hi>Arabian</hi> Gumme, and let it congeal and ſtick there, that your Soul may be there entoom'd, as the Fly or Spider in the Gumme or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. My heart will not receive it: May that be alwaies deep-inlaid and enamel'd with known truth: I'le tell you, Father; I ſaw an Image the other day, that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd with a Proceſſion, to a better lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe it wrought infinite Miracles; and the Image was all over moſt miſerably worm-eaten. Me thinks the Power, if it be a good one, that works theſe wnoders with reflection upon the Image, ſhould alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the miraculous Image from Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and from the Common people of Creepers the worms.

The Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts have found by curious Inquiſition, that if a Pearl which is foul, be ſwallowed into the womb of a Dove, and remain there ſome while; the Dove will give it again moſt pure and orient: Every thing muſt be tried and examin'd, according to my Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon treaſur'd up from the School of <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in the womb of devout Simplicity, which womb will free it from ſpots, clouds, deformity.

Thus did the Devils Oracles deliver many ſound Truths, the better, under ſuch palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, to diſſeminate and publiſh their moſt unſound Errours: Thus doth a ſtink offend us more, when concomitant with ſome weak Perfume which it hath <hi>pro vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo,</hi> than if it ſingly ſets upon us; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume procuring for the ſtink, eaſier admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into our ſenſe: Thus Poyſons are moſt dangerous and irremediable, when joyned in commiſſion with a Cordial that is not able to reſiſt them; it ſerving to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them to the heart, and being unable to vanquiſh their malignity: Thus the old Fowlers deceived Pigeons by ſhewing an exoculated Pigeon leaping and dancing in a Net.</p>

                     <p>The Nightingale growing fat, cannot ſing: I have long faſted. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the multitude of Operations (be they of the ſame or a different nature) in which the Soul doth buſie her ſelf, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth each particular Operation with leſs obſequiouſneſs and ability, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſs perfectly. Becauſe the Soul being finite and limited, her active virtue is alſo limited and finite; and ſo fitting and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying her activity to divers operations, ſhe gives the cauſe that each participateth a leſs portion thereof. It is not within the Sphere of humane power, that one ſhould at the ſame very time, obſervingly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the Feature of a mans face, beheld with his eyes, and judiciouſly bend his Thoughts to the curious and bewitching Strains of Muſick intruding upon his Ears; nor in the ſame inſtant attentively diſcern the Differences and ſeveral Garbs of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Figure. Had I a hundred Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and as many Tongues, I have Matter wherewith to lade and load them. Man, there is yet <hi>Terra Incognita,</hi> a Land unknown to thee, with reſpect unto know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Religion. The truly knowing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98827:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people, whereſoever they are, are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He that thinks ſuch a People can fall, fears the ruine of the Firmament, and is more than ſomwhat like him, who-being <hi>Galens</hi> Patient, and very ſick, told him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in the morning how he did; that he had been reſtleſs and without ſleep all the nigh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>; heaving himſelf from ſide to ſide, and heavily groaning; and had been grievouſly troubled in ſeriouſly thinking, what ſhould become of him (ſick man) if <hi>Atlas,</hi> weary now at laſt, ſhould ſteal away his out-worn ſhoulder, and Heaven, with all the Larks in the Ayr, fall upon him ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weak in his Bed. Without Infallibility, there is no certainty, no ſecurity. And what are all Profeſſors, compar'd to us? They are deckt like heatheniſh <hi>Indians,</hi> with fine Feathers; filch't from Birds, that when they were alive, flew near Heaven; while theſe, becauſe their feathers are aſcititious, cannot fly, can ſcarcely creep. If they raiſe an old Truth, like the ſhape of a fair plant or flower in a Glaſs, they ſuddenly draw the flame or Candle away, and let it fall to dull Aſhes again. Other men are petty Chapmen, and Pedlers of Divinity: Man, if thou wilt know, know that I am the knowing man: And man, thou maieſt know it by this: of a ſimple and ignorant man, I am ſuddenly exalted above my ſelf by Rapture. Perſons ill-affected in their eyes, many times ſee two things, when but one preſents it ſelf: every man in their ſeeing, hath two heads, four eyes, two Mouths, two Bodies, four hands, as many feet; and is twice himſelf, and a double man. Man, thou maieſt think me double and deceitful, but the fault is in thy Eyes, not in me. <stage>He trembles again.</stage>

But, I pray, keep it as a Secret, and tell it not abroad: neither let it paſs into the cold ayr: We experimentally find in the world, that Princes have their Jayle; for Offenders, and their Bedlams for mad people: And I know, that—I dare better ſhew towards him with my hand, than name him here, is the greateſt of Princes; and that Hell is his Jayle.

Are all the people of <hi>England</hi> mad? Soft and fair. I Anſwer: No. For in a Bedlam-houſe, the mad people have their ſober Keepers, their wiſe Phyſitians, their civil Waiters and Servants; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thoſe, whoſe Office it is to whip them, and thereby to awake and recal their ſenſes; and one of the laſt, I hope I ſhall be.

                     <p>Father, <hi>tanquam in tabellâ,</hi> in brief. Firſt, you ſent your Letter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations by me, and it had certain pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Marks in the bottom, according to your private Book of Rules, Politick rules, printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and no where elſe, which I have now ſeen; and this was to ſignifie to the Jeſuits, that if I refuſed to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your Society, they might uſe me <hi>ad libitum,</hi> at their pleaſure. Secondly, You ſent Letters every Moneth to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledges at S. <hi>Omers,</hi> at <hi>Valladolid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> where I was, to be read in the hearing of all the Scholars; and theſe Letters recounted wondrous things as done in <hi>England,</hi> diſgraceful to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though conducing to the confirmation of the Scholars in their Judgments, which things were neither done, nor feaſible. The Buſineſs of <hi>Garnets</hi> Straw was meet Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the Painter afterwards diſcover'd his own Folly, and yours; and your different Pictures of the Straw (I have ſeen them) gave evidence againſt you. <hi>Fox,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the famous Martyrology, never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd his Head was an Urinal. The Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church-man of <hi>England,</hi> did not die a Papiſt. I could exaſperate your ears with a thouſand of theſe. Thirdly, I never yet ſaw a Jeſuit or other Prieſt, of whom I could honeſtly ſay, this is a juſt man, his Heart and his Tongue concur, Truth and his Tongue are Uniſon: They are Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks in Religion, and have Spawns of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and Equivocation in their Mouths: they religiouſly keep <hi>Matchavels</hi> Rule; Beſpatter thy Adverſary with all ſorts of Dirt and filth, <hi>aliquid for ſit àn adhaerebit;</hi> it is likely that ſomwhat of it will ſtick cloſe to him.

You both know, or have reaſon to know, that I know you both. Come, come, ſtand as far off as you can one from the other: Ile bring you together, I warrant you. Jeſuit, and Brother of the Separation: Firſt, Are

ye not both wild-fire-heated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of Government, if heteroclite from your Deſignes? This cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: the meridian Sun is not more viſible. Come both a little nearer, for this firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Again, you brother of the Separation, have not you kicked againſt lawfull Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, inſtigated by the Grounds and Reaſons of the Jeſuits, their Schoolmen, Controvertiſts, Caſuiſts; have you not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied your Motives and Arguments out of their Champions? do not I know you have? Neerer now on each ſide. Yet again. Do you not both in all Nations, where there is an overſwaying and prevalent party, conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, ſide, vote, and dance in the ſame Fairy Ring, againſt the party authorized by the ſwaying Power? Ye do, ye do: Nearer, nearer yet. I have brought you to half-way Tree on both ſides. Still on. <hi>Vox populi,</hi> the voice of the people who beſt know you, as with an irreſiſtible charm will bring you neerer on both quarters. Are not you nam'd the Puritanical Jeſuit, and you the Jeſuitical Puritan? Neerer again. I follow the chaſe. Are ye not both ſo fevere and rigid in your Directions, Inſtructions, Counſils, as if ye were both Enthuſiaſm'd with a ſingular ſpirit above all others? Now ye are within the ſtretch of arms. Do ye not both with the ſame quibble of cunning inſinuate into houſes by mens wives, and there Lord it over their Husbands and the whole Family? I muſt not exceed my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time, and ſpeak from the Center beyond the Periphery. Now come cloſe together, joyn hands, imbrace according to the Jeſuitical Hugg. Why now ye are friends. O let poor deluded <hi>England,</hi> be now aſham'd of what is paſt, be provident and circumſpect for hereafter. All was Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical: the Jeſuit as the evil <hi>Genius,</hi> was the true and only Malignant: In all the combination and complication of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-headed Factions, he had acceſs by him ſelf or his Agents to the chief Actours while he blew the coles, with <hi>Julian,</hi> at the Devil's Altar. And now ye are coupled Ile tell you a Story; it hath, <hi>Janus-</hi>like, two faces, as looking Romeward and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward. <hi>Rome</hi> was with Child, and ſhe brought forth her eldeſt Son, the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine;</hi> to him as the Heir ſhe gave her Lands: She remain'd free a while; at length was with child again, and brought into the light two children, the <hi>Dominican</hi> and the <hi>Franciſcan;</hi> to the firſt, having given away her Lands, ſhe gave certain Houſes and monies in a Penſionary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; to the other, having nothing left, the Wallet, and ſet him out of doors a beging. She ſtood clear again, till at laſt ſhe was mountain-big with child; She long'd, ſhe groan'd, ſhe drew her breath ſhort, ſhe made ſtore of outlandiſh faces: In the concluſion ſhe gave into the world a luſty Boy, who being newly born utter'd from behind the Midwifes lapfull, a ſign of good luck; this was the Jeſuit: His Mother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given away Lands, Houſes, Wallet, took him up, gave him a ſmart clap on the right buttock, and ſaid, My dearling, ſhift for thy ſelf; and he did ſo moſt accurately. Turn the ſtory hither: Our Mother here was with child, and with child, again, and again. I ſo much honour the firſt-born chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that I ſhall not name them in this Comical Air; the Presbyterian himſelf ſhall paſs by me, without a glance upon him: queſtionleſs he means well, though he deſerves not this Elogy from me, yet I am ſo ſick of the Jeſuit and Monk, that I muſt praiſe him. But Brother of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you were the laſt-born, have run with the Torrent, and ſhifted for your ſelf, to rejoyce over the Creature<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and therein you and the Jeſuit are uniform. This is all, I take my leave. <stage>Exit.</stage>

                     <p>O Torment! The pangs of Death cannot be more grievous: and my pangs are notoriouſly more grievous to me than the pangs of Death, becauſe mine are continual. The whole Fabrick of my body is ſo ſtifned and benum'd with cold, ſo bruis'd and ſor'd with the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the rocky ground, that I cannot uſe a limb without exceſſive pain, and ſhaking of the whole frame. They have detain'd me here in the Baſtille the ſpace of fifteen Weeks, without Bed, Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Cap, Waſtcoate, Shirt, or other Linnen, (the <hi>French,</hi> my Executioners, rob'd me of all,) without Chair, Stoole, Table, Fire, Candle, Water, Knife, Spoone; without any ſuccour for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of nature, further than the floor of this cloſe and dark Dungeon or Cave where I lye: and by a little peeping-hole I have diſcover'd a Sentinel continually ſtanding with his Musket, to receive me, if I ſhould appear in the leaſt part of me. Dare theſe bleſſed-nam'd <hi>Benedictines</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver profeſſe, that they are fleſh and blood? the wild <hi>Indian</hi> man-eaters are not more barbarous; nor the bruite beaſts of the wilderneſſe more ſavage. Can it now be denyed from the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of this cruelty, that their lives in their Monaſteries are abſolutely diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, when they endeavour by ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hew'd and <hi>Scythian</hi> means to foreſtall the diſcovery of them. It is likely they will pull to themſelves in the covering of their nakedneſſe other pretences, that as <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> the Emperor abuſed the veſtals, they may firſt render me diſhonourable, and then miſerable: But here, two things obtain no ſmall ſurpluſſage of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; two things which walk it and ſtalk it as open truths in <hi>England,</hi> though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction be much obſtreperous: The firſt, The people of this Gang, this ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed fang, are moſt horribly Cruel: The ſecond, <hi>Rome</hi> cannot ſtand without the prop of a Lye.

                     <p>Preciſely and nakedly, for the ſpeaking of naked Truth: There is an <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhop here in <hi>Paris,</hi> a man of ſublime power, but of a leaden heart: He privately profeſſes againſt the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the ſoul; and uſes, againſt all the Sallies of Nature, a Boy every night, (ſuch is the vile extravagancy of our Nation.) This I ſpake into the open aire: And though the Truth of it is as well and throughly known to me, as that I walke and talke, yea, although they thought ſo worthily of me here, as to ſend me their Embaſſadour to <hi>Naples,</hi> yet they impriſon'd me. The grand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of your Countrey is ſetled <hi>en ſu ſer y pueſto,</hi> (I doubt not but you underſtand Spaniſh;) or you had been ſent to the Inquiſition, and your body had made a Bone-fire there: I am a <hi>Roman</hi> born, and know the manner of it; your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes ſhould have been thrown into the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> to feed the Water-ſnakes.

are ſeparate from it, and united with Heaven as the beams with the Sun. I fancied, that as Stars which have the leaſt Circuit, are neareſt the Pole; ſo men who are leaſt perplexed with buſineſſe, are neareſt to Heaven, becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remove a thing from earth, but we muſt exalt it nearer to Heaven.</p>

                     <p>You have been much entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the love of them: but as buſineſſes commonly move now, it is a putrified courſe of life in many parts, and reſpects. A corrupted Monk is like the reflexion of the great Angel-Image from a Steeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top in <hi>Millan,</hi> which at one ſtroke, limb'd it ſelf on the Clouds in the Air, of themſelves prepar'd for ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and only amazed and amuzed the vulgar heads, who vainly took the vain reflexion of an Image on the Clouds, for a moſt heavenly Saint or Angel. But when the Monks come down out of the Clouds, we know them better, becauſe they are near to us: we never find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, men ſo paſſionate, ſo profane: beſides that they are commonly drunken Beaſts, and lazy louſie belly-gods; theſe their myſteries I inwardly know: in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Monaſteries they ſtudy Magical and Demoniacal Arts; they learn the Art of compounding Philters, and thereby draw Nobles to love them above their own children; they compoſe poiſons of all ſorts; they deſtroyed <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, Emperour, with a ſubtle and moſt ſacrilegious poiſon in a Church, and your King <hi>John</hi> in a Monaſtery; the Monk is the Jeſuit's great Grandfather; the Monks coin falſe money; they falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſtones of middle rank into Pearls, and Jewels; by the tranſmutation of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, they raiſe them into a kind of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſilver.</p>

The Writings are here drawn, and he is anſwerable to us, by the procuration of this good Boy, both in Religion, and all our other Deſires. We intend him for one of our Monaſteries abroad: that he, like the Eagle hovering over the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Corps, yeelded up and expoſed to the funeral Flames, may be elevated from the Earth towards Heaven, while his Eſtate periſhes from him under him. It will ſuit more analogically, according to Logick with us, than with him. Our Vocation is more high, our lives are more holy, our Perſons are ſacred. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we have reform'd his Soul; for the which, his Eſtate, though great, is but a ſmall paiment: If he were able to exonerate both the Indies into our laps, he could not require us worthily.

ſalute thee. Thy buildings are now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionſly beautifull, if my eyes may ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for thee. Here dwels Simplicity, here Juſtice is enthron'd. O People of <hi>England,</hi> learn your own Happineſſe, your earthly Happineſſe drops and diſtils from your own hands. Be obedient, and conform to the good and eaſie Laws here; and you comprize more than the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all the other Fortunate Ilands; <hi>Arabia</hi> the Happy is not ſo happy, and fragrant as your Countrey.

Where is it ſo beſides here? Now ye are in joynt again, ſtand <hi>Atlas-</hi>firm, bear up your little Heaven of quiet here: or as ye are now the moſt happy, ye will be otherwiſe the moſt deſpicable and moſt unhappy of all Nations. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſire a man has of ſelf-preſervation, like adverſe Wind and Tyde, lately caſt me back into <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monks there, the ſordid idle Monks, more than impal'd me in the Baſtille, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I threatned to impound them here, as detaining from me a fair Sum of my own Monys moſt due to me. And to guild, to varniſh, to burniſh this their unhew'd, ragged, and ragged Action, they plyde my ſtory with lies of Defence, lies of Offence, lies with heads, but not with feet, lies with feet, but not with heads; lies with neither head nor foot; lies whiſper'd, and loud lies. Oye Scholars of our moſt renowned Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, ſet bounds to your feet, and limits to your Thoughts: I was my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eldeſt Son, and Heir to a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Eſtate of Houſes and Lands; and I threw all behinde me, to be cheated, moſt religiouſly cheated by ſecular Prieſts, Jeſuites, Monks, Friers; but amongſt all theſe godly Cheaters, the Monk is the Grandee, the <hi>Pontifex maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> the firſt and Univerſal Biſhop. Two years he held me now faſt in Priſon, in a loathed Priſon: and after the Buſineſs was made publick here by my private Letters, clear'd me of the Priſon, but unwillingly, but conditionally that I ſhould be confin'd there all my life: I conſented in the lip: Afterwards plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that my Body was greatly diſorder'd in reſpect of health, deſir'd a few dayes wherein to phyſick it (I meant with a better Air;) and in that little Tract of Time wherein it was ſuppoſed I took Phyſick, haſted privately to <hi>Diep,</hi> a Port-Town in <hi>France,</hi> where I found ſixteen Engliſh Monks attending the Paſſage-Boat: they prevented my Paſſage with them, and poſted away Letters to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſolliciting that I ſhould be ſtopt; but the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>Diep</hi> paſt me over the night following. In all their Houſes in thoſe tranſmarine parts, there are none left but boyes and old Men; hither they are all come. The greateſt Crocodile was at firſt harbour'd in an Egge, which is <hi>Paulò majus anſerino,</hi> a little bigger than a Gooſe-egg. And yet, the Crocodile is a Devourer of Men: and when, being horrour-ſtruck, theſe cannot weep for themſelves, mockingly weeps over them; grows huge, and on to the laſt period of life; and is different, not a little from the Gooſe, in ſhape, ſubſtance, colour, manners; though they favour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Egg. No ſenſual Creature ſpreads to ſo vaſt a bigneſs, from ſo ſmall beginnings, as this Egg-Crocodile. In
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98827:27"/>
two years I had not the benefit of a freſh Shirt. I had preſerv'd ſome rich Goods from the ravenous Officers who took me: And <hi>John Baptiſta Palliot,</hi> the Preſident of <hi>Noury</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> my fellow-priſoner, who deſired and undertook to ſecure them for me at his own houſe, ſecur'd them there indeed, but from me, and for himſelf, he, being in account a perſon of Honour, and I indeed a wrongfully and poor impriſon'd ſtranger. Another French Priſoner wearied me oftentimes, with deſiring me that he might uſe my body Sodomitically. The Frenchmen ſay: <hi>Omnis Jeſuita aut Magus aut Sodomita,</hi> Every Jeſuite is a Magitian or a Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite: This I know not; the other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience brought home to me. Upon compoſed and moſt deliberate thoughts, I ſet up this reſolution like a Coloſſus: I will yield up my life on a Gallows here, before I will ſet my foot again where proud <hi>Rome</hi> does Miſtris it: becauſe her Vaſſals are more than heatheniſhly cruel, more unclean than Turks and Indians. <hi>London,</hi> I joyfully kiſs thy ground, which others kick and tread upon: allow me a Grave here: Thy air ſeems to me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd: and I am now, as it were, born again.</p>

The ſoul it ſelf is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from without by the preſentation of external and occaſional Objects; and from within by the Paſſions, and is driven every way by them, as the Waves by the Winds; indeed, primordially and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by love, the Amazon-Queen of the Paſſions; afterwards by her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Hope;</hi> yea, by <hi>Anger Love</hi>'s-Champion. And then the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are good or evill, as the objects are evil or good, concerning which theſe Paſſions are excited; and as the carriage of the Paſſions in their tendencies, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, (managed by a prudent and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ordination) or diſordinate: The Sea breaking its bounds, is boundleſs in miſchief. To wade nearer our affair: The beſt change of the ſoul, anſwerable to man as a reaſonable creature, and within the Dominions of nature; is, when the moral vertues in it, are directed and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Prudence, and every Action tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour'd by ſome vertue, becauſe the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are obedient to reaſon. Nature is higher perfected by degrees: but of that I will ſpeak in the Nunnery.</p>

I am Mathematically cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as the Schools ſpeak, that the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will follow; I am more than moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain, and almoſt certain by phyſical certitude; and I cannot but leap for joy, for joy that the tother foot will certainly follow. To Heaven, to Heaven, 'tis even ſo, a Maid to Heaven dos eaſily go, for joy what I ſay I ſcarcely know. I forget. Miſtris of my heart, give way to my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, I have given order to Father <hi>Robert</hi> to go to your Uncle in the diſguiſe of a Seaman; and to ſay that he ſaw you take Shipping at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and Saile under the Conduct of a good Wind for <hi>France:</hi> Otherwiſe, Sweetheart, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my boldneſſe, he will lay waite for you at the Port-Towns: when he ſhall believe, and is ſatisfied, that you are gone, and the ſearch is blown over, you ſhall away indeed with ſafety.</p>

                     <p>I have ſeen a Sight here, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not unuſual, yet ſtrange to me: a Mountebank in this blind and uncouth part of the Suburbs, upon a common Stall. I took him for a Ballad-ſinger, till I came neer him: but finding him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to be a Mountebank, I waited upon the ſequel. He had his paints, his white and red for women; his powders of all colours; his perfumes, mixt and ſimple; his ſalves for all fores and griefs; he could abate the Drunkards redneſſe, and fire in his face, and raiſe a pale co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to beauty, from within: he could awake Appetite, ſet a man to ſleep, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſe nature as he pleas'd: He could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a man or woman with new teeth, new eyes, new ears, new noſes, new arms, new legs: I expected when he would have ſaid, new Heads, new Hearts. If my Ears ſcout it rightly for my Soul, I heard him ſay, that he could reſtore a loſt Maiden-head. He ſpake contemptibly of drinking poiſons: that, ſaid he, the common Rabble and Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh of Mountebanks, the vile Offal of Quackſalvers can do. He ſuppled us with a Story of one <hi>Barthochabas</hi> an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Sedition amongſt the old Jews, who ſo medicin'd his mouth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd a device in it, that he ſeem'd to vomit fire; and he profes't upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a Gentleman, that he had the Receipt: He put on with another Example of a man at <hi>Millan</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> City, who waſhed his face and hands with ſcalding lead, as careleſly and as confidently, as a man waſheth his hands and face with ordinary water; having firſt waſhed them with an extraordinary, new-found, and hardening water of his own: And of this water he proteſted as he was an Artiſt, he had a great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. We had from him a whole fardle of ſuch ſtuff. To all People that bought of his Traſh to the value of Twelve-pence, he gave a printed Bill, deſigning the Place where he lies, and the manifold motions and out-walkings of his skill. I ſtood in the crowd while he ſtaid upon the Stall; and when he came down and leyel'd himſelf with the People, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that ſpeaking with ſeveral Perſons, he did inſinuate theſe or the like words; All men have a natural care of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but who regards his own Soul? If a ſimple Aſſe fals in the ſtreets, many wiſe men run to lift the ſimple Aſſe up; but if a Man's Heart or Soul lies wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the dirt, ſuch a Soul or Heart is not regarded; pray, come to my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: theſe words had their myſterious aim. Now this metaphyſical Doctor, this all-able Mountebank with all his packs, and his knacks, is the <hi>Benedictine-</hi>Jeſuite, whom I have us'd, and by whom I have been manifoldly abus'd. As I take it, he takes this way. The Baſtille has chang'd me, and I believe he knows me not. I'le toſſe a word or two with him as he paſſes.</p>

                     <p>Sir, you ſeem in the ſhell, in the face or fore-head, to be well affected towards us, or at leaſt leſs ill-affected, and leſs indiſpos'd to Goodneſs. I confeſs to you, as to a Friend, prompted by the Bird of good Omen within me, that I and my Brother there, have been eatechiz'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that we are <hi>Benedictine</hi> Prieſts. Sir, our Order is the moſt ancient, and moſt holy of all others: the Devil is troubled that we are ſtation'd ſo neer him: If you were here alone, the Devil would lie down, leave barking, and be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et as a Lamb, becauſe you are yet abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the lines of Communication with us.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
                     <p>I am as much Prieſt as they; for Prieſthood cannot be loſt, but they are ignorant of it, becauſe they have loſt my face out of their remembrance. In good time, Sir. But under favour, I have read in your Authors, that the occaſion other Orders roſe, was, becauſe the Monks were defective in that part, which the new ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Order moſt profeſt: as that the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi> roſe, becauſe the Monks were Kitchin-bound, and their mouths were ſtop'd, they became dumb and muzzl'd in publick; good men, they dealt out their time in eating, hunting both Hare and Fox, and purging their reins according to leaſe: The <hi>Franciſcans</hi> came, becauſe the Monks were proud; and the <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi> for the ſame reaſon, becauſe the Monks were fat and ſtately: the Jeſuites came ſhoving in at laſt, becauſe the Monks had long deſiſted from the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Children, and thereby ingaging rich Parents, and from the recovering of Nations, and thereby obliging the moſt rich Parent of all at <hi>Rome:</hi> and ſo in others. Whom did, or do the Jeſuites and they love, but in order to their own ends, and for gain-ſake? Who have been more ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous in all the wandrings of wickedneſs, than the Monks with their poatch'd Eyes in their Meditations? The worſt of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va-</hi>Jeſuites might better and more juſtly be canoniz'd after the Age is paſs'd wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he liv'd, than the beſt of Monks in theſe parts. And I have read in a learned Monk, that as Rivers after long running run ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and muddy, ſo the beſt things gather duſt, and contract corruption in length of Time. Your <hi>Pontifices maximi,</hi> grand Fathers at <hi>Rome,</hi> have commonly moſt excellent Reſolutions and Actions at their firſt entrance into their <hi>Iriſh-</hi>wooden Chair; but they ſoon Reed-like hold down their Heads: The <hi>Italians</hi> jeſt it

notably, though profanely. If you cenſure me, that I whip the Monks too hard, blame me, ſcourge me; but then, you muſt blame and ſcourge with me holy Writers in all Ages, the learned Angel of <hi>Hippo,</hi> divine <hi>Salvianus,</hi> our Engliſh <hi>Gildas,</hi> and a thouſand worthy Rabbies more.
