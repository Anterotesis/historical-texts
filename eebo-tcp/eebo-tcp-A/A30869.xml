            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Origine of Perfumes is as Ancient as the Creation of the World; when the whole Earth was a delicious Garden, exhaling the ſweeteſt Smells. Art that never Injures Nature, but rather improves it, in ſucceeding Times collected what that good Mother had ſcattered in ſeveral places to Compound agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mixtures of Sweets: After innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Obſervations upon repeated Experiments, this Art is brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der infallible Rules to its utmoſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; by help of ſuch Rules which I had learnt from the beſt Maſters, and made uſe of a long time, I have
<pb facs="tcp:54362:3"/>
collected the Secrets which I now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Publick.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe is not deſigned to inſtruct Artiſts, who have particular Rules of their own, which (though by different Methods) lead them to the ſame end, but compiled for the Publick Good, which with me is the beſt reaſon for doing it, and for which therefore I ſhall not ask their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p>Perſons of Quality and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will find here in a ſhort View, a Variety of Sweets for various Uſes, if they can afford themſelves leiſure enough to gather Flowers at their Country Seats, and make uſe of them for Perfumes, they may not only agreeably divert themſelves in the Operation, but likewiſe ſave the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of buying them at Extravagant Rates in Shops: The Fair Sex eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, whoſe natural Graces receive ſo Charming a Luſtre from Neatneſs, will find enough in this Treatiſe to gratifie their Curioſity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54362:3"/>
If any Difficulties ariſe, they are explained in my Advertiſements, I would not inſert them through the body of the Book, becauſe the Reader might more eaſily find them there, and not be puzzled in preparing my Receipts.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are read in the Holy Scriptures, will not diſapprove of my Deſign, if they conſider that there was in the Old Teſtament an Altar whereon they burnt nothing elſe but Perfumes; and that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly written in ſeveral places in the Bible, that God delighted in Sweet Smells. Scentings preſcrib'd, and ſo exactly obſerv'd in the ancient Law, are further Inſtances of the Antiquity and uſe of Perfumes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> had a great many Women who prepared Perfumes for his own uſe: The Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> who came ſo far to ſee that Wiſe King, preſented him with ſeveral Perfumes. Some of the Offerings made to our Saviour by the Wiſe Men were Perfumes;
<pb facs="tcp:54362:4"/>
and <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her love better to Jeſus Chriſt, than in waſhing his Feet with Sweet Oyntment.</p>
            <p>But to leave the Holy Hiſtory, and mention the Eſteen they are in our days, our preſent King has diverted himſelf very often in ſeeing Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> compoſe in his Cloſet ſeveral Sweets which His Majeſty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to wear about himſelf. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> whoſe Memory will be ever precious to <hi>France,</hi> pleaſed himſelf often in ſeeing Mr. <hi>Charles</hi> Scent Snuff, and make other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes which His Highneſs made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular uſe of. The Powder that we call <hi>a la Marechale</hi> took its name from my Lady <hi>Marechale d' Aumont,</hi> who delighted in preparing it. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever would imitate theſe great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and paſs the time away in making Perfumes, &amp;c. will find great aſſiſtance in this little Book, and I aſſure them they will ſucceed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly,
<pb facs="tcp:54362:4"/>
provided they follow my Directions, for there is not one Receipt in it which I have not tryed my ſelf with all the Succeſs imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

               <p>AMber being a very dear Drug,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>: is neceſſary for the Buyers to know it well; which will be very eaſie if you obſerve, that when Amber is ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or has loſt its vertue, it is full of little white holes: You muſt alſo take care that it ſhould have no ſmell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its nature. To make trial of its goodneſs, heat a Needle and prick the Amber with it; if the ſmoak is ſweet, the Amber is good. The ſame Rule may be obſerved for the Black Amber.</p>
               <p>Several Authors have written of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I need not be large upon it; it is commonly conjectured that it is formed at Sea, and is a kind of Froth toſſed by the Waves to the ſhore, and which after a while is hardned.</p>

               <p>MUSK is an Animal found in hot Countries, who is hunted till quite weary, and ſo is taken alive; being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken they prick him in ſeveral parts of his Body with a ſharp Needle poyſoned at the point; the Venom of the Needle hinders the Blood from coming out; on the contrary in every pricked place riſes a Bladder of Blood; and that the Blood ſhould not return into the Body, they ſplit the Belly of the Beaſt, and draw the ſmalleſt Guts out of it, with which they tye the Bladders of Blood; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they keep them in the Sun till the Blood is coagulated; then they cut off all the Bladders, which are called Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Musk; and the true Musk is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Blood which is in them, as I ſaid before. The Bladders are not the Kidneys of the Musk, nor the Kidneys of a Pole-Cat, as many ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, but the Bags of Blood made as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The Kidneys of Pole-Cats are good for nothing, they have indeed a Smell, but weak and uſeleſs: And as for the Musk, if it be good, it muſt break eaſily
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54362:11"/>
with your Fingers like dry Blood, which is not hard however, for when it is too hard and too dry, it is a certain ſign that it is too old, and conſequently has loſt its Vertue, and is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>To preſerve it, you muſt keep it cloſe in a leaden Box, which Box ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in two or three other leaden Boxes to keep it freſh and good.</p>

When it is too old, it looks brown and is not good; it muſt be of a yellow golden Colour, and of a ſtrong and yet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Smell to be good. But above all,

The Flower will turn into Dung, and render the Starch damp, and turn into little lumps, and will ſmell muſty; which may be avoided if you obſerve the Rules I give in its proper place. However, if it happen that the Powder ſhould be ſpoiled, you muſt ſpeedily uſe this Remedy.

You ought to know, that all ſorts of Flowers are not capable to communicate their Smell to the Powder, Orange-flowers only; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Roſes, Musk Roſes, Janquils and Jaſmin are of that nature; other Flowers have a Smell too weak; <hi>Tuberoſe</hi> ſeems to have a ſtrong Smell, but its quality is not proper, and is uſeleſs to Perfume Powder.</p>

               <p>THE Eſſences of Flowers which we uſe for Hair are not true Eſſences, and we call them Eſſences, becauſe they are prepared with Oyl which takes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the Odour of Flowers, and only
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54362:16"/>
to diſtinguiſh them from the common Oyl. The common Oyls are the Oyl of Sweet Lemons, Olive-oyl perfumed with Flowers, which we make uſe of for Perriwigs. But the Oyl called <hi>Ben,</hi> whoſe figure is triangular, and whoſe Kernel renders an Oyl ſo fine, that it has no manner of Smell; having no Smell at all of it ſelf, it takes the Smell extreamly well of the Flowers you mix with it, even of the moſt ſweet and weak Smell, and ſo naturally, that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Smell of the Flower, and that of the Oyl: Provided you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it well, you'll ſee in its place how to Perfume them.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak now of the Natural Eſſences, They are true Eſſences, becauſe they come from the Flower or the Fruit they have the name of. Natural Eſſences are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Eſſence of <hi>Neroli,</hi> called otherwiſe the Quinteſcence of Orange-flowers; the Eſſence of <hi>Cedra,</hi> called <hi>Bergamotte;</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Citron; Eſſence of Orange ſtrong or ſmall: The Eſſence of <hi>Neroli</hi> is drawn from the Water of Orange-flowers, and is made of the Fruit which is in the Flower: The Eſſence of <hi>Cedra</hi> is produced of the drops you ſqueeze out

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54362:17"/>
only obſerve, that if you make it in a cloſe Copper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pot, it will be thick and muddy; but if you diſtil it in an Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick it is clear like Rock-water, though it has the ſame Smell as the other.</p>

               <p>Concerning Waters made of Flowers: There is only Orange flowers and Roſes you can make Water of, all other ſorts are adulterated. Several have tried to make Jaſmin-water, but could not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; the reaſon why is eaſie to be found, A Flower to make Water of muſt have a good Body or Subſtance; elſe it muſt be a Flower of an Aromatical Tree, as Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary or Myrrh, whoſe Leaves you may diſtil, becauſe they have a ſtrong Smell.</p>
               <p>As for Example, Take Orange flowers or Roſes, and rub your Hands with them, and they'll ſmell ſtronger than before: But on the contrary, If you do the ſame with Jaſmin or Tuberoſe, they will be

ſo far from communicating their Smell, that they'll be reduced into Dung, and will ſtink. By this you may judge, that though ſome pretend to ſell Water made out of Carnations, there is no ſuch thing, becauſe that Flower has not ſtrength enough to produce any; but becauſe it ſmells much like Cloves, the Water made out of them, is ſold for the Water of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>

               <p>IT is eaſie to draw Eſſences out of all manner of Flowers though they are of different ſorts, for if you can make of one, you may make of all others. Here is a general Receipt for all the Flowers which have any Smell.</p>
               <p>Take a Deal Box of what bigneſs you pleaſe, Tin it within leaſt the Wood ſhould ſpoil the Smell of the Flowers, and ſoak up the Eſſence which drops in. Take wooden Frames ſo made, that they may go in the Box exactly, they muſt be two Inches thick, and round about full of Wire Pins.</p>
               <p>You muſt alſo have as many Cloths as Frames, theſe Cloths muſt be a little big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the Frames, that you may faſten them round the Frames and ſtretch them; by this Direction it is eaſie to Proportion the Cloths to the Frames, and the Frames to the Box.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:54362:31"/>
The Cloths muſt be of Cotton, and well waſht in good Lye, they muſt be waſht again in fair Water, then be well dryed.</p>
               <p>Dip your Cloths in Ben Oyl, and let them ſoak up all the Oyl they can; ſqueeze them a little, then ſtretch them over your Frames; lay the firſt Frame in the bottom of the Box with Jaſmin or Orange-flowers, ſtrew them even upon the Cloth, and lay another Frame over, continue ſo doing till you have laid in all your Frames, or till your Box be full; the Frames muſt be two Fingers thick, that the Flowers laid between two Frames be not ſqueezed at all, and by that means every Cloth will be full of Flowers over and under. Leave your Flowers in the Frames twelve hours, from Morning till Night, put freſh ones often, continue ſo doing for ſome days, till you think the Smell is ſtrong enough.</p>
               <p>Then take your Cloths off your Frames, fold them, role them, and tye them well with Pack-thread, that they are not looſe, and preſs them in a Preſs to draw Oyl out of them, and 'tis the Eſſence of Flowers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:54362:32"/>
Obſerve that the Preſs muſt be Tinned over, leaſt the Wood ſoak the Eſſence Put under the Preſs Veſſels very clean to receive the Eſſence, then fill Glaſs-bottle with it.</p>
               <p>Obſerve alſo that you cannot make it a Box but Eſſence of one ſort of Flower at a time, for the Smell of one will ſpoi the other, and the Cloths which ſerved to draw one Eſſence, cannot ſerve for another, except you waſh them as before and dry them.</p>

They are extraordinary good to waſh Hands; beat them only in a Mortar, ſift them through a Sieve, and rub your Hands with them in a Baſon of warm Water; you may mix Iris Powder with it if you will.

               <head>Eſſence of Neroly.</head>
               <p>THE Eſſence of Neroly comes out of the Fruit which is in the Orange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower: You can draw but very little of that Eſſence, a great quantity of Water can make but an Ounce. The way how to make it up is thus, When the Orange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water is diſtilling, let it drop in a Bottle long, narrow-necked, and big-belly'd, when the Bottle is full of Water, let it ſtand and ſtop it; and as the Eſſence is lighter, it will certainly ſwim over the Water, ſo riſing to the Extremity of the neck of the Bottle, you may eaſily pour it in another Glaſs; it is Green at firſt, but being kept a while it will turn Red.</p>
               <p>As it is impoſſible to pour that Eſſence without ſome Water with it, to ſeparate them, put the Eſſence and the Water mixt with it in a Viol, ſtop the neck with your Thumb, and turn the Glaſs downwards; the Eſſence being light will come to the top, then take away your Thumb a little to let the Water out gently, all the Water being out, ſtop the

The Sieve you make uſe of, muſt be of Cloth pretty thin, to let the biggeſt Grains of your Snuff paſs through; you muſt Sift preſently what you beat; for if you beat it too long, you'll reduce to Duſt what is in Grains; the whole being in Powder, waſh it after this manner.</p>

               <p>TAke a Bucket, or another Veſſel alike, bigger then it need to contain the Snuff you will cleanſe; the Bucket muſt have a ſtop to let the Water out when you will; line your Veſſel within in the bottom, and round about the ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with a Napkin of very ſtrong and thick Cloath, leſt the Snuff ſhould paſs through. Put your Snuff in the Veſſel,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54362:66"/>
with Water enough to dip it well; ſtir it in the Water, and let it ſoak till the next day; then pour the Water out, and ſqueeze it as much as you can out of the Cloath; pour in it more freſh Water, and waſh your Snuff again, and let it ſoak as before; do ſo at leaſt two or three times at once. This being done, you'll ſqueeze at laſt your Snuff as much as you can; then get ſome Ozier hurdles, covered with ſtrong and thick Cloth, and dry over them your Snuff in the Sun; don't fail to ſtir it every minute, to have it dry all over; when it is very dry, put it in your Bucket again, with a good quantity of ſweet Perfum'd Water, of what ſort you like beſt, Roſes, Angel, or Orange-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-water are the beſt for Snuff: Let it be in that Water till the next day, then take it out, ſqueeze it gently, and let it dry again upon your hurdles, ſtirring it very carefully while it is a drying; being dry, pour over more of the ſame Water again, making it in a kind of a Paſte; let it be dry once more; being thus dryed and cleanſed, it will eaſily take all manner of Smells of Flowers.</p>
               <p>This way to cleanſe Snuff is the beſt; for the Snuff will the better take the ſmell you will give it; it is true, you cannot

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54362:68"/>
by that means the Snuff takes naturally the Smell of the Flowers, becauſe the ſame Smell is not corrupted or alter'd by the Snuff.

pour over it half an Ounce of Eſſence of Orange-flower-water, mixing it ſtill with the Peſtle, then fill up the Mortar with your Snuff, to mix the better the Eſſence: Take the Snuff out of the Mortar again, and mix it well with the other that was left, and your Snuff is done. It will be of a very ſweet and laſting Smell; and though your Eſſence is very oily, your Snuff will not be ſo, nor the worſe, if you do not put more than I preſcribe.</p>
               <p>If the Snuff is perfumed with Jaſmin-flowers, make uſe of Eſſence of the ſame Flowers, and ſo of other Flowers. All ſorts of Snuff may be perfumed the ſame way.</p>
