            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in his loweſt ebbe of ſorrow is the Childe of God, as well as when hee is in the greateſt flow of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4182:7"/>
comfort: onely the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe darts not the Beames of his Love ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and he can ſhew no more than God gives him. When God hides his face, needs muſt Man languiſh: His withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are our miſeries: His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence our aſſured joy. Sin may caſt the Good man in a trance, it cannot ſlay him: it may bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his heat for a time, it cannot extinguiſh it: It may make him in the Waine, it cannot change his Beeing: it may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, it ſhal not condemn him. Though God deprive him of his preſence for a time, he will one day re-inlighten him, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh him, and crowne him for Ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:4182:7"/>HEe that when hee ſhould not, ſpends too much, ſhall, when he would not, have too little to ſpend. <hi>Diogenes</hi> wittily asked a half peny of the Thrifty man, and a pound of the Prodigall: becauſe the firſt, he ſaid, might give him often; but the other, ere long would have none to give. As to be too neere, having enough, is ſordid baſeneſſe; ſo to ſpend ſuperfluouſly, though we have abundance, is one of Follies deepeſt over-ſights. There is better uſe to be made of our Talents, than to caſt them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in waſte; God gives them not to ſpend vainely, but to imploy profitably.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:4182:8"/>A Full delight in earthly things, argues a neglect of heavenly. Though the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, profits, and honours of this life may ſometimes ſhuffle a Chriſtian out of his uſuall courſe; yet like the Needle in a Dyall, remooved from his point, he wavers up and downe in trouble, runnes to and fro like Quick-ſilver, and is never quiet, till hee returnes to his wonted life and inward happi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe: there he ſets downe his reſt, in a ſweet unperceived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward content; which, though unſeene to others, he eſteemes more, than all that the world calls by the name of felicitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:4182:8"/>PRide and Avarice uſually attend great Fortunes: 'tis juſtly matter of amazement, for a man to grow rich, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a minde unalter'd; yet are not all men changed alike, though all in ſomething admit variation. The ſame Spider kills the man, that cures the Ape. High Fortunes are the way to high Mindes: Pride is uſually the Child of Riches. Contempt too often ſits in the Seat with Honour, cauſing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant ſpirits to contemne and ſcorne thoſe, which but of late they thought as worthy as themſelves, or better. And of all Vices, nothing doth ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe a man as Avarice; it makes a Maſter ſlave to his ſervant,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4182:9"/>
drudge to his ſlave; putting him under all, whom God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced over all. Miſerable is the man that ſo cares for Riches, as if they were his owne, and yet ſo uſes them as if they were anothers: that when hee may bee happie in ſpending them, will be miſerable in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them; and had rather, dying, leave wealth to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, than living, relieve his friends. Doubtleſſe, true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes eſteemes nothing more ſordid, than for a mans minde to be his Monyes mercenarie.</p>
            <p>WHile bloud is in our veines, ſinne will be in our nature: Our corruptions are diſeaſes incurable; while
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4182:9"/>
wee live, they will breake out upon us; wee may correct them, wee cannot deſtroy them. They are like the feathers in a Fowle, cut them, breake them out, yet will they come againe: onely kill the Bird, and they will grow no more. A weake Chriſtians life is almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a viciſſitude of ſinne; he ſinnes firſt, and after laments his folly: Like a negligent Schoole-boy, hee diſpleaſeth his Maſter, and then beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his remiſſion with teares. Since wee cannot avoid ſinne, wee ſhould learne to lament it: true ſorrow for ſinne, is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly darke Entry that leades the way to the faire Court of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:4182:10"/>THere are no familiars ſo infectious, as the angry Man and the Drunkard: Anger is the fever of the Soule, which makes the tongue talke idle; it puts a man into a tumult, that hee cannot heare what counſell ſpeakes: 'tis a raging Sea, a troubled water, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wholeſome for the uſe of any. Which he well knew, that adviſed us, Not to make friendſhip with an angry man. The Drunkard hath no memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie at all, Exceſſe hath utterly conſum'd it; ſo that friends and foes, familiars and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, are for the preſent of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall eſteeme. Hee forgetfully ſpeakes that in his Cups, which if he were ſober, ſhould be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4182:10"/>
in ſilence: firſt he ſpeakes he knowes not what, and after remembers not what he ſpake; his minde and his ſtomacke are alike, neither can retaine what they receive. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever friend wee make choiſe of, ſhould be ſure to have theſe two properties, Mildneſſe and Temperance; otherwiſe, 'tis better to want companions, than be annoyed with a mad man or a foole.</p>
            <p>NOthing makes us more wretched, than our owne uncontrouled Wills: A looſe Will fulfilled, is the way to worke out a woe; for, beſides the folly in beginning wrong, the greateſt danger is in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4182:11"/>
like a Bowle running downe, which is ever moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, when it growes neere its Centre and period of aime. Mans Will, without diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is like a blind Horſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Bridle, that ſhould guide him aright: hee may goe faſt, but runnes to his owne over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw; and while hee mends his pace, hee haſtens his owne miſchiefe: when the reines are given too looſely, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons runne wildly on, without a guide, to ruine. It ſhould be our vigilance, to curbe deſires betimes, that ſo they may not wander beyond moderation; our owne Will being a blinde Conductor: good Precepts to an ingenious Nature, are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4182:11"/>
Bitts that reſtraine, and hurt not.</p>
            <p>AN Eternall Kingdome is often loſt, for the gaine of toyes and vanities: Who is there, that hazards not his ſoule for the pleaſures or profits of ſinne; which when they have, what have they got, but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and vexations? The wealthie man is like a Pouder-Maſter, who hath proviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Enemie, but is ever in danger to be blowne up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And as for the beſt of Earthly pleaſures, they are farre ſweeter in the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than in the enjoyment; the moſt excellent, wee ſhall finde but lame, and halting. It is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4182:12"/>
great vanitie, to caſt away our Soules on ſuch tranſitorie Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, which when wee have, wee are neither ſure to enjoy, nor to finde commodious.</p>
            <p>HE that reacheth promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without Gods calling him, may flouriſh a while, but cannot thrive: He that is moſt fit for a place of note, ſeldome ſeekes it ſo much, as hee is ſought to for it; whereas ever the Bramble, that is low and worthleſſe, cryes out aloud, Make me a King. Many would be Magiſtrates, that know not how to be men: but the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding man knowes, that 'tis better to live in the Valley, where the times tempeſts blow
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4182:12"/>
over him, than to be ſeated on a Mountaine top, where every blaſt threatens both his ruine and fall. Howſoever others meaſure him, hee knowes his owne height, and will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed it. It is better live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, though meanely, than by unlawfull practiſes to uſurpe a Crowne.</p>
            <p>GReat is the wiſdome and goodneſſe of God, in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from evill men and ſpirits thoſe meanes &amp; ſeaſons, which taken, might proove moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to his Owne: wee had beene oftner foiled, if Satan could have knowne our hearts. Sometimes we lye open to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills; and 'tis our great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4182:13"/>
that H<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ely knowes it, that in ſtead of tempting, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties us: And how juſt is it with God, that thoſe that ſeeke miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to others, finde it to themſelves; and even whileſt they are ſpreading of Nets, are enſnared; their deliberate plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of evill, being ſurprized with a ſudden judgement.</p>
            <p>EVery gracious heart is in ſome meaſure ſcrupulous, and findes more ſafetie in feare than in preſumption: For hee whoſe ſtrictneſſe commands a reſtraint from things unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſurely dares much leſſe take free ſcope to evill; and by how much that ſtate is better, where nothing, than where all

things are allowed, by ſo much is the ſtrict and timorous bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the lawleſſe Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. There is hopes of that man who is ſcrupulous of his wayes, while he that makes no bones of his actions, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly hopeleſſe.</p>
            <p>OF all moral vertues Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is moſt beautifull, ſhe both ſhunnes Honour, and yet is the way to it: ſhe rocks De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate aſleepe, and keepes Peace waking, yet doth foſter and cheriſh her. It is a vaine thing to continue in ſtrife: hee that lives moſt quiet, lives moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from death and danger. 'Tis better be accounted too humble, than eſteemed a little

proud: The pureſt gold is moſt ductible; 'tis commonly a good blade that bends well.</p>
            <p>THe Winter is far harder to the Graſhopper than the Piſmire, who before having ſtored her Garner, is now able to withſtand a famine. When a miſhap comes ſuddenly and unlooked for, it diſtracteth the minde, and ſcares both the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and affections from their due conſultation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie: whereas an evill fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene is halfe cured, becauſe it giveth warning to provide for danger.</p>
            <p>IF there be any Nectar in this life, 'tis in the ſorrowes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4182:14"/>
we endure for goodneſſe: for they are but for a time, tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and momentany. The Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſhall not live alwayes under the tyrannie of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or the travells of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. That God we fight for is able enough to vindicate all our wrongs; and the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant our ſorrowes are here, the more plentifull ſhall our joyes be hereafter; our teares ſhall return in ſmiles, our wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings in a ſtream of pleaſures. God doth not recompence with a niggardly hand, we ſhall finde our joyes as an overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſea, and our glory beyond thought exuberant. Death ſhal be our happieſt day, and as a Bridge from woe to glory:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4182:15"/>
though it be the wicked mans ſhipwrack, it is the good mans putting into harbour, where ſtriking ſailes and caſting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, hee returnes his lading with advantage to the Owner, namely his ſoule to God, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Bulke ſtill moored in the haven, who is unrigged on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be new built againe, and fitted for an eternall voyage.</p>
            <p>GOod parts ill employed are weapons, that beeing meant for our defence, wee madly turne their edges, and wound our ſelves: they may make us faire in ſhew, but in ſubſtance more polluted: they are but as a ſaddle of gold to the back of a galld horſe, adorn
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4182:15"/>
us they may, better us they cannot; Grace onely can make a man truly happy, what ſhee affordeth can content ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and eaſily furniſh the vaſt rooms of the mind. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her all are nothing; with her even the ſmalleſt is true ſufficiencie. We ſhould never think our ſelves the neerer hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for poſſeſſing much on earth: a weake houſe with an heavy roofe is in moſt danger. He that gets heaven hath plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough, though the earth ſcorn to allow him any thing: hee that failes of that, is truely miſerable, though ſhee give him all ſhee hath; for it is a poore reliefe in miſery, to bee only thought well of by thoſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4182:16"/>
that cannot helpe us. Our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gifts may winne us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe with men; but inward grace wanting, wee ſhall never gaine approbation with God.</p>
            <p>WE are not rich or poore by what wee poſſeſſe, but by what we deſire: for hee is not rich that hath much, but he that hath enough; nor is he poore that hath little, but hee that wants more. If God make us rich by ſtore, wee ſhould not impoveriſh our ſelves by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe: but if hee make us poore by want, wee ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich our ſelves by content.</p>
            <p>HE ne're was ſo good as hee ſhould be, that doth not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4182:16"/>
ſtrive to be better than hee is; neither will he ever be better than hee is, that doth not feare to be worſe than hee was: For it is the greateſt of all ſinnes, alway to continue in ſinne; and where the Cuſtome of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning waxeth greater, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for ſinne growes the leſſe. It is eaſier to quench a ſparke, than a fire; and ſafer to breake the Cockatrices egge, than to kill the Serpent.</p>
            <p>IT is a competent eſtate one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that yeelds the quiet of content: Abundance, is a trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble; want, a miſerie; baſeneſſe, a ſcorne; advancements, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; diſgrace, odious. Wee ſhould not climbe, leſt we fall;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4182:17"/>
nor lye on the ground, leſt wee are trod on; wee are ſafeſt, while our legges beare us. It is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to deſire either to freeze, or burne; a competent heat is moſt healthfull for our bodies.</p>
            <p>REſolution without Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a ſloathfull folly; Action without Reſolution, is a fooliſh raſhneſſe: firſt, know what's good to be done; then doe that good, being knowne. If fore-caſt be not better than labour, yet labour is not good without fore-caſt: our actions ſhould not be done without, nor againſt knowledge.</p>
            <p>NAture hath ſent us abroad into the world, and wee are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4182:17"/>
every day travelling home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: if wee meet with ſtore of miſeries in our way, diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould teach us a religious haſte in our journey: and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with pleaſures, they ſhould pleaſure us onely, by putting us in minde of our celeſtiall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures at home; which ſhould teach us to ſcorne theſe, as worſe than trifles. A pleaſant journey is deare bought, with the loſſe of home; and a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome life is oftner a bleſſing than a Curſe: wee may as well die of ſurfet, as of hunger.</p>
            <p>EAch Night is but the paſt dayes Funerall, and the Morning his Reſurrection; Why then ſhould our Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4182:18"/>
ſleepe be other than our ſleepe at night? Why ſhould we not as well wake to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, as in the Morning? Death rather borrowes our life of us, than robbes us of it; and the glory of the Sunne findes a Reſurrection, why not the Sonnes of Glory? Since a dead man may live againe, we ſhould not ſo much looke for an end of our lives, as wait for the comming of our change.</p>
            <p>COntention is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, eſpecially with great Ones; as we may be too ſtrong for the weaker, ſo we muſt be too weake for the ſtronger: we cannot ſo eaſily vanquiſh our Inferiors, but our Superiors
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4182:18"/>
may as eaſily conquer us. We ſhould do much to be at peace with all men; but ſuffer much ere we contend with a Mighty man.</p>
            <p>THere is no heart of fleſh that at ſome time or other relents not: neither flint nor marble but in ſome weather will ſtand on drops. Good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions barely better not the man; the praiſe and benefit of thoſe guſts are not in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, but in the retention. A good heart is eaſily ſtaied from ſinning, and is glad when it finds occaſion to be croſt in ill purpoſes: thoſe ſecret checkes that are raiſed within it ſelf, do readily conſpire with all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4182:19"/>
retentives; it never yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a wicked motion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much reluctation, &amp; when it is overcome it is but with a halfe conſent. Whereas obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinners, by reaſon of their full delight in evill, and having already in conceit ſwallowed the pleaſures of ſinne, abide no reſiſtance, but keep a headlong courſe in ſpight of oppoſition, not weighing how neere their jollitie is to perdition. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is but juſt with God, that they who live without grace, ſhould die without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>IT is no meaſuring of men by the depth of purſe, by outward proſperitie; for even
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4182:19"/>
the beſt deſervings may want temporal rewards. Servants are oftentimes ſet on horſebacke, while Princes go on foot. Shall we contemne his neceſſity, who perhaps is ſo much more rich in grace, as he is poor in eſtate? Neither doth violence or caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie more impoveriſh a man, than his poverty ſomtimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth him. He whoſe wilfull folly hath made him miſerable, is juſtly rewarded with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; but hee that ſuffers for good, deſerves ſo much the more honor from others, as his diſtreſſe is more.</p>
            <p>MAny ſpeake fair that mean ill: but when the mouth ſpeakes foule, it argues a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4182:20"/>
heart. Though with Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his verball Benefactors we ſay, <hi>Depart in peace, fill your bellies;</hi> we ſhall anſwer for hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall uncharitableneſſe: but if we revile and curſe thoſe needy ſoules we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we ſhall give a more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full account of ſavage cruelty, in trampling on thoſe whom God hath humbled. If not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with good works be juſtly puniſhable, what torment is there for thoſe that wound with evill?</p>
            <p>IT is ill hurting the children of God; for though he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them not to ſinne in reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, yet hee ſuffers not their adverſaries to ſin unrevenged.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4182:20"/>
He that ſaith, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will repay,</hi> repayes oftentimes when wee have forgiven, when we have forgotten, and calls to reckoning after our diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Wherfore it is dangerous offending the meaneſt ſervant of Him, whoſe diſpleaſure and revenge is everlaſting.</p>
            <p>THat God whoſe the earth is, makes roome for His every where, and oftentimes provides for them a forreine Home more kindely than the Native. It is no matter for the change of our Soile, ſo wee change not our God: if wee can every where acknowledge him, He will no where be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:4182:21"/>THoſe who cannot fear for love, may chance to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for feare. And how much better is awe than terror? pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention than confuſion? De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is never neerer than when ſecurity hath caſt away feare. There is nothing more lamentable than to ſee a man laugh when hee ſhould feare: God ſhall laugh when ſuch a ones feare commeth: for as in mercy he forgets not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change our ſorrowes with joy, ſo neither doth he the joyes of the wicked with ſorrow. 'Tis an unreaſonable inequalitie to hope to finde God at our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, when we refuſe to bee at his; or to looke that he ſhould regard our voice in trouble,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4182:21"/>
when we would not regard his in peace.</p>
            <p>CVſtome makes Sin ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, that the horror of it by ſome is turned into plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: To make a right uſe of Gods judgements upon others, is to beare them in our ſelves, and finding our ſins at the leaſt equall, to tremble at the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the ſame deſerved puniſhments. God intends not onely revenge, but reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in his execution: as good Princes, who regard not ſo much the ſmart of the evil paſt, as the prevention of the future; which is never attained but when we make application of Gods hand, and draw common
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4182:22"/>
cauſes out of his particular proceedings.</p>
            <p>THe beſt intent cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, much leſſe warrant us in unlawfull actions: What we doe in faith it pleaſeth our God to winke at, and pitty our weakneſſes: but if we dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him with the well-meant ſervices of our owne making, we runne to his indignation: for Gods buſines muſt be done after his owne formes, which if our beſt intentions alter, we preſume. There is nothing more dangerous than to be our owne carvers in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It is better be too fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than too forward, in thoſe things which doe immediately
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4182:22"/>
concerne God. As it is not good to refraine from holy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, ſo 'tis worſe to doe them ill: Awfulneſſe is a ſafe interpreter of his ſecret acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and a wiſe guide of ours.</p>
            <p>THe firſt piece of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to God for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is the acknowledgement of our ſinnes: he can doe little, that in a juſt offence cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelfe. If we cannot be ſo good as wee would, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we ſhould do God ſo much right, as to ſay how evil we are. It is ſtrange to ſee, how eaſily ſinne gets into the heart, and how hardly out of the mouth! Is it becauſe Sinne, like to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, where it hath got poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4182:23"/>
is deſirous to hold it, and knowes it is fully ejected by a free confeſſion? or becauſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a guiltineſſe of deformity, it hides it ſelfe in the breſt where it is once entertained, and hates the light? or becauſe the tongue is ſo fee'd with ſelf-love, that it is loth to be drawn to any verdict againſt the heart or hands? Or is it out of an idle miſpriſion of ſhame, which whileſt it ſhould be placed in offending, is miſ-placed in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing our offence? How ever, ſure it is that God hath need even of racks to draw out Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; for ſcarſe in death it ſelfe are we wrought to a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of our errors. O Lord, ſince wee have ſinned, why
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4182:23"/>
ſhould we be niggardly of that action, wherein we may at once give glory unto Thee, &amp; reliefe to our ſoules? Whatſoever the ſore be, never any Soule truely applied this remedy and died: never any Soule eſcaped death that applied it not.</p>
            <p>TO know evill by others and not ſpeake it, is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſcretion: to ſpeak evill of others and not know it, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes diſhoneſty: he may bee evill himſelfe that ſpeaks good of others upon knowledge: but he can never be good himſelfe, that ſpeakes evill of others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuſpition. To ſpeake all we know ſhewes too much folly: to ſpeake more than wee know
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4182:24"/>
ſhewes too little honeſtie. He that ſpends all that is his owne, is an unthriftie Prodigall: but he that ſpends more than his owne, is a diſhoneſt Vnthrift. Wee may ſometimes know what wee will not utter, but ſhould never utter what wee doe not know.</p>
            <p>HEaven being our Home, and Chriſt our Way, wee ſhould learne to know our Way, ere wee haſte to travell to our Home. He that runnes haſtily in a Way he knowes not, may come ſpeedily to a Home he loves not. Seeing Chriſt is our Way, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven our Home, wee ſhould rather chearefully endure a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4182:24"/>
painefull Walke, than ſadly want a perfect Reſt.</p>
            <p>AS it is not againſt reaſon to be paſſionate, ſo wee ſhould not be paſſionate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon: as wee ſhould both grieve and joy, if we have reaſon for it, ſo we ſhould not joy nor grieve above reaſon; but ſo joy at our good, as not to take evill by our joy; ſo grieve at any evill, as not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the evill by our griefe.</p>
            <p>THe Widowes Mite was of more worth than the Riches of ſuperfluitie: Hee gives not beſt, that gives moſt; but he gives moſt, that gives beſt. If we cannot give boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4182:25"/>
yet we ſhould give free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and what wee want in our hand, ſupply by our heart. He gives well, that gives willingly.</p>
            <p>HE that contemnes a ſmall fault, commits a great one. Many drops make a ſhower; and what difference is it, to be wet either in the Raine, or in the River, if both be to the skin? There is ſmall benefit in the choice, whether wee goe downe to Hell by degrees, or at once.</p>
            <p>THe Devill is not more black-mouth'd than a ſlanderer, nor a ſlanderer leſſe malicious than the Devill: for to have themſelves thought as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4182:25"/>
good as any other, they will not have any thought good that dwells neere them. He is to be ſuſpected as ſcarce ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, that would with a ſlander make us to ſuſpect another as diſhoneſt: the worſt of tame beaſts, is the flatterer; and the worſt of wilde beaſts, is the ſlanderer.</p>
            <p>I Admire with reverence the juſtice and wiſdome of the Lawes, but deplore with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion the abuſed practice of them; and reſolve rather to beare with patience a haile-ſhower of injuries, than to ſeek ſhelter at ſuch a thicket, where the brambles ſhall pluck off my fleece, and doe me more
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4182:26"/>
hurt by ſcratching, than the ſtorme would have done by hailing. That Phyſick is not to be choſen, which makes the remedie worſe than the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>TO be good, is now thought too neere a way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Hee that lives vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and piouſly, the world commonly hates, and his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhall be traduced by the ignominious aſperſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent tongues. None can ſcape the Laſh of Cenſure. He that is never ſo profuſe and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſhall be loved of ſome, though not of the beſt. A ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed honeſt man found lewd, is hated as a growne Monſter. Privat ſinnes are often puniſht
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4182:26"/>
with publike ſhame: for ſinne is a concealed fire, that even in darkneſſe will ſo worke, as to bewray it ſelfe. 'Tis impoſſible to have every ones good word, becauſe howſoever wee carry our ſelves, ſome Cynicks will barke at our courſes. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther live hated for goodneſſe, than be loved for vice: he does better that pleaſeth one good man, than he that contents a thouſand bad ones. I care not for his friendſhip that affects not vertue, ſince it muſt needs be partly fained: for diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties breed nothing but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union, and ſweet congruitie onely is the Mother of true Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:4182:27"/>VIce is an infallible fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of wretchedneſſe. All our diſhoneſt actions are but Earneſts layd downe for griefe, anguiſh, or confuſion. Sinne on the beſt condition brings repentance; but for ſinne unrepented is provided Hell. He is in the higheſt degree of madneſſe, that deſires to buy his vexation. We ſhould force our ſelves to want that willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which wee cannot enjoy without future diſtaſte. The Bee chuſeth rather to goe to the flower of the field for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, where ſhee may lade her thighes ſecurely, and with lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, than to the Apothecaries ſhop, where ſhee gets more, but makes her life hazardable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:4182:27"/>WOrks without faith, are like a fiſh without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in which, though there may ſeeme to be ſome quick actions of life, and ſymptomes of agilitie, yet they are indeed but the fore-runners of their end, and the very preſages of death. Faith againe without works, is like a Bird without wings; who, though ſhee may hop with her companions here on Earth, yet living till the worlds end, ſhee'l never flye to Heaven: When both are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, then doth the ſoule mount up to the Hill of eternall Reſt. Faith is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, good works the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: the foundation without the walls, is of ſlender value;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4182:28"/>
the building without a <hi>Baſis,</hi> cannot ſtand. We ſhould firſt labour for a ſure foundation, ſaving faith; but equally ſeeke for ſtrong walls, good workes: for as the houſe is judged by the edifice, more than by the foundation; ſo not according to his faith, but according to his works, ſhall God judge man.</p>
            <p>HE lives truly after death, whoſe pious actions are his pillars of remembrance; though his fleſh moulders to droſſe in the grave, yet is his happineſſe in a perpetuall growth: no day but addes ſome graines to his heape of glory. Good works are ſeeds, that after ſowing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4182:28"/>
us a continuall harveſt. A vertuous man ſhining in the purity of a righteous life, is as a light houſe ſet by the Sea ſide, whereby the Mariners both ſaile aright, and avoid danger: But hee that lives in noted ſinnes, is as a falſe Lanthorne, which ſhipwrackes thoſe that truſt it; or like one dying of the Plague, who leaves an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the whole Citie. Doubtleſſe he runnes a wofull courſe, that lives lewdly, and dies without repentance.</p>
            <p>SEcrecie is a neceſſarie part of policie; divulged intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeldome proceed well: Things untold, are yet undone; Than to ſay nothing, there is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4182:29"/>
not a leſſe labour. The Fig-tree, whoſe fruit is moſt ſweet, bloomes not at all, whereas the Sallow, that hath glorious Palmes, is continually found barren. We ſhould firſt be ſo wiſe, as to be our owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors; and next ſo ſecret, as to be our owne counſell-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            <p>IT falls out oft in this world, that Gods people are like <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the Red Sea, invironed with dangers on all ſides; and are then like poore <hi>Hagar,</hi> who when the bottle of water was ſpent, fell a crying, when there was a Fountaine cloſe by, but her teares hindred her from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. When things goe ill
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4182:29"/>
with us in our Trades and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and all is ſpent, then our ſpirits droope, and wee are at our wits end, as if God were not where hee was. God will never forſake them that are his; his eyes are open, to look upon their condition; his eares are open to their prayers; a Booke of Remembrance is written, of all their good deſires, ſpeeches, and actions: hee hath Bottles for all their teares, their very ſighes are not hid from him, he hath written them upon the palmes of his hand, and cannot but continually looke upon them.</p>
            <p>TRue Religion conſiſts in the outward dutie and the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4182:30"/>
inward man joyned together: What the heart doth not in Religion, is not done: an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie title will bring an emptie comfort at the laſt: it was cold comfort to the rich man in flames, that <hi>Abraham</hi> called him Sonne; or to <hi>Iudas,</hi> that Chriſt called him Friend: God cares for no retainers, that will onely weare his Liverie, but ſerve themſelves.</p>
            <p>THe price of the Pearle is not knowne till all elſe be ſold, and we ſee the neceſſarie uſe of it: and the worth of God in Chriſt is never diſcerned, till we ſee our loſt and undone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition without him; till Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience flyes in our faces, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4182:30"/>
drags us to the brinke of Hell: then, if ever, we taſte how good the Lord is, and will ſay, <hi>Bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF Chriſtians regenerate tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew the power they have in Heaven and Earth, nothing would diſcourage them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were any thing able to ſtand againſt them: It is no wonder that Faith ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, if it overcome Him that made the world. God is content to be out-wreſtled and over-power'd by a ſpirit of Faith, as in <hi>Iacob</hi> and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Where unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe is, it bindes up Gods power; but where Faith is, there it is betweene the ſoule
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4182:31"/>
and God (as betwixt Iron and the Loadſtone) a preſent clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and drawing of one to the other.</p>
            <p>IF we be carefull to preſerve communion with God, wee ſhall be ſure to finde in him whatſoever wee denie for him; Honour, Riches, Pleaſures, Friends, all: ſo much the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by how much we have them more immediately from the Spring-head. Wee ſhall never finde God to be our God more, than when for making of Him to be ſo, we ſuffer any thing for his ſake.</p>
            <p>IF God ſhould beſtow his mercies upon us unasked,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4182:31"/>
wee would forget them, and his hand would not be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in them. What bleſſings wee win by prayer, wee weare with thankfulneſſe; and thoſe wee get without prayer, wee commonly ſpend and uſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any lifting up of the heart to God, in prayſing him for the ſame: All Gods Treaſures are locked up to ſuch as doe not call upon his Name; Prayer opens the doore to them all, and is effectuall to furniſh us with thoſe wee have occaſion to uſe.</p>
            <p>I Have ſeene ſome as happie as the world could make them, but never any more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented: for at the beſt they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4182:32"/>
were but as a good day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two Agues, or a Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine betweene two tempeſts: It is no great happineſſe, to have loſt mirth, and found wealth; in which caſe, all wee can boaſt of is, at once to have ceaſt to be merry and poore. When Satan tempts us to any evill, with <hi>All theſe will I give thee;</hi> wee ſhould repulſe him with Saint <hi>Peters</hi> anſwer, <hi>Thy Silver and thy Gold periſh with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MAny had beene greater, had they cared to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: It is juſt, to be croſt in what we would, when we will not what we ought. <hi>Thoſe that honour me, I will honour:</hi> It is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4182:32"/>
an high favour, to have grace to honour God: but becauſe men honour God as a dutie, that therefore God ſhould honour men, is to give, becauſe he hath given. It is a favour of God, that Man is honoured of Man like himſelfe; but that God allowes of our endeavours as honour to himſelfe, is a greater favour than that wherewith he requites it.</p>
            <p>FLatterie and Trecherie is but one Vice, though dreſt in two ſundry Sutes of Evill: Trecherie aimes at the bloud, Flatterie at the vertues of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: That takes them from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, This bereaves them of themſelves; That, in ſpight of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4182:33"/>
the actors, doth but change a Crowne, This ſteales it from them forever: So that it had beene better for ſome great ones not to have beene, than to have beene in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits more than men.</p>
            <p>GOds charges are oft times harſh in the beginnings and proceedings; but in the concluſion, alwayes comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. True ſpirituall comforts are commonly late, and ſudden: God deferres on purpoſe, that our tryals may be perfect, our deliverance welcome, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence glorious. <hi>Iſaac</hi> had never beene ſo precious to his father, had he not beene reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from death: <hi>Abraham</hi> had
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4182:33"/>
never beene ſo bleſſed in his Seed, had hee not neglected <hi>Iſaac</hi> for God. The onely way to finde comfort in earthly things, is to ſurrender them with a faithfull carefulneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of God. I would not doe that wilfully which <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> did weakely, on condition of a Bleſſing: He that pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his infirmitie, would curſe my obſtinateneſſe; I love his Bleſſing, but I hate his Lye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BLeſſe me alſo (my Father)</hi> ſaith <hi>Eſau:</hi> Every miſcreant can wiſh himſelfe well; no man would be miſerable, if it were enough to deſire happineſſe. He ſhould have wept rather to his Brother for the Pottage,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4182:34"/>
than to <hi>Iſaac</hi> for a Bleſſing: if hee had not ſold, hee had not needed now to buy. It is juſt with God, to denie us thoſe favours which we were careleſſe in keeping, and which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued in enjoying.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IAcob</hi> wreſtled, and wrencht his thigh. It is a favour to halt from God; yet this favour is ſeconded with a greater: hee is bleſſed, becauſe hee would rather halt than leave ere hee was bleſſed. That man may goe away ſound, but miſerable, that loves a Limbe more than a Bleſſing. Surely, if <hi>Iacob</hi> had not wreſtled with God, he had beene foiled with Evils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:4182:34"/>A Chriſtian is a Man of another World, and here from home; which hee would forget, if he were not exerciſed here, and would take his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for his Countrey. But though all Chriſtians agree, and meet in this, <hi>That through many afflictions wee muſt enter into Heaven;</hi> yet according to the diverſitie of place, parts, and grace, there is a different Cup meaſured to every one.</p>
            <p>SAtan is all for caſting down: hee was not aſhamed to ſet upon Chriſt himſelfe with this temptation, and thinks Chriſts members never low enough, untill he can bring them as low as himſelfe. But God is often
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4182:35"/>
neereſt to his children, when he ſeemeth fartheſt off: In the Mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeene. God is with them, and in them, though the wicked be not aware of it; even as the Moone, at what time it is leaſt viſible to us, is then neereſt the Sunne.</p>
            <p>HE that ſhunneth labour, procureth trouble. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imployed life is a burthen to it ſelfe. God is a pure At, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes working, alwayes doing: and the neerer our Soule comes to God, the more it is in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the freer from diſquiet. Men experimentally feele that comfort, in doing what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto them, which before
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4182:35"/>
they longed for, and went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
            <p>WE ought not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſtie in cenſuring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when we ſee their ſpirits out of temper: Many things worke ſtrongly upon the weake nature of man; and wee may ſinne more by harſh cenſure, than they by over-much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper: as in <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe, which was a matter rather of juſt griefe and pittie, than great wonder or heavie cenſure.</p>
            <p>IN all our troubles we ſhould looke firſt home to our owne hearts, &amp; ſtop the ſtorme there: for wee may thanke our owne ſelves, not onely for our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4182:36"/>
but likewiſe for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much troubling our ſelves in trouble: if wee will prevent caſting downe, let us prevent griefe, the cauſe of it; and ſinne, the cauſe of that.</p>
            <p>A Dejected man is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to good duties; it makes him like an Inſtrument out of tune, like a Body out of joint, that mooveth both uncomely and painefully: It unfits him to duties towards God, who loves both a cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full giver and receiver. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedneſſe makes a man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of all former bleſſings, and ſtoppes the influence of Gods grace for the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that to come: it makes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4182:36"/>
us unfit to receive mercies. A quiet Soule is the ſeat of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: therefore meekeneſſe is required, in receiving of that ingrafted Word which is able to ſave our ſoules. It is ill ſowing in a ſtorme: A ſtormie ſpirit will not ſuffer the Word to take place. Men are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that thinke a dejected ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be an humbled ſpirit: yet it is ſo, when we are caſt downe in the ſenſe of our owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe; and then as much rayſed, in the confidence of Gods mercie.</p>
            <p>SAtan hath never more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage than upon diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, it diſpoſeth us for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any Temptation: It
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4182:37"/>
damps the ſpirits of thoſe that walke the ſame way with us; when as we ſhould as good tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers cheere up one another both by word and example. In ſuch a caſe the wheeles of the ſoule are taken off, or as it were want oyle, whereby it paſſeth on very heavily, and no good action comes off from it as it ſhould, which breeds not only uncomfortableneſſe, but unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſſe in good courſes: for a man will never goe on comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably and conſtantly in that which he heavily undertakes. So much as we are quiet and cheerfull, ſo much we live, and are as it were in Heaven: ſo much as we yeeld to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, we loſe ſo much of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4182:37"/>
our life and happineſſe: Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe being as it were the life of our lives, and the ſpirit of our ſpirits, by which they are more inlarged to receive happineſſe, and to expreſſe it.</p>
            <p>THere is an art or skill in bearing troubles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out over-much troubling our ſelves: As in bearing of a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, there is away ſo to poiſe it, that it weigheth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heavy: if it hang all on one ſide, it poiſeth the body down: The greater part of our troubles we pul upon our ſelves, by not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our care ſo, as to take upon us only the care of duty, and leave the reſt to God: and by mingling our paſſions with our
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4182:38"/>
croſſes, and like a fooliſh Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, chewing the Pills which we ſhould ſwallow downe.</p>
            <p>WHy ſhould wee dwell too much upon griefe, when wee ought to remove the ſoule higher. Wee are neereſt neighbours unto our ſelves: when wee ſuffer griefe like a Canker to eat into the ſoule, and like a fire in the bones, to conſume the marrow, and drink up the ſpirits, we are acceſſarie to the wrong done both to our bodies and ſoules; we waſte our owne Candle, and put out our owne Light.</p>
            <p>IN great fires men looke firſt to their Iewels, and then to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4182:38"/>
their Lumber: No Iewell is ſo precious, no poſſeſſion ſo rich as the Soule. The account for our owne ſoules, and the ſoules of others, is the greateſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and therefore the care of ſoules ſhould be the greateſt care.</p>
            <p>A Godly mans comforts and grievances are hid from the world; naturall men are ſtrangers to them. If we be troubled with the diſtempers of our hearts, it is a ground of comfort unto us, that our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are ruled by a higher Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and that there is a principle of that life in us, which cannot brooke the moſt ſecret corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather caſts it out by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4182:39"/>
an holy complaint, as ſtrength of Nature doth poyſon, which ſeekes its deſtruction. Hee wants ſpirituall life, that is not at all diſquieted: hee abates the vigour and livelineſſe of his life, that is over-much diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted.</p>
            <p>A Burning Ague is more hopefull than a Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie; ſo is hee that feeles too much, more happie than hee that feeles not at all: for hee in all his jollitie, is but as a Booke fairely bound, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the eye while it is ſhut; but being opened, is full of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Tragedies: deſpaire to ſuch, is the beginning of comfort; trouble, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4182:39"/>
of peace. A ſtorme is the way to a calme, and Hell the way to Heaven: 'Tis fit that ſinne contracted by joy, ſhould be diſſolved by griefe. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould neither be a dead Sea, nor a raging Sea. Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are never well ordered, but when they are fit to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; to love, joy, truſt, and delight in him above all things: for they are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward movings of the ſoule, which then move beſt, when they move us to God, not from him.</p>
            <p>A Carnall man is like a Spring corrupted, that cannot worke it ſelfe cleare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is wholly tainted; his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4182:40"/>
eye and light is darkneſſe, and therefore no wonder if he ſeeth nothing. Sinne lyeth upon his underſtanding, and hinders the knowledge of it ſelfe; it lyes cloſe upon the will, and hinders the ſtriving againſt it ſelfe. That which a carnall man doth for by-ends and reaſons, the godly man doth from a new Nature; which if there were no Law to compell, yet it would moove him to that which is pleaſing to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>WE cannot ſay, This or that trouble ſhall not befall; yet we may by helpe of the Spirit ſay, Nothing that doth befall, ſhall make me doe that which is unworthy of a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4182:40"/>
Chriſtian. If wee expect the worſt, when it comes, it is no more than wee thought of: if better befalls us, then it is the ſweeter to us, the leſſe wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it.</p>
            <p>IN the uncertaintie of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents here, we ſhould labour to frame that contentment in and from our own ſelves, which the things themſelves will not yeeld: frame peace, by freeing our hearts from too much feare; and riches, by freeing our hearts from covetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: frame a ſufficiencie out of contentedneſſe. If the ſoule it ſelfe be out of tune, outward things will doe no more good than a faire ſhoo to a goutie
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4182:41"/>
foot. A man ſhall never live quietly, that hath not learned to be ſet light by of others. He that is little in his owne eyes, will not be troubled to be little in the eyes of others. Men that ſet too high a price upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when others will not come to their price are diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>THe ſtate of our ſoules ought carefully to bee lookt unto. What a ſhame is it, that ſo ſwift and nimble a Spirit as the ſoule is, that can mount up to Heaven, and from thence come downe into the Earth in an inſtant, ſhould, whileſt it lookes over all other things, over-looke it ſelfe, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4182:41"/>
be ignorant of its owne eſtate? What we are afraid to doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, we ſhould be afraid to think before God. If we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevent wicked thoughts, yet we may denie them lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in our hearts: No ſinne but is eaſier kept out than dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out. Little riſings neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cover the ſoule before we are aware.</p>
            <p>AS in proſperity God min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles ſome croſſes, to diet us; ſo in all croſſes, there is ſomething to comfort us. As there is a vanitie lyes hid in the beſt worldly good, ſo there is a bleſſing lyes hid in the worſt worldly evill. God uſually ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth up that with ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4182:42"/>
in another kinde, wherein we are inferior to others; and deſerving nothing, we ſhould be content with any thing.</p>
            <p>IT is no ſelfe ſeeking, when wee care for no more than that, without which we cannot comfortably ſerve God. And becauſe ſome enlargement of condition is that eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are beſt able to doe good in, we may in the uſe of meanes lawfully deſire it.</p>
            <p>THe diſorders of the ſoule were not naturall, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the firſt Creation; but ſince the Fall, they are become naturall. <hi>Adams</hi> perſon firſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted our Nature; and Nature
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4182:42"/>
being corrupted, corrupts our perſons; and our perſons being corrupted, increaſe the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, by cuſtome of ſinning, which is another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in us. As a ſtreame, the farther it runs from the Spring head, the more it enlargeth its Channell, by the running of leſſer Rivers into it, untill it empties it ſelfe into the Sea: ſo corruption, till it be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topped with grace, ſwelleth bigger and bigger.</p>
            <p>MEns hearts tell them, they might rule their deſires, if they would: Fore-tell a man of any Diſh which hee liketh, That there is poyſon in it, and he will not meddle with it. So
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4182:43"/>
tell him, that death is in that ſinne which hee is about to commit, and hee will abſtaine, if hee beleeve it to be ſo: if hee beleeve it not, it is his volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie unbeleefe and Atheiſme.</p>
            <p>WEre it not that God, partly by his power ſuppreſſeth, and partly by his grace ſubdueth the diſorders of mans nature, for the good of Societie, and the gathering of a Church upon Earth, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption would ſwell to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, that it would over-turne and confound all things, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it ſelfe. For although there be a common corruption that cleaves to the nature of all men in generall, as men, (as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4182:43"/>
diſtruſt in God, ſelfe-love, a carnall and worldly diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.) yet God ſo ordereth it, that in ſome there is an ebbe and decreaſe; in others (God juſtly leaving them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) a flow and encreaſe of ſinfulneſſe, even beyond the bounds of ordinarie corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereby they become worſe than themſelves, either like beaſts in ſenſualitie, or like Devils in ſpirituall wickednes, Lord circumciſe our hearts, and waſh us with cleane water; write thy Law within us, and give us thy holy Spirit when wee begge it, that it may be a never-fading Spring of all holy thoughts, deſires, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in us, ſubduing the ſeed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4182:44"/>
of the Serpent, and drying up the iſſue and ſpring of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature.</p>
            <p>MAny, out of a miſconceit, thinke that Corruption is greateſt, when they feele it moſt; whereas indeed, the leſſe wee ſee it, and lament it, the more it is. Sighes and groanes of the ſoule, are like the pores of the body, out of which, in diſeaſed perſons, ſick humours breake forth, and ſo become leſſe. Vpon every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie and conflict, Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion loſes ſome ground, and Grace gaines upon it. The Doctrine of the Croſſe hath the Croſſe alwayes following it, which corrupt imagination
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4182:44"/>
counteth the moſt odious and bitter thing in the World; whereas indeed it is the chiefe courſe which God takes, in bringing men to Heaven.</p>
            <p>IT is an evidence that a man lives more to Opinion than Conſcience, when his griefe is more, for being diſappointed of outward good things, than for his miſ-carriage towards God. It marres all in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when wee goe about hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things with earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and ſeeke not Chriſt in Chriſt, but the World. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is apt to breed falſe feares, and falſe feare brings true vexation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:4182:45"/>WE ſhould not bring God down to our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, but raiſe our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations up to God: for by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging matter out of it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground, the imaginarie grievances of our lives are more then the reall. Many good men are in a long dreame of miſerie, and many bad men in as long a dreame of happineſſe, till the time of awaking come; and all becauſe they are too much led by appearances.</p>
            <p>A Naturall man is ever wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Spiders webbes, or hatching Cockatrices egges; that is, his heart is exerciſed either in vanitie or miſchiefe: for not onely the frame of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4182:45"/>
heart, but what the heart fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, is evill continually. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other creature is naturally carried to that which is helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto it; onely Man is in love with his owne bane, and fights for thoſe luſts that fight againſt his ſoule.</p>
            <p>IDleneſſe is the houre of temptation, wherein Satan joynes with our imagination, and ſets it about his own work, to grinde his Greefe; for the Soule, as a Mill, either grindes that which is put into it, or elſe works upon it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>THe miniſtring of ſome excellent thought, from what wee heare or ſee, often
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4182:46"/>
proves a great advantage of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good to the Soule. Whileſt S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie deſired to heare the eloquence of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> hee was taken with the matter it ſelfe, ſweetly ſlyding toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the words, into his heart.</p>
            <p>SOme conceit, they may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt, without his Croſſe; and lead a godly life, without perſecution: They would pull a Roſe, without pricks: But though it may ſtand with their owne baſe ends for a time, yet will it not hold out in times of change, when ſickneſſe of body, and trouble of minde ſhall come: emptie
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4182:46"/>
conceits are too weake to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with reall griefes.</p>
            <p>IT is a ſtrong argument, that the Spirit hath ſet up a Kingdome and order in our hearts, when our ſpirits riſe within us againſt any thing which lifts it ſelfe up againſt goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>THere is nothing that more mooveth a godly man to renew his intereſt every day in the perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and obedience of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour than the ſinfull ſtirrings of his ſoule, when hee findes ſomething in himſelfe alwayes enticing and drawing away his heart from God, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingling
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4182:47"/>
it ſelfe with his beſt performances.</p>
            <p>WE may with better leave uſe all the comforts which God hath given, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh us in the way to Heaven, than refuſe them. The care of the outward man bindes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſo farre, as that wee ſhould neglect nothing which may helpe us, in a chearefull ſerving of God, in our places, and tend to the due honour of our bodies, which are the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Holy Ghoſt, and companions of our ſoules in all performances: but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate uſe of the creatures, is the Nurſe of all paſſions; becauſe our ſpirits, which are
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4182:47"/>

            <p>SAtan and his inſtruments, by bewitching the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with falſe appearances, miſ-leadeth not only the world, but troubleth the peace of men taken out of the world, whoſe eſtate is layd up ſafe in Chriſt: Who notwithſtanding paſſe their few dayes here, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, weariſome, and unneceſſarie ſadneſſe of ſpirit; being kept in ignorance of their happie condition, by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans juggling, and their owne miſtakes, and ſo come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4182:48"/>
before they are aware. Some againe paſſe their dayes in a golden dreame, and drop into Hell before they thinke of it.</p>
            <p>AS the diſtemper of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie diſturbing the act of Reaſon, oftentimes breedes madneſſe, in regard of civill converſation; ſo it breeds like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpirituall madneſſe, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to thoſe things, which if they were in their right wits, they would utterly abhorre.</p>
            <p>MEn whoſe Wills are ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than their Wits, who are wedded to their own wayes, are more pleaſed to heare that which complyes with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4182:48"/>
than a harſh truth, which croſſes them; this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſageth ruine, becauſe they are not counſellable: Wherefore God ſuffers them to bee led through a fooles Paradiſe, to a true Priſon; as men that will neither heare themſelves, nor others, who would doe them good againſt their wills.</p>
            <p>WHat an unworthy thing is it, that wee ſhould pittie a beaſt over-loaden, and yet take no pittie of a Brother? Whereas there is no living member of Chriſt, but hath ſpiritual love infuſed into him, and ſome abilitie to comfort others. Dead ſtones in an Arch uphold one another, and ſhall
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4182:49"/>
not living? After Love hath once kindled love, then the heart being melted, is fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any impreſſion.

            <p>AS God loves not emptie hands, ſo he meaſures ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not by the hand, but the heart: A Widowes Mite is prefer'd before the Temples Treaſure, by Him who never askes how great, but how good our offerings are.</p>

            <p>REmove the beame from thine owne, if thou wilt clearely ſee the mote in thy brothers eye: firſt learne, then teach. He gathers, that heares; he ſpends, that ſpeaketh: and if we ſpend before we gather, we may ſoone prove bankrout.</p>
            <p>THe Devil alledged Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to tempt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and therefore no marvell though hypocrites make a faire ſhew, to deceive with a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous luſtre of holineſſe, ſince we ſee from whence they have it.

            <p>SAtan makes the ruggedeſt way ſeeme ſmooth, while we tread in his paths: but turne thy feet unto holineſſe, hee blocks up the way with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

over-values a man, that knowes juſt cauſe of his owne humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If others miſtake us, this can be no warrant for our error.

It is the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Nature, upon an Inch given, to challenge an Ell: for finding our ſelves graced with ſome abilitie, wee ſtrait flatter our ſelves with a facultie of more.</p>
            <p>IT hath ever bin Gods wont, by ſmall Precepts to trie mans obedience; which is ſo

            <p>IT is moſt ſeaſonable in our worſt, to thinke of our beſt eſtate: for both that thought will be beſt digeſted, when wee are well; and that change beſt prepared for, when fartheſt from us.</p>

            <p>I Like ſilent ſpeaking well, when our actions ſupply the office of our tongue. Give me the Chriſtian that's more ſeene than heard; for a loud tongue and a ſilent hand never eſcapes the brand of an hypocrite.</p>

combat, and in a place of ſuch advantage. Wherefore, thoſe that will be alone, (being caſt downe by any ſpirituall temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) doe as much as in them lyeth, tempt the Tempter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to tempt them.</p>
            <p>AS wee ought not to reject the comfort of our friends in adverſitie, ſo ſhould we not build too much upon humane comforts: Men being at the beſt, but Conduits of comfort, and ſuch as God freely convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth comfort by; taking liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie often to denie comfort by them, that ſo hee may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the God of all comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:4182:53"/>WE muſt not goe to the Surgeon for everie ſcratch: opening of our eſtates to others is not good, but when it is neceſſarie; and it is not neceſſarie, when wee can fetch ſupply from our owne ſtore: For God would have us tender of our reputations, except in ſome ſpeciall caſes, wherein we are to give him the glory, by a free and full confeſſion.</p>
            <p>A Wicked man, beaten out of earthly comforts, is as a naked man in a ſtorme, and an unarmed man in the field; or as a Shippe toſſed in the Sea, without an Anchor, which preſently daſheth upon Rocks, or falleth upon Quick-ſands.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4182:54"/>
But a Chriſtian, when hee is driven out of all comforts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, nay, when God ſeemes to be angry with him; he can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from God angry, to God appeaſed; he can wreſtle and ſtrive with God, by Gods owne ſtrength; fight with him with his owne weapons, and plead with him by his owne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, till he obtaine the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort he deſireth.</p>
            <p>IT is an infallible rule of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a man to be in the ſtate of Grace, when he findes every condition draw him nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer unto God: For thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that ſuch love God, and are called of him, unto whom all things worke together for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4182:54"/>
the beſt. Grace dormant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exerciſe, doth not ſecure us. The ſoule without action, is like an inſtrument not plaied upon, or like a ſhip alwaies in the haven. Even life it ſelfe is made more lively by action: and by ſtirring up the grace of God in us, ſparkles come to be flames, and all graces are kept bright.</p>
            <p>WHen the ſoule ſuffers it ſelfe by ſomthing here below to be drawne away from God, 'tis his mercy tous, that we ſhould find nothing but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; unquietnes in any thing elſe, that ſo wee might remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from whence we are fallen, and returne home againe: and it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4182:55"/>
is a good trouble that frees us from the greateſt trouble, and brings with it the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable reſt. The ſoule natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſinks downewards, and therefore had need to be often wound up: but after that Gods ſpirit hath touched the ſoule, it will rather be quiet till it ſtands pointed Godward; in whom there is both worth to ſatisfie, and ſtrength to ſupport it. If we reſolve in Gods power, and not our own, and be ſtrong in the Lord, and not in our ſelves, then it matters not what our troubles or temptations be, either from within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: for Truſt in God at length will triumph.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:4182:55"/>GRace, like oyle will ever be above: and though the ſoul be overborne with paſſion for a time, yet if grace have once tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeaſoned it, it will worke it ſelfe into freedome again. The eye, when any duſt falls into it, is not more tender and unquiet till it bee wrought out againe, than a gratious ſoul being once troubled: The ſpirit, as a ſpring, will be cleanſing it ſelfe more and more; whereas the heart of a carnall man is like a ſtanding poole, whatſoever is caſt into it, there it reſts: trouble and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe in him are in their proper place: It is proper for the ſea to rage and caſt up durt: and God hath ſet it downe for an eternall rule, That vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4182:56"/>
and ſinne ſhall be inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable.</p>
            <p>IF Man withdraw himſelfe from Gods gratious govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him to happineſſe, hee will ſoone fall under Gods juſt government of him to deſerved miſery: If he ſhakes off Gods ſweet yoake, hee puts himſelfe under Satans heavy yoake, who as Gods Executioner hardens him to deſtruction; and ſo while hee ruſhes againſt Gods will, he fulfils it, and whileſt he will not willingly doe Gods will, Gods wil is don upon him againſt his will.</p>
            <p>FOr ſetling our Faith the more, God taketh liberty in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4182:56"/>
uſing weake meanes to great purpoſes, and ſetteth aſide more likely and able means; yet ſometimes he altogether diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the greateſt meanes, and worketh often by no meanes at all. Nay God often bringeth his will to paſſe by croſſing the courſe and ſtreame of meanes, to ſhew his owne ſoveraigntie, &amp; to exerciſe our dependance.</p>
            <p>THere is nothing ſo high, that is above Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; nothing ſo low that is beneath it. Nothing ſo large, but is bounded by it. Nothing ſo confuſed, but God can order it. Nothing ſo bad, but he can draw good out of it. Nothing ſo wiſely plotted, but God can
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4182:57"/>
diſappoint it; as <hi>Achitophels</hi> counſel: nothing ſo weakly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but he can give a prevailing iſſue unto it. Nothing ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but he can ſuſpend its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as heavy burdens from ſinking, fire from burning, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>WHere a fearful ſpirit, &amp; a melancholy temper, a weak iudgement and a ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conſcience meet in one, there Satan and his, together with mens owne hearts, (which like Sophiſters are continually cavilling amongſt themſelves,) worke much diſquiet, and makes the life uncomfortable. But in this caſe, wee ſhould wholly reſign our ſelves up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, with <hi>Davids</hi> words: <hi>Here I am, let the Lord deale with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4182:57"/>
me as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> For God oft wraps himſelfe in a cloud, and will not be ſeen till afterward. Where wee cannot trace him, we ought with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to admire and adore him; for all Gods dealings will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare beautifull in their due ſeaſon, though wee for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſee not the contiguitie and linking together of one thing with another.</p>
            <p>NOthing ſhould diſpleaſe us that pleaſeth God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould any thing be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to us that diſpleaſeth him. A godly man in all eſtates and conditions, ſayes Amen, to Gods Amen, and puts his <hi>fiat</hi> and <hi>placet</hi> to Gods. As the ſea
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4182:58"/>
turnes all rivers into his owne relliſh, ſo he turnes all to his owne ſpirit, and makes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever befalls him, an exerciſe of ſome vertue. Thus hee inioyes heaven, in the world under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and Gods kingdom comes, where his will is thus done and ſuffered.</p>
            <p>AS beaſts that cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the yoke at the firſt, after they are inured a while unto it, beare it willingly, and carry their worke more eaſily by it: So the yoke of obedience makes the life regular and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. The meeting of authoritie and obedience together, main- the order and peace of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:4182:58"/>SAlvation comes to bee ſure unto us, whilſt by Faith loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to Gods promiſes, (and to God himſelfe freely offering grace therin) the ſoule reſignes up it ſelfe to God, making no further queſtion from any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe of its owne: for doubtleſſe he will make good whatever he hath promiſed for the comfort of his children. And what greater aſſurance can there be, than for Being it ſelfe to lay its being to pawne? and for Life it ſelfe to lay life to pawne? and all to comfort a poore ſoule. By the bare word of God it is alone, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of day and night, and the preſervation of the world from any further ouerflowings
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4182:59"/>
of waters, continueth: which if it ſhould fail, yet his Covenant with his people ſhould abide firm for euer, though the whole frame of nature were diſſolved.</p>
            <p>GOd (ſimply conſidered) is not all our happineſſe, but God as truſted in; and Chriſt as we are made one with him. The ſoule cannot ſo much as touch the hem of Chriſts gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it ſhall find vertue comming from him to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and ſettle it: God in Chriſt is full of all that is good: when the ſoule is emptied, inlarged and opened by Faith, to receive goodneſſe offered, there muſt needs follow ſweet ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:4182:59"/>NOne can know the truth of God, ſo as to build upon it, but by the Truth it ſelf, and the ſpirit revealing it by its owne light to the ſoul. And that ſoul which hath felt the power of truth, in caſting it downe and raiſing it up againe, will eaſily bee brought to reſt upon it. Wee muſt apprehend the love of God and the fruits of it, as better than life it ſelf, and then chuſing and cleaving to the ſame will ſoon follow. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect faith dares put the hardeſt caſes to its ſoule, and then ſet God againſt all that may befal it. There is no readier way to fall, than to truſt equally to two ſtayes, whereof one is rotten, and the other ſound: God will
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4182:60"/>
be truſted alone, or not at all: thoſe that truſt to other things with God, truſt not him, but upon pretence to carry their double minds with leſſe check.</p>
            <p>WHen the darkeneſſe of the night is thickeſt, then the morning beginnes to dawne: deep extremities are to the wicked a ground of utter deſpaire; but to him that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ways of God they are a riſe of exceeding comfort: for infinite power and goodneſſe can never bee at a loſſe; neither can Faith, which looks to that, ever be at a ſtand: in a hopeleſſe eſtate a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will ſee ſome dore of hope opened, becauſe God is ever
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4182:60"/>
neereſt to us, when we ſtand moſt in need of him. Gods truth and goodneſſe is unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, he never leaves thoſe that truſt in him.</p>
            <p>AS God commands us to truſt him in doing good, ſo ſhould wee commit our ſoules to him in wel-doing, and truſt him when wee are about his owne works, and not in the works of darkneſſe: wee may ſafely expect God in his waies of mercy, when wee are in his waies of obedience.</p>
            <p>THe heart is never drawne to any ſinfull vanitie, or frighted with any terrour of trouble: til faith firſt loſeth the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4182:61"/>
ſight and eſtimation of divine things, and forgets the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and excellencie of them: when the great things of God are brought into the heart by faith, what is there in the whole world that can out-bid them. Faith preſerves the chaſtitie of the ſoule, and cleaving to God is a ſpirituall debt which it oweth him: whereas cleaving to the Creature, is ſpirituall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery.</p>
            <p>WE caſt away floures af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter once wee have had the ſweetnes of them, becauſe there is not ſtill a freſh ſupply of ſweetnes in them: whatever comfort is in the creature, the ſoule will ſpend quickly, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4182:61"/>
looke ſtill for more, whereas the comfort we have in God is undefiled, and fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Outward things are onely ſo far forth good, as we doe not truſt in them. Thornes may be touched, but not reſted on, for then they will pierce: wee muſt not ſet our hearts upon thoſe things, which are never evill to us but when wee ſet our hearts upon them.</p>
            <p>WHere affections to any thing below get much ſtrength in the ſoule, it will by little and little bee ſo over-growne, that there will bee no place left in it either for Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or Art, God, or Truſt in him, which is (as it were) the

mother root and great veine, whence the exerciſe of all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have their beginning and ſtrength. An Heire doubts not but his father will provide him food and nouriſhment, and give him breeding ſutable to his future condition. It is a vaine pretence to beleeve that God will give us Heaven, and yet leave us to ſhift for our ſelves in the way.</p>
            <p>PLants move not from place to place, becauſe they finde nouriſhment where they ſtand: but living creatures ſeeke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad for their food, and to that end have a power of moving from place to place; and this is the reaſon why truſt is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4182:62"/>
by going to God with an humble boldnes, which carries the ſoule out of in ſelfe, to rely wholy upon his all-ſufficiency.</p>
            <p>THoſe that take liberty in things they either know or doubt will diſpleaſe God, ſhew they want the feare of God, &amp; the want of feare ſhews their want of dependancie, and therefore want of truſt. Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancie is alwaies very reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, it ſtudieth contentment, and care to comply: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that commits his ſoule to God to ſave, wil commit his ſoule to God to ſanctifie and guide in a way of wel pleaſing.

at the becke of thoſe that feed them, though they are ready to fall violently upon others: Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience therefore is againſt the Principles of Nature.</p>
            <p>GOd can convey himſelfe more comfortably to us when hee pleaſeth, without means, than by means: and true Truſt, as it ſets God higheſt in the ſoule, ſo in dangers and wants it hath preſent recourſe to him (as the Conies to the rockes) patiently waiting his leiſure: for God ſeldome makes any promiſe to his children, but he exerciſeth their truſt in waiting long before, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> for a ſonne, <hi>David</hi> for a kingdome, the whole world for Chriſts comming, &amp;c.</p>

confidence, or ſinking by feare and diſtruſt, to lie levell upon God, and cleave faſt to him: Square will lie faſt upon ſquare, but our hearts are ſo full of unevenneſſe, that God hath much adoe to ſquare our hearts ſit for him; notwithſtanding the ſoul hath no true reſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this.</p>
            <p>A ſpirit ſet in tune, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by a higher ſpirit, will ſtand out againſt ordinary aſſaults, but when God (who is God of the ſpirits of all fleſh) ſhall ſeem contrary to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, we ſhall then find ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief elſewhere.

            <p>SIn is nothing ſo ſweet in the committing, as it is heavy and bitter in the reckoning.

            <p>THere is ſomething in the very greatneſſe of ſin, that may encourage us to goe to God: for the greater our ſinnes are, the greater the glory of his powerfull mercy in pardoning

will appeare. The great God delights to ſhew his greatneſſe in the greateſt things, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in mercy, it pleaſeth him, nothing ſo well, as being his chiefe Name. His mercy is not only above his own works, but above ours alſo: if we could ſin more then he could pardon, then wee might have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to deſpaire. Deſpaire is a high point of Atheiſm, it takes away God and Chriſt both at once. <hi>Iudas</hi> in betraying our Saviour was occaſion of his death as man: but in deſpairing he did what lay in him to take away his life as God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould never thinke the dore of hope to be ſhut againſt us, if we have a purpoſe to turn
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4182:65"/>
unto God. Invincible mercy will never be conquered; and endleſſe goodneſſe never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of bounds or ends. If Chriſt be the Phiſitian, it is no matter of how long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the diſeaſe be: hee is good at all diſeaſes, and will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the reproach of diſability to cure any.</p>
            <p>AS in the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, feare ſhewes that we have not committed it: ſo a tender heart fearing leſt the time of true repentance is paſt, ſhewes plainly that it is not paſt. God is more willing to entertaine us, than we are to caſt our ſelves upon him. As there is a fountaine opened for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4182:66"/>
ſin and for uncleanneſſe; as it is a living fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that runs for ever, and can never be drawne dry.</p>
            <p>ALl men are not affected with a like ſorrow for ſin: God giveth ſome larger ſpirits, and ſo their ſorrowes become larger. Some upon quickneſſe of apprehenſion, and the ready paſſages betwixt the brain and the heart, are quickly moued: where the apprehenſion is dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the paſſages flower, there ſorrow is long in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and long in removing: the deepeſt waters have the ſtilleſt motion. Iron takes fire more ſlowly than ſtubble, but then it holds longer. It is fitter to leave
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4182:66"/>
it to Gods wiſdome to mingle the portion of ſorrow, than to be our owne chuſers.</p>
            <p>IF wee grieve that we cannot grieve, and ſo far as it is ſin, make it our grief, it ſhould not hinder us from going to Chriſt, but rather drive us to him: God delights not in our ſorrow; if we could truſt in him without much ſorrow, then it would not be required: and though want of feeling be quite oppoſite to the life of grace: yet ſencible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the want of feeling, ſhewes ſome degree of the life of grace. When that which is wanting in grief for ſin, is made up in feare of ſinning, there is no great cauſe of complaine of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4182:67"/>
the want of griefe: for this holy affection is the awe-band of the ſoule, whereby it is kept from ſtarting from God and his waies. That meaſure of griefe and ſorrow is ſufficient, which brings us and holds us to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>WE ſhould grieve for our ſins, and rejoice for our griefe: and though wee can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love nor grieve, nor ioy of our ſelves as we ſhould, yet are we often guilty in giving a checke to the ſpirit, ſtirring theſe affections in us: which is the maine cauſe of the many ſharp afflictions wee endure in this life, though Gods Love in the maine matter of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4182:67"/>
bee moſt firme unto us.</p>
            <p>GRiefe is no farther good, than it makes way for ioy: which cauſed our Saviour to ioyne them together: <hi>Bleſſed are the mourners, for they ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted:</hi> it is one maine end of Gods leaving us in a ſorrowfull condition, that we may live and die by faith in the perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, whereby we glorifie God more, than if we had perfect righteouſneſſe of our owne.</p>
            <p>OVr corruptions are Gods enemies, as well as ours: therefore in truſting to him, and fighting againſt them, wee may be ſure he will take our
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4182:68"/>
part in vanquiſhing them. The looking too much to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kims and Gyants, and too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to Gods omnipotency, ſhut the Iſraelites out of Canaan, and put God to his Oath, that they ſhould never enter into his reſt: And it will exclude our ſouls from happines at length, if looking too much on theſe Anakims or great corruptions within and without us, we baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpaire, and give over the Field: what coward will nor fight, when hee is ſure of helpe and victorie?</p>
            <p>THough God be of pure eyes, yet he looks upon us his poore Creatures, in him who is blameleſſe, and without
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4182:68"/>
ſpot, who by vertue of his ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice appeares for us in heaven, and mingles his odors with our ſervices; and in him will God be knowne to us by the name of a kinde Father, not onely in pardoning our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, but accepting our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p>WHatſoever comfort we have in goods, friends, health, or other Bleſſings, it is all conveied by God, who ſtill remaines, though theſe bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from us: And we have him bound in many promiſes for all that is needfull for us: we may ſue him upon his owne bond. Can we thinke that hee who will give us a Kingdome,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4182:69"/>
will faile us in neceſſary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to bring us thither, who himſelfe is our portion.</p>
            <p>DEparture of friends ſhould not be grievous unto us: A true Beleever is unto Chriſt as his Mother, Brother and Siſter, becauſe he carries that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, as if they were ſo indeed to him. As Chriſt makes us all to him, ſo ſhould wee make him all in all to our ſelves. If all comforts in the world were dead, wee may enioy them ſtill in the living Lord.</p>
            <p>HEalth is at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſickneſſe ſtayes at his rebuke. The time of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4182:69"/>
is a time of purging from that defilement we gathered in out health, till wee come purer out: which ſhould moue us the rather willingly to abide Gods time. Bleſſed is that ſickneſſe that proves the health of the ſoule: we are beſt for moſt part when wee are weakeſt. Then onely it truly appeares what good proficients we have been in the time of health.</p>
            <p>IN all kinde of troubles, it is not the Ingredients that God puts into the cup, ſo much afflicts us, as the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of our diſtempered paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions mingled with them. The ſting and coare of them all is ſinne: when that is not onely
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4182:70"/>
pardoned, but in ſome meaſure healed, and the proud fleſh ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out, then a healthy ſoul wil beare any thing: when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is once ſet at liberty, we cheerfully undergoe any burthen. But it is a heavy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be under the burthen of trouble, and under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of a guilty conſcience both at once. When men will walke in the light of their own fire, and the ſparks which they have kindled themſelves, it is iuſt with God that they ſhould lie downe in ſorrow.</p>
            <p>IN all ſorts of injuries which we ſuffer, we ſhould commit our cauſe to the God of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, &amp; not meddle with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4182:70"/>
he will revenge better than we can, and more perhaps than we deſire. The wronged ſide is the ſafer ſide. If in ſtead of meditating revenge, we can ſo overcome our ſelves as to pray for our enemies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve wel of them, we ſhal both ſweeten our owne ſpirits, and prevent a ſharp temptation which wee are prone unto, and have an undoubted argument, that we are ſons of that Father that doth good to his enemies, and Members of that Saviour that prayed for his perſecutors: and withall, by heaping coles upon our Enemies heads, wee ſhall melt them either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or confuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:4182:71"/>WEe are not diſquieted when wee put off our clothes and go to bed, becauſe we truſt Gods ordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to raiſe us up again: And why ſhould wee be diſquieted when we put off our bodies, and ſleep our laſt ſleep: conſidering we are more ſure to riſe out of our graves, than out of our beds. Nay we are raiſed up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in Chriſt our Head, who is the Reſurrection and the life; in whom we may triumph over death, that triumpheth over the greateſt Monarchs, as a diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and conquered Enemy.</p>
            <p>THat which belongs to us in our calling, is care of diſcarging our duty: that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4182:71"/>
which God takes upon him is aſſiſtance and good ſucceſſe in it. Let us do our work, and leave God to do his owne. Diligence and truſt in him is onely ours, the reſt of the burthen is his. He ſtands upon his credit ſo much, that it ſhall appeare wee have not truſted him in vaine, even when we ſee no apparance of doing any good. <hi>Peter</hi> fiſhed all night &amp; catcht nothing: yet upon Chriſts word caſting in his net again, he caught ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fiſh as brake it.</p>
            <p>COvetouſneſſe (when men wil be richer than God wil have them) troubles all, it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the houſe, the whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the houſe within us, our
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4182:72"/>
pretious ſoule, which ſhould be a quiet houſe for Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to dwell in, whoſe Seat is a quiet Spirit. If men would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſts method, and <hi>ſeeke firſt the Kingdome of Heaven, doubtleſſe all other things ſhould be caſt upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOd is neereſt to us in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: when our enemies on earth conclude our utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, God is in Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding our glorious delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Vſually after the loweſt Ebbe, followes the higheſt Spring-tide. Chriſt ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mount Sion, and will worke our raiſing by that very meanes by which our enemies ſeeke to ruine us. There is no condition
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4182:72"/>
ſo ill, but there is Balme in Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead, Comfort in the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. The depths of miſerie are never beyond the depths of mercy. Naturall men from the common light of Nature diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering there is a God, will in extremities run unto him: and God as the Author of Nature will ſometimes heare them; as he doth the young Ravens that cry unto him. But comfortably and with aſſurance thoſe onely have a familiar recourſe unto him, that have a ſanctified ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſition unto God, as being well acquainted with Him. It is an excellent ground of ſincerity, to deſire the favour of God, not ſo much out of ſelf-aimes, as that God may have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:4182:73"/>
the more free and full praiſe from us: conſidering the ſoul is never more fit for that bleſſed duty, than when it is in a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plight.</p>
            <p>IF we ſeriouſly think of what is our Duty, God will ſurely thinke of what ſhall bee for our Comfort: we ſhall feel God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering what we look for from Him, in doing what he expects from us. Can we have ſo meane thoughts of Him, that wee ſhould intend his glory, and he not much more intend our good. Yet many doe groſſely miſtake, in taking Gods curſe for a bleſſing: To thrive in an ill way is a ſpirituall iudgement, extremely hardening the heart.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:4182:73"/>
There can neither be grace nor wiſdome in ſetling upon a courſe, wherein we can neither pray to God for ſucceſſe in, nor bleſſe God when he gives it.</p>
            <p>WHen we are at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, yet it is a mercy that we are not conſumed: wee are never ſo ill, but it might be worſe with us: whatſoever is leſſe than Hell is undeſerved: and it is a matter praiſe worthy to God, that we yet have time and opportunitie to get into a bleſſed Condition.</p>
            <p>THe Apoſtle thought it the firſt duty in affliction, to pray. <hi>Is any afflicted, let him pray: Is any joyfull, let him ſing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4182:74"/>
Pſalmes.</hi> Praiſing of God is then moſt comely, (though never out of ſeaſon) when God ſeems to call for it by renewing the ſence of his mercies in ſome freſh favours toward us. If a Bird will ſing in Winter, much more in the Spring. If the heart be prepared in the winter time of Adverſitie to praiſe God, how ready will it be when it is warmed with the glorious ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of his Favour.</p>
            <p>OVr life is nothing but as it were a Webbe woven with interminglings of wants and favours, croſſes and bleſſings, ſtandings and failings, combat and victory: therefore there ſhould be a perpetuall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4182:74"/>
courſe of praying and praiſing in our hearts. We ſhould often apply theſe generalls of Holy-writ to our ſelves, to ſtir up our hearts to praiſe God: <hi>He will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave nor forſake us: he will be with us in fire and water: the iſſue of all things ſhall be for our good: we ſhall reap the quiet fruit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and no good thing will he withhold from them that live a godly life.</hi> If wee had a ſpirit of Faith, to apply ſuch like gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall promiſes, wee ſhould ſee much of Gods goodneſſe in particular toward us. God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth the forgiveneſſe of ſin, and yet thou findeſt the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thereof daily upon thee; Neuertheleſſe cheere up thy ſelfe, when the Morning is dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4182:75"/>
then comes day; after a weary weeke comes a Sabbath, and after a fight, victory will appeare: wee muſt endure the working of Gods Phyſicke: when the ſick humor is carried away and purged, then we ſhall enioy deſired health.</p>
            <p>PRaiſing of God may well be called, Incenſe: becauſe as it is ſweet in it ſelfe, and ſweet to God, ſo it ſweetens all that comes from us: Wee cannot love and joy in God, but he wil delight in us; when we neglect the praiſing of God, wee loſe both the comforts of his Love and our owne too. Our praiſing God ſhould not bee as ſparkes out of a flint, but as water out
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4182:75"/>
of a Spring, natural, ready, free, as Gods Love to us: as Mercy pleaſeth him, ſo ſhould praiſes pleaſe us; For unthankfulneſſe is a ſin deteſtable both to God and man: and the leſſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it receives from humane lawes, the more it is puniſhed inwardly by ſecret ſhame, and outwardly by publicke hatred, if once it prove notorious.</p>
            <p>THe living God is a living Fountaine, never drawne dry: he hath never don ſo much for us, but he can and will doe more: If there be no end of our praiſes, there ſhall be no end of his goodnes: by this means we are ſure never to bee very miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: how can he be dejected,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4182:76"/>
that by a ſweet communion with God, ſets himſelfe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? nay maketh his heart a kind of heaven, a Temple, a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Holies, wherein Incenſe is offered unto God? A thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart to God for his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings is the greateſt Bleſſing of all: But were it not for a few gratious Soules, what Honour ſhould God have of the reſt of the unthankfull world? which ſhould ſtir us up the more to be Trumpets of Gods Praiſes in the midſt of his Enemies; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this (in ſome ſort) hath a Prerogative above our praiſing him in Heaven: for there God hath no Enemies to diſhonor him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:4182:76"/>GOd is Salvation it ſelf, and nothing but Salvation: and though our ſins for a time may ſtop the current of His Mercy, yet it being above all our ſins, will ſoone ſcatter that cloud, remove that ſtop, and then wee ſhall ſee and feele nothing but ſalvation from the Lord, all his wayes are Mercy and Peace, to a repentant Soule that caſts it ſelfe upon him. We ſhould not therefore ſo much looke what deſtruction the Devill and his threaten, as what ſalvation God promiſeth. Canot he that hath vouchſafed an iſſue in Chriſt from eternall death, vouchſafe an iſſue from all temporall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills? He that brought us into trouble can eaſily make a way
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4182:77"/>
out of it when he pleaſeth: this ſhould be a ground of reſolute and abſolute obedience even in our greateſt extremities; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering God will either deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from death, or by death, and at length out of death.</p>
            <p>CAiniſh hypocrites hang downe their heads when God lifts up the countenance of their brethren: when the countenance of Gods children cleers up, then their enemies hearts and looks are cloudy; Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalems joy is Babylons ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: It is with the Church and Her enemies as it is with a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, the ſcales whereof when one is up, the other is downe: The reaſon why wicked men
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4182:77"/>
gnaſh their teeth at the ſight of Gods gratious dealing, is, that they take the riſe of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be a preſage of their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. Which leſſon <hi>Hamans</hi> wife had learned.</p>
            <p>SAlvation is Gods own work, humbling and caſting down is his ſtrange Worke, whereby he comes to his owne worke. For when he intends to ſave, he wil ſeem to deſtroy firſt: whom he will revive, he will kill firſt. Grace and Goodneſſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by God, have a native in-bred majeſty in them, which maketh the face to ſhine, and borroweth not his luſtre from without; which God at length will have to appeare in its own
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4182:78"/>
likeneſſe, howſoever malice may caſt a vaile thereon, and diſguiſe it for a time.</p>
            <p>WHat comfort was it for <hi>Adam</hi> when hee was ſhut out of Paradiſe, to looke upon it after he had loſt it: the more excellencies are in God, the more our grief if we have not our part in them: the very life-bloud of the Goſpell lies in a ſpeciall application of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mercy to our ſelves, without which we can neither entertain the Love of God, nor returne Love againe; whereby we loſe all the comfort God intends us in his Word, which of purpoſe was written for our ſolace and refreſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:4182:78"/>PRetend not thy unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unabilitie to keep thee off from God; for this is the way to keep thee ſo ſtill. God bids us draw neer to Him, and Hee will draw neere to us. Whilſt we in Gods own wayes draw neere to Him, and labour to entertaine good thoughts of Him, He will delight to ſhew himſelfe fauourable unto us: whileſt we are ſtriving againſt an unbeleeving heart, Hee will come in and helpe us, and ſo freſh light will come in. God alone muſt help us, and if ever Hee helpe us, it muſt be by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting our ſelves upon him: for then he will reach out himſelfe unto us, in the promiſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to pardon our ſin, and in the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:4182:79"/>
promiſe of Grace, to ſanctifie our Natures.</p>
            <p>SPirituall Comforts in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, ſuch as the world can neither give nor take away, ſhew that God lookes upon the ſoules of his, with another eye than he beholdeth others: He ſends a ſecret Meſſenger, that reports his peculiar Love to their hearts. He knowes their ſoules, and feeds them with his hidden Manna: the inward peace they feele is not in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from trouble, but in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with God in the midſt of trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SEchem</hi> had not ſinned, if <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> had not tempted him.

Immodeſtie of behaviour makes way to Luſt, and gives life unto wicked hopes. Luſt commonly ends in loathing. But <hi>Sechem</hi> would ſalve up his ſinne with an honeſt ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but actions ill begun, are hardly ſalved up with late ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; wheras good entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces give ſtrength to the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and ſucceſſe to the end. <hi>Dinahs</hi> brethren pretend Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (we cannot give our ſiſter in mariage to an uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man:) here God is in the mouth, and Satan in the heart. A ſmiling malice is moſt deadly, and hatred doth moſt ranckle the heart, when it is kept in and diſſembled. <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes think of nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:4182:80"/>
and which is worſt, begin their crueltie with craft, and end their craft with Religion. Bloudieſt projects have ever wont to be thus coloured; for the worſe any thing is, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhew it deſires to make; and contrarily, the better colour is ſet upon vice, the more odious it makes it: for as every ſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion addes to an evill, ſo the beſt addes moſt evill: Indeed filthineſſe ſhould not have bin wrought in Iſrael, nor ſhould murther have been wrought by Iſrael: Curſed be their wrath, for it was fierce, and their rage, for it was cruell. To puniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the offence, is no leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice than to offend: and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute rigor upon a ſubmiſſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4182:80"/>
is more mercileſſe than juſt. The idle curioſitie of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> bred all this miſchief: what great evills ariſe from ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings? Raviſhment followes her wandring; upon her raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, murther; and upon the murtner, ſpoile.

            <p>IF <hi>Thamar</hi> had not put off her widowes apparell, <hi>Iudah</hi> had not taken her for a whore: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſtie of outward faſhion or geſture, bewraies evill deſires: the heart that means well, will never wiſh to ſeem ill, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we affect to ſhew better than we are, and it is no truſting

of thoſe which wiſh not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare good. <hi>Thamars</hi> belly ſwells, and <hi>Iudahs</hi> heart ſwells with rage, Let her be burnt. How eaſie is it to deteſt thoſe ſinnes in others, which wee flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in our ſelves?

Yet as wounds though healed leave a ſcar behind them; ſo injuries (though remitted) leave a guilty remembrance in the actors, and it muſt bee a great favor that can appeaſe the Conſcience of a great injurie: for a guilty conſcience ſeldom thinks it ſelfe ſafe.</p>
            <p>COrruption when it is chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, growes mad with rage,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:4182:82"/>
as the vapour in a cloud, which would not make that fearefull report, if it met not with oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. A good heart yeelds at the ſtilleſt voice of God; but his moſt gratious motions har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the wicked. Many would not have been ſo deſperately ſetled in their ſins, had not the Word controlled them. Any thing ſeems due worke to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall minde, ſave Gods ſervice; nothing ſuperfluous, but religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties. Chriſt tells us there is but one thing neceſſarie; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, there is nothing but that needleſſe.</p>
            <p>REligion doth not call to a weake ſimplicitie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes as much of the Serpent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:4182:83"/>
as the Dove. Lawfull Policies have from God both liberty in the uſe, and bleſſing in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. A wicked heart never looks inward to it ſelf, but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Reproover: if that afford exception, it is enough: as Dogs run firſt to revenge on the ſtone. What matter is it to me, who he be that admoniſhes mee? Let me looke home unto my ſelfe, and alſo to his advice; if that be good, my ſhame's the more to be reproved by an evill man. As a good mans allowance cannot warrant evill, ſo an evill mans reproof may remedy evil.</p>
            <p>NOthing but innocencie and knowledge can give ſound confidence to the heart.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:4182:83"/>
Ignorance as it makes bold, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding men into unknowne dangers, ſo it makes men often cauſeleſly fearfull. <hi>Herod</hi> feared Chriſts comming, becauſe hee miſtooke it; had the tyrant known the manner of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall regiment, hee had ſpared both his owne fright, and the bloud of others. And hence it is that wee feare death, becauſe we are not acquainted with the vertue of it.</p>
            <p>WOrdly Cares are fitly compared to Thornes; for as they choke the Word, ſo they prick our Soules: Neither can the word grow up amongſt them, nor the heart reſt upon them: Spirituall Cares are as
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:4182:84"/>
ſharp, but more profitable. They paine us, but leave the ſoule better: they breake our ſoule, but for a ſweeter reſt: we are not well, but either while we have them, or after wee have had them. It is impoſſible to have ſpirituall health without theſe, as to have bodily ſtrength with the other. Hee lives moſt contentedly, that is moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for this World, moſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute for the other.</p>
            <p>SAtan never feares us, but when we are well imploied: and the more likelihood hee ſees of our profit, the more is his envy and labour to diſtract us: he is ever buſieſt in our beſt actions, and moſt in the beſt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4182:84"/>
part of the beſt, as in the end of prayer, when the heart ſhould cloſe up it ſelf with moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. We ſhould therfore ſtrive ſo much the more towards our own good, as his malice ſtrives to interrupt it. We do nothing if we contend not when wee are reſiſted. The Devill ſteals upon us ſuddenly by temptations, becauſe he would foile us: and if we be not armed ere we be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, wee ſhall be foiled ere we can be armed.</p>
            <p>HE that intermits good Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, incurreth a double loſſe: of the bleſſing that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth good, and of the faculty in doing it. Want of uſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth diſabilitie, as Cuſtome,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:4182:85"/>
perfection: He that omits pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his cloſet, can hardly pray in publique, but with a cold formalitie. Hee that diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues meditation, ſhall be long in recovering; whereas the man inured to this exerciſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms both well and with eaſe.</p>
            <p>CHriſtianity is both an eaſie yoke, and a hard: hard to take up, eaſie to beare when once taken. The heart requires much labour ere it can be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtoop under it, and finds as much content when it hath ſtooped. The worldling thinks Religion great ſervitude: but the Chriſtian knowes whoſe ſlave he was, till he entred into this ſervice, and that no bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:4182:85"/>
can bee ſo ill, as freedome from theſe bands. Every good action hath his let, and hee can never be good as he ought, that is not reſolute. The regenerate Chriſtian both is, and knowes himſelfe truly great, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon mindeth and ſpeaketh of ſpirituall, immortall, glorious, Heavenly things: but every Worldling is baſe minded, and therefore his thoughts creepe ſtill low upon the earth. The more the ſoule ſtoopeth to earthly matters, the more unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate it is.</p>
            <p>ALl our future good wee hold only in hope: and the preſent fauour of God, wee have many times when we feele
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:4182:86"/>
it not. The ſtomacke finds the digeſtion, even in ſleep, though we perceive it not: We are moſt happy when wee know our ſelves ſo: But miſerable were many Chriſtians if they could not be happy, and know it not. It is not a mans naturall parts, but his graces that crown him: honeſt ſottiſhneſſe, is better than prophane eminence: None ever did ſo much miſchiefe to the Church, as thoſe that have been excellent in wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: others have been ſpitefull enough, but were not able to accompliſh their malice. That Enemy is moſt to bee feared, that hath both ſtrength and craft to hurt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:4182:86"/>THe Conſcience can have no perfect peace, while ſinne is within to vexe it, no more than an angry ſwelling can ceaſe throbbing &amp; aching, while the Thorne or corrupted Matter lies rotting under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. Time, that remedies all other evils of the mind, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this: which like to bodily diſeaſes, proves worſe with continuance, and growes upon us with our age. Sin is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Make-bait betwixt God and man, betwixt a man and himſelfe, ever working ſecret unquietneſſe to the heart. The guilty man may have a ſeeming Truce, a true peace hee cannot have: which makes the galled ſoule ſeek refreſhing in varietie
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:4182:87"/>
of pleaſures, places, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; yet after many ſuch vaine wearyings, finds no reſt, but complaines of remedileſſe and unabated torment: for alas what availes it to ſeeke outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefes, when our executioner is within us. <hi>Nero</hi> after ſo much innocent bloud ſhed, may change his Bed-chamber, but his Friends being as parts of himſelfe, will ever attend him. The ſoule may flee from the body, but the Conſcience will not flee from the Soule, nor ſin from the Conſcience. It is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power only, that can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the mind againſt the rage of inward troubles. When therefore thy Conſcience like a ſterne Sergeant ſhall catch
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:4182:87"/>
thee by the throat, and arreſt thee upon Gods debt, let thy only plea bee, that thou haſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie paid it: Bring forth that bloudy acquittance ſealed unto thee from Heaven by Faith in Chriſt, and ſtreight way thou ſhalt ſee the fierce and terrible looke of thy Conſcience chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into friendly ſmiles; and that rough and violent hand that was ready to drag thee to priſon, ſhall now lovingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thee, and fight for thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the wrongfull at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of any Spirituall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie. But the time wil come when the careleſſe ſinner ſhall bee plunged in woes, and ſhall therefore deſperately ſorrow, becauſe he ſorrowed not ſooner
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:4182:88"/>
for ſin: He may feaſt away his Cares for a while, and bury them with himſelf, in wine and ſleep; but after all theſe frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous evaſions, they will returne again, nor will they be repelled, but increaſed hereby. Sin owes him a ſpight, and perhaps will pay him when hee is in worſe caſe to ſuſtaine it; Namely, up- his Death-bed, which ſhall prove very grievous unto him, for his many wilfull adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Repentance.</p>
            <p>HE ſaid wel, who when ſome skilfull Aſtrologer upon calculation of his Nativitie, had foretold him ſome ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerning his future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; anſwered, Such perhaps I
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:4182:88"/>
was borne, but ſince that time I have been born again, and my ſecond Nativitie hath croſſed my firſt. The Power of Narure, is a good Plea for thoſe that acknowledge nothing above Nature: but for a Chriſtian to excuſe his intemperateneſſe by his naturall inclination, and to ſay, I am borne cholericke, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Amorous, &amp;c. is an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie worſe than the fault: For wherefore ſerves Religion, but to ſubdue or governe Nature? We are ſo much Chriſtians as wee can rule our ſelves, the reſt is but forme and ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>THere is no difference but continuance, betwixt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Madneſſe: for raging
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4182:89"/>
Anger is a ſhort Madneſſe, elſe what argues the ſhaking of the hands and lips; the paleneſſe, redneſſe, or ſwelling of the face, glaring of the eies, ſtammering of the Tongue, ſtamping with the Feet, unſteadie motions of the whole Body, wilde diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Speeches, and raſh Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which we remember not to have done. Doubtleſſe a milde Madnes is more tolerable, than frequent and furious Anger.</p>
            <p>OVr Cowardlineſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedneſſe, is Deaths chiefeſt advantage: wheras true boldneſſe in confronting him, diſmayes and weakens his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Happy is the Soule that can ſend out the Scouts of his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4182:89"/>
thoughts before-hand, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the power of Death, a far off, &amp; then can reſolutely incounter him at unawares upon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: ſuch a one lives ſecurely, and dies with Comfort: Death argues not Gods diſpleaſure: <hi>Abel</hi> whom God loved beſt, dies firſt, when the Murtherer <hi>Cain</hi> is puniſhed with living.</p>
            <p>COntentation is a rare Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, becauſe it either ariſes from a fruition of all comforts, or a not deſiring of ſome wee have not. We are never ſo bare, as not to have ſome benefits: never ſo ful, as not to want ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yea, as not to bee full of wants. God hath much adoe with us, either we lacke health,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:4182:90"/>
or quietneſſe, or Children, or wealth, or company, or our ſelves in all theſe. Nature is moderate in her deſires, but Conceit is inſatiable. Who cannot pray for his daily bread, when hee hath it in his Cup-bourd? but when our owne proviſion failes, then not to diſtruſt God is a noble triall of Faith. All grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging is odious, but moſt when our hands are full. To whine in the midſt of abundance, is a ſhamefull unthankfulneſſe: it is a baſe cowardiſe, ſo ſoon as ever we are called from the garriſon to the field, to think of running away: then is Fortune worthy of Prayſe, when wee can endure to be miſerable. O God, I have made an ill uſe of thy mercies,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:4182:90"/>
if I have not learned to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with thy corrections.</p>
            <p>NO benefit can ſtop the mouth of impatience, if our turne be not ſerved for the preſent, former favours are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgotten, or contemned. No marvell wee deale ſo with men, when God receives this meaſure from us. One Moone of ill weather makes us over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke all the bleſſings of God, and more to mutine at our ſence of evill, than to praiſe him for our variety of good. It is an unfound praiſe that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a man for one good action. Many diſtruſt God in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that are ready to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his guidance in their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:4182:91"/>
if wee follow God and murmure, it is all one as if wee ſtaid behinde. We can think him abſent in our wants, yet cannot ſee him abſent in our ſinnes: It is wickedneſſe, not affliction that argues him gone: for he is moſt preſent, when he moſt chaſtiſes. And the ſorrow of repentance comes never out of ſeaſon, all times are alike unto that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity where to we make our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall moanes: that which is paſt, and that which is future are both preſent with him. It is neither weake nor uncomely for an old man to weep for the ſins of his youth. Such teares can never bee ſhed either too ſoon or too late.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:4182:91"/>THere is ſcarſe a vicious man, who name is not rotten before his Carcaſſe: Contrarily, a good mans name is often heire to his life, either borne after the death of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent (Envy not ſuffering it to come forth before) or perhaps ſo well growne up in his life time, that the hope thereof is the ſtaffe of his age, and the joy of his death. The name of the wicked may be feared a while, but is ſoone forgotten, or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: The good mans either ſleepes with his body in peace, or wakes (as his ſoule) in glory. Vertue is not propagated: Children naturally poſſeſſe only, as bodily diſeaſes, ſo the vices of their Parents. The
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:4182:92"/>
grain is ſowne pure, yet comes up with chaffe and huske: Haſt thou a good ſon? he is Gods, not thine: Is he evill? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his ſinne is thine: Help by thy prayers and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to take away that which thou haſt given him, and to obtaine of God that which perhaps thou haſt, and canſt not give; elſe maiſt thou name him a poſſeſſion, but finde him a loſſe.</p>
            <p>SPirituall gifts are ſo chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, that who excels in one, hath alwaies ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in more: Faith is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a Bevy of Graces: he that beleeves cannot but have hope: if hope, patience:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4182:92"/>
he that beleeves and hopes, muſt needs have joy in God: if joy, love of God: hee that loves God, cannot but love his brother: his love to God breeds piety and care to pleaſe, ſorrow for offending, feare to offend. Vertues goe ever in troopes, and that ſo thicke, that ſometimes ſome are hid in the crowd, which yet are, but appeare not.</p>
            <p>IT is a rare evill that hath not ſomething to ſweeten it, either in ſence or in hope: otherwiſe men would grow deſperate, mutinous, envious of others, weary of themſelves. The better the thing is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we place our comfort, the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4182:93"/>
happier we live: and the more we love good things, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are to us: The world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling laughs more, but the Chriſtian is more delighted: Thou laugheſt not at the ſight of an heap of thy gold; yet thy delight is more than in a jeſt that ſhaketh thy ſpleene. As griefe, ſo joy is not leſſe, when it is leaſt expreſſed. It muſt needs be a ſtrong and nimble ſoule that can mount to heaven, poſſeſſing abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of earthly things. If thou finde wealth too preſſing, abate of thy load, either by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leſſe, or loving leſſe: or adde to the ſtrength of thy activity, that thou maiſt yet aſcend. It is more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4182:93"/>
by how much more hard, to climbe up to heaven with a burthen.</p>
            <p>THe meaner ſort of men would be too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, if they ſaw how far more pleaſant the life of others is: and if thoſe of higher ranke could looke downe to the infinite miſeries of their inferiours, it would make them either miſerable in compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or proud in conceit. It is good ſometimes for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate rich man to looke into the poore mans Cup-board; and ſeeing God in mercy lets him not know their ſorrows by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, yet to know it in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. Which will teach
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4182:94"/>
him more thankes to God, more mercy to men, and more contentment in himſelfe. I never ſaw Chriſtian leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for a wiſe neglect of himſelfe: If our dejection proceed from the conſcience of our want, it is poſſible wee ſhould be as little eſteemed of others, as of our ſelves: but if we have true Graces, and prize them not at the higheſt, others ſhall value both them in us, and us for them, and with uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry give us that honour we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held modeſtly from our ſelves. I never read of Chriſtian that repented him of too little worldly delight: he that takes his full liberty in what he may, ſhall repent him: how much
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:4182:94"/>
more in what hee ſhould not. The ſureſt courſe in all earthly pleaſures, is to riſe with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and to be ſatisfied with a little. That mans end is eaſie and happy, whom death findes with a weake body, and a ſtrong ſoule.</p>
            <p>HErein as much as in any thing the perverſneſſe of our nature appeares, that wee wiſh death, or love life upon wrong cauſes: we would live for pleaſure, and die for paine. <hi>Iob</hi> for his ſores, <hi>Elias</hi> for his perſecution, <hi>Ionas</hi> for his Gourd would preſently die, and outface God that it was better for him to die than to live. Wherein we are like to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:4182:95"/>
garriſon ſouldiers, that while they live within ſafe walls, and ſhew themſelves once a day, rather for ceremony and pompe, than need and danger, like warfare well enough: but being once called forth to the field, they hang the head, and wiſh themſelves at home.</p>
            <p>THe ſhipwrack of a good Conſcience, is the caſting away of all other excellencies: It is no rare thing to note the ſoule of a wilfull ſinner ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all her Graces, and by degrees expoſed to open ſhame: for ſince he hath caſt away the beſt, it is juſt with God to take away the worſt; and to caſt off them in leſſer
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:4182:95"/>
regards, which have rejected him in greater.</p>
            <p>THe tongue will hardly leave that to which the heart is inured: if we would have good motions to viſit us in ſickneſſe, we muſt ſend for them familiarly in health: for ſuch as a mans delights and cares are in health, ſuch are both his thoughts and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches commonly on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. And no marvell though the worldling often eſcapes earthly puniſhments: God corrects him not becauſe hee loves him not; he will not doe him the favour to whip him. The world afflicts him not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it loves him: for each
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:4182:96"/>
one is indulgent to his owne. God uſes not the rod, where he meanes to uſe the ſword: the Pillory or ſcourge is for thoſe Malefactors which ſhal eſcape execution.</p>
            <p>LAughing is proper to Man alone. amongſt all living creatures: though indeed he ought ever to be weeping, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ever ſins; and the beaſts might rather laugh to ſee man ſo much abuſe his moſt excellent part, his reaſon. Doubtleſſe if man knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came into the world, what ſhould be his portion in the world, he would feare his firſt day more than his laſt: wherefore we ought to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:4182:96"/>
our affections, and in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our great Lord and Saviour (who was a man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows) we ſhould not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compoſed of mirth.</p>
            <p>SEldome hath any man got either wealth or learning with eaſe: and the greateſt good is moſt difficult in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining: he muſt not thinke to get Chriſt, that takes no paines for him: If men can endure ſuch cutting, ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and ſearing of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, only to protract a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life for a ſhort time; how much ſhould we care, what we doe, or what we ſuffer, ſo wee may win Chriſt: No paine ſhould bee refuſed for the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:4182:97"/>
gaining of Eternity.</p>
            <p>MVch oſtentation, and much learning, ſeldome meet together: The Sun ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and declining makes long ſhadows, but being at the higheſt makes none at all. Skill when it is too much ſhewne loſeth the grace; as freſh coloured wares that are often opened, loſe their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and are ſoiled with much handling. It is better to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud our ſelves for having much of that we ſhew not, than that others ſhould applaud us for ſhewing more than we have The conſcience of our owne worth ſhould cheare us more in their contempt, than
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4182:97"/>
their approbation comfort us, againſt the ſecret check of our knowne unworthineſſe. Every man hath an heaven and a hell; Earth is the wicked mans hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, his hell is to come: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, the godly have their hell upon earth, where uſually they are vexed with many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and temptations by Sathan and his complices; their heaven is above in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe happineſſe: Though they ſow in teares, they ſhall reape in joy, though their ſeed time be commonly wateriſh and lowring, and their ſpring wet, they ſhall bee ſure of a cleare and joyfull harveſt. It is no marvell if the wicked have peace in themſelves, being as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4182:98"/>
ſure as temptation can make them. Princes wage not warre with their owne ſubjects. The The godly are ſtill enemies, and muſt therefore looke to be aſſaulted both by ſtratagems and violence. Wherefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould more joy us than our inward unquietneſſe. A juſt war is far more happy than an ill conditioned peace.</p>
            <p>EVery good prayer knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at heaven for a bleſſing, but an importunate prayer pierceth it, though as hard as braſſe, and makes way for it ſelfe into the eares of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. And as it aſcends lightly up, carried with the wings of faith, ſo it ever comes
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:4182:98"/>
laden downe againe upon our heads. In prayer our thoughts ſhould not be guided by our words, but our words by our thoughts. Good prayers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came weeping home; and by fervent prayer we are ſure to receive either what we aske, or what we ſhould aske.</p>
            <p>VErtuous actions are a mans beſt monument. Fooliſh is the hope of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and future praiſe, by the coſt of ſenceleſſe ſtone, when the Paſſenger ſhall only ſay, here lies a faire ſtone, and a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Carkaſſe. That only can report us rich, but for other praiſes our ſelves muſt build our owne Monuments alive,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:4182:99"/>
and write our owne Epitaphs in honeſt and honourable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Which are ſo much more noble than other, as living men are better than dead ſtones. We ſhould either procure ſuch a Monument to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by, or elſe wiſh to be buried in oblivion: for it is better be inglorious than infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
            <p>NO man is ſo happy as the regenerate Chriſtian; when he lookes up into heaven hee thinkes, That is my home, The God that made it and owes it, my Father: the Angels, more glorious in nature than my ſelfe, are my attendants. Yea, thoſe things that are moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:4182:99"/>
to the wicked, are moſt pleaſant to him. When hee heares God thunder above his head, he thinkes, This is the voice of my Father. When he remembreth the Tribunall of the laſt judgement, he thinkes, It is my Saviour that ſits in it. When death, he eſteemes it but as the Angel ſet before Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, which with one blow admits him to eternall joy. And (which is his greateſt comfort) nothing in earth or hell can make him miſerable.</p>
            <p>AN evill man is Clay to God, Waxe to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, God may ſtamp him into powder, or temper him anew, but none of his meanes will
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:4182:100"/>
melt him. Contrariwiſe, a good man is Gods Waxe, and Sathans Clay; hee relents at every looke of God, but is not ſtirred by any temptation, knowing, that earth affoords no ſound contentment. For what is there under heaven not troubleſome, beſides that which is called pleaſure? And that in the end we finde moſt irkſome of all other.</p>
            <p>THe ſpirits of Chriſtians are like the Engliſh Iett, whereof we reade, that it is fired with water, quenched with oyle. And theſe two, proſperity and adverſity are like heate and cold, the one gathers the powers of the ſoul
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:4182:100"/>
together, and makes them abler to reſiſt, by uniting them: The other diffuſes them, and by ſuch ſeparation makes them eaſier to conquer. The Sun more uſually cauſeth the Traveller to caſt off his cloake than the Winde. I hold it therefore as praiſe-worthy with God, for a man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to contemne a proffered honour or pleaſure for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, as on the Rack not to deny his profeſſion.</p>
            <p>THere is no vice doth ſo cover a man with ſhame, as to be found falſe and perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious: cleare and round dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the honour of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Certainely it is heaven
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4182:101"/>
upon earth, to have a mans minde move in charity, reſt in providence, and turne upon the poles of truth.</p>
            <p>THat man which ſtudies revenge, keepes his owne wounds greene, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would heale and doe well. Revenge is a kinde of wilde ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which the more mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture runs to, the more ought Law to roote it out. In taking revenge a man is but eaven with his enemy, but in paſſing over an injury he is ſuperiour.</p>
            <p>CHildren ſweeten labours, but they make misfortunes more bitter: they increaſe the cares of life, but they mitigate
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4182:101"/>
the remembrance of death. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents joyes are ſecret, and ſo are their feares and griefes: they cannot utter the one, nor will they utter the other. The perpetuity by generation is common to beaſts: but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, merit, and noble workes are proper to men.</p>
            <p>HEE that hath wife and children, hath given ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages to fortune, for they are impediments to great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes either of vertue or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes. Vnmarried men are beſt friends, beſt Maſters, beſt ſervants, but not alwayes beſt ſubjects, for they are light to run away, and almoſt all fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are of that condition.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4182:102"/>
A ſingle life doth well with Church-men: for charity will hardly water the ground, where it muſt firſt fill a poole. Grave natures led by cuſtome, and therefore conſtant, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly loving husbanda. Wives are young mens mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, companions for mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle age, and old mens Nurſes.</p>
            <p>CErtainly great perſons had need to borrow other mens opinions to thinke themſelves happy; for if they judge by their owne feeling, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde it ſo. Men in great place are thrice ſervants, to the Soveraigne or State, to fame, and to buſineſſe: ſo as they have no freedome, either in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:4182:102"/>
their perſons, actions, or time. It is a ſtrange deſire, to ſeeke power with loſſe of liberty; or to ſeeke power over others, and to loſe power over a mans ſelfe. The riſing unto paines is labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and by paines men come to great paines. Great perſons are the firſt that finde their owne griefes, but the laſt that finde their owne faults. The vices of authority are chiefly foure, delaies, corruption, roughneſſe, and facility. And it is an aſſured ſigne of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit, whom honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends: for honour is or ſhould be the place of Vertue.</p>
            <p>GOodneſſe of nature is a character of the Deity,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4182:103"/>
and without it a man is a buſie, miſchievous, and wretched thing, no better than a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Goodneſſe anſwers to the Theologicall Vertue, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and admits no exceſſe but error. Seek the good of other men, but be not in bondage to their faces, for that is facility or ſoftneſſe, which ſoone ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an honeſt minde priſoner.</p>
            <p>HEE that denies a God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes Mans nobility: for certainly man is of kin to the beaſts by his body: and if he be not of kin to God by his ſpirit, he is a baſe and ignoble creature. And doubtleſſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are the greateſt Atheiſts, who are ever hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

Things to bee ſeene and obſerved in travell, are, the Courts of Princes, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they give audience unto Embaſſadours: The Courts of juſtice while they ſit and heare cauſes: And ſo of Conſiſtories Eccleſiaſtick, the Churches and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with the Monuments that are therein extant: the Wals and Fortifications of Cities and Townes, with their havens and harbors, antiquities and

            <p>THe minde of man is more cheared and refreſhed by profiting in ſmall things, than
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:4182:104"/>
by ſtanding at a ſtay in great. It is a miſerable ſtate of minde to have few things to deſire, and many to feare. And yet that commonly is the caſe of Kings: who are like to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies, which cauſe good or evill times: having much veneration, but little or no reſt.</p>
            <p>THere is no greater wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, than well to tune the beginnings and onſets of things, that ſo neither haſt may harme thee, nor delay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee of what thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt. As in races it is not the large ſtride or high lift that makes the ſpeed; ſo in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the keeping cloſe to the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:4182:105"/>
matter, and not taking of it too much at once, procureth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. True diſpatch is a rich thing: for time is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of buſineſſe, as money is of wares; and buſineſſe is bought at a deare hand, where there is not diſpatch.</p>
            <p>SEeing God hath given us an uncertaine life, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine death, we ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the one, and ſhun the other, ſeeing the one failes us ſo ſoone, and the other infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly will come.</p>
            <p>I Had rather with charity help him that is miſerable, as I may be, than deſpiſe him that is poore, as I would not

Our eſtates are then beſt, when they are neither diſtended with too much, nor narrowly pent up with too little.

            <p>HEE that can be a worthy enemy, will, reconciled be a worthier friend: he that in a juſt cauſe can valiantly fight againſt thee, can in a like cauſe fight as valiantly for thee. And he that wilfully continueth an enemy, teacheth a man to do him a miſchiefe if be can.</p>

Good workes, and good inſtructions are the generative acts of the ſoule, and hee ungratefully ſlinkes away, that dies, and doth nothing to reflect a glory to heaven.

            <p>SVrely the world would bee much happier if there were no ſuch thing in it as gold: but ſince it is now the fountaine whence all things flow, I will care for it as I would for a Paſſe, to travell the world by without begging: If I have none, I ſhall have ſo much the more miſery, becauſe cuſtome hath played the foole in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it materiall when it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not.

Even the ſlave may ſometimes light on a way to enlarge his Maſter, when his own invention failes.

            <p>A Diſcontented man is a Watch over-wound, wreſted out of tune, and goes falſe. Griefe is like Inke

husbands to jealouſie, wiſe men to irreſolution and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. They are defects not in the heart, but in the braine, taking place in the ſtouteſt Natures. The beſt meanes to cleare the way in this wood of ſuſpitions, is frankly to communicate them with the party we ſuſpect, for thereby wee ſhall bee ſure to know more of the truth of them than we did before, and withall ſhall make the party more circumſpect, not to give farther cauſe of ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>CErtaine things are to bee privileged from jeſting, namely, Religion, matters of State, great perſons, any mans

Certainly he that hath a Satyricall vaine, as he maketh others afraid of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, ſo he had need be afraid of their memory. Speech of touch towards others ſhould be ſparingly uſed: for diſcourſe ought to be as a field, without comming home to any man. Diſcretion of ſpeech is more than eloquence, and to ſpeake agreeably to him with whom we have to deale, is more than to ſpeake in good words, or good order. He that queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth much, ſhall learne much; but eſpecially if he apply his queſtions to the skill of them whom he asketh, for hee ſhall

            <p>TO forſake or deſtitute a Plantation once in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe is a great ſin, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the diſhonour, it betraies many commiſerable perſons to utter ruine. The Planters chiefly ought to be Gardeners, Plowmen, Labourers, Smiths, Carpenters, Ioiners, Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Foulers, with ſome few Apothecaries, Surgeons, Cookes, and Bakers. When the Plantation growes to ſtrength, then (and not before) it is time to plant with women as well as men, that ſo the

            <p>AS the baggage to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſo is riches to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it cannot be ſpared, nor left behinde, but it hindereth the march; yea, and the care of it ſometimes loſeth or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbeth the Victory. Beleeve them not that ſeeme to deſpiſe riches; for they deſpiſe, that deſpaire of them, and none worſe when they enjoy them. Seeke no proud riches, but ſuch as thou maiſt get juſtly, uſe ſoberly, diſtribute cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and leave contentedly. A great State left to an heire is as a lure to all the Birds of

            <p>AMbition is like choler, as that is an humour which makes men active, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, full of alacrity, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, while it hath vent; being ſtopped becomes aduſt, and thereby maligne and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.

beſt pleaſed when things goe backward. He that ſeekes emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence among able men hath a great taske; but that is ever good for the publique. But he that plots to be the only fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure among Ciphers, is the decay of a whole age.</p>
            <p>MAns nature runs either to herbes or weeds, therefore the one ſhould be ſeaſonably watered, and the other deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In Cuſtome, whatſoever a man commands upon himſelf, let him ſet houres for it: But what is agreeable to nature, let him take no care for any ſet times, for his thoughts will fly to it of themſelves. A mans nature is beſt perceived in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:4182:113"/>
for there is no affectation in paſſion, for that puts a man out of his precepts: and in a new caſe or experiment, for there Cuſtome leaveth him.</p>
            <p>A Man ſhould not force a habit upon himſelf with perpetuall continuance, but with ſome intermiſſion, for both the pauſe re-enforceth the new onſet; and if a man that is not perfect be ever in practiſe, he ſhall as well pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe his errors, as his abilities, and induce one habit of both. He that ſeekes victory over his nature, ſhould not ſet himſelfe too great nor too ſmall taskes: for the firſt will deject him by often failings; and the ſecond
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:4182:113"/>
will make him a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeder, though by often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailings: at the firſt he ſhould uſe helps, as young ſwimmers doe bladders and ruſhes: but after a time let him practiſe with diſadvantages, as dancers doe with thick ſhooes: for it breeds great perfection if the practiſe be harder than the uſe. Nature is often hidden, ſometimes overcome, but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome extinguiſhed. Force makes nature more violent in the returne, doctrine and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe makes it leſſe importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: only Cuſtome doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſubdue it.</p>
            <p>MEns thoughts are much according to their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:4182:114"/>
their diſcourſe and ſpeech according to their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and infuſed opinions; but their deeds are ever as they have been accuſtomed. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould by all meanes endeavour to obtaine good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes in our younger yeares, for thoſe cuſtomes are moſt perfect, and this we call educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in effect is but an early cuſtome.</p>
            <p>FOrtune is to be honoured and reſpected, and it be but for her two daughters Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Reputation: for thoſe two felicity breedeth: the firſt within a mans ſelfe, the later in others towards him. Certainly there are not two
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:4182:114"/>
more fortunate properties, than to have a little of the foole, and not too much of the honeſt.</p>
            <p>VErtue is like a rich ſtone, beſt plaine ſet, and ſutes beſt in a comely body, though not of delicate feature, but hath rather dignity of preſence than beauty of aſpect. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it almoſt ſeene, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beautifull perſons are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of great vertue: As if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were rather buſie not to erre, than in labour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce excellency: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they prove accompliſhed, though not of great ſpirit, and ſtudy rather behaviour than Vertue. But this is not alwaies
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:4182:115"/>
though for the moſt part. Beauty like ſummer fruits, is eaſily corrupted, and cannot laſt, and commonly it makes a diſſolute youth, and an age a little out of countenance: but againe, doubtleſſe if it light well, it makes vertues ſhine, and vices bluſh. Deformed perſons are commonly eaven with nature; for as nature hath done ill by them, ſo doe they by nature, being for the moſt part (as ſaith the Scripture) void of naturall affection, and ſo they have their revenge of nature. Whoſoever hath any thing fixed in his perſon indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing contempt, hath alſo a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſpur in himſelfe to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue and deliver his perſon
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:4182:115"/>
from ſcorne: wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all deformed perſons are extreame bold; firſt as in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of themſelves, expoſed to ſcorne, but in proceſſe of time by a generall habit. It ſtirs up alſo induſtry, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this kinde, to watch and obſerve the weakneſſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they may have ſomething to repay.</p>
            <p>IN civill government it is good to uſe men of one ranke equally: for to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſome extraordinarily makes them impudent, and the reſt diſcontented, becauſe they may claime a like due. To be governed by one is not ſafe, for it ſhewes ſoftneſſe, and gives a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:4182:116"/>
freedome to ſcandall and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation: for he that would not cenſure or ſpeake ill of a man immediatly, will talke more boldly being ſo great with him, and perhaps wound his honour. Yet to be diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with many is worſe: for it makes men to be of the laſt impreſſion, full of Change. To take advice of ſome few friends is very honourable: for lookers on many times ſee more than gameſters, and the Vale beſt diſcovereth the hill.</p>
            <p>STudies perfect Nature, and are perfected by experience: for naturall abilities are like naturall plants, that need proyning by ſtudy. And ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:4182:116"/>
themſelves doe give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience. To ſpend too much time in ſtudies, is ſloath: to uſe them too much for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament is affectation: to make judgement wholly by their rules is the honour of a Scholer. Crafty men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne ſtudies, ſimple men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire them, only wiſe men uſe them. Studies ſerve for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ornament, and ability: their chiefe uſe for delight is in privateneſſe; for ornament, in diſcourſe: and for ability, in judgement and diſpoſition of buſineſſe: for expert men can execute and perhaps judge of particulars one by one: but
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:4182:117"/>
the generall Councells, and the plots and marſhalling of affaires, come beſt from thoſe that are learned. Reade not to contradict and confute, nor to beleeve and take for granted; not to finde talk and diſcourſe, but to weigh and conſider. Some bookes are to be taſted only, others to be ſwallowed, and ſome few to bee chewed and digeſted: That is, ſome are to be read only in parts, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers curſorily, and few wholly and with diligent attention. Reading makes a full man, Conference a ready man, and Writing an exact man. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that writes little had need have a great memory: he that confers little had need
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:4182:117"/>
have a preſent wit: and hee that reades little had need have much cunning, to ſeeme to know that he doth not. Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry makes men wiſe, Poetry witty, naturall Philoſophy deepe, Morall, grave: Logick and Rhetorick able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. There is no ſtone or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment in the wit, but may be wrought out by fit ſtudies: like as diſeaſes of the body may have appropriate exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; bowling is good for the ſtone and reines: ſhooting for the lungs and breaſt: gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle walking for the ſtomach; riding for the head, &amp;c. So, wandring wits ſhould ſtudy the Mathematicks; for in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, if fancy bee
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:4182:118"/>
drawne away never ſo little, they muſt begin againe. Let a wit not apt to diſtinguiſh or finde differences, ſtudy the School men. And he that is apt to beat over matters, and to call up one thing to prove and illuſtrate another, ſhould ſtudy Law Caſes: ſo every defect of the minde may have a ſpeciall Receit.</p>
            <p>OVr behaviour ſhould bee like our apparell, not too ſtraite or point device, but free for exerciſe or motion. Men had need beware how they bee too perfect in complements; for be they never ſo ſufficient otherwiſe, their enviers will be ſure to give them that attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:4182:118"/>
to the diſadvantage of their greater vertues.</p>
            <p>Opinion many times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth verity: Praiſe from the vulgar ſort is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly falſe: becauſe they underſtand not many excellent vertues: the loweſt vertues draw praiſe from them: Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle vertues aſtoniſh them: but of the higheſt vertues they have no ſence or perceiving at all. Certainly fame is like a River, that beares up things light and ſwolne, and drownes things weighty and ſolid. Vaine glorious men are the ſcorne of wiſe men, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of fooles, the Idols of Paraſites, and the ſlaves of their
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:4182:119"/>
owne vaunts. Vaine glory ſutes beſt with Commanders, and ſouldiers: for as iron ſharpens iron, ſo by glory, one courage ſharpeneth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>IVdges ought to bee more learned than witty, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend than plauſible, more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed than confident: and ought alſo to remember, that their office is <hi>Ius dicere,</hi> and not <hi>Ius dare;</hi> to interpret Law, and not to make or give Law. Elſe will it be like the authority of the Church of Rome, which under pretext of expoſition of Scripture, doth not ſticke to adde and alter, pronouncing what they doe not finde, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:4182:119"/>
by ſhew of antiquity doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce novelty. The principall duty of a Iudge is to ſuppreſſe force and fraud: Force being moſt pernitious, when open; and fraud when it is cloſe and diſguiſed. One foule ſentence doth more hurt than many foule examples: for theſe doe but corrupt the ſtreame, the other corrupts the fountaine. In caſes of life and death Iudges ought (as far as the Law permitteth) in juſtice to remember mercy; and to caſt a ſevere eye upon the example, but a mercifull eye upon the perſon. Patience and gravity of hearing is an eſſentiall part of Iuſtice: and an over ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iudge is no well-tuned
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:4182:120"/>
Symbal. It is ſtrange to ſee that boldneſſe of Advocates ſhould prevaile with Iudges: whereas they ſhould imitate God, who repreſſeth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, and giveth grace to the modeſt. The place of Iuſtice is an hallowed place, and therefore not only the Bench, but the footpace and precincts thereof ought to be preſerved without ſcandall or corruption. For certainly (as the Scripture ſaith) Grapes will not be gathered of thorns, nor Figs of thiſtles: Neither can Iuſtice yeeld her fruit with ſweetneſſe, among the Briars and Brambles of catching and polling Clerks and Miniſters. An ancient Clerke, skilfull in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:4182:120"/>
Preſidents, wary in proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and underſtanding in the buſineſſe of the Court, is an excellent finger of a Court, and doth many times point the way to the Iudge himſelfe.</p>
            <p>ANger is certainly a kind of baſeneſſe, as it appears well in the weakneſſe of thoſe ſubjects in which it reignes. Children, women, old folkes, ſick folkes: Only men muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that they cary their anger rather with ſcorn than feare, ſo that they may ſeeme rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the injury than below it; which may eaſily be done, if we can maſter our Paſſion by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The prime motive of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is to be ſencible of hurt:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:4182:121"/>
and therefore tender and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate bodies muſt needs be oft angry, having ſo many things to trouble them, which robuſt natures have little ſence of.</p>
            <p>PVblique reproofe is like ſtriking a Deere in the Heard; it not only wounds him to the loſſe of inabling blood, but betrayes him to the Hound his enemy, and makes him be puſhed out of company by his fellows. To be plaine in reproofe argues honeſty, but to be pleaſing argues diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Sores are not to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht with a ruſtick preſſure, but gently ſtroaked with a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:4182:121"/>CHriſtian ſociety is like a bundle of ſticks laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereof one kindles ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as ſolitary men have few provocations to evill, ſo againe have they feweſt incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to good. So much as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good is better than not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evill; will I account Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian good fellowſhip better than an Hermitiſh and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſolitarineſſe.</p>
            <p>AMbitious men are like poyſoned Rats, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taſted of their baine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt till they drinke, and then reſt much leſſe till their death; for ambition affoords as much diſcontentment in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying as in want. It is better
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:4182:122"/>
to live in the wiſe mans ſtocks in a contented want, than in a fooles Paradiſe, to be vexed with wilfull unquietneſſe.</p>
            <p>SVrely we deceive our ſelves, to thinke that on earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued joyes would pleaſe: It is a way that croſſes that which Nature goes: nothing would be more tedious than to bee glutted with perpetuall jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Were the body tyed to one (though moſt delicate) diſh alwaies, after a ſmall time it would complaine of loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſaciety; and ſo would the ſoule if it did ever Epicure it ſelfe in joy. I know not well which is the more uſefull: Ioy is to be choſen for pleaſure;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:4182:122"/>
but adverſities are the beſt for profit: and ſometimes theſe doe ſo far help us, that wee ſhould without them want much of the joy we have.</p>
            <p>VAlour is then beſt temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when it can turne out of a ſterne fortitude, into the milde ſtraines of pitty. For though pitty be a downy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, yet ſhe never ſhines more brightly than when ſhe is clad in ſteele. A Marſhall man compaſſionate, ſhall conquer both in peace and war, and by a twofold way get victory with honour.</p>
            <p>WIth a generall ſwallow death ſtill gapes upon
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:4182:123"/>
the generall world: It is a ſleepe eternall; the bodies diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, the rich mans feare, the poore mans wiſh, an event inevitable, an uncertaine jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, a theefe that ſteales away Man: Sleepes father, Lifes flight, the departure of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and the reſolution of all.</p>
            <p>THe idle man is like a dumbe Iack in a Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; while all the other dance out a winning muſick, this like a member out of joynt, ſullens the whole body with an ill diſturbing lazineſſe. It is action only that keepes the ſoule both ſweet and ſound, whileſt lying ſtill doth rot it to an ordured noyſomneſſe.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:4182:123"/>
There is no creature but is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in ſome action for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the reſtleſſe world: Nor is the teeming earth it ſelfe weary, after ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares productions. Men learne to doe ill, by doing what is next it nothing: for while we want buſineſſe, wee are ready to drown in the mud of vice, and ſloathfulneſſe. The ſoule growes bright with uſe and negotiation: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it induſtry is never whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unfruitfull, if it bring not joy with the in-comming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, it will baniſh miſchiefe from thy buſied gates: There is a kinde of good Angel wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon diligence, that ever carries a Laurell in his hand to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:4182:124"/>
crowne her: but the boſomed fiſt beckens the approach of poverty, and leaves beſides the noble head ungarded: while the lifted arme doth frighten want, and is ever a ſhield to the noble director.</p>
            <p>CErtainly they worke by a wrong engine, that ſeeke to gaine their ends by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: You may ſtroke the Lion into bondage, but you may ſooner hew him in pieces than beat him into a chaine. Eaſie nature and free liberty will ſteale a man into a winy exceſſe, when urged healths doe but ſhew him the way to refuſe. The nobleſt weapon wherewith man can conquer,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:4182:124"/>
is love and gentleſt curteſie. Nature is more apt to be led by the ſoft motions of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall tongue, than the ruſticke threſhings of a ſtriking arme. How many have loſt their hopes, while they have ſought to raviſh with too rude a hand. Little fiſhes are twitched up with the violence of a ſudden pull; when the like action cracks the line whereon a great one hangs. I have knowne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials that had never been given but for the earneſtneſſe of the requeſter: Vrge a grant to ſome men, and they are inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: ſeeme careleſſe and they will force the thing upon you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:4182:125"/>THe beſt object of bounty is either neceſſity, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert: the beſt motive, thy own goodneſſe: and the limit is, the ſafety of thy ſtate. It is for none but him that is all, to give to all abundantly. To live well of a little, is a great deale more honour, than to ſpend a great deale vainly. It is not good to make our kindneſſe to others, to be cruelty to our ſelves and ours.</p>
            <p>CErtainly if there bee any <hi>Dalilah</hi> under heaven, it is in bad ſociety: it bindes us, betrayes us, blindes us, undoes us. Many a man had been good that is not, if he had but kept good company. Ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:4182:125"/>
is an engine wherewith the devill is ever practiſing to lift man out of Vertues ſeat: It is the ſpirituall Whore, which toyes the good man to his ſoules undoing. Good company ſhould be cheriſhed as the choice of men; or as Angels that are ſent for Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians: but we ſhould ſtudy to loſe the ſociety of the bad, leſt by keeping them, we loſe our ſelves in the end.</p>
            <p>THe jollities of the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous man ſtagger the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious minde: They live as if they were paſſing through the world in ſtate, and the ſtreame of proſperity turning it ſelfe to rowle with their

applauded wayes: when how miſerable is deſpiſed vertue, and how ſtormy is her ſea? Certainly for the preſent the good man ſeemes to be in the diſgrace of heaven: he ſmarts and pines, and ſaddens his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combered ſoule, living as it were in the frowne and nod of the traducing world: ſo that to view the vertuous but with natures eye, a man would think they were things that Nature envyed; or that the whole world were deluded with a poiſonous lye, in making only the vertuous happy. Innocence is become a ſtaire, to let others riſe to our abuſe, and not to raiſe our ſelves to greatneſſe. How rare is it to finde one
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:4182:126"/>
raiſed for his ſober worth and vertue. <hi>Ioſephs</hi> goodneſſe alone brought him to the ſtocks and irons: whereas if he had coap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his enticer it is like he might have ſwom in Gold, and lived a lapling to the ſilkes and dainties. Doubtleſſe we may finde a ſoule within our ſoules which tels we doe unnobly, while we love ſin more for the pleaſure of it, than we doe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue for the animall ſweetneſſe ſhe yeelds in her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>SVrely cowards have ſoules of a courſer mixture than the common ſpirits of men. The coward really meets with far more dangers than the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant man: Every baſe nature
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:4182:127"/>
will be ready to offer injuries where they thinke they will not be repaid: he will many times beat a coward, that would not dare to ſtrike him if he thought him valiant. An unappalled looke doth daunt a baſe attempter, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times if a man hath nothing but a couragious eye, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects him: the brave ſoule knowes no trembling: and indeed valour caſts a kinde of honour upon God, in that wee ſhew we beleeve his goodneſs, when we truſt our ſelves in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon his care only. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the coward eclipſes his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, by unworthy doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God will not bring him off, ſo unjuſtly accuſing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4182:127"/>
either his power or his will, while he would make himſelfe his owne Saviour, he becomes his owne confounder: For, it is juſt with God to leave Man when he diſtruſts him. No ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour can defend a fearefull heart; when hee would runne away, feare arreſts him with a ſenceleſſe amaſement, which betraies him to the purſuite of his foes. I had rather have a minde confident and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with ſome troubles, than a pulſe ſtill beating feare in the fluſh of proſperity.</p>
            <p>IT is compariſon more than reality, that makes men both happy and miſerable. Were all the world ugly, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

would be no Monſter. In thoſe Countries where all goe naked, they neither ſhame at their being uncovered, nor complaine that they are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the violence of the Sun and Windes. Many never finde themſelves in want, till they have diſcovered the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſome others: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againe doe beare their want with eaſe, when they finde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers below themſelves in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe: Our adverſity is leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened by ſeeing our enemies in worſe eſtate than onr ſelves. We pick our owne ſorrowes out of the joyes of other men; and out of their ſorrowes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we aſſume our joyes. When we ſee the poore toiling

Labourer, we looke upon our ſelves with gladneſſe: but when we eye the diſtributers of the earth in their royalty, then what poore Atomes doe we count our ſelves, compared with thoſe huge piles of State.</p>
            <p>THe proud man and the cholerick, ſeldome arrive at any height of vertue. They are ſometimes borne to good parts of nature, but they rarely, are knowne to adde by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. It is the milde and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſpoſition that oftneſt doth attaine to eminence. Temper and humility are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious vertues for buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to riſe by. Pride and Choler make ſuch a noiſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:4182:129"/>
that they awake dangers, which the other with a ſoft tread ſteales by undiſcovered. Temper and humility are like the Foxe when hee went into the Garner: he could creep in a little hole, and arrive at plenty: Pride and Choler are like the Foxe offering to goe out when his belly was full, which enlarging him big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the paſſage, made him ſtay and be taken with ſhame. They that would come to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment by pride, are like them that aſcend a paire of ſtaires on horſeback, it is ten to one but the beaſt will caſt them before they come to tread their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Pride is an enemy to it ſelfe, the proud man cannot
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:4182:129"/>
endure to ſee pride in another. Pride and Choler are both baſe vices, as being both awed by the moſt abject paſſion of the minde, feare: we dare nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be proud to one that can puniſh us; nor cholerick to one much above us. Why ſhould we live like beaſts, puſht at by all the world for loftineſſe? or like Waſpes, ſtinging upon every touch?</p>
            <p>BEnefits are ſo long grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as we thinke we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay them, but when they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge more, our thankes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to hate: it is not good to make men owe us more than they are able to pay, except it be for vertuous deſerts, which
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:4182:130"/>
may in ſome ſort challenge it. The Malefactor which thou ſaveſt, will if he can condemne thee. Some ſay that <hi>Cicero</hi> was ſlaine by one, whom his Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had defended when he was accuſed of his Fathers mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whatſoever favours thou imparteſt, let them be to thoſe of deſert: It will be much for thy honour, when by thy kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe men ſhall ſee thou affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſt vertue. It is only in rank grounds that much rain makes weeds ſpring: where the ſoile is cleane, and well planted, there is the more fruit return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſhowres that did fall upon it.</p>

It is for the moſt part true, Fortune firſt fooles the man ſhe meanes to foile.

            <p>FOoliſh baſhfulneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traies us to all inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: it brings a foole in bond to his utter undoing: how

many maids are undone by it, even bluſhing oftentimes brings them to their devirgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; making their faces lures to enkindle lewd mens loves, which being expreſſed by large gifts, doe ſo work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Natures, as they know not how to deny, ſo rather then be ungratefull, they oft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unchaſt. In friendſhip it is an odious vice, and lets a man run on in abſurdities, for feare of diſpleaſing by telling the fault: Yet ſurely the Graces ſojourne with the blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing man. Modeſty is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertue to curbe and keep us from the ſtray and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. I am perſwaded many had been bad that are not, if
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:4182:131"/>
they had not been bridled by a baſhfull nature; divers have hearts for vice, which have not face accordingly. Baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with a ſilent kinde of Majeſty (like a Watch at the doore of a Theeves Den) makes vice not dare peepe out of the heart, wherein it is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Modeſty in women ſhould be like the Angels flaming ſword, to keep vile men out of the Paradiſe of their chaſtity.</p>
            <p>SVſpitious thoughts, like new Wine, boile in our breaſts, to the hazzard of the hogſhead, for want of venting. The wiſe and honeſt are never fooled with this quality; hee that knows he deſerves not ill,

            <p>VAinglory at beſt is but like a Window Cuſhion, ſpecious without, and garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the taſſeled pendant, but within nothing but hay or ſome ſuch traſh, not worth the looking on. Where the heart is full the tongue is ſeldome liberall: the tongue is the hollow inſtrument that ſounds lowdeſt. Whatſoever good worke the hand builds, is again pulled downe by the folly of a boaſting tongue. To doe well is as much as a good man la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:4182:132"/>
for: The honeſt man takes more pleaſure in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe ſo, than in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all the world approves him ſo. He that remembers too much his owne vertues, teacheth others to object his vices. We diſgrace the worke of vertue, when we goe about any way to ſeduce Voices for her approbation.</p>
            <p>HOpe is both a flatterer and a true friend; it is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable mans god, which in the hardeſt gripe of calamity ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failes to yeeld him beames of comfort: It is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous mans devill, which leads him a while in a ſmooth way, and then makes him

breake his neck on the ſudden, Hope is to Man, as a bladder to a learning ſwimmer, it keeps him from ſinking in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Waves, and by that help he may attaine the exerciſe. But when it makes him venture beyond his heigth, and breakes, or a ſtorm ariſes, he drownes without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. How many would die did not hope ſuſtaine them? How many have dyed by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping too much? She dandles us into killing flames, ſings us into Lethargies, and like an over-haſty Surgeon, skinneth dangers that are full and foule within. Againe, he that hopes for nothing, will never attaine to any thing. This good comes
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:4182:133"/>
of over hoping, that it ſweetens our paſſage through the world, and ſometimes ſo ſets us to worke, as it produces great actions, though not alwaies pat to our ends.</p>
            <p>THe end of Policy is to make a mans ſelfe great: the end of Love is to advance another.

Policy in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is like Logick in truth, ſomething too ſubtill for the plaineſſe of diſcloſing hearts. For a friend to converſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, let me rather meet with a

            <p>HEE that is perfect and marries not, may in ſome ſort be ſaid to be guilty of a contempt againſt Nature: when the husband and wife are
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:4182:135"/>
together, the world is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in a bed; and without this, like the head and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy parted, either would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume without a poſſibility of reviving. A wiſe wife com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends both Sexes, ſhe is woman for her body, and ſhe is man within, for her ſoule is like her husbands. Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a woman with a wiſe ſoul is the fitteſt companion for man, otherwiſe God would have given him a friend rather than a wife. It is the crowne of bleſſings, when in one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a man findeth both a wife and a friend. Poverty in Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock is a great decayer of love and contentation: Above all, therefore the generous minde
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:4182:135"/>
ſhould beware of marrying poore; for though hee cares leaſt for wealth, yet will he be moſt galled with the want of it. Single life is to be liked in thoſe who can ſuffer Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, but ſhould all live thus, an hundred yeares would make the world a Deſart.</p>
            <p>NOthing makes a man more like to God than Charity. As all things are filled with his goodneſſe, ſo the Vniverſall is partaker of the good mans ſpreading love. Wealth in a Miſers hand is uſeleſſe, as a lockt up treaſure: It is charity only that makes Riches worth the owning. To every thing that hath ſence
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:4182:136"/>
there is a kinde of pitty ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Solomons</hi> good man is mercifull to his beaſt. Surely he that is right, muſt not think his Charity to one in need, a curteſie, but a debt, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at his firſt being bound him to pay; yet ſhould we not water a ſtrange ground to leave our owne in drought.</p>
            <p>MVſick is good or bad, as the end to which it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: they that wholly deſpiſe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:4182:136"/>
his veines, when the very aire he breathes in frisketh in a tickled motion? We finde Halelujahs are ſung in heaven: and doubtleſſe Muſick is a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per both to good and ill: it is therefore to be honoured when it moves to uertue; as to bee ſhunned when it would flatter into vice.</p>
            <p>REpentance is ſo powerfull, that it cannot be but a gift of the Deity: he is not to be pittied in his ſufferings, that may eſcape a torment by the compunction of a heart and teares. Sometimes a returne after failing is a prompter to a ſurer hold. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doubts not to ſay, that <hi>Peter</hi> by his fall
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:4182:137"/>
found more grace than he loſt, his faith being thereby much ſtronger. The devill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times coſens himſelfe by plunging man into a deepe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. A ſudden ill act grows often abhorred in the minde that did it: yet a man ſhould beware the ſteps he once hath ſtumbled at. Doubtleſſe that is the beſt life that is a little ſprinkled with the ſalt of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the other would quickly be ranke and tainted. There are whoſe paths are waſht with butter, and the Roſe bud crownes them: but ſurely it is a miſery to live in oily vice, when her waies are made ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery with her own ſlime. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is not had without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

            <p>COmmanders in war ſhould be wiſe, valiant, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced: Experience puts a credit on their actions, making them far more prompt in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. And indeed there is a great deale of reaſon why we ſhould reſpect him, that with an untainted valour hath growne old in armes, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the drum beat. When every minute death ſeemes to paſſe by and ſhun him, he is as one that the ſupreame God hath cared for, and by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular guard defended in the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:4182:138"/>
haile of death. It is true, it is a life tempting to exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; yet this is more in the common ſort, that are preſſed, as the refuſe and burthen of the land, than in thoſe that by a nobler breeding are abler to command. Want, idleneſſe, and the deſperate face of blood hath hardened them to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages. Nor may we wonder hereat, ſince even their life is but an ordered quarrell, raiſed to the feud of killing. Wars have the ſame nature with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, they muſt be, yet are they mightily in fault that cauſe them. When a juſt cauſe and a juſt deputation meet for war, I ſhall ever thinke this one of the nobleſt and moſt

            <p>BLots appeare fouler in a ſtrict life, than a looſe one: no man wonders at the Swines wallowing: but to ſee an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min mired is a prodegy: Where doe vices ſhew ſo foule as in a Miniſter? When he ſhall be heavenly in the pulpit only? Certainly they wound the Goſpell, that preach it to the world, and live as if they thought to goe to heaven ſome other way than that they teach the people. How unſeemly is it when a grave Caſſock ſhall be lined with a wanton Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler? and with crimes that make a looſe one odious? We ſhould not profeſſe that wee
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:4182:139"/>
will not ſtrive to practiſe. Surely God will bee ſevereſt againſt thoſe that will weare his badge, and ſeeme his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, yet inwardly ſide with the devill and luſts: They ſpot his honour, and cauſe profane ones to jeſt at his holineſſe. Other offences God may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, this he muſt, left the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his truth triumph againſt him. If thou beeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound within, ſoile not the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious robe of truth by putting it upon thy beaſtlineſſe.

            <p>THe beſt way of ſpeech is to be ſhort, plaine, mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall. Tedious admonitions dull the adviſed, and make the giver contemptible. It is a ſhort reproofe that ſtaies like a ſtab in the memory: and many times three words doe more good than an idle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of three houres. A li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitleſſe tongue is a ſtrange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitted beaſt to worry one with: A talkative fellow is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced drum, which beats a wiſe man out of his wits. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature did not guard the tongue with the double fence of teeth and lips, but that ſhee

            <p>GOod men have moſt right to the beſt of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and ſeeing Wine was given to cheare the heart, why ſhould I not uſe it to that end: for ſurely the merry ſoule is freer from intended miſchiefe, than the thoughtfull man: and a bounded mirth is a Patent adding time and happineſſe to the crazed life of man; without which he is but a meere lumpe of quickned care: For as there are many that in their life aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume too great a liberty: ſo doubtleſſe there are ſome that abridge themſelves of what they might lawfully uſe:
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:4182:140"/>

            <p>I Never yet found Pride in a noble Nature; nor humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in an unworthy minde. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance is a Weed that ever growes in a dunghill; it is from the rankneſſe of that ſoile ſhe hath her height and ſpreadings. To be humble to our Superiours is duty; to our equals curteſie; to our Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours nobleneſſe. If ever Pride be lawfull, it is when it meets with audacious Pride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers: for then many times the affronting man by his own

            <p>Vlee is a myery deepneſſe: If thou ſtriveſt to helpe one out and doeſt not, thy ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him ſinkes him in the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Fury is the madder for his Chaine. When thou chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thy wandring friend, do it ſecretly, in ſeaſon, in love. Certainly he is drunke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that prophanes reaſon ſo as to urge it to a drunken man. To admoniſh a man in the height of his paſſion, is to call a Souldier to councell in the heat of a Battell: Let the Combate ſlack, and then thou maiſt expect a hearing.

            <p>TO finde friends when wee have no need of them, and to want them when wee have, are both alike eaſie and common. And certainly it is not the leaſt part of mans mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, that hee can neither bee truly happy without a friend, nor yet know him to be a true friend without his being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.

            <p>INfidelity is the cauſe of all our woes, the ground of all our ſins: not truſting God, we diſcontent our ſelves with feares and ſolicitations; and to cure theſe, we run into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited pathes: Vnworthy earthen Worme, to thinke that he that graſps the unemptied proviſions of the world in his hand, can be a niggard to his Sons, unleſſe he ſees it be for their good and benefit. O my God, let me finde my heart du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:4182:142"/>
and my faith upon triall ſtedfaſt, that I may but ſerve thee, and depend upon thee, and then I need beg no farther ſupply; for theſe will bee ground enough for ſufficient happineſſe while I live here.</p>
            <p>NEither example nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept (unleſſe in matters wholly religious) can be the abſolute guides of a diſcreete man; It is only a knowing and a practicall judgement of his owne that can direct him in the Maze of this life, in the buſtle of the world, in the twitches and twirles of Fate: for mans life is like a State, ſtill caſuall in the future: and he that lives alwaies by booke

Rules, ſhall ſhew himſelfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and a foole. I will doe that which I ſee is comely, (ſo it be not diſhoneſt) rather than take grave advice to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>VIce ruleth as a god in this preſent evill world, and it is impoſſible to live and not encounter her: Wherefore it is good to be acquainted with Vertue alſo; that the true beauty of the one may draw our affections from the ugly deformity of the other: And happy is hee that makes other mens vices, ſteps for him to climbe to heaven by.</p>

               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:4182:143"/>THe good man is he to whom life and death is indifferent: for he knowes, while he is here God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him; and that when hee goes hence God will receive him. Certainly we are never quiet in any thing long, till we have conquered the feare of death; every ſpectacle of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality terrifies, and every caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all danger affrights us. Feare of death kils us often, when death it ſelfe can doe it but once. But he that would not die when he muſt, and he that would die when he muſt not, are Cowards alike: And why ſhould we feare to doe that at any time, which we know wee muſt doe once. But what wee
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:4182:144"/>
cannot do till our time comes, let us not ſeeke to doe before. He that hath lived well, will ſeldome be unwilling to die: for death hath nothing in it terrible, but what our life hath made ſo.

            <p>VErtue were but a kinde of miſery, if fame only were all the Garland that did crown her: but in heaven is laid up a more glorious and eſſentiall recompence.

            <p>A Prince that leaveth law, and ruleth himſelfe and others by his owne appetite and affections, is of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the worſt, and of all beaſts the moſt furious and dangerous: for that nothing is ſo outragious as injuſtice armed, and no armour is ſo ſtrong as Wit and Authority: whereof the firſt he hath as he is a Man; and the other as he is a Prince.</p>

            <p>THoſe ſins are greater which are committed
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:4182:146"/>
through luſt, than thoſe which are committed through anger: for he that is angry ſeemes with a kinde of griefe and cloſe contraction of himſelfe to turne away from reaſon: but he that ſins through luſt, being overcome by pleaſure, doth in his very ſin bewray a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and unmanlike diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the angry man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by anothers injury that provokes him: whereas the other doth of himſelfe meerly reſolve upon any evill action.</p>
            <p>IT ſhould be every mans du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to confine all his thoughts and cares to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of that ſpirit which is within himſelfe, namely to

his braine, and lay off all thoſe phanatique toyes that gingle about his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cauſing him through a needleſſenicity to be a Theefe to himſelfe, of thoſe benefits which God hath allowed him.

            <p>EXtreame poverty is worſe than abundance: the beſt eſtate is that which partakes of both, and conſiſts of neither: he that hath too little, wants feathers to flye withall: and he that hath too much is but combred with too large a taile.</p>

               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:4182:147"/>IMpriſonment is nothing ſuch a miſchiefe as moſt do thinke it: the greateſt is, in that the eye is debarred the delight of the worlds vanity.

It is no other but a place of retyring, or ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the world, which many of the wiſeſt have volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily put upon themſelves; and ſurely while a man is toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among men and buſineſſe, he cannot ſo freely enjoy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as when hee is ſecluded from them both: and it is a

miſery, when a man muſt ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelfe to others, as hee cannot have leiſure to account with himſelfe. Beſides, be he never ſo at large, he doth but run over the ſame things, hee ſees but the like world in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. If he hath but light and any proſpect, he may ſee by that what the reſt is, and enjoy it by his boundleſſe minde. Indeed the moſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome impriſonment is to be priſoner to diſeaſes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for the moſt part theſe hold us, not without paine and the great trouble of our friends about us.</p>
            <p>A Perfect ſoule in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect body, is like a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:4182:148"/>
bright Tapour in a darke Lanthorne: the fault is not in the light, but in the Caſe, which curtaines it with ſo dull an outſide, as will not let the ſhine be tranſparent. And we may ſee this even in thoſe that have been both able and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, who after a hurt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſome vitall part, have growne mopiſh and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſencible, that defect keeping the intellectuall ſo under, that it appeareth not to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apprehenſion. Inward defects alſo, either in Nature or Generation, do often eclipſe the luſtre of noble ſpirits: yea, even from the wombe ſome malignant humour may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the true operation of

the ſpirits internall.</p>
            <p>CErtainly God hath made man to dwell in doubt, that hee might bee awed to good by feare and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We are led along by hope, to the ends that are appointed us, and by an uncertaine way we come at laſt to a certaine end, which yet we could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know nor avoid. The great Creator wiſely put things to come, in the miſt and twilight, that we might neither be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with the certainty of good, nor overmuch terrified with the aſſurance of an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable ill. If Fate be certain, it can be no good to know it, becauſe we cannot prevent it:
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:4182:149"/>
If it be uncertaine, we ſearch in vaine to finde out that which but may be. He that lives vertuouſly needs not doubt of finding a happy Fate: If our lives pleaſe God, the ſucceſſe ſhall ſurely pleaſe us. Vertue and Vice are both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the one of certain good, the other either of Paine or Penitence.</p>
            <p>WIthout charity a man cannot be ſociable: and take away that, and there is little elſe that a man hath to doe in the world: Certainly if there be any thing ſweet in meere humanity, it is in the intercourſes of beloved ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: a reverend humility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:4182:150"/>
God, and Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity toward our Neighbours, will give us a peace that ſhall fit us for whatſoever befalls. He that hath theſe graces ſhall not feare himſelfe, for hee knowes his courſe is Order: he ſhall not feare the world, for he knowes he hath done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that hath angerd it: he ſhall not bee afraid of heaven, for he knowes he ſhall there finde the favour of a Servant of a Son, and be protected againſt the malice and ſpleene of hell.</p>
            <p>AS no Phyſitian can be ſo abſtemious, as to follow ſtrictly all his owne preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo I thinke there is no

Chriſtian ſo much his mindes Maſter, as to keepe preciſely all his reſolutions: they may better ſhew what he would be, than what he is. Nature hath too ſlow a foot to follow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion cloſe at the heele: Who can expect our dull fleſh ſhould wing it with the flights of the ſoule? He is not a good man that lives perfect, but hee that lives as well as he can, and as humane frailties will let him: he that thus ſtrives not, never began to bee vertuous, nor knowes he thoſe tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyes that continually feaſt in the noble minded Man. All the externall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that Mortality is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, can never inkindle a

            <p>SWeetneſſe of Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a great helpe toward the good entertainment of an admonition. Roughneſſe and rigour many times harden
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:4182:152"/>
thoſe hearts, which meekneſſe would have melted to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Whether we ſue, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or reprove, little good is gotten by bitterneſſe: Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the ſin may well ſtand with favour to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and thoſe two not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, cauſe great wrong ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our charity or juſtice: for either we uncharitably hate the creature of God, or unjuſtly affect the perſons of Men.</p>
            <p>IT is madneſſe in a man not to be warned, but to run upon the ſame judgements where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſees others miſcarry, and not to beleeve till he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not recover. Our aſſent is
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:4182:152"/>
purchaſed too late when wee over-ſtay prevention, and truſt to that experience we cannot live to redeeme: Nor is it wiſdome to ſtay till a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come home to us, for the only way to avoid it is to meet it halfe way. There is the ſame remedy both or war and of danger: To provoke an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in his owne borders is the beſt ſtay of invaſion: and to ſolicite God betimes in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt danger, is the beſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt the greateſt evils that can be fall us.</p>
            <p>IT is a good ſigne when God chides us: his round repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions are ever gracious fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of mercy; whereas
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:4182:153"/>
his ſilent connivence at the wicked argues deep and ſecret diſpleaſure. Fond Nature thinkes God ſhould not ſuffer the winde to blow upon his deare ones, becauſe her ſelfe makes this fond uſe of her own indulgence. But whereſoever God chaſtiſes, there he is, yea, there he is in mercy: Nothing more proves us his than his ſtripes, he will not beſtow whipping where he loves not.</p>
            <p>HEE that commonly gives us power to crave, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gives us without cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that the benefit might be ſo much more welcome, by how much leſſe it was ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and we ſo much more
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:4182:153"/>
thankfull, as he is forward: When he bids us aske, it is not that he needs to be entreated, but that he may make us more capable of bleſſings by deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them: and where he ſees fervent deſires, he ſeldome ſtaies for words: but how much more will he give when we aske, that ſo freely gives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we aske.</p>
            <p>BY contrary paces to ours it pleaſes God to come to his owne ends, looking oft the contrary way to that we move. No man can meaſure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of Gods acts by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings: hee that fetches good out of evill, often raiſes the glory of men out of their
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:4182:154"/>
ruine. Wee love to goe the neareſt way, and often faile: God commonly goes about, and in his owne time comes ſurely home. Neceſſity will drive us to ſeeke all helpes, even thoſe which our wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe deſpiſed. It is a ſafe courſe to make much of thoſe in our peace, whom wee muſt make uſe of in our extremity: elſe it is but juſt that we ſhould be rejected by them we have rejected.</p>
            <p>VOws are as they are made, like unto Sents, if they be of ill compoſition nothing offends more, if well tempered, nothing more pleaſant: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certainty of evill, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:4182:154"/>
of good, or impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of performance, make Vowes of no ſervice to God. When we vow that we cannot, or what wee ought not, wee mocke God in ſtead of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him: It is a vain thing for us to goe about to catch God hoodwinkt: for there is no comfort in Peradventure I may pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>IT fals out often, that thoſe times and occaſions which promiſe moſt contentment, prove moſt dolefull in the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue: as contrarily, the times and events which we have moſt diſtruſted, prove moſt benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. It is good in a faire morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to think of the ſtorme that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:4182:155"/>
may ariſe before night, and to enjoy both good and evill fearefully.</p>
            <p>AS it becomes not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be too forward in their choice, ſo Parents ought not to bee too peremptory in their deniall. It is not ſafe for children to out-run their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in ſetling their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; nor for Parents, where the impediments are not very materiall, to come ſhort of their children, when their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are once ſetled: the one is diſobedience, the other tyranny.</p>
            <p>THe curteſies of the world are ever hollow and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:4182:155"/>
thankleſſe, neither doth it ever purpoſe ſo ill, as when it ſhewes faireſt: None are ſo neare dangers as thoſe whom it entertaines with ſmiles. Whileſt it frownes wee know what to truſt to, but the favours of it are worthy nothing but feares and ſuſpitions: open defiance is better than falſe love.</p>
            <p>INdulgences of Parents is the refuge of vanity, the bawde of wickedneſs, the bane of children. How eaſily is that Theefe induced to ſteale, that knowes his Receiver? When the lawleſneſſe of youth knows where to finde pitty and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, what miſchiefe can it forbeare?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:4182:156"/>GOod diſpoſitions love not to pleaſure themſelves with the diſadvantage of others, and had rather be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable alone, than draw in partners to their ſorrow: for the ſight of anothers calamity doth even double their owne, and if themſelves were free, would affect them with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. As contrarily, ill mindes care not how many companions they have in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; they can be content all the world were inwrapped with them in the ſame diſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>IT is no love that cannot make us willing to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for thoſe we affect: the holloweſt heart can be content
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:4182:156"/>
to follow one that proſpereth. Adverſity is the only furnace of friendſhip; if love will not abide both fire and anvile it is but counterfeit: And in our love to God we doe but crack and vaunt in vaine, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee willing to ſuffer for him.</p>
            <p>THe Rich exchanging their almes with the poore for their bleſſings, have no cauſe to complaine of an ill bargaine; our gifts cannot be worth their faithfull prayers. Therefore it is better to give than to receive; becauſe hee that receives hath but a worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe almes, he that gives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an unvaluable bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:4182:157"/>WEE cannot better pleaſe an adverſary than by hurting our ſelves. This is no other than to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour envy, to ſerve the turne of thoſe that maligne us, and to draw on that malice which will weary us. Whereas care leſneſſe puts ill will out of countenance, and makes it withdraw it ſelfe in a rage, as that which doth but ſhame the Author, without the hurt of the Patient. In cauſeleſſe wrongs the beſt remedy is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>GViltineſſe is commonly clamorous and impatient; whereas innocence is ſilent and careleſſe of miſreports. It is
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:4182:157"/>
naturall to all men to wipe off from their names all aſperſions of evill; but none doe it with ſuch violence, as they which for moſt part are faulty. 'Tis a ſigne the horſe is galled which ſtirs too much when hee is toucht.</p>
            <p>EVen the beſt may erre, though not perſiſt in it: when good natures have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they are unquiet till they have haſtened ſatisfaction. It cannot be ſpoken how much eaſe and joy the heart of man findes, in having unloaded his cares, and poured out his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications in the eares of God, ſince it is well aſſured, that the fruit which is faithfully asked,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:4182:158"/>
is already granted in heaven. The conſcience may well reſt when it tels us we have negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no meanes of redreſſing our affliction: for then it may reſolve to looke either for amendment or patience.</p>
            <p>THoſe which are deareſt to God, doe oft times with great difficulty work out thoſe bleſſings which fall into the mouthes of the careleſſe. The juſt diſpoſer of all things holds it fit to keep us ſhort of thoſe favours we ſue for, either for the triall of our patience, or the exerciſe of our faith, or the increaſing of our importunity, or the doubling of our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:4182:158"/>THoſe hearts which are truly thankfull doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce no leſſe in their reſtraint than in their receit; and doe as much ſtudy how to ſhew their humble and fervent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for what they have, as how to compaſſe favours when they want them. Their debt is their burthen, which when they have diſcharged they are at eaſe.</p>
            <p>WIcked men are upon all occaſions glad to bee rid of God, but they can with no patience endure to be rid of their ſinnes; but whileſt they are weary of the hand that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth them, they hold faſt the cauſe of their puniſhment:
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:4182:159"/>
their falſe hopes coſt them deare. They could not bee ſo miſerable, if their owne hearts did not deceive them with miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectations of impoſſible fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>IT is hard not to over-joy in a ſudden proſperity: and to uſe happineſſe is no leſſe difficulty than to forbeare it. Nature is too ſubject to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and is ever either too dull in want, or too wanton in fruition: it is no eaſie matter to keepe a meane either in good or evill.</p>
            <p>THe mercies of God draw more teares from his children, than his judgements
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:4182:159"/>
doe from his enemies: There is no better ſignes of good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and grace, than to be won to repentance by kindneſſe. Not to thinke of God unleſſe we be beaten unto it, is ſervile; No warning will ſerve obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hearts; wicked men are even ambitious of deſtruction: Iudgements need not goe to finde them out, they run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to meet their bane. God will never acknowledge any convert that ſtayes in a known ſin: Graces and vertues are ſo linkt together that hee which hath one hath all: the partiall converſion of men to God is hatefull hypocriſie, and the triall of our ſincerity is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning of our wonted ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:4182:160"/>PRide and wantonneſſe have marred theſe times: Great Parents account it a diſ-repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to imploy their ſons in courſes of frugality, and their pampered children thinke it a ſhame to doe any thing, and ſo beare themſelves, as thoſe that hold it the only glory to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther idle or wicked.</p>
            <p>GOd never imployed any man in his ſervice, whom he did not inable to the worke he ſet him, eſpecially thoſe whom he raiſeth up to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of his owne place, and the repreſentation of himſelfe. It is no marvell though Princes excell the Vulgar in gifts, no leſſe than in dignity: their
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:4182:160"/>
Crownes and their hearts are both in one and the ſame hand: if God did not adde to their powers as their honours, there would be no equality.</p>
            <p>GOds children cannot by any means be diſcouraged from their honour and love to his Ordinances, if they ſee thouſands ſtruck downe to hell by the Scepter of Gods kingdome, yet they will kiſſe it upon their knees; and though their Saviour be a Rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and the occaſion of others falling, they feed tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately on that whereof others have ſurfeited to death. Nothing but grace can teach us to make uſe of others judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:4182:161"/>
for wicked men are not moved with ought that falls beſide them, they truſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their owne ſmart, and notwithſtanding the daily repreſentation of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their peremptory reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution takes no more notice of them than if God had never ſhewne a diſlike of their wayes.</p>
            <p>HOw eaſie is it for us to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake our owne eſtates? to rejoyce in that which we ſhall finde the juſt cauſe of our juſt humiliation: the end of a thing is better than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: the ſafeſt way is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our joy till we have good proofe of the worthineſſe and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:4182:161"/>
fitneſſe of the object: what are we the better for having a bleſſing, if we know not how to uſe it?</p>
            <p>GOd may be angry enough with us while we outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſper: It is his wiſdome to take his beſt advantages; he ſuffers us to goe on till wee ſhould come to enjoy the fruit of our ſin, till we ſeeme paſt the danger either of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or puniſhment, then (even when we begin to be paſt the feeling of our ſins) we often begin to feele his diſpleaſure for our ſins: but this is only where he loves, for where hee meanes utter vengeance, hee lets men harden themſelves to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:4182:162"/>
a reprobate ſenſeleſneſſe, and make up their owne meaſure without contradiction, as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to reckon with them but once for ever.</p>
            <p>WEE ſhould ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſins, but ſhould not alwaies ſhew it: diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the choice of ſeaſons for reproving, is no leſſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and neceſſary, than zeale and faithfulneſſe in reproving. Good Phyſitians uſe not to evacuate the body in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of heate or cold. Wiſe Mariners doe not hoiſe their ſailes in every winde. And as all times are not fit for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, ſo all perſons are not fit to bee reprovers: hee that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:4182:162"/>
caſts a ſtone at an offendor, ſhould bee free from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, otherwiſe he condemnes and executes himſelfe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon. The conſcience ſtops the guilty mans mouth, and choakes him with that ſin which lies in his owne breaſt: which having not come forth by a penitent confeſſion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde the way out in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe: and if he doe reprove, he doth more ſhame himſelfe, than reforme another.</p>
            <p>A Mans heart can beſt judge of himſelfe, others can beſt judge of his actions: As another mans conſcience and approbation cannot beare us out before God, ſo cannot

our owne before men; for oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe actions are cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the beholders as wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, wherein we applaud our owne juſtice. Happy is the man that can be acquitted by himſelfe in private, in publike by others, by God in both. Standers by may ſee more: it is very ſafe for a man to looke into himſelfe by others eyes: in vaine ſhall a mans heart ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him, that is condemned by his actions. A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will make a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly confident, and dares put him upon any triall: where his owne heart ſtrikes him not it bids him challenge all the world, and all commers. How happy a thing is it for a man to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:4182:163"/>
be his owne friend and Patron: he needs not feare forreine broiles, that hath true peace at home: but he that hath a falſe and ſoule heart, lies at every mans mercy, lives ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly, and is faine to daube up a rotten peace with the baſeſt conditions. Truth is not afraid of any light, and therefore dares ſuffer her wares to bee carried from a dim Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board to the Street doore. Perfect Gold will be but the purer for trying, whereas falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood being a worke of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, loves darkneſſe, and therefore ſeekes where it may worke cloſeſt.</p>

only doe what he bids us, not bid what he commands not. Never did any true piety ariſe out of the corrupt puddle of mans braine; if it flow not from heaven it is odious to heaven: The only way to bring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and to intaile a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proſperity upon our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, is our conſcionable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obedience to God.</p>
            <p>The ſervices of our love to Gods Children are never thankleſſe: When wee are dead and rotten, they ſhall live and procure bleſſings to thoſe that never knew perhaps, nor heard of their progenitors. If we ſow good workes, ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall reape them, and wee
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:4182:165"/>
ſhall be happy in making them ſo. Doubtleſſe that childe is happy, whoſe progenitors are in heaven; for he is left an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor of bleſſings together with eſtate: whereas wicked Anceſtors loſe the thankes of a rich Patrimony, by the curſe that attends it.</p>
            <p>A Good heart hath learned to frame it ſelfe unto all conditions, and can change his eſtate without change of diſpoſition, riſing and falling according to occaſion: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the worldly minde can riſe eaſily, but knowes not how to deſcend either with patience, or ſafety.</p>

not more in the receiving, than in the remembrance. A ſmall injury ſhould goe as it comes: great ones may dine or ſup with us, but if they lodge with us, we ſhall finde them very irkſome.</p>
            <p>A Friends death as it may moderately grieve us, ſo it may another way much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit us in recompence of his want, for it ſhould make us think more often and ſeriouſly of earth and of heaven: of earth, for his body which is repoſed in it; of heaven, for his ſoule w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> poſſeſſeth it before us: of earth, to put us in minde of our like frailty and mortality; of heaven, to make us deſire, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:4182:170"/>
after a ſort emulate his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and glory: and it is a true ſaying, he which hath himſelfe hath loſt nothing.</p>
            <p>IT is better not know, than by knowledge to bee made miſerable: he that never taſted the pleaſures of ſinne, longs leaſt after thoſe deceitfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments. 'Tis eaſier to deny a gueſt at the firſt, than to turn him out having ſtayed awhile. The ſenſeleſſe man knowes not what joy hee loſeth, when he fondly laſheth into new of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. While the Conſcience is unſpotted it can make us ſmile even on the Rack, and in Flames; but that once woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, our joyes are buried at
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:4182:170"/>
once, and wee throw a jewell from us which is richer than the worlds wealth: happy is he that deſires to die unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in the ſweets of ſuch ſin he knowes not.</p>
            <p>HE is not worthy of thanks that profeſſeth kindneſſe for his owne ends: hee that loves me for my gift ſake, loves my gift above my ſelfe; and if I ſhould happen to light on Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, I ſhould not finde him then to appeare, there being no hope of a gainefull requitall: friendſhip won by large gifts reſembles a ſtraw fire, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving matter to feede upon burnes brightly, but let new fuell be neglected, it dies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:4182:171"/>
and quite goes out.</p>
            <p>A Good life is a Fortreſſe againſt ſhame, and a good mans ſhame is his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; the one keepes it away, the other when it comes makes it prove profitable: for nothing more ſaddens the ſoule of a good man, than the ſerious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a juſt ſhame: and by how much his honeſty was more noted, by ſo much will his ſhame and griefe bee more; becauſe all will now bee ready to brand him with the odious and ſtygmaticall name of an hypocrite. Wee ſhould firſt ſtrive to be voyd of the act may bring ſhame, and next not to caſt it in the diſh of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:4182:171"/>
If our ſufferings bee unjuſt, wee ſhall bee ſure in the end to finde them comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            <p>BEtweene friends it cannot be but diſcurteſies will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, though not intended by a willing act, yet ſo taken by a wrong ſuſpect, which ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſilence increaſe daily to a greater diſtaſte, but once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in a friendly manner, oft meet with that ſatisfaction which doth in the diſcloſure baniſh them: There is not any thing eates out friendſhip ſooner than concealed grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: Conceits of unkindneſſe harboured and beleeved, will worke even a ſteady love to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:4182:172"/>
If a private thought of unkindneſſe ariſe betweene my friend and my ſelfe, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tell it, and be reconciled: If he be cleare, I ſhall like him the better when I ſee his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity: if faulty, confeſſion gaines my pardon, and bindes me ſtill to love him. Fire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt quencht, and laid abroad, dies preſently; put together, it will burne the better: a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhaking helps the trees growth; every ſuch breach as this may unite affection faſter.</p>
            <p>HOnour and high place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth can confer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto us that may make our life more truly happy: if it add to our joys, it increaſeth
<pb facs="tcp:4182:172"/>
our feares: if it augment our pleaſure, our trouble and care is the more: great perſons are like flags in the tops of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſts, as more high and more viſible, ſo more and ever open to the winde and ſtormes. What a ſnare hath wealth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to many? that like the Sun, have in the morning of their time mounted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the higheſt pitch of perſpicuity and brightneſſe; which when they have once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, they decline, fall, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and are gone, leaving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behinde them but darke night, black reputation. The Theefe that meets with a full purſe, takes away it, and returns a ſtab; whileſt the empty
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:4182:173"/>
pocket makes the life ſecure. Hee is not a compleat Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that cannot be content with what be enjoyes: we ſhould rather ſettle our mindes to a quiet reſt in that we finde, than let her wander in a wearied ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude after ungotten plenty: we ſhould ever eſteeme that eſtate beſt which God gives us: though we cannot thinke ſo, yet doubtleſſe it is ſo, and to thinke againſt knowledge is a fooliſh ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>AS Providence is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of happineſſe, ſo Negligence is the parent of miſery: No vice ſo ſoone ſteales on us as the abuſe of things in themſelves: It is
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:4182:173"/>
good the Vine ſhould flouriſh, but let it alone, and it ruines it ſelfe in ſuperfluous branches. Our pleaſures are ſometimes the inlivenings of a drooping ſoule, but they eaſily ſteale away our mindes, making us with a mad affection dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to our deſtruction: We ſhould ever be moſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in things veiled ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with goodneſſe or ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for nothing ſteales more ſoules from God, than lewd courſes that are outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorious.</p>
            <p>THe formall amity of the world is confined to a face, or to the poſſibility of a recompence, languiſhing in
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:4182:174"/>
diſability, and dying in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of the party affected: It is true love, that, over-living the perſon of a friend, will be inherited of his ſeed: but to love the poſterity of an enemy, in a friend is the miracle of friendſhip: That love was ever falſe, that is not ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and the moſt operative, when it cannot be either knowne or requited.</p>
            <p>WE ſhould not nouriſh the ſame ſpirits in our adverſe eſtates, that we found in our higheſt proſperity: what uſe have wee made of Gods hand, if we be not the lower in our fall? Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is, we ſhould carry our
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:4182:174"/>
Croſſe, not make a fire of it to warme us by: It is no bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of ſailes in a Tempeſt, nor is there a more certaine way to glory and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than a lowly dejection of our ſelves under Gods cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements.</p>
            <p>IT is one of the mad Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of wickedneſſe, That it is weakneſſe to relent, and rather to die than yeeld: even ill Cauſes, once undertaken, muſt be upheld, although with blood: whereas the gracious heart, finding its owne miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, doth not only remit of an ungrounded diſpleaſure, but ſtudies to bee revenged on it ſelfe, and to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:4182:175"/>
to the offended.</p>
            <p>THere can be no fitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to temptation, than the down-bed of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: the induſtrious man hath no leiſure to ſin; the idle hath neither leiſure nor power to avoid ſin. Exerciſe is not more wholſome for the body, than for the ſoule, the omiſſion whereof breeds matter of diſeaſe in both: the water that hath been heated, ſooneſt freezeth; and the moſt active ſpirit ſooneſt tyreth with ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: The earth ſtands ſtill and is all dregs; the heavens ever move and are pure. Wee have no reaſon to complaine of the aſſiduity of worke; the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:4182:175"/>
toile of action is anſwered by the benefit: if we did leſſe we ſhould ſuffer more. Satan, like an idle companion, if he findes us buſie flies back, and ſees it no time to entertaine vaine purpoſes with us: We cannot pleaſe him better, than by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away of our worke to hold chat with him; we can not yeeld ſo far &amp; be guiltleſs.</p>
            <p>THere can bee no ſafety with that ſoule, where the ſenſes are let looſe; hee can never keepe his covenant with God, that makes not a covenant with his eyes. It is an idle preſumption to thinke the outward man may be free, while the inward is ſafe: he is
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:4182:176"/>
more than a man, whoſe heart is not led by his eyes: he is no regenerate man whoſe eyes are not reſtrained by his heart.</p>
            <p>THe griefe that goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an evill, for remedy, can hardly be too much; but that which followes an evill paſt remedy, can never be too little: Even in the ſaddeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, Death, we may yeeld ſomething to Nature, nothing to impatience. Immoderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſorow for loſſes paſt hope of recovery, is more ſullen than uſefull: our ſtomack may be bewrayed by it, not our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:4182:176"/>THere is no enmity ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as that which comes maſqued with love: open hoſtility calls us to our guard, but there is no fence againſt a truſted treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Wee need not bee bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to avoid an enemy, but who would run away from his friend? Thus ſpiritually deales the world with our ſoules, it kiſſes us, and ſtabs us at once: if it did not embrace us with one hand, it could not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther us with the other. Only God deliver us from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this truſt, and wee ſhall be ſafe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:4182:177"/>WIcked Politiques care not ſo much for the commiſſion of villany, as for the notice: Smothered evills are as not done: If oppreſſions, murther, or treaſons may bee hid from view, the obdurate-hearted offender complaines not of remorſe: So vaſt are the gorges of ſome Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that they can ſwallow the greateſt crimes, and finde no ſtraine in the paſſage.</p>
            <p>THe perfections of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation argue not alwaies the inward powers of ſelf-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: the eye may bee cleare, whileſt the hand is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied: it is not ſo much to bee heeded how the ſoule is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:4182:177"/>
as how ſhe is diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the lighted of knowledge doth well, but the order of the affections doth better: there can bee no ſafety upon that ſoule where there is no ſtrait curb upon the deſires: if our luſts be not held under as ſlaves, they will rule as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants: nothing can prevent the extremity of our miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but early and ſtrong deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls of our concupiſcence: A competent eſtate well huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, is better than a vaſt patrimony neglected.</p>
            <p>THere is no preſuming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on time, or meanes, or ſtrength: how many have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and proceeded well, who
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:4182:178"/>
yet have ſhamed themſelves in their laſt ſtage: If God uphold us not we cannot ſtand, if God uphold us we cannot fall: when wee are at the ſtrongeſt, it is good to be weake in our ſelves: and when at our weakeſt, ſtrong in him in whom we can doe all things. Lord bee thou ſtrong in our weakneſſe, that our weake knees may be ſteady in thy ſtrength.</p>
            <p>THere are ſome whoſe ſpeeches are witty, whilſt their carriage is weake; whoſe deeds are incongruities, whilſt their words be apophthegms. It is not worth the name of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that may be heard onely and not ſeene; Good diſcourſe
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:4182:178"/>
is but the froth of wiſedome, the pure and ſolid ſubſtance of it is in well framed actions: and knowing theſe things, happy are we if we do them.</p>
            <p>AS he is a foole that hath a price in his hand to get wiſedome, and wants a heart; ſo is hee unthankfull that hath a heart to get wiſedome, and hath no price in his hand, a price not countervailable to what he ſeekes, but retributo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him of whom he ſeekes: It is a ſhame to come with cloſe hands to them which teach us the great myſteries of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:4182:179"/>EXpectation is no better than a kinde enemy to good deſerts: We loſe thoſe things we over-looke: Many had been admired, if they had not been overmuch befriended by Fame, who now in our judgement are caſt as much below their ranks, as they were fore-imagined above it.</p>
            <p>EVen our very permiſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates our ruine: wee need no more guiltineſſe of any ſin, than our willing tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Every acceſſary to ſin is filthy, but the firſt authors of ſin are abominable. And if the followers and abettors of evill be worthy of torment, no hell is too deep for the leaders
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:4182:179"/>
of publique wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>GEtting and ſaving are not ever the waies to abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, but ſometimes giving: the mercifull God crownes our beneficence with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſtore: It is a good ſigne of a wel meant devotion, when we can abide it chargeable: as contrarily, in the affaires of God, a niggardly hand argues a cold and narrow heart.</p>
            <p>SOmetimes God ſtrikes in favour, but more often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares out of ſeverity: the beſt are fitteſt for heaven, the earth is fitteſt for the worſt: this is the region of ſin and miſery, that of immortality:
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:4182:180"/>
It is no argument of disfavour to be taken only from a well fed life, as not of approbation to age in ſin.</p>
            <p>GOd oft winkes at weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, where he ſees Truth: O how pleaſing a thing is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, that in favour thereof the mercy of a God digeſts many an error. Lord let our hearts goe upright, though our feet ſlide, the fall cannot (through thy grace) be deadly, however it may ſhame or pain us.</p>
            <p>WEE cannot eaſily put upon God a greater wrong than the alienation of our truſt: earthly meanes are
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:4182:180"/>
for uſe, not for confidence: we may, we muſt imploy them, we may not, we muſt not rely upon them. Policy and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doe as well together, as they are ill aſunder; the Dove without the Serpent is eaſily caught: the Serpent without the Dove ſtings deadly: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion without Policy is too ſimple to be ſafe: Policy without Religion is too ſubtle to be good: being matched they make themſelves ſecure, and many happy.</p>
            <p>THere is not alwaies the greateſt efficacy where is the greateſt noiſe: God loves to make way for himſelfe by terror, but he conveyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:4182:181"/>
to us in ſweetneſſe: It is happy for us, if after the flaſhes and guſts of the Law, we have heard the ſoft voice of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall mercy: It is fit they ſhould be firſt humbled by his terror, that would be made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of his mercy; and by both won to repentance.</p>
            <p>NOthing is more odious to God, than a prophane neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality in maine oppoſitions in Religion: To goe upright in a wrong way is a leſſe eye-ſore to God, than to halt betwixt right and wrong. The Spirit wiſheth that the Laodiceans were either hot or cold: either Temper would bee better borne than neither, than
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:4182:181"/>
both. In reconcileable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences nothing is more ſafe than indifferency, both of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and opinion: But in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſo neceſſary hoſtility, as betwixt God and <hi>Baal,</hi> he that is on neither ſide, is enemy to both: Leſſe hatefull are they to God that ſerve him not at all, than they that ſerve him with a Rivall.</p>
            <p>FOoliſh men are plagued for their offences, and it is no ſmall part of their plague that they ſee it not. The only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſturber of Men, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Cities, Kingdomes, Worlds, is ſin: There is no ſuch traitor to any State as the wilfully wicked: the quieteſt
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:4182:182"/>
and moſt plauſible offender is ſecretly ſeditious, and ſtirreth quarrels in heaven. Our hearts are Wells of bitter and veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Water; our actions are the ſtreames: In vaine ſhall we cleanſe our hands, while our hearts are evill. If the fountaine bee redreſſed, the ſtreames cannot be faulty; as contrarily the purity and ſoundneſſe of the ſtreame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes nothing to the redreſſe of the fountaine: Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt beginne at the Well head of the abuſe: the order of beeing is a good guide to the method of amending.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:4182:182"/>AS there are ſometimes beardleſſe Sages, ſo are there oft times gray-headed Children: not the ancient are wiſe, but the wiſe is anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. It is vaine to looke for good of thoſe Children wee have neglected; and as vaine to grieve for thoſe miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages in elder age, which our care might have prevented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. Children are ſuch as their inſtitution: Infancy is led altogether by imitation: it hath neither words nor acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but infuſed by others; their full growth in good or ill is but borrowed, and the ſhame or thank is due to thoſe that lent it. Next to being good, is the happineſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:4182:183"/>
with them that are ſo: for if we be not bettered by their example, yet are we often bleſt by their protection.</p>
            <p>THe contempt of honeſt callings in thoſe which are well borne, argues pride without wit: humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions are ſo much the more heroicall, as they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to higher ſubjects. We may freely come to God, but wee may not come too neare him: when we meditate of the great myſteries of the Word, wee come to him: we come too neare him when we ſearch into his Councels. A man may be too lowly in his dealings with men, even unto contempt:
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:4182:183"/>
with God hee cannot, but the lower he falleth, the higher is his exaltation: And I never finde that any man bragged to God, although in a matter of truth, and within the compaſſe of his deſert, and was accepted.</p>
            <p>IT is a great skill to know what is enough, and great wiſdome to care for no more. As in words, much talke ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a braine feeble and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered; ſo affectation of ſuperfluity, is in all things a ſigne of weakneſſe.</p>
            <p>IN all humane things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency is ſafeſt: if our doubts be equal to our deſires, our diſappointment ſhall not
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:4182:184"/>
be grievous, becauſe our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation was not peremptory.</p>
            <p>DEceit is gracious compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for it alwaies ſtudies to be faire and pleaſant: but then like a theefe, having train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the road, it robs us; where all the benefit we have left is this, that if we have time to ſee how wee are couzened, we may have ſo much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as to die repenting.</p>
            <p>SEeming wiſe men may make ſhift to get opinion, but I would wiſh no man to chooſe them for imployment: for certainly you were better to take for buſineſſe a man ſomewhat abſurd, than over-formall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:4182:184"/>THere is but one way wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man may commend himſelfe with good grace, and that is in commending vertue in another, eſpecially if it bee ſuch a vertue whereunto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe pretendeth.</p>
            <p>HE that reſteth upon gaines certaine, ſhall hardly grow to great riches: and hee that puts all upon adventures, doth oftentimes breake and come to poverty. It is good therefore to guard adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold loſſes. ⁂</p>
