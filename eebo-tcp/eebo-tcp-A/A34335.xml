            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

end in the publication of theſe Papers, but
the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> of

Author. Therefore I reſolve againſt the
Impertinence of an Apologie, and leave
you to the common liberty of Cenſure: If
I meet with the fate of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to paſs
through <hi>good</hi> as well as <hi>bad Report,</hi>
I ſhall have Honour, and content enough.</p>
            <p>If thou art a ſound, and ſober mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

thy Temper cannot be Sullen, or Ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd:
it is thy Genius to be Candid, and
Generous, and thy <hi>Religion</hi> makes thee
Charitable: and therefore I am aſſured
that thy <hi>Balms</hi> cannot <hi>break my Head:</hi>
and if theſe Papers may in any meaſure

my principal End is then effected.</p>
            <p>

If thou art a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> from this

But if thou art one who haſt

let me beſeech thee to read no further: for

ever cured Perverſeneſs.</p>
            <p>If thou art a <hi>Romiſh Recuſant,</hi>
let me intreat thee to Suffer thy Reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:52132:4"/>
to recover its Liberty, and not alwayes
be in Vaſſallage to thoſe <hi>Roman Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
I know there are many of that
<hi>Religion</hi> in this Nation, who are <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi>
of Complaiſant Converſe, and
Ingenuous <hi>Education:</hi> but I wonder that
ye (who pretend ſo much Abhorrence of
<hi>Fanaticiſm,</hi> and boaſt of <hi>Loyalty</hi> to
your <hi>Prince,)</hi> ſhould yet degrade your
ſelves to the ſame Level with the Baſeſt
<hi>Sectaries,</hi> and live in conſtant <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to the Laws of your <hi>Natural Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is great Reaſon that the <hi>Kings</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> ſhould ever have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Jealouſie upon your Party: for though
your <hi>Bodies,</hi> and <hi>Eſtates</hi> are <hi>Subjects</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> yet your <hi>Souls,</hi> or <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
are under the Empire of a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Juriſdiction:</hi> and as long as ye
continue ſo, there is no Reaſon in the
world, that can give the <hi>Crown</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<hi>Security</hi> for your laſting <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52132:4"/>
As for thoſe of your Religion,
who live under the Laws of the <hi>Romiſh
Dominions,</hi> I have great Charity for
them, for they can plead ſubmiſsion to their
own <hi>Superiours:</hi> and I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Plea may be very conſiderable,
when they come to appear before the <hi>Prince
of Peace,</hi> and the <hi>God of Order.</hi>
But for you, whoſe Lot hath caſt you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Government of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
and <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
and yet to Divide from their Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſubject your ſelves to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi>
of a Forreign Church, is not only
a Diſobedience againſt the Laws of this
<hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> but a <hi>Violation</hi>
of the <hi>Antient</hi> Canons of the <hi>Catholick
Church;</hi> and is ſo great a Diſorder,
and unreaſonableneſs, that the Penalties
inflicted for your <hi>Recuſancy,</hi> are as
<hi>Juſt,</hi> as they are <hi>Severe,</hi> and ye merit no
Compaſsion. Indeed if your deſerting the
<hi>Romiſh,</hi> would put you out of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church,</hi> I would never upon
<pb facs="tcp:52132:5"/>
thoſe hard terms perſwade you into our
<hi>Communion.</hi> Our <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of
<hi>Faith</hi> ye will acknowledge to be the antient
<hi>Catholick,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolick Creed:</hi>
I know your principal Prejudice is againſt
the Succeſsion of our <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and the
Authority of our <hi>Prieſthood:</hi> But let
me beſeech you to do ſo much Right to us,
and ſo much Juſtice to your ſelves, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
to peruſe Mr <hi>Maſon</hi>'s <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Miniſtry of the
Church of England,</hi> and if his
Tranſcript of thoſe <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of our <hi>Church</hi> will not ſatisfie
you, let ſome of your ſubtileſt <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
convict that Author of Falſhood, or Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture;
and I will acknowledge that we
are no <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and you no
<hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many of your <hi>Religion,</hi>
perſons of great <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Eſtates</hi>
in this Kingdom, who may eaſily have the
Advantage to view, and examine the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb facs="tcp:52132:5"/>
Records of the <hi>Conſecration</hi> of
our <hi>Engliſh Biſhops,</hi> in that great
<hi>Criſis</hi> of our <hi>Reformation;</hi> and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
in ſo weighty a matter, where your
<hi>Eſtates</hi> (if not ſome raſter <hi>Intereſt)</hi>
are highly concern'd, ye ſhould be ſtrictly
inquiſitive, and not ſo blindly acquieſce
in a popular Miſtake, and Jeſuitical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.
In the mean time I charge you
with the guilt of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> in <hi>Dividing</hi>
from the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and if
you think your ſelves injur'd by this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,</hi>
let any of your <hi>Romiſh
Champions</hi> be the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Second,
and publiſh a Plea for your <hi>Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and though I am none of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
of <hi>England,</hi> yet I will engage for
a <hi>Reply.</hi> If any of you ſhall think fit
to require it, I dare undertake to prove,
that the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh
Church,</hi> do no more oblige any Subject
of <hi>England,</hi> than our <hi>Statute Laws</hi>
do bind the <hi>Poles,</hi> or <hi>Moſcovites:</hi> and
that it is as great a Diſorder and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
<pb facs="tcp:52132:6"/>
for the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> to
excommunicate any of the people of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
as it were for the <hi>Lord Chief
Juſtice of England,</hi> to outlaw <hi>Don
Juan of Auſtria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> I leave you to enjoy
your Humour, to be Candid, or Clamorous
as your fancy inclines you. To be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

with an Apoſtolick Sobriety.</p>
            <p>When I reflect upon this Intrigue of the
preſent Diſſenters from the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
in confounding the Notion of Schiſm
with that of Hereſie, and by that jejune
project would evade that Scandal of being
Schiſmaticks; a diſcrimination eſteemed ſo
odious and perilous among all good Catholicks
in all Ages of the Chriſtian Church; I can
fancy no other reaſon they can have than
this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> leſt their Proſelytes and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſhould be juſtly affrighted at the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
guilt of Schiſm and Separation; and
conſult their return to that Fold which they
have deſerted, which is certainly their ſafeſt
Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Another Stratagem, which has not been
leſs uſeful for them than the former, is
their contemning an Apoſtolical Succeſſion of
Prieſthood; and thereby leſſening the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of a Schiſmatick condition in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the people: This unchriſtian humour
they continually inſtill into the Populacy,
and inforce it with this Anti-Apoſtolick
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52132:7"/>
Maxim, That there is no difference between
a Prieſt and a Laick, but that the firſt reads
the Prayers of the Church, and Preaches
Morally, as they call it; and the other is
gifted with continual Revelations: for that,
they muſt mean; if any thing, by praying
by the Spirit in their notion. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I am as yet unconverted to theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and have an awful reſpect to your
Sacred Order, and I could be as eaſily Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyted
to Atheiſm, as to think a <hi>Knipper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolling</hi>
or an <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> were as true

or a <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, As an obedient Son of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> and a Loyal Subject to my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
and ſo oblig'd to be very ſolicitous
of the Welfare of Church and State, give
me leave to ſigh out ſome thoughts which
have been and are afflictive to my Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
and may detect, if not the cauſes, at leaſt
the encouragements of our Schiſms.</p>
            <p>When I ſee the admir'd providence of
our indulgent Prince (ſo eminently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in his Royal <hi>Amneſtie</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion)</hi>
for the obliterating all Animoſities
and Rancours (which might ſtill ferment in
the hearts of men ſo Diametrically oppoſite,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52132:8"/>
and who had eſpouſed Caſes as contradictory
as beſt and worſt,) contemned and flouted
by an undutiful and unchriſtian humour of
perſiſting in the ſame ſtubborneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they have check'd two Glorious Princes,
and Mated a third (God bleſs the fourth)
and wherewith they brought upon our Church
and Kingdom, the late horrid and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
confuſions; Indignation prompts me to
think, that Sincere Religion cannot reſide in
an ungrateful heart; nor true Piety and
Loyalty, where there are no Symptoms of
their repentance. And let me appeal to
common ſenſe and reaſon, what a frightful
face of Government there would appear in
this Nation; if all His Majeſties evil-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Subjects ſhould as boldly reſolve to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate
all thoſe Crimes prohibited by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and Statute Laws of this Realm, as the
Diſſenters do temerariouſly tranſgreſs, or
fraudulently evade thoſe Statutes relating
to Conformity.</p>
            <p>When I ſee ſome of your Sacred Order fly
at a Dignity, a Biſhoprick, and when they
have truſs'd it, quarry and prune them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon it, and live as if a Dioceſs
were only deſigned to Gorge and Aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
the Biſhop, and he not concern'd to be
a faithful Shepherd to his flock, but negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52132:8"/>
if not wholly careleſs in no ſmall part
of his Epiſcopal Function and Paternal charge
(witneſs the omiſſion of that Solemn Office
of Confirmation:) nor obliged to moderate
over, and inſpect the manners of his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Clergie, who are in Law but his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
and whoſe vices and diſorders reflect
a Blot upon himſelf, and a Scandal to the
Church; then I think, the longer time runs,
its ſand will be the fuller of duſt, and I
am ready to renounce my Philoſphy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Gold may ruſt; and we have too
many <hi>Roſy-Crucians</hi> in Divinity to make
their Remarques.</p>
            <p>When our Parochial Clergie ſhall out of
good nature, tepidity or perjury omit, if not
all, at leaſt ſome part of the Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to curry their Males, and coaks their
Females: when to pleaſe a weak Siſter, the
Croſs after Baptiſm muſt not be uſed, and
for a bribe the Sacrament ſhall be Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to a ſitting Bumkin, and the Prieſt
ſhall civilly be from home, when a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
is to have the Burial of an Aſs: when
every Pariſh ſhall have a ſingular Directory,
and every waxen Prieſt ſhall aſſume a
Papiſm to diſpenſe with Oath, Canons and
Statutes, and the Dioceſan ſhall be demure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compos'd into a poſture of conſent with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52132:9"/>
cloſed eyes and folded arms, are we then
like to be bleſt with one faith and one
way?</p>
            <p>When too many of our Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
ſhall aſſume that honour and glory to
liſt themſelves in, and be reputed Sons of
our Church of <hi>England,</hi> but by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs,
Debauchery and prodigious vice,
live Antipodes to that holy Profeſſion, and
act below the dictates of uneducated nature;
then I think this muſt be influential upon
the Manners of the Populacy, and create an
inclination to Schiſm, if not an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Religion in them, who are commonly
capable of no other direction in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
and Piety, than the vertuous examples
of their Superiours.</p>
            <p>When too many of our Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
ſhall deſert their antient Seats and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Intereſts, to enjoy an urbane effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
immerge in the gulfs of Luxury, and to
enervate in the Venereal Laboratories of the
Town, with the greater Security to their
names, and leſs obſervation of the world;
this muſt be reputed no ſmall cauſe of Schiſm
in their Tenants and Dependents, who in
many Lordſhips and places of the Nation
want nothing more, than the antique Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52132:9"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> and the Orthodox practice
of their Landlords and Patrons, to ſecure
them againſt the cantings of the Wolves,
and to ſhame them into a conformable obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
and were it ſeriouſly conſider'd,
how eaſie and natural the motion is from
immorality and Atheiſm, to diſloyalty and
civile Apoſtaſie, theſe Monſters would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
the Courts of Princes, to learn huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
among flocks and herds.</p>
            <p>But when the Sacred Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhall
be mouth'd by the moſt vicious perſons, to
diſguiſe an ugly, perhaps a treaſonous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
and <hi>novi homines,</hi> men of yeſterday,
ſhall dare to trifle with that Scepter which
dignified them, and problem the Right of
their Prince in the face of his Throne; when
<hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſhall Italianize and ſhoot thoſe
envenom'd arrows, their filthy Paſquils to
wound their Prince in his reputation, which
is the ſoul of his Throne: O, then I think,
if it awakens not all the Sentinels of the
Government, ſure they are in their dead
ſleep or infatuated for deſtruction.</p>
            <p>When I conſider the ill-boding circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
attending the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
her prodigious rents, her aſſiduous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
Adverſaries, accompanied perhaps
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52132:10"/>
with too much Supinity in ſome of her moſt
Principal members, and when it comes into
my mind, that Miracles are ceaſed too, then
each moment ſpur on my thoughts to expect;
when Religion (now on tiptoes to be gone)
ſhould turn her back upon us, and that the
ultimate failure of the Faith is at hand,
ready to be the Harbinger to the Catholick
Doom.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, not to trouble your more Serene
Meditations with ſuch melancholy reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
give me leave to Alarm you to Muſter
your notions, and by your Animadverſions
upon this Doctor, undeceive the deluded mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

the ruine of our Church, and with that
the unhinging that excellent temper of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which has been the envy of the

            <closer>

            </opener>
            <p>THat Kingſhip and Epiſcopacy,
have been the antient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Government of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in State and Church, ever ſince
our Primitive Chriſtianity, is evident from
undoubted Records: But the Gentlemen of
our <hi>New Engliſh Intereſt,</hi> mock at the two
old Grandſires, Monarchy and Hierarchy,
and begin to hope that they are come to
their decrepit Age, and not far from a
Grave, and they are preparing for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
It is now ſcandalous to be Loyal
to our Prince, or Regular to the Church.
You will be thought a mean-ſpirited Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
for expreſſing any regard to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of Religion. And you have no way
to redeem your Honour, but either to turn
Atheiſt, or liſt your ſelf a Member of the
<hi>New Intereſt.</hi> And now Sir, can it be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd
to Friendſhip, to ſhip your Friend, when
the Clouds look black and threaten a
Storm? But ſince you are as kind to me as
you are to your ſelf; and are pleas'd to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque
with me, I am reſolv'd to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52132:11"/>
and am prepar'd for Tempeſt, and
that worſt of Hurricanes, the madneſs of
the People.</p>
            <p>I think it highly neceſſary to demonſtrate
our Non-conformiſts to be Schiſmaticks:
for though meer State Intereſt may legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
many ſeverities againſt thoſe Perſons
and Principles that are Antipodes to the
eſtabliſh'd Government; yet if that were
truth, which the Doctor pretends to prove,
That the Sectaries of <hi>England</hi> were as much
in the family of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Catholick Church, as the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> it would puzzle my Reaſon,
to make a Subſtantial Apology for our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws. But if we can make it evident,
that theſe men walk diſorderly, and are Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts
from the Catholick Church, it
will then appear, that our Laws are ſo far
from Rigor or Perſecution, that they are
more charitable proviſions, and only deſign'd
to compell men to come in to that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
where their Eternal Intereſt will be moſt
rationally and manifeſtly ſecur'd.</p>
            <p>When I firſt open'd the<hi> Doctor'</hi>s<hi> Plea </hi>you
ſent me, mine eye chanc'd upon a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
paſſage, to this effect, viz.<hi> That the</hi>Greek<hi> Church call the Church of </hi>Rome,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52132:11"/>
               <hi>Schiſmatick, and the Church of </hi>Rome<hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the Schiſmatick upon the </hi>Greek<hi> Church.
The Church of </hi>England<hi> make the </hi>Romiſh<hi>Church the Schiſmatick, and the Church of</hi>Rome<hi> charge the Schiſm upon the Church of</hi>England.—Again,<hi> The Church of </hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland<hi>call her Diſſenters Schiſmaticks, and the
Diſſenters think the Church to be Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
from them; and ſo we have call'd one
another Schiſmaticks Round: and therefore
Schiſm is but </hi>Vox &amp; praeterea nihil,<hi> nothing
but a meer noiſe and Nick-name, which every
Party caſt upon all them who are not of their
Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us try the Strength of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by tranſlating it to another circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
word, and that is Infidelity. The
Mahometan calls himſelf Muſalman, which
my <hi>Perſic</hi> Dictionary aſſures me, ſignifies
Faithful or Believer in God; yet we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
call the Mahometans Infidels; and
they call us Unbelievers. We call the
Jews Infidels, and they return the ſame
name upon us and the Mahometans too.
Both Chriſtian, Jew, and Mahomentan pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all Pagans to be Infidels, and ten to
one, but they are as ſtout and peremptory
as the reſt of Mortals, and think all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
Infidels but themſelves. Thus the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52132:12"/>
whole World have call'd one another Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
Round, and therefore Infidelity is but
a meer empty noiſe, and there is no ſuch
thing in the World as a True Religion.
I appeal to any ſober Judgement, if there
be not as much Logick in this, as there was
in the other.</p>
            <p>I hope it will be an eaſie diſcovery, to
find out the ſquare of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Circle,
and to fix the Notion of Schiſm upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Baſis. And therefore Sir, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to your Requeſt, I ſhall diſcuſs that
great Queſtion, Whether the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
in <hi>England</hi> meeting together for the
Worſhip of God in places diſtinct from the
Parochial Churches, are not Schiſmaticks?</p>
            <p>To this I ſhall anſwer in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and ſhall conſider this Separation,
Firſt, With reſpect to the whole Catholick
Church. Secondly, With relation to the
Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, To be a Member of the Catholick
Church, there is required a double Unity:
Firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> An Unity of Faith, or Doctrine: a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
ſeparation from this, we grant to be
Apoſtaſie; a diſowning any one fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Article, makes a man a Heretick. But
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52132:12"/>
in this does not conſiſt the formal notion
of Schiſm. Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There is requir'd an
Unity of Order or Government, which
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls <hi>Unitas Eccleſiaſtica.</hi> Now
a Separation from this Unity, hath the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of Schiſm. And for a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of this, I muſt look back to the
firſt Origine of this Unity.</p>
            <p>The Holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the great Author and
Founder of our Religion, was ſent of God, and
all power in Heaven and Earth committed
to him. Now before his Aſcenſion, that he
might not leave his Diſciples to the end of the
World, to be governed by every pretender
to Revelation, which would have expoſed
his Kingdom upon Earth, to eternal confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and impoſtures, he ſolemnly ordains
and conſecrates the Apoſtles his immediate
Delegates upon earth. John 20. 22. <hi>As my
Father ſent me, even ſo ſend I you:</hi> by
vertue of which Commiſſion, the power of
Ordaining, Governing and conferring Orders
did reſt only in the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>They took care to continue this Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and therefore <hi>Timothy</hi> was by the
Apoſtles ordain'd Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
of <hi>Crete,</hi> and both inveſted with power
of Juriſdiction and conferring Orders, as is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52132:13"/>
evident from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles directed to
them: and though there were many Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
in the Dioceſes of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi>
yet none had Authority to ordain Elders or
Prieſts, but only <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus. Linus</hi>
by Apoſtolick Conſecration ſucceeded the
Apoſtles in the Chair of <hi>Rome. Symeon</hi>
governed the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the
Dioceſs of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> next after St. <hi>James.
Anianus</hi> ſucceeded St. <hi>Mark</hi> in the Church
of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And this Succeſſion was
propagated with ſo much care and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us, He could name all
the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles in the ſeveral
Apoſtolick Churches unto his dayes: <hi>Habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
annumerare eos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 3. adv.</note>

               <hi>&amp; Succeſſores
eorum, uſque ad nos.</hi> And this line of
Apoſtolick Succeſſion of Biſhops hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
through all Ages of the Church to
our preſent times. So that he who is out
of this line of Apoſtolick Succeſſion, and
exerciſes any Miniſterial Office without the
Commiſſion of Epiſcopal Ordination, is but
a Lay-Impoſtor, and a Schiſmatick from the
Catholick Church. And all other Societies
of Chriſtian people, who totally withdraw
themſelves from the Government of their
Biſhops, who are the Apoſtles Succeſſors,
and from the Miniſtry of thoſe Presbyters
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52132:13"/>
lawfully ſet over them by Epiſcopal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Inſtitution, and caſt themſelves
into any other Model of Government, are
guilty of Schiſm. This was the formal
Notion of Schiſm in the ſenſe of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lugdunum,</hi>
who convers'd with <hi>Polycarpus</hi> the Diſciple
of St. <hi>John,</hi> may in reaſon be allowed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

of Schiſm, better than our <hi>Doctor</hi> at the

his Book <hi>Adverſus Hereſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> exhorts the
Chriſtian World to hearken only to thoſe
Prieſts,<note place="margin">cap. 43.</note> who were in the Communion of the
Catholick Church; and who thoſe are, he
there deſcribes, <hi>Quapropter eis, qui in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia

the guilt of Schiſim. And when <hi>Maximus,
Urbanus, Sydonius</hi> and <hi>Macarius</hi> return'd
from the <hi>Novatian</hi> faction into the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church, they expreſs it thus,
<hi>Epiſcopo noſtro pacem fecimus,</hi> they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
themſelves to the Biſhop: and this
was enough to aſſure St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> they had
renounc'd their Schiſm, and were reſtor'd to
the Churches communion. I will end this
with the aſſertion of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. 42.</note> 
               <hi>Radix
Chriſtianae ſocietatis per ſedes Apoſtolorum,
&amp; ſucceſsiones Epiſcoporum, certâ per orbem
propagatione diffunditur: i. e.</hi> the root or
foundation of unity or communion in the
Chriſtian Church, is founded in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Seats of the Apoſtles, and diffuſed through
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52132:15"/>
the Chriſtian World, by the certain propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
or ſucceſſion of Biſhops. Therefore
in the judgement of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> all thoſe
perſons, or ſocieties that have divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Biſhops and Prieſts of the
Apoſtolick ſucceſſion, are but wild plants,
and no branches of the Catholick ſtock. I
could fill many Pages more with Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the ſame nature; but ſuch numerous
Quotations would look like Pedantick im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence:
and I doubt not, but thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
I have already mentioned, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
you to believe, That a total ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Orders and Government of
Biſhops, was conſtantly adjudg'd to be
Schiſm by the concurrent ſentiments of the
antient Church.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, having examined theſe
Teſtimonies, I may proceed to ſentence:
That ſeeing the Teachers of our Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Congregations in <hi>England</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
regularly Ordain'd to any Miniſterial
Function by the hands of the Biſhops (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
their Authority from Apoſtolick ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion)
and ſeeing their Leaders and their
blind Proſelytes have wholly withdrawn
themſelves, from the Conduct &amp; Government
of Epiſcopal Authority, I ſhall therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to pronounce them Schiſmaticks,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52132:15"/>
not only from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but
from the whole Corporation of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church. Therefore that which the
<hi>Doctor</hi> ſo Magiſterially aſſerts at the end
of his ſeventeenth Page is no Axiom of
Divinity; for I have already prov'd, that
a man may be Schiſmatick from the whole
Catholick Church on earth without Hereſie
or Apoſtaſie. The premiſes being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
will furniſh us with an Anſwer to
that paſſionate Harangue, pag. 21. <hi>Do we
not own Chriſt, his Goſpel, the ſame points
of faith, the ſame acts of Worſhip, where is
the Separation then?</hi> This St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells
us, was the ſame <hi>Plea</hi> of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and
might have been urged by the <hi>Novatians,</hi> and
Schiſmatick Presbyters of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but it
would not acquit them from Schiſm, nor
will it vindicate our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sectaries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corah</hi> and his confederate Mutineers were
neither Hereticks nor Apoſtates, but men of
the ſame Creed with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> their
crime was the violating that ſubordination
which God had appointed, and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
themſelves to the Superiour Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Prieſthood. And Sir, it may
be worth your obſervation, that this <hi>Plea</hi> of
the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and that of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Rebels
have the ſame ſenſe; for juſt thus they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52132:16"/>
plead, Numb. 16. 3. <hi>All the Congregation
is holy, every one of them:</hi> that is, in the
<hi>Doctor</hi>'s phraſe, Do we not own <hi>Moſes,</hi> his
Laws, the ſame points of faith, the ſame
acts of Worſhip? But this plauſible plea
would not prevail, nor mitigate the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
for God puniſhed one Schiſm with
another, <hi>The earth rent, and ſwallowed
them up,</hi> and with open mouth taught the
reſt of the Church to keep Unity and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as well as the profeſſion of a true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Therefore the Anſwer is very eaſie
to the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s ruffling Queſtion; Do we
not own Chriſt, his Goſpel, the ſame points
of faith, the ſame acts of Worſhip, where
is the ſeparation then? Why Sir, the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is in dividing from the communion
of all the Biſhops and Epiſcopal Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who in a conſtant line ſucceeding the
Apoſtles, have only a juſt and regular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to govern and guide the Chriſtian
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 34.</note> The <hi>Doctor</hi> in the beginning of <hi>pag.</hi> 34.
tells us, That a controverſie among them
of the ſame communion is the chief, if not
the only notion of Schiſm that the Scripture
gives us. I confeſs, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Schiſm
in its general notion ſignifies any manner of
ſeparation or diviſion; and therefore I do
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52132:16"/>
acknowledge, that thoſe diſſentions that
were within the bowels of the Apoſtolick
and Catholick Church were called Schiſms,
both in the Scripture, and in the Writings
of the antient Fathers: but this does not
hinder, but that the ſame word may be
uſed to ſignifie a ſeparation from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church; for if a wound in the body
may be called a Schiſm, ſure Amputation or
the cutting off from the body is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
rent and Schiſm in the World. For
though there were indeed diviſions in the
Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where ſome were for
<hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Apollos,</hi> and ſome for
<hi>Cephas:</hi> this at the worſt was but a faction
or a breach of charity, but it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Schiſm in the higheſt ſenſe of the
word; for they ſtill ſetled themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Government and Miniſtry of the
Apoſtles, or ſome Presbyters ordained by
the hands of the Apoſtles. But thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles
that crept into houſes, and formed
Aſſemblies diſtinct from the communion of
the Apoſtolick Church, thoſe that heaped
to themſelves Teachers, which, as the phraſe
imports, were not ſet over them by Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Order and Inſtitution; thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
Dominion, and ſake evil of thoſe
Dignities which did ſuperintend the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church: Theſe men St. <hi>Jude</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52132:17"/>
tell us, were thoſe that did ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that is, were Schiſmaticks; and
juſt ſo are their Brethren the Sectaries of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I proceed to the next enquiry that
concerns the Schiſm from the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> it will be neceſſary to ſtate the
right notion of the Catholick Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſenſe of the antient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and Fathers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> and his Complices are for
Comprehenſion, and give us a very wide
notion of the Catholick Church; for they
will have all men that profeſs the name of
Chriſt, though in ſome things Hereticks and
Schiſmaticks too, yet to be included within
the boundaries of the Catholick Church.
But I obſerve, the Antients would not endure
this Comprehenſion; for they reckoned
none to be in the communion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, but thoſe who confeſſed the
common faith delivered to the Saints, and
kept themſelves under the Orders and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Biſhops, who were the
Apoſtles Succeſſors: and therefore oft-times
in Councils and antient Epiſtles we find this
Superſcription, To the Catholick Church in
<hi>Antioch,</hi> To the Catholick Church of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52132:17"/>
To the Catholick Church of
<hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> this ſtill being uſed in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction
from the <hi>Novatians, Arrians</hi>
and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> which the antient Church
look'd upon as Schiſmaticks and <hi>extra Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now having advanc'd thus far, the way
is prepared for the ſecond enquiry, Whether
our Non-conformiſts are guilty of Schiſm
from the Church of <hi>England?</hi> And I doubt
not but to prove the Affirmative.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> adhere to that
Creed which was delivered by the Apoſtles,
profeſſed by the antient Primitive Church,
and confirm'd by the firſt four General
Councils; it hath preſerv'd the Unity of
Government by a ſucceſſion of Biſhops in
the Apoſtolick line, as appears from the
undoubted Archives and Records of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi>
Therefore we are ſecured that it
is in the Unity of the Catholick Church,
and a moſt excellent part of it.</p>
            <p>Now as our Chriſtianity obliges us to be
members of that body of Chriſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church: So the eternal reaſons of Peace
and Order bind us to communicate with
that part of the Catholick Church, in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52132:18"/>
which our lot hath plac'd us, except it can
manifeſtly appear, that that part is ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
that we cannot communicate with it
without evident hazard of our ſalvation. It
were an unpardonable diſorder, for a Native
of <hi>England</hi> dwelling in <hi>London,</hi> to contemn
the Laws of our Prince, and to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by the Placaets of the <hi>United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi>
and it were as great a confuſion, for
thoſe who live within the Juriſdiction of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> to ſubmit themſelves to
the Orders and Government of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</hi>
Before the Papal Uſurpation of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Monarchy, the Patriarchs of the
Chriſtian Church had their diſtinct Limits
and Juriſdictions: The Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
had his peculiar Primacy or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
and was not to intermeddle with
the Province of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and ſo the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had his peculiar Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and was allowed no inſpection over
<hi>Conſtantinople, Antioch</hi> or <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and
theſe diſtinct boundaries were fixed by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and becauſe
it con<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>utes both the Papal Supremacy and

Let the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> have the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of <hi>Aegypt, Libya</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis,</hi>

let the Churches of <hi>Antioch</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
keep their peculiar priviledges. And
ſo the Chriſtians dwelling under theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Patriarchates were obliged to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
obedience to their peculiar Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial:
and to divide themſelves from their

Schiſm in the antient Church. <hi>Timothy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to ſubmit themſelves to his peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection,
and it had been Schiſm to have
diſobeyed him, or ſeparated themſelves from
his Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> obſerved this <hi>decorum</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

that Chriſtian peace and order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
that we ſhould conform to the Rites

All the Presbyters of this Province have
their peculiar Cures, or Pariſhes, but all
the Churches of this Region are under the

And the very ſame thing <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us
in his ſecond Book <hi>adverſus Haereſes,</hi>

            <p>Now the Arch-biſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi>

the Right of Church-Government which
their ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles give them,
they are impowr'd to exerciſe their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
by the Laws of our Chriſtian Prince:
and therefore thoſe Societies of Chriſtians
living under the Juriſdiction of the Arch-biſhops
and Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> and yet do
ſeparate from their communion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are Schiſmaticks from the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> To conclude this, if the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> if the five Presbyters
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> if <hi>Iſchyras</hi> in <hi>Alexandria</hi> were
Schiſmaticks; if from the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of our

can be a Schiſmatick; then the Sectaries of

               <hi>England</hi> are Schiſmaticks, not only from
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but from the whole

            <p>Having thus ſtated the antient notion of
Schiſm, and found it a henous impiety,

them the juſtice to examine the <hi>Doctors</hi> Plea,

<hi>England,</hi> that there is no ſuch diſtinct orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Church in <hi>England,</hi> that is, a ſeparate
body from the Catholick Church, I am
then of his opinion: But if he means, that
the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> have no power of
Government over the Chriſtians in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
it is a very foul miſtake, to ſpeak in
the modeſteſt phraſe: for I have already
prov'd, that the Arch-biſhops and Biſhops
have as much Juriſdiction in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Provinces and Dioceſes of <hi>England,</hi>
as any other Patriarchs and Biſhops of the
Catholick Church ever had in theirs: and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52132:20"/>
if the <hi>Act of Uniformity</hi> be a Law, I am
ſure there is ſuch an eſtabliſh'd being as a
National Church.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> In <hi>Pag.</hi> 30. his gravity drolls, and gives us a

<hi>muſt find us an Officer clothed with

Now Sir, let this paſs for a piece of wit,
though it is as wide from reaſon, as <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi>
from <hi>Berwick.</hi> What though the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Antioch</hi> could not excommunicate
from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and from
thence to the borders of <hi>Perſia,</hi> muſt there
therefore be no governing Church in <hi>Greece?</hi>
and might the Chriſtians in <hi>Antioch</hi> by
that Logick ſeparate themſelves from the
communion and juriſdiction of their proper
Patriarchs without Schiſm? If our Author
could have prov'd, that there were any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
or Natives of <hi>England,</hi> that were <hi>de
jure</hi> exempt from the Canons of this
Church, and the juriſdiction of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Biſhops, then there had been ſomething of
argument: But if the <hi>Doctor</hi> for contumacy
and diſorder ſhould be excommunicated from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52132:21"/>
Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Berwick,</hi> I am ſure
without abſolution, <hi>de jure</hi> he could not
communicate with any Aſſembly of the
Church in <hi>England,</hi> though he travail'd
from <hi>Berwick</hi> to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Mount Michael</hi> in <hi>Cornwall:</hi> and this I
fancy, does ſtrongly conclude, That the
Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſuch a part of the
Catholick Church, which hath a proper
and peculiar juriſdiction over all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in this Kingdom.</p>

               <note place="margin">Page 10. Sect. 12.</note> Our<hi> Doctor, pag. 10. ſect. 12. </hi>owns it as

bound in duty both to God and his own ſoul,
to joyn himſelf to ſome particular Society of

and faithfulneſs as in any other part of the

            <p>To this he anſwers <hi>pag.</hi> 11. That the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs

that they cannot communicate with us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52132:21"/>
There is nothing can juſtly be called ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but what tranſgreſſes ſome manifeſt
Law of God or Nature: and could the
<hi>Doctor</hi> have prov'd, that any thing pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed

did violate any of thoſe Divine
Rules, his <hi>Plea</hi> had been allowed, and his
Party might vindicate their Non-conformity.
But to Tranſgreſs a plain Law of God, to
diſobey the Orders of our Governours, and
yet to give us no better reaſon for it, than
to ſay, they fancy the things are ſinful, is ſo
far from excuſing, that it aggravates the
guilt. For, Firſt, Their diſobedience is an
affront to their Governours, and then the
doing this only upon the account of their
own judgement or fancy, is an affront to
God: for private conſcience to uſurp the
Soveraignty of God, and to lay ſuch Divine
Obligations upon the ſoul and mind, which
God never impos'd. The nature and guilt
of this diſobedience is exactly repreſented

dwelt in <hi>Bethel</hi> pretends a new Revelation,
and that with ſuch cunning deluſion, as he
prevailed with the young Prophet to go
back and dine with him at <hi>Bethel;</hi> but that
entertainment coſt him his life, <hi>Verſe</hi> 24.
The reaſon of this ſeverity was very juſt
and equitable; for God had given him an
expreſs command not to eat in that place,
and that charge was reveal'd to him by
ſome ſuch manifeſt way of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he was as much aſcertain'd, it was
the Word of the Lord, as he was aſſur'd of
his own being: And therefore he was juſtly
puniſh'd for diſobeying a plain command,
and hearkning to a pretended Revelation,
which was not perſonally reveal'd to him,
and of the truth of which he could not be ſo
much ſecur'd, as he was of his former Viſion.
Thus obedience to Governours in general, is
as manifeſt a Law of God as was ever given
to the World, and we are in no particular
to diſobey them, except we can produce
another Divine Law of equal evidence and
Authority which prohibits our obedience in
that particular; or elſe I believe from the
proceſs of the former ſtory, it is diſpleaſing
to God to tranſgreſs ſuch a plain certain
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52132:22"/>
Law, without a manifeſt prohibition from
Heaven, but only out of niceneſs of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or private judgement. And if the
Church ſhould part with all thoſe things
which Diſſenters judge to be ſinful, there
could be neither Church nor Government:
for we muſt throw off our Hoods and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
to gratifie the ſcrupulous Puritan;
we muſt ſtrip our ſelves ſtark-naked to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the Fanaticiſm of the <hi>Adamites;</hi> nay,
we muſt part not only with Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
but the whole Liturgie and Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy
of the Church, becauſe ſome fancy
them to be Anti-chriſtian; nay, the Creed
is not ſecure, we muſt expunge the Article
of Chriſts Divinity to humour the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
we muſt blot out the Propitiation of
Chriſt, the Doctrine of the Trinity, and
the Reſurrection of the body, to gratifie the
<hi>Quakers:</hi> and ſo we muſt not only deface
the front and out-ſide of the Temple, but
even raze it to the ground, becauſe it does
not pleaſe the eye of theſe men of <hi>Babel:</hi>
nay, we muſt renounce our reaſon and our
ſenſes too to ſatisfie the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Tranſubſtantiation, and ſo by this
method, at length we muſt neither be men
nor Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But let us put the caſe at the worſt, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52132:23"/>
ſuppoſe what theſe men fancy, were really
true; That there were ſome things enjoyn'd
by the Church, which were really ſinful;
I confeſs this would be a difficult and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
circumſtance, but yet it would not
juſtifie a total ſeparation, and the erecting
of new modell'd Churches; for I have prov'd
before, that we are bound by the eternal
reaſons of Peace and Order to communicate
with thoſe Biſhops, and that part of the
Catholick Church under which we live:
and if it ſhould ſo happen, that ſome things
evidently ſinful were enjoyn'd by this
Church, then we might remove into ſome
other part of the Catholick Church, that
were of a ſounder conſtitution. But if we
continued within the Juriſdiction of this
Church, I think we ſhould be oblig'd to
communicate with it in Publick Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Faith, in Devotions and Sacraments,
and as far as we could without manifeſt ſin.
We might with peace and patience enjoy a
pure conſcience in our own family, but it
could never be lawful by any rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
to make a total ſeparation, and to
ſet up another form of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in oppoſition to that under whoſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
we live.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in the <hi>Appendix</hi> hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52132:23"/>
a new Argument to vindicate the
Non-conformiſts in upholding Conventicles
diſtinct from the Aſſemblies of the Church
of <hi>England:</hi> The ſumm of his new Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amounts to thus much.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That neceſſity is laid upon them by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law to preach the Goſpel;<note place="margin">Pag. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> as for their
communion with our Churches, it is but an
humane eſtabliſhment: Now ſeeing they
cannot preach in our Aſſemblies, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of a Divine Law obliges them to teach in
Conventicles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Sir, to encounter this Gigantick
reaſon, we muſt enquire the truth of his
firſt <hi>Poſtulatum,</hi> Whether any ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
be laid upon theſe men to preach the
Goſpel?</p>
            <p>Indeed I have met with a <hi>Geneva</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
that ſtoutly believes, that neceſſity
was laid upon <hi>Cain</hi> to be a Murderer, and
upon <hi>Judas</hi> to be a Traytor: Now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
if this Divinity be true, they may be
under the unavoidable fate of Schiſm and
Rebellion, and then we ought to pity
and excuſe them, and lay the guilt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
But I will ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to be too
good and modeſt for to accuſe God, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52132:24"/>
acquit himſelf. And the neceſſity he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
is founded in their call to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.
Now Sir, there will be a neceſſity for
us to enquire the truth of this Divine Call: for
the Parliament were a very <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrim</hi>
to forbid theſe men to ſpeak openly in the
name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> if they were certainly ſent
of God. But I ſhall ask them the ſame
Queſtion concerning their Miſſion, that our
Saviour asked the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning <hi>John</hi>'s
Baptiſm, <hi>Was it from Heaven, or of men?</hi>
If they ſhall ſay from men, then they muſt
ſhew us their orders from the hands of the
Biſhops, the Apoſtles Succeſſors, who only
have Authority with <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain Elders
or Prieſts in every City: If they ſay from
Heaven, they muſt then bring us very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
credible Witneſſes to aſſure us, that they
were called by a voice from the clouds, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in his way to <hi>Damaſcus:</hi>
And yet if this were done, we live in ſuch
a Sceptick Age, that men would not credit
the Boaſt of Revelation without the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials
of a Miracle. And I confeſs I
cannot blame the Chriſtian World for this
ſuſpecting humour; for ſo many impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
and deluſions have been impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the World by this pretence, that 'tis pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
not to be too credulous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52132:24"/>
Now Sir, you may obſerve, that theſe
fanciful Viſions and Revelations have
ſtrangely ſwelled theſe men; for they are
no leſs in their own opinion, than the great
Apoſtles of Chriſt, and therefore with
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they cry out, <hi>Neceſsity is laid upon
us, and wo be unto us if we preach not the
Goſpel:</hi> that is, Sir, That the Kingdom of
<hi>England</hi> are ſtill Jews and Barbarians, and
except theſe chief Apoſtles preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
there is no hopes of their converſion
from Gentiliſm or Judaiſm. Nay, <hi>pag.</hi> 5, 6.
he tells us, <hi>That there is ſuch a neceſsity
for theſe men to preach in Conventicles,
that the everlaſting welfare of thouſands of
mens ſouls depend upon it.</hi> Wo, wo to
the King and Parliament, that ſhould dare
to ſtop the mouths of theſe men, upon
whoſe breath depends the ſalvation of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of ſouls! Why Sir, this is far more
miſchievous, than ſhutting up the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi>
breaking the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, or
ſpoiling all the Trade of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Sir, I hope this dreadful Harangue
will not fright you, for all is but noiſe and
canting: for I dare aſſure you, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law will no way hinder the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Goſpel, nor hazard one
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52132:25"/>
ſoul in <hi>England:</hi> for Chriſtianity will be
ſoberly preach'd in <hi>England,</hi> though all theſe
men be ſilenc'd. And beſides, I ſhould
think by the principles of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> that
the ſalvation of ſouls were more fix'd and
fatal, than to depend upon the ſilence or
preaching of a few Non-conforming Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
You know Sir, the Decree of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
Election was dated long before
that Reprobate <hi>Act of Uniformity,</hi> and
therefore there is no fear of loſing one of
the elect, though theſe men be ſtruck
dumb: and as for the Reprobates, all the
Oratory of Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and the reſt
of thoſe mighty men can never alter their
ſadder fate. And therefore I think I may
conclude from their own Divinity, that
there is no neceſſity laid upon them to
preach the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note>Mr.<hi> H. </hi>ſolemnly propounds this weighty
Queſtion,<hi> Which will be moſt for the glory
of God, either for the Non-conforming
Teachers to preach the Goſpel to their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
or to keep the Union of their Pariſh
Churches?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which Queſtion there is a very eaſie
Anſwer; for no doubt, the God of order is
more glorified by Unity, Peace and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52132:25"/>
to our Governours, than by diſorder
and confuſion. And therefore I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this by inverting the Argument: They
may live in the communion of the Church,
without the leaſt hazard of their ſalvation;
and neceſſity is laid upon them to obey their
Governours; and wo be unto them if they
preach the Goſpel in Conventicles, and by
walking diſorderly, trouble the peace and
order both of Church and State.</p>
            <p>But there is one Plea more for this Schiſm
or Separation, (call it which you pleaſe)
and that is cunningly inſinuated in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
definition of Schiſm by Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>pag.</hi> 17. <hi>Schiſm is an unneceſſary ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from that part of the viſible Church,
of which we once were members.</hi> That
their ſeparation is unneceſſary, let the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
himſelf judge, who <hi>pag.</hi> 9. tells us,
they differ from us only in the inſignificant
fringes and laces of Forms and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Now I fancy, it were a very unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
and undutiful thing, for a Son to
diſown and deſert his Mother, only becauſe
the fringe and lace of her garment did not
pleaſe his eye.</p>
            <p>But the myſterie lyes in the laſt words of
the diſtinction, A ſeparation from that part
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52132:26"/>
of the Church, of which we once were
members. Now Sir, there are vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of perſons in <hi>England</hi> who were never
baptized by the Miniſtery of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> or had any communion with her,
and then by the judgement of Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>
cannot be charg'd with Schiſm or ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from her.</p>
            <p>But this is already anſwer'd, for I have
prov'd, that they are bound in duty to live
in communion with thoſe Biſhops and
Prieſts, or that part of the Catholick
Church, under which they reſide: and if
they never were in the communion of this
Church, they have been the longer in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and diſobedience, and that is a very
ill method of excuſing the crime.</p>
            <p>By this Sophiſtry Schiſm can only be the
ſin of the firſt generation: <hi>Novatus</hi> and his
contemporaries that firſt departed from the
communion of the Catholick Church, were
indeed Schiſmaticks, but then thoſe who
were baptiz'd and educated by that faction,
were never in the communion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, and ſo by this argument
were free from Schiſm, and ſo downwards
from generation to generation. Now this
looks like Magick, for it teaches us an art
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52132:26"/>
how to ſplit the Church into a thouſand
pieces, and to continue this diviſion for
ever; and yet in a little while there ſhould
be no diſ-union: for it is only the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the firſt Authors to break off from
the Catholick Church, but then as many
as they propagate to the end of the world
are no Schiſmaticks, becauſe they never had
any perſonal communion.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, having aſſerted that the Unity
of the Catholick Church conſiſts not only
in the unity of faith, but in a ſucceſſion of
Biſhops and Prieſts, and a regular obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to their inſpection and conduct; give
me leave to reflect and conſider what dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
concluſions our Adverſaries may draw
from this notion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This will be accuſed of too much
kindneſs to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for they
having continued their ſucceſſion of Biſhops
from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> this will acquit them from
Schiſm, and place them within the body of
the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>I hope Sir, it will not offend, if we be
as kind to the Pope as we are to the Devil,
and allow him his due: No doubt, the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in the communion of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52132:27"/>
the Catholick Church, but yet this is no
argument for any to deſert the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and remove to that of <hi>Rome;</hi> for
our Apoſtolick Succeſſion of Biſhops is as
authentick as theirs, and our Doctrine more
Pure, Primitive and Catholick; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is irrational for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church
to accuſe us of Schiſm: for whatever they
can juſtly plead for their Unity, will equally
eſtabliſh ours with the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>I cannot better repreſent the preſent
State of the Catholick Church, than by an
alluſion to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple: The Church
of <hi>England,</hi> we are able to prove, is the
pureſt part of the Catholick Church, being
moſt refined from error and ſuperſtition, and
therefore that may be reſembled to the
<hi>Sanctum Sanctorum;</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> Church,
though ſomething defiled, yet ſtill preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Apoſtolick faith and ſucceſſion of
Patriarchs and Presbyters, may be compar'd
to the <hi>Middle Temple;</hi> The Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> like the <hi>Outward á Court,</hi> is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fan'd
with the Tables of the Money-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and defil'd by abominable ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but yet though it be filthy, it is a part
of the building, and within the <hi>Area</hi> of the
Temple: But for any to deſert the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> to communicate with that of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52132:27"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> is ſuch a frantick humour as for a man
to quit the neateſt appartment, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for the moſt ſluttiſh room in the
ſame houſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That which will raiſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
clamour is, That by this notion I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church
all the forreign Reform'd Churches,
who have no Biſhops of the Catholick line
to govern them, and ordain their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That if any of the
forreign Churches have continued a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Presbyters, who can derive their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigination
from Epiſcopal Ordination, it
ſomething leſſens their diſ-union, and gives
them a remote alliance to the Catholick
Church; yet this is but private charity,
and will not juſtifie them from Schiſm by
the Canons of the antient Church. But if
any of them have a Miniſtry, which have
no other Orders than their own Uſurpation
or popular Election, I know not how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
them from being Schiſmaticks from the
Catholick Church. And why do not the
States of <hi>Holland</hi> ſend their Profeſſors from
<hi>Leyden</hi> to <hi>London</hi> to receive Conſecration
from the hands of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, and
ſo engraft themſelves again into the unity
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52132:28"/>
of the Catholick Church? this they might
eaſily do, without being oblig'd to any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
to Papal power or innovations;
if their omiſſion of this ariſe from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and abhorrence of Epiſcopacy, I have
no Apology for them, neither would I be in
the communion of thoſe Churches for all
the Bank of their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company. If
any of the forreign Churches be under ſuch
unhappy circumſtances, that they can juſtly
plead a neceſſity for having no Biſhops or
Prieſts of the Apoſtolick Succeſſion, I have
great compaſſion for them, and queſtion
not but God accepts them: for I receive
that as an indiſputable Maxim, That where
there is an inevitable neceſſity, there can
be no guilt, though the fact it ſelf be never
ſo much irregular. But as for thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in general, I have St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Charity,
<hi>Thoſe that are without let God judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Our ſqueamiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sectaries are
offended at the Hierarchy of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it derives its ſucceſſion from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of <hi>Rome.</hi> To which I have a double
Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That I make not the Chair of
<hi>Rome</hi> the ſole Head, or Origine of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
ſucceſſion: for the Epiſcopal or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52132:28"/>
power of Government and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was equally conferred upon all the
Apoſtles by the general commiſſion of our
High Prieſt <hi>Jeſus:</hi> and therefore a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Biſhops and Prieſts from any of theſe
Apoſtles, is enough to aſſert our unity with
the Catholick Church. You know the
twelve Apoſtles are made the twelve foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-ſtones
of the Chriſtian Temple; and
that part of the Church which in a right
line is built upon St. <hi>James,</hi> is as much in
the unity and compact of the building, as
that which ſtands upon St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Let us grant it, that we claim
our ſucceſſion from the line of <hi>Rome,</hi> this
will no way prejudice the Epiſcopacy of
<hi>England:</hi> I hope it was no diſhonour to the
Holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that there were ſome of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy
that had no very good fame in the
World; it was ſufficient, that by that line
it was made evident our Lord ſprung from
<hi>Judah:</hi> and it is enough for the Biſhops of
<hi>England</hi> to make it evident, they ſprung
from the Apoſtles, and though ſome of
their line were men of impious lives, or
erroneous opinions, that no way leſſened
their power of propagation, nor invalidates
the Authority of our ſucceſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:52132:29"/>
Thus I have conſider'd Schiſm as a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the Biſhops and Prieſts of the
Apoſtolick line, and I ſee no reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
this notion. And therefore the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendixer</hi>
is vaſtly miſtaken, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. when he
tells us, <hi>That if the Parliament did legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
their Meetings, there were an end of
the Schiſm:</hi> for they might indeed by a Law
of Toleration acquit them from all the
Temporal penalties of a ſeparation, but it
would exceed all the Omnipotency of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
to diſcharge them from the guilt
of Schiſm: for they muſt firſt compel their
Teachers to take Epiſcopal Orders, and
bring in all the Conventicles into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Catholick Church, and place
them under the Government of their proper
Biſhops, or elſe they would ſtill be Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
<hi>non obſtante Statuto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I will conſider ſome
grand Abſurdities that will follow from the
denyal of this notion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The profound Fanaticks in <hi>England</hi>
clamour againſt the whole Hierarchy, and
will have the whole race of Arch-biſhops
and Biſhops to be Anti-chriſtian. Now
Sir, I'le appeal to your judgement, if this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52132:29"/>
be not blaſphemy; for then all the holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
that aſſembled in the firſt four Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils, that did aſſert the truth of
Chriſtianity againſt Pagans, Jews and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and thoſe many Biſhops of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Church that headed the noble Army of
Martyrs, muſt be damn'd as limbs of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt:
Nay, I cannot ſee how to defend
<hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> from being Anti-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
too; and if theſe Propagators of the
Chriſtian Faith, were Anti-chriſtian, where
ſhall we enquire for Chriſtianity? Nay,
this were a ſure foundation for Atheiſm;
for how can it be reconcil'd to the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a God, or the care of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that
he ſhould plant a Kingdom upon earth, with
a promiſe of his preſence and moſt careful
providence, and yet to ſuffer his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to be enſlav'd under the uſurpation of
an Anti-chriſtian yoke for ſixteen hundred
years together? if this were true, too many
wiſe men would conclude with the fool in
the <hi>Pſalmiſt, That there is no God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If this ſucceſſion of Biſhops and
Presbyters be not neceſſary to preſerve our
unity with the Catholick Church, then the
Keys muſt be thrown away, and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
is but an idle impertinence: for if
there be not a certain body or corporation
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52132:30"/>
of Chriſtians known by a ſucceſſion of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Prieſthood from the Apoſtles, how
can it be known, when a perſon is caſt out
of the Church? for if the Chriſtian Church
be like a Wilderneſs, where every family
may pitch their Tent where they pleaſe,
there is no uſe of Keyes to ſo wide a
deſert.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if this ſucceſſion be not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
how can any rational man be ever
ſatisfied in the adminiſtration of Miniſterial
Offices, as Sacraments, and Abſolution, when
there is no certain rule in the world by which
he can rationally be aſſured of the regular
Authority of him that miniſters.</p>
            <p>To conclude this, if this notion of unity
be diſown'd, then every Conventicle is a
true Church; and every man whom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
or the people fancy inſpir'd muſt be
receiv'd for a Prophet; and God muſt loſe
one of his Titles, The God of Order; and

            <p>Before I conclude, give me leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and make his Front the
Rear: (Sir, the phraſe may be allow'd,)
for if I miſtake not, the Author has been
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52132:30"/>
a man of War, and underſtands very well
the Martial Dialect.</p>
            <p>The Harangue with which the <hi>Doctor</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces
his <hi>Plea,</hi> may juſtly be inverted.</p>
            <p>It was doubtleſs one of the greateſt infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities
that ever befell the whole body of
people in theſe three Nations, that when in
the year 1662. Religion was ſo happily ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Faith, Worſhip and Government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the pattern of the antient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church in the firſt three Centuries,
and though this Religion was ratified by the
very hand of God, and the dry bones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd
by the Miracle of an unexpected Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
that yet there ſhould be amongſt
us ſo many thouſands of ſuch perverſe and
ſullen Tempers, as not to be perſwaded into
the Churches communion neither by Law,
Reaſon, nor Miracle.</p>
            <p>I cannot diſcern the <hi>Doctors</hi> ingenuity in
his ſecond <hi>Section,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 2.</note> where he originates the
<hi>Act of Uniformity</hi> in the anger, ambition
and covetouſneſs of Church-men, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
our Governours not one grain of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or Piety in the compoſure of that
Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52132:31"/>
He firſt takes notice of the anger that
reſted in the boſom of Church-men,<note place="margin">Page 2.</note> who had
been ſufferers. Methinks thoſe men who
had invaded the Rights and Revenues of
the Loyal Clergy ſhould have been content
with the publick remiſſion and charity of
the <hi>Act of Indemnity,</hi> and not expect a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
that the <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> ſhould quite
deſtroy the Church-mens memories: for
theſe ploughers had ploughed ſuch deep
furrows upon the Churches back, that it
was impoſſible ſuch impreſſions ſhould ſoon
wear out. The Doves were driven from
their neſt, and their feathers of Gold
pluck'd off by thoſe ravening Vultures, and
they were forc'd (in the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage)
<hi>to lye among the pots.</hi> And yet
after all this, they muſt not ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon all thoſe rapines, nor expreſs
any prudent caution againſt theſe Birds of
prey, but they muſt preſently be accuſed of
having too much gall.</p>
            <p>His next charge is againſt the Zeal of
Church-men to continue ſome Biſhops the
repute of Martyrs,<note place="margin">Page 2.</note> who had ſuffer'd for
the vigorous inforcing of ſome of the things
now enjoyn'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52132:31"/>
I obſerve, the <hi>Doctor</hi> very warily covers
the Blood of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, but dares
dip his fingers in that of the Biſhops; and
yet I believe, the King as well as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
is left out from his Martyrologie.
Had the Biſhops impos'd ſuch Rites and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
as had been inconſiſtent with the
reverence of Religion and the nature of
Chriſtianity; had they urged ſuch Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
which had never been practis'd in
the Catholick Church, nor required by the
Church of <hi>England:</hi> truly then the blood
of Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> ſhould have no Rubrick
in my Kalendar, for then he had ſuffered
as an evil doer. But when thoſe things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
were founded upon good reaſons of
Religion, the cuſtom of the antient Church,
and enjoyn'd by the juſt Authority of this
Nation, I think the Arch-biſhop who had
the hard fate to fall in doing of his duty,
may (in a ſober ſenſe) be ſaid to ſuffer for
righteouſneſs ſake, and be allowed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of ſome kind of Martyrdom. Sir, I
do here declare my ſelf an eternal enemy
to that Religion, which can conſecrate Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
hallow Rebellion, and ſanctifie
Rapine and Injuſtice. Nor will I ever
have any communion with thoſe men, who
Canonize the moſt infamous Traytors and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52132:32"/>
Murderers for Saints, and condemn the beſt
King and Biſhop in the World for Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors:
I don't ſee, but by the Theorems of
this Jewiſh Divinity, <hi>Barabbas</hi> might have
been Sainted, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> recorded for an
Impoſtor.</p>
            <p>The next accuſation brought againſt
Church-men, is their deſire of filthy
Lucre. I confeſs, covetouſneſs is one of
the greateſt ſhames of humane Reaſon, and
that it is a moſt abſurd impertinence to ſee
Spiritual men to fond upon the things of
earth. But if that muſt be called a deſire of
filthy Lucre, when a man perhaps a little too
paſſionately deſires and enjoyes his own
juſt Rights and Properties, then ſure it was
the fouleſt Lucre, for thoſe men no invade
the Revenues of the Church, to which they
had no Title, neither by the Law of God,
nor the Statutes of the Nation: Sure none
but a Phariſee could have overſeen ſo vaſt
a beam in his own eye, and taken ſuch
great notice of a little ſpot in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Acts of Uniformity</hi> and that againſt
Private Meetings,<note place="margin">Page 4.</note> are deſcrib'd as Severe
and Tragick,<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> as if they had been the Edicts
of <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian.</hi> I do believe, had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52132:32"/>
the very ſame Laws been by the <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperours impoſed upon the Catholick
Church in the firſt three hundred years,
they would have made a Jubilee, and have
been celebrated by the antient Chriſtians
with Hymns and Hallelujahs: The Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of theſe men differ ſo much from the
judgement of the antient Chriſtians, as if
they were not of the ſame Religion. And
Sir, you may remember ſome Ordinances
of Parliament that did more bloody execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than all the Laws and Canons Royal
of <hi>England.</hi> Sure you have not forgot,
when Loyalty to our Prince, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the eſtabliſh'd Religion was damn'd
for Malignancy; and the Loyal Nobility,
Gentry and Clergy of <hi>England</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to Axes and Halters, Plunderings
and Sequeſtrations, Priſons and Baniſhment.
And yet all theſe Tragick Scenes muſt have
a ſilken curtain drawn over them, and muſt
be interpreted as expreſſes of holy zeal,
and Rigour and Perſecution charg'd only
upon the <hi>Acts of Uniformity,</hi> and that againſt
Conventicles.</p>
            <p>From <hi>pag.</hi> 3. to <hi>pag.</hi> 7. the <hi>Doctor</hi> labours
to aſſert the great numbers of Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
and inſinuates, that the prudence of
our Governours could never have paſſed the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52132:33"/>
               <hi>Act of Uniformity,</hi> if they had not been
miſ-informed, that the numbers of Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
were very inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, in State Logick number is a
weighty argument, and in Politicks it muſt
be thought imprudence, to diſoblige a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
party, who are able to affront their
Governours, and caſt away their cords from
them; <hi>Cum plurimi peccant impunes ſunt:</hi>
But whether the eſtabliſhing parties and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
by a Law, do conſiſt with the Piety
of a Chriſtian Prince, I ſhall leave to your
Judgement to enquire. But I ſee by the
<hi>Doctor</hi>'s Maxims of Prudence, if the World
run after the Beaſt, it is but the duty and
wiſdom of the Kings of the Earth to fall
down and worſhip him: and if the <hi>Arrian</hi>
faction be great and popular, it is Prudence
in <hi>Conſtantius</hi> to Arrianize.</p>
            <p>It is worth obſerving, how theſe men to
ſerve their Intereſt can quit their old im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation
of the little flock, and to make
themſelves formidable, will appear as the
<hi>Syrians, that cover the Land.</hi> But this
Popiſh Argument of Number, is never
urg'd but upon deſign; for it is confeſs'd,
Multitude is no infallible argument of truth,
for Anti-chriſt will out poll us.</p>

He complains,<note place="margin">Page 9.</note> that there is a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Atheiſtical livers, that ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reſort to Publick worſhip, and yet theſe
eſcape the Indictments of Law &amp; Cenſures of
the Church; but all the arrows are made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
againſt the ſervants of the Living God.
Whether the Title of the Servants of God,
which theſe men appropriate to themſelves;
be not a Preſumption, I ſhall leave to be
examin'd by Omniſcience: But I am ſure,
they are guilty of ſome actions of ſo bad a

               </gap>iſtical
Separatiſts, it is our complaint and
lamentation as well as theirs. The <hi>Doctor</hi>
in the ſame Section makes the number of
the Atheiſts in <hi>England</hi> not inferiour to the
Non-conformiſts: And then by the late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation
their number will likewiſe plead
for Toleration, and it will not be prudence
to moleſt them. And where there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sectaries, it is no wonder there ſhould
be as many Atheiſts. You know Sir, it
was remarqued by a very obſerving Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>That there were more Atheiſts in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52132:34"/>
the</hi> Seven Provinces, <hi>than in the reſt of</hi>
Chriſtendom: (we muſt now except <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland)</hi>
and he gives us this reaſon for
his conjecture, That there were ſo many
Religions, that there were great numbers of
men that were of none at all.</p>
            <p>Sir, There are many impertinencies in
that little Book, which I thought not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the examination, and which your
Judgement will eaſily anſwer from the
grounds of this diſcourſe: Such is his
branding Pariſh Churches for a Popiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
which any ſober man would rather
have thought to have been the contrivance
of Reaſon and convenience; for we find
this invention elder than the Pope; for
they were founded in the Province of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
in the dayes of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> as <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi>
and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> inform us.</p>
            <p>Such another impertinence is his tedious
Harangue about Separation from Parochial
Organical Churches, which no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the conſtitution of the Catholick
Church, or the Church of <hi>England:</hi> for
though deſerting our Pariſh Church in ſome
circumſtance may be a diſorder, yet it is
no Schiſm if we communicate with any
other regular Aſſembly of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52132:34"/>
               <hi>Athanaſius</hi> does not accuſe <hi>Iſchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
of Schiſm, for ſeparating from his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Congregation and Prieſt, but for
erecting a Conventicle, and dividing from
the Biſhop, and the whole Catholick Church
in <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Diſcourſe about the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation

for an Anſwer to St. <hi>Paul</hi> and Biſhop <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon;</hi>
and when they are anſwered, we
muſt enquire further.</p>
            <p>I take no notice of the Railery againſt
Ceremonies. The neceſſity of them in

            </opener>
            <p>THere lately came to my hand the
Works of Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> Entituled
<hi>Golden Remains.</hi> The moſt Sacred
of theſe Reliques, is a little Tract
of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which you find celebrated by the
High and Mighty <hi>Tranſproſer,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
by your <hi>Doctor of Divinity,</hi> and is
the fam'd Sanctuary of our dividing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Therefore having ſome Months ſince
preſented you with my thoughts concerning
Schiſm, I thought my ſelf oblig'd to an
impartial peruſal of this Famous Tract,
for fear I might through weakneſs of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have impos'd an error upon you and
my ſelf. I found the <hi>Remains</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>
prefac'd with ſo vaſt an <hi>Encomium</hi> of the
Author, that I addreſs'd my ſelf to his
Tract of <hi>Schiſm</hi> with a very awful reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
reſolving to ſubmit to the cleareſt
Reaſons, and not to be aſham'd to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
by a Perſon of that admir'd Acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
But having with the moſt ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
conſider'd that Diſcourſe, I find my
notion of Schiſm left untouch'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:52132:36"/>
But becauſe our Non-conformiſts ſo oft
Appeal to this Tractate, I reſolv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how far it could ſerve their Intereſt,
and juſtifie their Separation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Page 2.</note>Firſt therefore he informs us, That there
are two things which ſerve to compleat a
Schiſm.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The choice of a Biſhop in oppoſition
to the former.</item>
               <item>2. The erecting of a Church or Oratory
for the dividing parties to meet in.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now I acknowledge this notion of Schiſm
to be both Antient and Orthodox: Schiſm
being conſider'd as a breach of charity, or
a diſſolving of that Bond of Peace, which
we are ſo often ſolemnly changed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
inviolate. And without a great and
evident neceſſity, this Dividing muſt be
very diſpleaſing unto the Prince of Peace,
who did command us to <hi>be One, even as
He and the Father are One.</hi> Of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was the Schiſm of the <hi>Arrians, Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
and <hi>Donatiſs</hi> at their firſt dividing:
They ſet up Altar againſt Altar, had Biſhops
of their own party, and their peculiar
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52132:36"/>
Oratories, and would have no communion
with the Biſhops or Aſſemblies of that
ſtanding part that alwayes called themſelves
the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> by the title of
long preſcription and the eſtabliſhment of
a Law, is the ſtanding Church of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with which all the people of this
Kingdom are bound to communicate; But
our Non-conformiſts have choſen to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Paſtors in oppoſition to the Biſhops
and Prieſts of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
have erected their diſtinct Congregations to
confront our Church Aſſemblies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>'s definition they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of compleat Schiſm.</p>
            <p>But Sir, it muſt be obſerv'd, that theſe
men have run further than the <hi>Arrians, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letians</hi>
and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did at their firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding:
for though they had ſo little cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as for a matter of diſpute, to divide
from the communion of the other part of
the Church, yet they had ſo much Prudence,
as they preſerv'd to themſelves ſome Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Prieſts who had receiv'd their
Conſecration and Orders from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church; and when their Biſhops and
Prieſthood were worn out, the Factions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52132:37"/>
for they were not arriv'd to ſuch a
height of Fanaticiſm, as to think themſelves
a Church without the Government and
Prieſthood of the Apoſtolick line. No,
they were ſo ſacred and curious in this, that
I find the <hi>Arrians</hi> cavilling at the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> as not being Catholick
and Canonical; juſt as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> objected
againſt us the <hi>Naggs-head</hi> Conſecration.
And (by the way) that was the moſt
weighty and conſiderable attempt that ever
<hi>Rome</hi> made upon the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
and could they clearly have invalidated and
diſannull'd our ſucceſſion of Biſhops and
Prieſthood, all the learning of <hi>England</hi>
could not have prov'd us a Catholick
Church. But this Cavil was with demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
confuted by that elaborate Piece of
Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> Sir, I
hope that the merit of this Digreſſion will
beg its own pardon.</p>
            <p>But to return to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sectaries ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>'s notion, it would be
indeed a very unhappy Schiſm in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> for the Biſhop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>
and his Presbyters and Juriſdiction, to
divide from the communion of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and to ſet up a Church
of the <hi>Eaſt Angles</hi> divided from that of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52132:37"/>
               <hi>Weſt.</hi> But ſuppoſing this, there were yet
left to us this ſatisfaction, that we were
ſtill under the Government and Miniſtry of
that Biſhop and Prieſthood, of whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration
and Orders we were ſufficiently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd;
and though this would be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
Faction in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hierarchy,
yet it would be no Schiſm from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church.</p>
            <p>But our Separatiſts are run to a further
diſtance; for they have not ſet up Altar
againſt Altar, or one Biſhop in oppoſition
to another, but have thrown off all the
Biſhops and Prieſts of the Apoſtolick Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
and have erected a Synagogue againſt
the Church; and ſet up a Lay-Elder in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the Biſhop and Prieſt. And this
is not only a diſobedience againſt the Laws,
and a Schiſm from the eſtabliſh'd Church
of <hi>England,</hi> but is a ſeparation from the
Catholick Church. And ſeeing our Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
have no Prieſthood, I believe their
Conventicles to be no more a Church, than
a Club of Mechanicks in a Coffee-houſe.
For though ſome of theſe Congregations
may retain Impoſition of hands as a mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Ordination, yet the impoſing of Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hands
have no more power to confer Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
than I to have to conſtitute a Judge of
<hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52132:38"/>
Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> makes Schiſm and Sedition of
a very reſembling nature:<note place="margin">Page 1.</note> He tells us, <hi>That
Sedition is a Lay Schiſm, and Schiſm is an
Eccleſiaſtical Sedition.</hi> Now, 'tis true, it
would be a great Sedition to ſet up a Prince
of the Blood in oppoſition to our Soveraign,
who by long and Legal Inveſtiture hath
been poſſeſſed of Regal Supremacy: But it
would be Sedition of a deeper dye, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all Allegiance to our Prince, and to
caſt off the whole Royal Line, and to ſet up
a Forreigner, or one who had no alliance to
the Royal Blood.</p>
            <p>Thus, if to ſet up one Biſhop in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to another (though both be of the
ſame Apoſtolick ſucceſſion) if this be a
Schiſm and a great diſorder, then ſure, for
our Sectaries to caſt off all the Biſhops and
Prieſts of the Catholick Church, and to
ſet up ſuch Teachers and Governours, who
have no relation to the Sacerdotal Line,
this muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the outmoſt and
moſt Schiſmatical ſeparation from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church.</p>
            <p>But Mr.<hi> Hales </hi>proceeds and gives us a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of Schiſm.<hi> There is a Schiſm,
where only one part is the Schiſmatick, for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52132:38"/>
where the occaſion is neceſſary, there not he
that ſeparates, but he that is the cauſe of
the Separation is the Schiſmatick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſhall be allowed to be Orthodox
too: and when our Non-conformiſts can
demonſtrate, that it is neceſſary for them to
ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we
will take off the Indictment, and abſolve
them from Schiſm. But they muſt prove
this neceſſity from weightier Topicks than
Fringe and Lace. They muſt make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that they cannot communicate with
us, without manifeſt diſhonour to God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his holy Religion, and
evident hazard of their ſalvation. But this
can never be prov'd, but from the New Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
of private Conſcience, for I am ſure the
Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſo happily conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that there is no Law nor Canon in the
four <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> or in the Apoſtolick <hi>Acts</hi>
or <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> that will juſtifie a ſeparation
from it, much leſs vote it to be neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our Author tells us,<hi> That there
is a Schiſm in which both parties are the
Schiſmaticks; for where the occaſion of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
is unneceſſary, neither ſide can be
excuſed from the guilt of Schiſm. </hi>An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of this he gives us in that great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52132:39"/>
between the<hi> Eaſtern </hi>and<hi> Weſtern</hi>Churches about the Obſervation of<hi> Eaſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs I can make no Defence for the
Churches of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt</hi> for that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
diviſion upon the account of a
different Ceremony; for ſure the ſeveral
parts of the Catholick Church might have
enjoy'd their peculiar Rites and uſages, and
yet preſerv'd an entire peace and univerſal
communion. I am of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s mind,
<hi>Totum hoc genus liberas habet obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. 118.</note>
               <hi>nec Diſciplina ulla eſt in his melior

modo agat quo agere viderit Eccleſiam ad
quamcunque forte devenerit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how this Inſtance of the Paſchal
Schiſm ſhould be improv'd to ſerve the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sectaries, I can no
way diſcern. He that can from hence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
a Plea for our Non-conformiſts, muſt
have greater skill in Theological Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
than I dare pretend to. For though
this unhappy controverſie occaſioned a breach
of charity and communion, yet here was no
departure from the Catholick Church on
either ſide, nor any violation of Order and
Government; for the Chriſtians of the <hi>Eaſt</hi>
obſerv'd the Canons and Cuſtoms of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52132:39"/>
               <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church, and ſubmitted themſelves
to the Government and Miniſtery of thoſe
Biſhops and Prieſts, in whoſe Juriſdiction
they liv'd, and ſo likewiſe in the <hi>Weſt, vice
verſa.</hi> And would our Non-conformiſts
learn but ſo much Order and Obedience,
there were an end of the Schiſm.</p>
            <p>Thus I have conſider'd the Theorems of
our Admir'd Author, and I find no miſchief
in them; but there are ſtill behind ſuch a
Train of conſequences, as (in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
are of very evil inſinuation, and do
no way merit to be reckon'd among his
<hi>Golden Remains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot approve of his ſevere Cenſure
upon the Antient Church, upon the account
of the Paſchal difference: for he interprets
that Breach<hi> to be a juſt judgement of God,</hi>(But then Sir, mark the Provocation)<hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>(ſayes he)<hi> that through ſloth and
blind obedience, men examin'd not the
things, which they were taught: but like
Beaſts of Burden patiently couch'd down, and
indifferently underwent whatever their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
laid upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I abhorr the Barbarity of rifling Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres,
or diſturbing the Aſhes of the Dead.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52132:40"/>
But I wiſh our ingenious Author had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
ſome kinder Emblems for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Chriſtians, than Aſs and Camel. For
though they were ſo humble and peaceable,
as quietly to ſubmit to the Orders of their
Spiritual Governours, yet they were not ſo
tame as to truckle to an Idol, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to couch by <hi>Imperial</hi> Injunctions.</p>
            <p>I will never plead for a brutiſh inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
or a blind and unchriſtian obedience
to our Superiours. The Church provides
by a Canon, that all Chriſtians ſhould once
be <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> inſtructed in the plain Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of Faith and Piety; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not intended, that men ſhould be
impos'd upon in matters that concern their
common ſalvation, and there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that in things of that moment men
ſhould be cautious and inquiſitive. But I
believe that Apoſtolick Canon, <hi>Let all things
be done in Decency and Order,</hi> hath left a great
ſcope to the wiſdom of our Superiours, to
order the publick Adminiſtrations of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And in inſtitutions of this nature
(the people being ſecured of all the pure
neceſſaries to ſalvation) I don't think they
are oblig'd to any further examination, their
greateſt duty in this caſe is a quiet ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
The Gentile Chriſtians of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52132:40"/>
knew themſelves to be free'd from all Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
or Levitical Obſervances, but yet when
the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for prudential
Reaſons and conſiderations enjoyn'd them
the Abſtinence from Blood and things offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Idols, we don't read, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
any further, but quietly obeyed that
Canon, and yet I hope thoſe primitive
Chriſtians deſerv'd a better name and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
than Beaſts of Burden in matters of
this nature, I cannot yet diſcern the guilt or
irreligion of a blind obedience.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh that all Chriſtians would
keep the common Faith, and practiſe the
plain Rules of Chriſtian Religion, and theſe
things being preſerv'd entire, I ſee no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
if in other things we ſhould leave our
Superiours to govern, and ſubmit even with
blind obedience, and not trouble our ſelves
and the World with nice and ſcrupulous
examinations. Blind or unexamining obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to our Superiours, with thoſe limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
I have ſtated, would ſo much aſſure
the peace and order of the Church, that if
it were not a vertue, yet I am ſure it would
be a leſſer crime, than Pride, Schiſm or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
diſobedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:52132:41"/>
Our Author reflects again upon the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Schiſm in theſe words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We may plainly ſee the danger of our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to Antiquity for Reſolution in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
points of Faith,<note place="margin">Page 3.</note> and how ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
we are to expect from them; for if
the Direction of the chiefeſt Guides and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors
of the Church, did in a point ſo Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
ſo mainly fail them, can we without
the imputation of great Groſsneſs and Folly,
think ſo poor-ſpirited Perſons competent
Judges of the Queſtions now on foot between
the Churches? Pardon me, I know what tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
drew that note from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Sir you may perceive that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
was very ſenſible, that there was ſome
ſuch guilt in this paſſage, as would ſtand
in need of pardon; And therefore if you
dare adventure the ſcandal of giving pardon
to a man, after he is dead, you may remit
this guilty paſſion of Mr. <hi>Hales:</hi> for my
part, I have charity for him, becauſe he tells
us, that this expreſſion was drawn from
him, by ſome vehement Temptation. And
you know, that a very great Apoſtle under
a Temptation denyed the Son of God; and
if this Good man in ſuch a Hurricane, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52132:41"/>
all the Fathers of the Church, this
ſhould plead for our compaſſion.</p>
            <p>What that particular Temptation was
that occaſioned this Ecſtaſie, he was not
pleas'd to acquaint us, and therefore I
cannot determine, but give me leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.
I find Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> had the ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny
to be a member of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Synod,
and he informs us in his Epiſtles, that it
was ſometimes his Province, to refute the
Arguments of the <hi>Remonſtrants, (Hoſte
abſente.)</hi> Now perhaps, obſerving that
thoſe poor-ſpirited Antients, would not be
preſs<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d into the <hi>States</hi> ſervice, but were all
of a different opinion from that Synod, who
knows but this unlucky contradiction, and
his converſing too much with <hi>Dammannus,</hi>
might put him into an unwary heat, and
make him Reprobate all Antiquity. Our
Church has ſo much Reverence for the
Antients, as in her publick Articles to own
the Authority of the firſt four General
Councils, and King <hi>James</hi> himſelf would
never impoſe upon us the Novel Decrees
of <hi>Dort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs Sir, ever ſince I underſtood
Greek, I have had the Groſsneſs and Folly
(as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> interprets it) to have more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52132:42"/>
value for the Judgement of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> and St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi>
than for the opinion of <hi>Bogerma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Sybrandus, Beza</hi> or <hi>Gomarus.</hi> I have
been ſo ſilly as to think the Antient, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> (that was but three
Centuries remov'd from the Apoſtles) did
merit more Authority and eſteem in the
Chriſtian Church, than that partial and
Modern Aſſembly of <hi>Dort.</hi> And I cannot
yet alter my Perſwaſion. But I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quit my ſelf from thoſe ugly imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Groſsneſs and Folly.</p>
            <p>I muſt therefore examine the Arguments
of Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> by which he invalidates the
Authority of the Antients.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He accuſes them for Poor-ſpirited
Perſons. Indeed they never were ſo daring
as to be ſo bold with the Attributes of God,
as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Profeſſors were in the Synod
of <hi>Dort,</hi> or as <hi>Beza</hi> was in <hi>Geneva:</hi> but yet
theſe poor-ſpirited men had the Reſolution
to be Martyrs for the Name of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and
that Sir, I ſhould think, is a very divine and
noble piece of Gallantry. Beſides, ſome
of them left to the World their <hi>Golden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi>
excellent Monuments of their Prety
and Learning, as worthy as our Authors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:52132:42"/>
Secondly, But his great Argument againſt
Appealing to the Judgement of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
is their indiſcretion about that trivial
matter of the obſervation of <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Churches of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> were
not without ſome plauſible reaſons, for their
different obſervance of that Feſtival, and
though they will not amount to a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Apology for that Controverſie, yet
they will ſomething help to leſſen the vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Indiſcretion: for the <hi>Eaſtern</hi>
Church had been taught by the Apoſtles,
an innocent complyance to the <hi>Jews</hi> in
thoſe Quarters, that they might not ſcandal
them by a ſudden and total departure from
all the Moſaical Rites and Obſervances;
and therefore the Chriſtians in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
them by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Rule of complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance,
to the <hi>Jews</hi> they ſo far became <hi>Jews,</hi>
as to celebrate their <hi>Eaſter</hi> Feſtival, upon
the fourteenth Month, when the <hi>Jews</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
their Paſchal. And though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that Reaſon was out of force in two
or three Centuries, yet Sir, you know, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
has a Great Empire upon wiſer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
than Beaſts of Burden: and therefore
it was no Prodigy of imprudence, nor any
Divine Judgement, if they were ſo tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52132:43"/>
of an Antient cuſtom, that had a very
innocent and Apoſtolick Foundation. The
<hi>Weſtern</hi> Church being at a great diſtance
from <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> was never oblig'd to that
complyance to the <hi>Jews:</hi> But being left
to their Chriſtian Liberty, and aſſured by
an infallible Oracle, That our Lord aroſe
from the Dead upon the firſt day of the
Week, therefore they judged it moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
and rational, to celebrate the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
Feaſt of the Reſurrection, upon a
<hi>Dies Dominicus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This appear'd ſo reaſonable to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Prince <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, that
with great Reſolution he oppos'd the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>
complyance of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Chriſtians,
and in his General Epiſtle concerning the
Tranſactions of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> he
diſſwades the Chriſtian Church from that
cuſtom, <hi>Itaque nihil vobis commune ſit
cum infeſtiſſima Judaeorum Turba—

Ratification of the Canon of <hi>Nice,</hi>
he inforces a General Uniformity in the
Obſervation of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> by a very plauſible
Reaſon,<note place="margin">Niceph. l. 8. c. 25. Lang. Int. <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>But grant this Controverſie to be trivial,
and the Antients indiſcreet in the manage
of it, yet I cannot diſcern the Logick of
his concluſion, that therefore they are not
to be appeal'd unto in any controverſie of

            <p>The ſenſe of this Argument amounts to
thus much, Becauſe the wiſeſt and moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>There are two Caſes in which we Appeal
to the old Catholick Fathers.</p>

               <item>1. In Controverſies of Faith, or the great
Doctrines of Chriſtian Religion.</item>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52132:44"/>
and Diſcipline of the Antient
Church.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now the great Diſpute is, Whether we
may appeal to their judgement in matters
of Faith. And here I will freely truſt
you with my Sentiments. My Belief of
the great Fundamentals and Doctrinals of
Chriſtianity is founded upon thoſe Divine
Oracles of the Holy Scriptures: But my
Perſwaſion is much help'd and eſtabliſh'd
by the univerſal conſent of the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church in the ſame Articles. For
I conſider, that the Antients of the firſt
four Centuries, liv'd very nigh the time
of the firſt Promulgation of Chriſtianity,
when the Senſe of the Apoſtolick Age,
was yet freſh and early. And I am huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirm'd by obſerving, that the old
<hi>Greek</hi> Fathers and Councils expounded
the Creed juſt as we do: for ſure they
muſt in reaſon be ſuppos'd to underſtand
the Idiom of their own Language, and
therefore to interpret the Myſteries of the
Goſpel better than we, who are ſo many
Ages remov'd from the firſt Revelation,
and are but Forreigners to that Language in
which the Goſpel was writ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:52132:45"/>
There is ſtill a controverſie on foot in
the Churches (to uſe the Phraſe of our
Author) concerning the eternal Divinity
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of God, and the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Fleſh is ſtill called in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
Now though my Belief of theſe
two Articles, is primarily founded upon
the Sacred Scriptures, yet that which makes
up my Plerophorie, is the authority of the
Antients. For though the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
appear very expreſs in thoſe two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
yet I have ſeen all thoſe Texts ſo
cunningly evaded by the plauſible interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that I confeſs it
is great ſatisfaction to me, that the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Catholick Church did in General
Councils maintain thoſe Articles and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Holy Text in that ſenſe which
we receive. I was about to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
this with an old ſentence of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius
Lyrinenſis;</hi> but I conſider'd, that
to prove the authority of the Antients, by
an antient Author, would be falſe Logick,
and a groſs impertinence; and I am very
ſhye of thoſe ill-looking imputations.
Therefore I will end with the authority
of the great <hi>Chamier,</hi> who was but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Divine, and of the Reformed <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:52132:45"/>
Church, and I hope our Appeal to him

Church, as they are to their own Court,
and allow the antient Records of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church to be as Sacred, as the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52132:46"/>
old Rolls of Parliament, they would have
oblig'd themſelves never to alter Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Government. For we can ſhew more
numerous, and far more antient Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove the Primitive and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Juriſdiction of Biſhops, than their
Lordſhips can produce, to aſſert their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Prerogatives.</p>
            <p>But Sir, if you would more clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
this neceſſity or uſefulneſs of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to the Antients, let me humbly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
this advice. I know your Temper
is ſerious and contemplative, but I adviſe
you upon this ſpecial occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
your mind into an extraordinary Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
and when you are retired, and
your eyes ſhut, and your arms folded,
Then think out of the World all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and Fathers, Fancy we had no more
notice of the Judgement or Practice of
the Antients, than <hi>Origen</hi> had of his
State of Pre-exiſtence; Suppoſe this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Age of the Church to have no Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Chriſtian Antiquity, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels
and Epiſtles in <hi>Greek,</hi> and no skill
in that Language, but what we learned
from Pagan Orators, Poets and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers:
And at my next Viſit pray acquaint
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52132:47"/>
me with the Reſult of your thoughts;
Whether in thoſe conſiderations you did
not fancy a ſtrange Darkneſs upon the
face of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and ſee a neceſſity
of a New Revelation to interpret the
Old.</p>
            <p>Our Author proceeds and tells us,<hi> He
ſees no Reaſon, why </hi>opinionum varietas &amp;
opinantium unitas<hi> ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, why
we might not differ in opinion, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi>in Sacris.</p>
            <p>The honour of God and Religion have
ſo much ſuffered by our Diviſions, that I
wiſh with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 15. 6. <hi>That we
might with one mind and with one mouth
Glorifie God the Father of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi> But ſince our controverſies in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are ſo far multiplyed, that there
is no hope the Chriſtian World ſhould
ever unite in one judgement, without the
force of a Miracle, yet it would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
if all Chriſtians would quietly enjoy
their Differences of Opinion, and be ſo far
of one mind, as to go up together to the
Temple to pray and communicate with the
Catholick Church <hi>in Sacris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:52132:47"/>
The Church of <hi>England</hi> retains no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
but thoſe which have the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
Authority of Divine Inſtitution.
All the Prayers of this Church are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
directed to the Eternal God:
and all preſented in the Name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
We Petition for nothing, but what the
Religion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> allows us to ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
And therefore I ſee no reaſon why
all the People of this Nation, who are
not Atheiſts and Anti-chriſtian, ſhould
not communicate with us in thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
Services of Prayers, Praiſes and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentals.</p>
            <p>And this is all that is required by that
Tyrannical <hi>Act of Uniformity.</hi> And
therefore that great Popular Orator in
his late Harangue to the Houſe of Lords
has impoſed a Fallacy upon us, For he
paſſionately complains againſt the Law,
<hi>for deveſting the People of their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
only becauſe they cannot agree with
Church-men in ſome uncertain Opinions
of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope it will not amount to <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Magnatum</hi> to ſay, that this is meer
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52132:48"/>
Sophiſtry. For our Laws proſecute no
man for difference of Opinion; no, ſo
far from this, that the very <hi>Act</hi> againſt
<hi>Conventicles</hi> allows our Diſſenters, not
only their different Opinions, but the
quiet uſe and enjoyment of their ſeveral
Religions in their own Families; nay, it
granted them a further Favour and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
that they might receive four or
five more of the ſame diſſenting Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
to make the exerciſe more full
and ſatisfying. Here was nothing prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
but noiſe and multitude. But they
might notwithſtanding that Law have
peaceably enjoyed their different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Property too (that great Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
of State Religion.) The Church
doth not put the ſouls of men upon the
Rack, or command an exact conſent to
all her Publick Articles; but indulges a
difference of Opinion: it only provides
for the Beauty, Order and Solemnity of
Publick Worſhip, by enjoyning all the
Chriſtians of this Kingdom to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with us in thoſe common <hi>Sacra,</hi> that
all ſober Chriſtians acknowledge to be of
univerſal obligation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52132:48"/>
But here your <hi>Doctor</hi> would Rejoyn,
that it is as far from <hi>Cornwall</hi> to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
as from <hi>Berwick</hi> to <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and
demand a Reaſon, why we do not exerciſe as
much charity to others, as we expect to
our ſelves, or why we ſhould not with
as much Reaſon be obliged to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with their Aſſemblies, as to expect
them to be preſent at ours? For our
Author was ſo kind to Diſſenters, as he
tells us, <hi>He ſees no Reaſon why we ſhould
not mix with thoſe divided Aſſemblies,
where there was nothing done, but what
True Piety and Devotion would brook.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I may credit my own conſcience, I
have a very ſerious love and veneration
for all True Piety and Devotion. But
I am reſolved to have no communion
with Conventicles, and will faithfully
acquaint you with my Reaſons for that
Reſolve.</p>
            <p>Firſt, My ears are not fitted for the
unintelligible Rapſodies of Enthuſiaſtick
Divinity. Nothing impreſſes upon me,
but what my Reaſon and Judgement can
give a ſober account of. And I am
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52132:49"/>
ſure, there are many Aſſemblies in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
called Religious Meetings, whoſe
chiefeſt Devotions conſiſt in nothing but
Froth and Groans (to borrow an odd
phraſe from our Author.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will appeal from our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
to Mr.<hi> Hales, </hi>who towards the
end of this<hi> Tract </hi>gives us a very Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Definition of a Conventicle.<hi> A
Conventicle is a Congregation of Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
or all Meetings upon unneceſſary
ſeparation, </hi>(and concludes)<hi> that it is
not lawful, no not for Prayer, for Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for Conference, or for any other
Religious Office whatſoever, for the People
to Aſſemble otherwiſe, than by Publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is allowed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſince I can enjoy a communion
with the Catholick Church, and all the
advantages of Chriſtianity, without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Conventicle; I think it were
neither Piety nor Devotion for me to
communicate with thoſe Congregations,
which our Author grants to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Aſſemblies. Had I lived in the dayes
of <hi>Dioclefian,</hi> I would have been a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <hi>Eccleſia Subterranea,</hi> and have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52132:49"/>
aſſembled with the Catholick Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in Caves and Grotto's, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
had conſecrated into Holy Places;
But ſince it is my happy Lot to live in
that Age and Kingdom, where Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
may be confeſſed above ground,
ſince a juſt Authority hath opened our
Churches, ſeeing I may offer all the
Publick Devotions that God requires, in
thoſe Solemn Places which the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points;
Since I can at the ſame time
be both Devout towards God, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to my Governours, I reſolve I
will have no communion with thoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
which the Law of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Canons of the Church make
irregular. Sir, I aſſure you, it adds
ſome cheerfulneſs to my Publick Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that I can at the ſame time,
both give unto God, the things that are
God's, and to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the things that are
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I reſolve I will never be a
member of our ſeparate Congregations,
becauſe in them I cannot be aſſured of
my compleat communion with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, or the advantages of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Prieſthood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:52132:50"/>
I queſtion not, but God may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
without the Abſolution of a Prieſt,
and give a man poſſeſſion of eternal
life, without the ſeal or title of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:
but ſalvation is a matter of ſuch
vaſt importance, that I would never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
it upon extraordinary Methods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in concerns of Religion and everlaſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
I love to enjoy all the ſecurity,
that God hath given to mankind. In
that great Schiſm of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſome of the
moſt ſober and conſidering <hi>Jews,</hi> were
not ſatisfied with their communion in that
new Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though it was
eſtabliſhed by the Law of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> but
returned to worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet
the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> retain'd the ſame
Creed with thoſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Calves
of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> were not deſign'd for
Idols, but ſet up in imitation of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims
in the Temple; but theſe wiſe men
were diſſatisfied, becauſe their Prieſts were
not of the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Line, and had no
other Conſecration or Authority, but
what was deriv'd from the Patents of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi>
and they could not be aſſured,
that God would accept their Oblations
from the hands of thoſe men, who had
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52132:50"/>
no Regular Prieſthood. Now there is
great Reaſon to believe, that there ſhould
be as much order in the Kingdom of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> as there was in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and therefore I am aſſur'd both by
Reaſon and Sacred Oracles, that there is
an Evangelical Prieſthood, that hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
that of <hi>Aaron;</hi> That there is a
peculiar Order of men, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
this Prieſtly Authority, by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Ordination from the Apoſtles Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.
And I eſteem theſe men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Injunction, <hi>as the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
of the manifold Myſteries of God, and
the Miniſters of Reconciliation:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(without an inevitable neceſſity)
I will never live without the advantage
and ſatisfaction of their Miniſterial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>St.<hi> Chryſoſtome </hi>in his Diſcourſe<hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>highly magnifies the Office and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a Prieſt; for ſpeaking of that
order of men, he tells us,<hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, </hi>&amp;c.<hi>That God hath inveſted the Prieſts with
ſuch Authority, as he never confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon Angels or Arch-Angels. For to
which of the Angels did he ſay at any time,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52132:51"/>
               </hi>What ever ye bind on Earth, is bound
in Heaven; and whoſe ſins, ye Remit,
they are Remitted?<hi> For as the Father
gave Power to the Son to Remit ſins, ſo the
Son of God hath committed the ſame Power
to his Miniſters on Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe the Power of Abſolution which
was conferred upon the Chriſtian Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
by the Commiſſion of our Lord,
is not ſo large, as the Pope would extend
it; nor yet ſo inconſiderable as the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
fancies it. I believe our Saviour did
not trifle, when he granted that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Apoſtles, but ſure there is
ſomething in that Authority, that is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
and momentous, and whatever it
be, I reſolve to enjoy the benefit of it.
And therefore I declare, that I would
ſooner travel from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> to
communicate with the <hi>Greek</hi> Church,
where I might be aſſured of Prieſtly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
than walk from <hi>Temple-Barr</hi> to
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to joyn with a Lay-Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.
I know no Rule in the World, that
can rationally aſſure me of Miniſterial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but a Sacerdotal ſucceſſion from
the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52132:51"/>
As for the Pretenſion of Inſpiration, it
is no more than <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Manes,</hi>
and every Impoſtor have pretended. Their
Argument from Gifts and Qualifications,
weighs nothing with me. A <hi>Jew</hi> under
the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oeconomy, might have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Butcher, who might have
ſlain his Lamb or Goat, and have dreſs'd
it, and laid it upon an Altar with as much
art and exactneſs, as the eldeſt Prieſt in
the Temple: but then it had been no
Sacrifice, nor have ever been accepted
of God, as a Legal Attonement: no, it
was the Prieſts offering Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Lev. 17. 5, 6.</note> that
made them Peace-offerings; it was the
Prieſts ſprinkling the blood upon the
Altar of the Lord, and his burning the
Fat, that was an eſſential Requiſite to
render the Oblation a ſweet ſavour unto
the Lord. Angels and Arch-Angels are
Wiſe, Zealous and Holy Spirits, but all
their excellencies do not make them Prieſts,
though in another ſenſe they are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
Spirits. To conclude this, ſince
I can no way be rationally ſecured of my
Relation to Chriſt, or of my participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the advantages of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but by a comm<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nion with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52132:52"/>
Church and its Miniſterial Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I do therefore aſſure you, that I
have a greater value for my communion
with the Prieſts and the Temple, than
for that ador'd <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And if any unhappy circumſtance
ſhould ever put me upon the experiment,
I would deſert this, to enjoy the other.</p>
            <p>Sir, if ever the Chriſtian World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
wiſe and ſober, this very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would repair the Breaches of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, and prove the final Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of Fanatick Conventicles.</p>
            <p>Our Author paſſionately declaims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Supremacy and Ambition of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, Pride and Ambition are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inconſiſtent with the humble nature of
Chriſtianity, and are ſtrange indecencies
in Spiritual Governours: and I will never
make an Apology for Vice and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
But this ought not to be urged as
a Reaſon for the extirpation of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Our Lord did not ſuſpend nor degrade
his Apoſtles, becauſe there was a ſtrife
among them, who ſhould be the greateſt.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52132:52"/>
Nor would it be juſt or charitable, to

            </p>
            <p>But Sir, our Author not only proteſts

of Biſhops: for he tells us,<hi> They do but

perſwade us, that Biſhops by Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,

            </p>
            <p>He grants, that there is a greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
due to them, than to other men,
but how this ſhould become a duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſuppoſing a juſt ſuperiority to exact it,
I cannot underſtand.</p>
            <p>I will not here ingage in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
about the Divine Right of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.
But I am ſure the Apoſtles had a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52132:53"/>
Superiority over the Seventy Diſciples
by Chriſts Inſtitution, and I am certain
that the Antient Catholick Church did
eſteem Biſhops as the Apoſtles Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.
The firſt we meet with in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Hiſtory that ever denyed the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
of Biſhops, was <hi>Aenius</hi> a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<hi>Arian,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> records him
for a Heretick, and brands his Opinion as
a Diabolical Deluſion.</p>
            <p>Sir, there remains nothing more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
in our Author, only the old Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan

Garments and Muſick in Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

            <p>Sir, I have neither mind nor leiſure

            <p n="1">1. Whether the Governours of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

more <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> than the Surplice or

            <p n="2">2. Whether a Pompous Superſtition in

than a Rude Forlorneſs? Or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Sancy Rudeneſs will not ſooner
introduce Atheiſm, than the moſt Glorious
Superſtition?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether the awful Adorations of
the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Glory of the Tabernacle
and the Temple, the Ornaments of the

or rather founded upon Moral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether a Publick Oratory or
Church that is ſet apart for the more
Solemn Worſhip of the Eternal God,
may not without Superſtition be as Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Magnificent, as the <hi>Stadthouſe</hi>
