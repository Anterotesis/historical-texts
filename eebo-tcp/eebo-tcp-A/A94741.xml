            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Infant-Baptiſme.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He preſent Tenent,<note place="margin">§. 1. The firſt Argument for Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the intereſt in the promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7.</note> according to which Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
is practiſed, is, that the Infants born of a
Believer, are univerſally to be baptized.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine and Practice conformable, is made
doubtfull to me, by theſe Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That which hath no teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for it, is doubtfull.</p>
            <p>But this Doctrine of Infant-Baptiſme, hath no teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for it; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is doubtfull.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved by examining the places that are brought for
it, which are theſe: <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, &amp;c. <hi>Acts 2. 38, 39. 1 Cor. 7. 14. Mark.</hi> 10.
14. 16. <hi>Acts 16. 15. 32. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 16. The Argument from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, &amp;c.
is almoſt the firſt and laſt in this buſineſſe; and therefore is the more
accurately to be examined; but it hath ſo many ſhapes, that I may here
take up that Speech, <hi>With what knot ſhall I hold ſhape-changing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus?</hi>
But in the iſſue, it falls into one or other of theſe forms:</p>
            <p>The firſt thus; To whom the Goſpel-covenant agrees, to them the
ſign of the Goſpel-covenant agrees alſo. But to the Infants of Believers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113333:7"/>
the Goſpel-covenant agrees; therefore to them the ſign of the Goſpel-covenant
agrees, and conſequently Baptiſme. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved
from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. where God promiſeth to <hi>Abraham, I will be a God
to thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, That we may meet with this Argument, divers things
are to be examined, which are taken for granted:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether the Goſpel-covenant, and the Covenant made with
<hi>Abraham</hi> be the ſame: Secondly, what ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> it is, of which
it is ſaid, <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy ſeed:</hi> Thirdly, whether there
be the ſame reaſon of circumciſion and of baptiſme in ſigning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-covenant:
Fourthly, whether theſe terms be convertible [<hi>Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and to be ſigned</hi>].</p>
            <p>Of theſe, I ſay; 1. The Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is not a
pure Goſpel-covenant, but mixt, which I prove;</p>
            <p>The Covenant takes its denomination from the promiſes; but the
promiſes are mixt, ſome Euangelicall, belonging to thoſe to whom
the Goſpel belongeth, ſome are Domeſtique, or Civill promiſes, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
reſpecting the Houſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and policy of <hi>Iſrael; Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That was Euangelicall which we reade, <hi>Gen. 17. 5. I have made
thee a father of many nations;</hi> and that which we find, <hi>Gen. 15. 5. ſo
ſhall thy ſeed be;</hi> in which it is promiſed, that there ſhall be of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
innumerable that ſhall be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children by believing, <hi>Rom.</hi>
4. 17, 18. It was Euangelicall, which we find, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. &amp; <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 18.
and <hi>in thy ſeed ſhall all the kindreds of the earth be bleſſed;</hi> for in theſe
is promiſed bleſſing to Believers, of whom <hi>Abraham</hi> is father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
8, 9. and by Chriſt, who is the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Gal. 3. 16. Acts</hi> 3. 25.</p>
            <p>Domeſtique and Civill promiſes were many; of the multiplying the
ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the birth of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> of the continuation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with <hi>Iſaac;</hi> of the coming of Chriſt out of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> the bondage of
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and deliverance thence; of poſſeſſing the Land
of <hi>Canaan, Gen. 15. 13. 18. Gen. 17. 7, 8. 15. 16. Act.</hi> 7. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
and many other places.</p>
            <p>Yea, it is to be noted, that thoſe promiſes which were Euangelicall,
according to the more inward ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt, do point at
the priviledges of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Houſe, in the outward face of the words;
whence it may be well doubted, whether this Covenant made with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> may be called ſimply Euangelicall, and ſo pertain to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
as ſuch, although there be Euangelicall promiſes in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
pertaining to all Believers, as Believers. There were annexed to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113333:7"/>
the Covenant on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> ſacrifices pointing at the ſacrifice of
Chriſt, and yet we call not that Covenant ſimply Euangelicall, but
in ſome reſpect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> is many wayes ſo called: Firſt,
Chriſt is called the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by excellency, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
all the Elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7. all Believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11, 12. 16. 17,
18. are called the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, the ſpirituall ſeed. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there was a naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom the inheritance
did accrue; this was <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 21. 12. Fourthly, a naturall ſeed,
whether lawfull, as the ſons of <hi>Keturah,</hi> or baſe, as <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> to whom
the inheritance belonged not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5. But no where do I find, that
the Infants of Believers of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are called <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, of the
three former kinds of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, the promiſe recited, is meant,
but in a different manner thus: that God promiſeth, he will be a God
to Chriſt, imparting in him bleſſing to all nations of the earth, to the
ſpirituall ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in Euangelicall benefits, to the naturall ſeed
inheriting, in domeſtick and politicall benefits.</p>
            <p>3. That the promiſe of the Goſpel, or Goſpel-covenant, was the
ſame in all ages, in reſpect of the thing promiſed, and condition
of the covenant, which we may call the ſubſtantiall and eſſentiall
part of that covenant, to wit, <hi>Chriſt, Faith, Sanctification, Remiſſion of
ſins, Eternall life;</hi> yet this Euangelicall covenant had divers forms in
which theſe things were ſignified, and various ſanctions, by which it was
confirmed: To <hi>Adam,</hi> the promiſe was made under the name of the
ſeed of the woman, bruiſing the head of the Serpent; to <hi>Enoch, Noah,</hi>
in other forms; otherwiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> under the name of his ſeed, in
whom all nations ſhould be bleſſed; otherwiſe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> under the
obſcure ſhadows of the Law; otherwiſe to <hi>David,</hi> under the name of
a ſucceſſor in the kingdome; otherwiſe in the New Teſtament, in
plain words, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 6. Heb.</hi> 8. 10. It had likewiſe divers ſanctions.
The promiſe of the Goſpel was confirmed to <hi>Abraham</hi> by the ſign of
circumciſion, and by the birth of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> by the Paſchall
Lamb, and the ſprinkling of blood on the book, the rain of Mannah,
and other ſigns; to <hi>David</hi> by an oath; in the New Teſtament, by
Chriſts blood, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25. Therefore circumciſion ſignified and
confirmed the promiſe of the Goſpel, according to the form and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Baptiſme ſignifies and confirms
the ſame promiſe according to the form, ſanction and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the new Teſtament: Now theſe forms and ſanctions differ
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113333:8"/>
many wayes, as much as concerns our preſent purpoſe in theſe: Firſt,
circumciſion confirmed not only Euangelicall promiſes, but alſo Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall;
and if we may believe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cameron,</hi> in his <hi>Theſes</hi> of the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Covenant of God, <hi>Theſi. 78. Circumciſion did primarily ſeparate the
ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>from other nations, ſealed unto them the earthly promiſe;
Secondarily, it did ſignifie ſanctification:</hi> But Baptiſme ſignifies only
Euangelicall benefits. Secondly, circumciſion did confirm the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
concerning Chriſt to come out of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> Baptiſme aſſures Chriſt
to be already come, to have been dead, and to have riſen again,
Thirdly, circumciſion belonged to the Church, conſtituted in the
Houſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Baptiſme to the Church gathered out of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
whence I gather, that there is not the ſame reaſon of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and baptiſme, in ſigning the Euangelicall covenant; nor may
there be an argument drawn from the adminiſtration of the one to
the like manner of adminiſtring the other.</p>
            <p>4. That ſome there were circumciſed, to whom no promiſe in the
covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> did belong; of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> God had ſaid,
that his covenant was not to be eſtabliſhed with him, but with <hi>Iſaac;</hi>
and yet he was circumciſed, <hi>Gen. 17. 20, 21. 25. Rom. 9. 7, 8, 9. Gal.</hi> 4.
29, 30. the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Eſau:</hi> All that were in <hi>Abrahams</hi>
houſe, whether ſtrangers, or born in his houſe, were circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi>
17. 12, 13. of whom nevertheleſſe, it may be doubted, whether any
promiſes of the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> did belong to them;
there were other perſons, to whom all, or moſt of the promiſes in the
covenant pertained, that were not circumciſed; this may be affirmed
of the Females, coming from <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Infants dying before the
eighth day, of juſt men, living out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, as <hi>Melchiſedech,
Lot, Job.</hi> If any ſay, that the females were circumciſed in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of the Males, he ſaith it without proof; and by like, perhaps
greater, reaſon it may be ſaid, that the children of Believers are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in the perſons of their parents, and therefore are not to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in their own perſons. But it is manifeſt that the <hi>Jewes</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and circumciſed, were
nevertheleſſe not admitted to Baptiſme by <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and Chriſts
Diſciples, till they profeſſed repentance, and faith in Chriſt. Hence I
gather, firſt, that the right to Euangelicall promiſes, was not the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
reaſon of crrcumciſing theſe or thoſe, but Gods precept, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<hi>Gen. 17. 23. Gen.</hi> 21. 4. Secondly, that thoſe terms are not
convertible, [<hi>federate and to be ſigned</hi>].</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113333:8"/>
Whereupon I anſwer to the Argument: Firſt, either by denying
the <hi>Major,</hi> if it be univerſally taken, otherwiſe it concludes nothing:
or by granting it with this limitation; it is true of that ſign of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which agrees univerſally in reſpect of form and ſanction, to them
that receive the Goſpel, but it is not true of that ſign of the covenant,
which is of a particular form or ſanctior of which ſort is circumciſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer by denying the <hi>Minor,</hi> univerſally taken, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe thoſe children only of believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are <hi>Abrahams</hi>
children, who are his ſpirituall ſeed, according to the election of grace
by faith, which are not known to us, but by profeſſion, or ſpeciall
Revelation.</p>
            <p>THe ſecond Argument is thus formed:<note place="margin">§. 2. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſme from the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Baptiſme to circumciſion, examined.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To whom circumciſion did agree, to them Baptiſme doth agree,
but to Infants Circumciſion did agree, therefore alſo Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is thus proved: If the baptiſme of Chriſt ſucceed into
the place of circumciſion, then Baptiſme belongs to them that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
belonged to; but the Antecedent is true, therefore alſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.
The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved to be true, becauſe, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12. it is
ſaid the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were circumciſed, becauſe they were buried with
Chriſt in Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer: This Argument ſuppoſeth Baptiſme to ſucceed in the
place of Circumciſion, which may be underſtood many wayes.</p>
            <p>1. So as that the ſenſe be, that thoſe perſons be to be baptized, which
heretofore by Gods command were to be circumciſed, and in this
ſenſe the Argument muſt proceed, if it conclude to the purpoſe; but
in this ſenſe it is falſe, for no females were to be circumciſed, which
yet are to be baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14, 15. and Believers out of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
houſe, as <hi>Lot, Melchiſedech, Job,</hi> were not to be circumciſed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>Gentiles</hi> are univerſally to be baptized.</p>
            <p>2. It may be ſo underſtood, as if the rite of Baptiſme then began,
when the rite of circumciſion did, or was of right to end; but this is
not to be ſaid: For <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Diſciples of Chriſt baptized,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1, 2. before circumciſion of right ceaſed, and they who firſt
were circumciſed, were after baptized, being converted to the faith, as
is manifeſt concerning <hi>Paul, Phil. 3. 5. Acts</hi> 9. 18.</p>
            <p>3. It may be underſtood, as if Baptiſme did ſucceed into the place
of circumciſion, in reſpect of its ſignification, which is true in ſome
things: Firſt, it is true that both ſignified the righteouſneſſe of faith,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113333:9"/>
               <hi>Rom. 4. 11. Rom. 6. 3. Gal. 3. 27. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 21. Secondly, it is true,
both ſignified ſanctification of the heart, and this is all that may be
concluded out of the place alledged, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. to which I think
meet to adde; that if the Text be looked into, that place ſpeaks not
of any circumciſion, but of Chriſts circumciſion in whom we are
compleat, and by whoſe circumciſion we are ſaid to put off the body
of the ſins of the fleſh; nor doth the Text ſay, we are circumciſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are baptized; but we are compleat in Chriſt, becauſe we are
circumciſed in him, and buried with him in Baptiſme, in which, or in
whom, ye are alſo riſen together, through the faith of the operation of
God that raiſed him from the dead.</p>
            <p>In ſome things Baptiſme doth not ſucceed into the place of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
in reſpect of ſignification: For, firſt Circumciſion did ſignifie
Chriſt to come of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> according to the fleſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. 21. but
Baptiſme doth not ſignifie this, but points at the incarnation, death,
and reſurrection of Chriſt. Secondly, Circumciſion was a ſign that
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were a people ſeparated from all nations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1. but
Baptiſme ſignifieth, that all are one in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28. Thirdly,
Circumciſion ſignified that <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was to be obſerved, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3.
but Baptiſme doth ſignifie that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law is made voyd, and the
Doctrine of Chriſt to be retained, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 37. Fourthly, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
did ſign the promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Baptiſme eternall life
by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>From hence I anſwer to the Argument: Firſt, by denying the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi>
of the fore Syllogiſme. Secondly, to the conditionall Syllogiſme,
by denying the Conſequence of the <hi>Major,</hi> if the Antecedent be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of ſucceſſion, in the third ſenſe, in reſpect of ſome ſignification
granted; but if the ſucceſſion be underſtood in the firſt, ſecond, or
third ſenſe, in reſpect of other ſignifications, the <hi>Minor</hi> is denied; the
proof from <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. is already anſwered.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if this Argument be not warily, and reſtrainedly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
an Egge is laid, out of which manifeſt <hi>Judaiſme</hi> may be hatched,
but if it be taken reſtrainedly, no more follows thence, but that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
and Circumciſion in ſome things, ſignifie the ſame, which is
more plainly ſaid of <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. of the red Sea, and
the cloud that guided, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. and yet we ſay not that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
ſucceeded into their place, much leſſe do we inferre any rite to
be inſtituted in their ſtead, reſpecting the ſame perſons; yea verily it
is to be ſeriouſly thought on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:113333:9"/>
1. That by ſuch Arguments drawn from Analogies, not conceived
by the holy Spirit, but drawn out of our wit, a new kinde of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Rites, to wit, from Analogies, is brought in, beſides our Lords
Precepts and the Apoſtles examples.</p>
            <p>2. This being once laid, by like manner of argumentation, it will
be lawfull to bring into the Chriſtian Church, under other names and
forms, the whole burthen of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites; yea, almoſt, out of what
you will, to conclude what you will; for who ſhall put a bound to
mens wits faining Analogie, when they go beyond the Lords Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and the Apoſtles examples? It is well known, that the divine
appointment of tythes to be paid, and many other things, in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Divines, are aſſerted by this kinde of Argument, beſides the
rule of the Lords Precept and the Apoſtles example.</p>
            <p>3. Hereby will the opinion of <hi>Papiſts</hi> be confirmed, who affirm
from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. the Sacraments of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to be types of the
Sacraments of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which is rejected by Divines that diſpute
againſt <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. This manner of arguing will countenance the Arguments of the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> for an univerſall Biſhop, becauſe there was an High Prieſt
amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> for ſacrificing Prieſts, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſuch; for a
linen garment at Maſſe, becauſe there was ſuch among the <hi>Jews;</hi> for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
water, purification of women, <hi>Eaſter, Pentecoſt,</hi> and many more ſuch
ceremonies, for which the <hi>Papiſt</hi> do in like manner argue, as appears
out of <hi>Durandus</hi> Rationals, and other Interpreters of Rituals among
the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> yea, what hindreth, but we may give children the Lords
Supper, if we argue this way, ſith <hi>Samuel,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt under age, were
partakers of the Paſſeover, and of right, all the males were to appeare
thrice in the yeer, before the Lord; and therefore it is certain they did
eat the Paſſeover; and it ſhall be after ſhewed, that the place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
28. will not avoyd this inconvenience, if the Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.
may be ſhifted off, as <hi>Paedo-baptiſts</hi> uſe to do. Leſt any man take this
for a light ſuggeſtion, I will adde, that grave, godly and learned men,
have often warned, that we are to take heed, that we do not raſhly
frame arguments from Analogie: among others in their late writings,
in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue, <hi>John Paget,</hi> in his <hi>Defence of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
part. 1. chap. 3. pag. 8. and elſewhere, <hi>John Ball</hi> in his <hi>Reply</hi> to
the <hi>Anſwer</hi> of the <hi>New-England</hi> Elders, unto the 9. <hi>Poſitions,</hi> Poſit. 2.
pag. 14.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is to be conſidered again and again, how by theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113333:10"/>
conſciences may be freed from the danger of wil-worſhip
and polluting ſo remarkable an Ordinance of Chriſt as Baptiſme is,
ſpecially this care lies on them, who by Prayers, Sermons, Writings,
Covenants and Oaths, do deterre <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from humane inventions,
in Gods worſhip diligently, and as is to be hoped ſincerely.</p>
            <p>THe third Argument is thus framed.<note place="margin">§. 3. The third Argument from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of grace in the new Teſtament to that in the old examined.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If Baptiſme be not granted to the Infants of Believers, then the
grace of God will be more reſtrained in the new Teſtament then in
the old: but this is not to be affirmed; therefore Baptiſme is to be
granted to Infants of Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this Argument be of any weight, it will prove that the
grace of God is ſtraitened, becauſe we give not the Lords Supper to
children, to whom the Paſſeover was given, as appears by that which
was above ſaid.</p>
            <p>2. The grace of God is not tied to Sacraments, neither do Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
give grace by the work done, and therefore grace is not reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though Sacraments be never granted, grace is not denyed to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
perſon, who is inhibited the Lords Supper, the Grace
of God is free, whether we underſtand it of the divine affection, or
the effects of it; nor can be made larger or narrower by our act.</p>
            <p>3. Yet it is not abſurd to ſay, that in reſpect of ſome priviledges, the
Grace of God is more contracted in the new Teſtament then in the
old: For inſtance, no family hath now the priviledge that was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, that out of it Chriſt ſhould be born; no man
beſides <hi>Abraham</hi> is called <hi>The father of the faithfull;</hi> no woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
one, <hi>The mother of Chriſt;</hi> nevertheleſſe, ſimply the grace of God
is ſaid to be larger in the new Teſtament, by reaſon of the revelation
of the Goſpel imparted to all nations, the more abundant communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the holy Spirit, and more plain manifeſtation of the myſterie
of the Goſpel: I would have it weighed, whether thoſe phraſes of
the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 21. as <hi>the naturall branches,</hi> ver. 24. <hi>The wilde Olive
by nature,</hi> were't <hi>graffed contrary to nature. Theſe which be naturall
branches,</hi> do not ſufficiently imply, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> children by their
birth had a priviledge beyond the <hi>Gentiles</hi> children.</p>
            <p>Thereupon I anſwer to the Argument: Firſt, by denying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of the <hi>Major,</hi> for the reaſon given: Secondly, by denying the
<hi>Minor,</hi> if it be underſtood of ſtraitning the grace of God, in reſpect
of ſome priviledge, although the Aſſumption may be granted, if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113333:10"/>
underſtood of the ſtraitning Gods grace ſimply.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſumme of the Anſwer to the Arguments, drawn from</hi> Gen. 17.
17. <hi>is this: The Sacraments are not to be adminiſtred according to
rules taken from our reaſonings, but Gods appointment. Rightly
doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Ball <hi>forenamed, in the Book forenamed,</hi> Poſit. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. pag. 38.
<hi>ſay,</hi> But in whatſoever Circumciſion and Baptiſme, do agree or differ, we
muſt look to the inſtitution, and neither ſtretch it wider, nor draw it nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
then the Lord hath made it, for he is the inſtitutor of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
according to his own good pleaſure; and it is our part to learn of
him, both to whom, how, and for what end the Sacraments are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred,
how they agree, and wherein they differ, in all which we muſt
affirm nothing, but what God hath taught us, and as he hath taught us.</p>
            <p>THe Argument from <hi>Acts</hi> 2.<note place="margin">§. 4. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39. for Infant-baptiſme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</note> 38, 39. may be thus formed: To
whom the promiſe is made, they may be baptized; but to the
Infants of Believers the promiſe is made, therefore they may be
baptized.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from the words of <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. for the promiſe
is made to you and to your children.</p>
            <p>That an Anſwer may be fitted to this Argument:</p>
            <p>1. It is to be obſerved, that the promiſe made, is the ſending of
Jeſus Chriſt, and bleſſing by him, as it is expounded, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 25, 26.
<hi>Acts 13. 32, 33. Rom.</hi> 15. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>2. That the Text ſaith, the promiſe was made to them he ſpake
to, and their children, then to them that are afarre off, who, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are ſaid to be afarre of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. or
<hi>Jewes,</hi> in future ages and generations, as <hi>Beza</hi> thinks, are limited by
the words cloſing the verſe, <hi>as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi>
which limitation plainly enough ſhewes the promiſe to appertain to
them not ſimply as <hi>Jewes,</hi> but as called of God, which is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
affirmed, <hi>Acts 3. 26. To you, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus,
ſent him to bleſſe you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquity:</hi>
or as <hi>Beza, Every one of you turning your ſelves from your iniquities;</hi>
therefore the promiſe here is not ſaid to be made but with condition

            <p>3. That <hi>Peter,</hi> verſ. 38. doth exhort to repentance and Baptiſme
together, and in the firſt place perſwades to <hi>Repentance,</hi> then <hi>Baptiſme,</hi>
which ſhewes <hi>Repentance</hi> to be in order before <hi>Baptiſme.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:113333:11"/>
4. That mention is made of the promiſe, not as of it ſelf, yeelding
right to <hi>Baptiſme</hi> without <hi>Repentance,</hi> but as a motive, inciting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to Repentance and Baptiſme. Whereupon it is anſwered:</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Major</hi> is to be limited, to whom the promiſe is made,
they may be baptized, to wit, when they are called, and have ſhewed
ſignes of repentance; If it be taken without limitation, it is to be
denied.</p>
            <p>2. By denying the <hi>Minor,</hi> if it be univerſally taken of all Infants of
Believers, of whoſe Baptiſme the queſtion is; as for the Text, it ſpeaks
not expreſly of Infants, but of children indefinitely; nor of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at all, (of whom we are) but of the children of
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and therefore, if that promiſe be extended to Infants, which
doth not appear, the promiſe is to be expounded ſo, as to note ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
peculiar to the <hi>Jews</hi> Infants.</p>
            <p>THe Argument from the place,<note place="margin">§. 5. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. for Infant-Baptiſme, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. may be thus formed:
They who are holy with Covenant-holineſſe, may be baptized:
But the Infants of a Believer are holy, with a Covenant-holineſſe;
for it is ſaid in the Text, <hi>but now they are holy;</hi> therefore they may
be baptized. I anſwer:</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Minor</hi> is not true, univerſally underſtood, as is manifeſt
from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. where it is ſaid, <hi>If the firſt fruits be holy, ſo is the
lump: if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> The ſenſe is, that <hi>Abraham</hi>
is the firſt fruits, and holy root; the elect <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are the branches
and lump; ſo that it followes, that the elect of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> not yet
called, are holy in reſpect of the Covenant, and are not yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be baptized; for although they may be ſaid to be holy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Covenant, of old entred into with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
reſpect of God to them, to be manifeſted in opportune time, yet
in their preſent ſtate, before calling, they denying Chriſt, neither In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
nor grown men are to be baptized, unleſſe we would have the
branches broken off to be graffed into the Church; and therefore,
although the ſenſe were in the place of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. your children are
holy with Covenant-holineſſe, by reaſon of Gods gracious favour to
be manifeſted in due time, yet it will not follow, that they are to be
baptized, who have not yet yeelded any ſhewes of divine grace.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Minor</hi> is not proved from the place alledged: For it doth
not ſpeak of federall holineſſe, but of holineſſe, that I may ſo call it,
Matrimoniall, ſo that the ſenſe is, your children are holy, that is, legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113333:11"/>
Whether any in the ages before, the age laſt paſt, expounded
it, of federall holineſſe, as they call it, I am not yet certain: as for
the expoſition of that place, of that holineſſe, I called Matrimoniall,
of it the place is expounded by <hi>Aquinas,</hi> in his <hi>Commentary</hi> upon the
place, and perhaps by others, whom I have not yet had time to look
into, but I think beſt to ſet down the words of <hi>Joachimus Camerarius,</hi> about this matter, in his <hi>Commentary</hi> on the new Teſtament, lately
printed at <hi>Cambridge; [for the unbelieving husband hath been ſanctified]
an uſuall change of the Tenſe, that is, is ſanctified, in the lawfull uſe of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
for without this (</hi> he ſaith <hi>) it would be, that their children ſhould
be unclean,</hi> that is, <hi>infamous, and not legitimate, who ſo are holy,</hi> that is, <hi>during the marriage are without all blot of ignominy:</hi> Moreover, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> in his <hi>Commentary</hi> on the place, <hi>Therefore</hi> Paul <hi>anſwers, that
the marriages are not to be pulled aſunder, for their unlike opinions of God, if
the impious perſon do not caſt away the other;</hi> and for comfort he addes
as a reaſon, <hi>the unbelieving husband is ſanctified by the believing wife,</hi> of which Speech divers interpretations are made, but the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
is this, as elſewhere, he ſaith, <hi>Meat is ſanctified, for that which
is holy in uſe, that is granted to Believers from God, ſo here he ſpeaks the
uſe of marriage to be holy, and to be granted of God, [elſe were] the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the</hi> Sept. <hi>ſo ſpeaks unclean, it calls unclean that which
is prohibited; as wee ſay Swines fleſh was unclean by the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>that is, prohibited, or a woman brought to bed, is unclean,</hi> that is, <hi>whoſe touching is forbidden. The connexion of the Argument is
this: If the uſe of marriage ſhould not pleaſe God, your children would
be baſtards, and ſo unclean; but your children are not baſtards, therefore
the uſe of marriage pleaſeth God: How baſtards were unclean in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner, the Law ſhewes,</hi> Deut. <hi>23. Let not a baſtard enter into
the Congregation of the Lord, to the tenth generation,</hi> that is, <hi>Let him
be admitted to no function in the Church; therefore this is the moſt
plain meaning, children are not baſtards, nor to be kept away, as the
Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>kept them away; therefore alſo the uſe of marriage plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
God.</hi> Muſculus <hi>Comment.</hi> on <hi>1 Cor. 7. 14.</hi> hath theſe words; <hi>[is
ſanctified] this expreſſeth the reaſon of that which he ſaith, Let him
not put her away; perhaps, the more unskilfull Chriſtians thought
ſuch dwelling together to be unclean and unlawfull; and they did fear,
leſt they ſhould be made one body with the yoak-fellow that was an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,
as he that is joyned to an Harlot, is made one body with the
Harlot, and ſo of the members of Chriſt, ſhould make them members of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113333:12"/>
an Idolater, which hath more ſin then if they ſhould make them the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of an Harlot; for this cauſe,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>for the unbeliever is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>for the unbelieving husband in the wife,</hi> that is, <hi>in the conjunction of the wife, which is by marriage, even long ago hath
been cleanſed by vertue of marriage; ſo that his conjunction and copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath nothing unclean: ſo in like manner alſo, the unbelieving wife,
by reaſon of lawfull wedlock, in which ſhee is joyned to the man,
even long ago is cleanſed, that the believer is not defiled, if ſhe live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with him; for the word holineſſe here, is taken for the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the marriage-bed which he hath by the tradition of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſaith, elſe your children ſhould be unclean, but now they are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
he ſhould have ſaid, but now they are clean, if to be holy, and clean,
in this place were not the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the moſt plain underſtanding of this place is, firſt, in that we
underſtand not the word holineſſe, of that holineſſe which is by the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God, or the Spirit of faith, by which Believers are ſanctified, as
a people of God, but of the holineſſe of the conjugall bed, otherwiſe it will
bring forth a troubleſome diſpute, how an unbelieving husband may be
ſaid to be ſanctified. Then, that we attribute this ſanctification that is
cleanneſſe, not to the faith of the believing yoak-fellow, but to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
by reaſon of the appointment of God; with</hi> Hierome, <hi>who ſaith,
becauſe by Gods appointment, marriage is holy; and</hi> Ambroſe, <hi>who hath
it thus, the children are holy, becauſe they are born of lawfull marriage;
therefore, that in the wife and in the husband, is not to be read with the
addition of Believer, as the old Interpreter hath it, but ſimply, as the</hi> Greek <hi>hath it; if any thing be to be added, it is better to be added,
the lawfull wife or husband, that we may underſtand, that the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
husband is cleanſed in his lawfull wife,</hi> that is, <hi>by vertue of their
lawfull marriage, is not unclean, but clean, as far as appertains to the law of
cohabitation of marriage, although he be impure ſo far as appertains to
the commerce of Religion, of which the word of Deacons in the Church was,
Let the prophane depart, the holy draw neer. [elſe your children]</hi> Ambroſe <hi>ſo expounds this particle [elſe]</hi> that is, <hi>if thou the believing husband
ſhouldſt put away thy unbelieving wife, and marry another, your children
ſhould be unclean, becauſe you ſhould be made Adulterers, but [now]</hi> that
is, <hi>if thou retain thy unbelieving wife, they are holy, becauſe they are born
of a lawfull marriage. But it is more plain, that we underſtand the
Apoſtle, to have reſpect to the ſanctimony of marriage, even of them who
without the faith of Chriſt, are conjoyned in marriage, as if he had ſaid,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113333:12"/>
unleſſe marriage were holy and clean, even between unbelievers, what other
thing would follow, then that all the children of Infidels are baſtards, and
unclean? but far be it from us to ſay ſo; they are holy, for they are born of
lawfull marriage.</hi> Ambroſe <hi>looks to that which he ſaid,</hi> Let him not
put her away; <hi>the other Expoſition to that which he ſaid,</hi> the unbelieving
husband is ſanctified in the wife. <hi>I have ſometimes abuſed the preſent
place againſt the error of</hi> Anabaptiſts, <hi>keeping back Infants of Chriſtians
from Baptiſme, thinking that ſpeech,</hi> but now are they holy, <hi>to be the
ſame, as, they are the people of God, by reaſon of the believing parents; but
although it be ſure in it ſelf, that the children of believers, are both holy, and
pertaining to the people of God, by reaſon of the participation of the Covenant,
and ſo are partakers of Baptiſme, as the ſign of the Covenant, yet the preſent
place makes nothing to this cauſe, in which the ſanctimony of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and people is not meddled with; but the cleanneſſe of lawfull marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
even of Infidels: for not only to children, to whom perhaps, the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of a believing parent, may ſo appertain, that for it they may be
partakers of the Covenant, but alſo to unbelieving husbands and wives
is ſanctimony aſcribed, although they oppoſe the Chriſtian faith; nor is
any other holineſſe or cleanneſſe of children meddled with, then that which
agrees alſo to unbelieving parents, for to them, no other agrees, then
that which is by lawfull marriage. There's other teſtimonies out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
from whence the</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>may be convinced of error; ſo that
there is no need to uſe this place againſt them.</hi> Thus far <hi>Camerarius,
Melancthon, Muſculus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> Perhaps ſome one will object, that no where is <hi>holy,</hi> the ſame with
legitimate: to which I anſwer, That holineſſe is put for Chaſtity, is
manifeſted from <hi>1 Theſ. 4. 3. 4. 7.</hi> and the word <hi>[ſanctified]</hi> in this place,
what doth it found elſe, then <hi>[is lawfully coupled]</hi> and <hi>[is ſanctified]
1 Tim. 4. 5.</hi> what elſe doth it ſignifie, then <hi>[is lawfully uſed]?</hi> at which
place <hi>Beza</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>Therefore meats are ſaid to be ſanctified,
which we uſe lawfully, and with Gods good leave; he alludes to legall puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
and the difference between clean and unclean meats:</hi> And why
may not by a like alluſion, unclean, be put for Baſtards, and holy for
legitimate? for the Baſtard is among the unclean, <hi>Deut. 23. 2.</hi> To
which I may adde what <hi>John Calvin</hi> hath on <hi>Mal. 2. 15. Wherefore
hath God made one?</hi> to wit, <hi>ſeeking a ſeed of God; a ſeed of God is here
taken for legitimate, as the</hi> Hebrewes <hi>do name that divine whatſoever
doth excell, yea, they call that divine which is pure from any fault and ſpot:
therefore he ſought a ſeed of God, that is, appointed marriage; from whence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113333:13"/>
ſhould be born a legitimate and clean off-ſpring. Secretly therefore doth the
Prophet here ſhew, that they are all baſtards, that ſhall be born by polygamy,
becauſe they neither can, nor ought to be counted legitimate ſons, but they
who are begotten according to Gods inſtitution, but where the husband vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
the faith given to the wife, and takes to himſelf another, as he perverts
the order of marriage, ſo alſo he cannot be a lawfull father.</hi> Thus <hi>Calvin,</hi> and in like manner <hi>Cameron</hi> praelect. in <hi>Mat. 19. 5.</hi> interprets that Text.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if the words of the Text be weighed, this will ſeem the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and genuine ſenſe; for the queſtion which the Apoſtle reſolves was,
whether the conjunction was to be retained of the believing yoak-fellow,
with the unbelieving? The reaſon of doubting was, becauſe
that conjunction ſeems impure, by reaſon of the impurity of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
yoak-fellow; the Apoſtle anſwers, not ſo: For the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
husband hath been ſanctified in the wife. To draw out the
ſenſe of this place, it is to be noted, that [<hi>the unbelieving husband</hi>]
ſounds the ſame, as if he had ſaid, [<hi>the husband, though he be an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi>];
for the ſcope requires that this be the ſenſe, the <hi>Husband,</hi>
though he be an <hi>unbeliever,</hi> yet is ſanctified in the wife.</p>
            <p>2. That it is not ſaid, <hi>in the believing wife,</hi> nor <hi>in the believing huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>
(though I deny not <hi>Beza</hi> obſerved ſome ſuch thing in the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
copy, and elſewhere): For the copies do not ſo reade, and it
ſeems the Apoſtle of purpoſe ſo ſpake, that the reaſon of <hi>Sanctification</hi>
may be intimated to be taken, not from the faith of the yoak-fellow,
but conjugall relation.</p>
            <p>3. [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] is not rightly rendred, [<hi>by</hi>] in the vulgar and our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
tranſlation, as if the ſenſe were, that the faith of the wife, were the
cauſe of ſanctifying the unbelieving husband, for this ſenſe cannot be
faſtened to this place; for no man will ſay, the faith of the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
wife, ſanctifies the unbelieving husband federally; ſo that the
unbelieving husband ſhould be capable of Baptiſme by his wifes faith,
(which yet, by the good leave of ſuch men be it ſaid, doth as well
follow from this place, as that the ſon is federally holy, and capable
of Baptiſme, for the faith of the parent) neither can it be ſaid, that
the parent is ſanctified with ſpirituall ſanctification by the faith of the
wife; for how ever it be determined that faith is the cauſe of inward
ſanctification, yet it is certain that the faith of one is not the cauſe of
the ſanctification of another, I mean, the next and effectuall cauſe. Nor
doth this ſenſe pertain hither, the unbelieving husband is ſanctified
by the wife, that is, is renued in the ſpirit of his mind, by the diligence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113333:13"/>
of his wife, inſtructing him in the faith, as ſhe is ſaid to ſave, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.
For this ſanctification being put, the children may remain impure,
and not holy; the contrary whereof is here aſſerted: and this ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is contingent, it may be, or it may not be, as is manifeſt from
<hi>verſ.</hi> 16. For how knoweſt thou? But in this place the ſanctification is
certain and neceſſary, elſe it ſhould not take away the doubt, about
the retaining the conjunction; nor doth the ſenſe pertain hither, the
unbelieving husband is ſanctified in the wife, that is, the wife, becauſe
ſhe hath faith, hath uſed the unbelieving husband without all ſcruple
of conſcience; for the contrary was the occaſion of this Diſcourſe;
nor doth this belong a whit to the impurity or holineſſe of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
therefore more rightly [<gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

the ſenſe then is, that the unbelieving husband is ſanctified to the wife,
that is, is not coupled as an unclean fornicator, but as a lawfull huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and that copulation is holy, that is, remains chaſt, the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
remaining a husband; for an unbeliever is a husband, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the uſe of him is chaſt, [elſe] the Apoſtle proves what he had
ſaid, of the ſanctification of the unbelieving husband, to the wife, and
the order being turned, by an argument from an abſurdity, which
may be reduced unto this form:</p>
            <p>If the unbelieving husband be not ſanctified to the wife, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
turned, then your children ſhould be unclean; but your children
are not unclean, but holy; <hi>Ergo.</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, elſe] plainly ſhewes,
that abſurdity would follow, if this were not granted, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
husband is ſanctified to the wife, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, otherwiſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
as <hi>Beza</hi> renders it, your children are unclean, that is, your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which you have have hitherto begotten, ſhould be unclean, that
is, baſtards, but now they are holy: [<hi>but now</hi>] <hi>Beza</hi> rightly notes it,
<hi>is not an Adverb of time, but a Conjunction, that is wont to be uſed in the
Aſſumptions of Arguments,</hi> and the ſenſe is, [<hi>but now</hi>] that is, but for as
much as the unbelieving husband is ſanctified to the wife, that is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the uſe of the wife, your children are holy, that is, lawfully
begotten and born; but if it be granted the ſanctification is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of lawfull and chaſt uſe, (which is neceſſarily to be yeelded) and
yet the uncleanneſſe and holineſſe be underſtood of that which they
call federall, then this will follow, that the children born of wives ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded
to the firſt, inceſtuous, concubines and harlots are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113333:14"/>
the Covenant, neither to be circumciſed nor baptized, whereas not
only <hi>Iſhmael</hi> by <hi>Abraham,</hi> but alſo many ſons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Judah,
Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zarah</hi> by <hi>Thamar,</hi> were circumciſed; nor doth cuſtome or
canon put ſuch back children from Baptiſm; but in very deed, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the ſenſe, for only holines, which I call Matrimoniall, of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
followeth from Matrimoniall lawfull copulation, which is here
aſſerted, and only uncleanneſſe oppoſite to legitimation, follows illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
and polluted copulation, and of theſe alone there was doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Chriſtians, and therfore the Apoſtles reſolution.</p>
            <p>Nor yet, as <hi>Beza</hi> inferres, if this ſenſe be put, ſhould the Apoſtle
draw an argument from civill Laws, to pacifie conſcience, but he uſing
his Apoſtolicall authority, reſolves the doubts in this Chapter, and
teacheth, that according to Gods Law, and Chriſts Precept, the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is not diſſolved by the infidelity of either yoak-fellow, but that
they may lawfully dwell together, and couple, according to Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Marriage. As for that which <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, <hi>No man hath ever
ſaid truly, that marriage is holy between two unbelievers, and that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are holy, ſith their meats are unclean to them, as being to be ſanctified by
the Word, and giving of thanks;</hi> it is true, if we ſpeak of the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the heart, but it is manifeſt from that which is before ſaid, that
the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the ſanctification and ſanctity, that is in chaſtity,
and legitimation, and in reſpect of it <hi>Beza</hi> grants the marriage of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
not to be accounted before God for fornication; for marriage
is honourable among all, even unbelievers, and the bed undefiled, but

In many of theſe, we have ſcarce any thing beſide conjectures, which
we may follow, neither have I leiſure or books to look into all things
which <hi>Commentators</hi> have diſcourſed concerning theſe heads.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt, it it is ſuppoſed that the bringers were either parents,
or other believers, who at leaſt wiſhed well to the little children; which
is probable from the end for which they brought them, to wit, that he
might bleſſe them, and pray for them, for this ſhewed faith and love.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond, it is probable they were children of <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe
this was done in the coaſts of <hi>Judea, Mat. 19. 1. Mar.</hi> 10. 1. But whether
the parents of the children believed in Chriſt or otherwiſe, is not
manifeſt.</p>
            <p>As for the third, concerning the motive, there is little certain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were upon the ſight, or hearing of that which Chriſt did, <hi>Mat.</hi>
18. 2. or from a cuſtome among the <hi>Jews,</hi> of ſeeking the bleſſing of
Prophets and holy men, for their little ones, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> for <hi>Jacob, Joſeph</hi>
for his ſons; or from the fame of things done upon the praiers of Chriſt;
or an inſtinct from God, that occaſion might be given of teaching the
things that Chriſt taught upon this matter; or ſome other motive.</p>
            <p>As for the fourth, the end is expreſſed by <hi>Matthew,</hi> that he might
put on hands and pray; by <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> tha the might touch them,
which tends to impart a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>As for the fifth, <hi>Matthew</hi> points at the time, by the particle [<hi>then</hi>] and
both <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Matthew,</hi> put it after the diſſertation, with the <hi>Phariſees</hi>
concerning divorce, and the anſwer to the Diſciples exception, which
<hi>Mark</hi> teſtifies was made in the houſe; <hi>Luke</hi> puts it after the parable of
the <hi>Publican</hi> and the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> but he is wont to relate things out of their
right place. But what the holy Spirit doth intimate, by noting the time
preciſely, I gueſſe not, unleſſe perhaps he would have it noted, that an
occaſion was opportunely miniſtred, of amplifying the argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
making a mans ſelf an Eunuch for the kingdome of heaven,
though this reaſon doth not very much like me.</p>
            <p>As for the ſixth, the place is intimated, <hi>Mat. 19. 1. Mar. 10. 1. in the
coaſts of Judea, beyond Jordan,</hi> in Matthew; <hi>By the farther ſide of Jordan,</hi> in
Mark; about which it availeth not to our preſent purpoſe to inquire.</p>
            <p>As for the ſeventh, the reaſon of repelling, is not known, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
it is probable this bringing of little children, was troubleſom to
them, either becauſe it did interrupt Chriſts Speech about marriage,
and fitneſs to the Kingdom of heaven, or becauſe they ſought reſt in the
houſe, or becauſe they did think this bringing would be in vain.</p>
            <p>As for the eighth, Chriſt without doubt, was angry with the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113333:15"/>
becauſe they hindred the occaſion of doing good to men, whereas
Chriſt went about doing good, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 38. And in this buſineſs the
faith of the bringers was to be cheriſhed, and the power of bleſſing in
Chriſt was to be manifeſted, &amp; the excellent doctrine to be delivered,
concerning little childrens being capable of the Kingdome of heaven,
of the quality of them who receive the Kingdome of heaven; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Chriſt would that this fact ſhould remain, as a perpetuall rule for
baptizing the Infants of Believers, is yet a queſtion. It ſeems, ſcarce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe Baptiſme of Infants, being meerly poſitive, ſo obſcure
and doubtfull an inſtitution, is without example and reaſon.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe we find no practice or hint in Scripture, which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
this fact to this ſenſe.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe, if he had given a command to the Apoſtles of baptizing
Infants, he had rather ſaid, bring the little children to me, then ſuffer
them to be brought to me.</p>
            <p>4. He had declared whoſe Infants he would have baptized, and not
have ſpoken ſo indefinitely, it is certain, before the command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
19, 20. There is no Precept extant, concerning baptizing <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
much leſſe concerning baptizing the Infants of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The words, <hi>ſuffer &amp; forbid not,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>theſe little children,</hi> as
<hi>Beza</hi> reads, ſhew that Chriſts words are meant only of thoſe children.</p>
            <p>6. If this fact pertain to Baptiſme, then we muſt ſay, that Chriſt bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
the contrary whereof is ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 2. As for that which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that three Euangeliſts rehearſe this fact, that thence a perpetuall
rule may be drawn, of bringing Infants to Chriſt by an outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
which is not done but by Baptiſme, it is weak: For,</p>
            <p>1. Three Euangeliſts rehearſe the bringing of the palſie man to
Chriſt, the acceſſe of the leprous perſon to Chriſt, and many other
things, from which yet no perpetuall rule is formed.</p>
            <p>2. If any rule be hence to be formed, that is to be perpetually obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
this relation will ſerve more fitly to eſtabliſh Epiſcopall confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by laying on hands, and praying, then Presbyteriall baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt diſtinguiſh, concerning bringing to Chriſt; there
is a bringing to Chriſt, by locall admotion, there is another bringing
to Chriſt by ſpirituall inſtruction; this bringing to Chriſt, is the
cauſe of Baptiſme, not the other: for many were brought by the
command of Chriſt, to Chriſt, as the blind ſon of <hi>Timaeus,</hi> and others,
of whoſe baptiſme, or converſion we reade not; for not all that were
corporally healed by Chriſt, were alſo ſpiritually healed, as we are to
ſay of the nine Lepers. <hi>Malchus</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:113333:15"/>
3. The Argument ſuppoſeth they may be baptized, whom Chriſt
commands to be brought, but neither is this true of ſpirituall bringing;
for not thoſe whom he commands to be brought ſpiritually, are to be
baptized, but thoſe whom he hath brought; as for that which is ſaid,
they are repelled from Chriſt, that are repelled from Baptiſme, it is a
light thing, for Baptiſme doth not bring men to Chriſt, unleſſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
be firſt in Chriſt; neither is therefore any man repelled from Chriſt,
becauſe he is not baptized, but when he is kept back, being fit for baptiſm.</p>
            <p>To the Argument therefore anſwer is made, by denying the <hi>Major</hi>
univerſally taken.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Argument is thus formed:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> Thoſe whom Chriſt imbraced, laid his hands on, bleſſed, may
be baptized; But Chriſt imbraced Infants, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, this argument ſuppoſeth theſe acts of Chriſt, to have
been all one, as if he had baptized, but this is ſaid without proof, in very
deed, that act of bleſſing was more then Baptiſme, and yet it had not the
ſame reaſon with Baptiſme; it is manifeſt out of <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 2. that Baptiſme
was an act of miniſtry, which Chriſt did not exerciſe by himſelf, but his
Diſciples, but that bleſſing was an act, by which he obtained ſome ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
gift from God by prayers for thoſe Infants, upon whom he had laid
his hands; nor is this benefit ſaid to be beſtowed on them for the faith of
their parents, but out of ſingular favour which Chriſt beſtowed upon
many, as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> with his ſiſters, <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle and others, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition is to be denied; for there is no connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this act, which is extraordinary, and the act of ordinary miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which is to be fulfilled according to the Lords preſcription.</p>
            <p>The third Argument is thus formed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> They may be baptized, whoſe is the Kingdome of heaven; but
of Infants is the Kingdome of heaven; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition is true, if it be underſtood of
thoſe whoſe is the Kingdome of heaven, when it appears that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven belongs to them, otherwiſe it is not true. Secondly, it
is not ſaid in the Text [<hi>of Infants is the kingdom of heaven</hi>] but, <hi>of ſuch
is the kingdome of heaven;</hi> and Chriſt expounds what he means, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.
15. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 17. to wit, of them who in humility of mind, are like little
children, as it is <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 3, 4. but if [<hi>of ſuch</hi>] be to be expounded, as <hi>Beza</hi>
would, <hi>Annot.</hi> in <hi>Mat. 19. 14. of theſe and the like,</hi> as above, 18. it is not
proved from thence, that the kingdome of heaven pertains to all Infants
of Believers, but to them whom he then bleſſed, and to thoſe perſons who
either are ſo bleſſed, or are converted and humble as little children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:113333:16"/>
Whence it is anſwered; firſt by denying the <hi>Major,</hi> if it be expounded
univerſally and unreſtrainedly: ſecondly, by denying the <hi>Minor,</hi> as it
is put indefinitely, for the reaſons above put.</p>
            <p>THe Argument from the place,<note place="margin">§. 7. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 16. &amp;c. for Infant-Baptiſme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</note> 
               <hi>Act. 16. 15. 32. 33. Act. 18. 8. 1 Cor.</hi> 1.
16. is thus formed: If the Apoſtle baptized whole houſholds, then
Infants; but the Apoſtle baptized whole houſholds, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument reſts on a ſleight conjecture, that there were
Infants in thoſe houſes, and that thoſe Infants were baptized, whereas
the words of the Text evince not theſe things, yea, thoſe things which
are ſaid, <hi>Acts 16. 32. He ſpake the Word of the Lord to him, and to all in his
houſe;</hi> and verſ. 33. <hi>He rejoyced, believing God with all his houſe. Act.</hi> 18. 8.
Criſpus <hi>believed the Lord with his whole houſe,</hi> do plainly prove, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>the whole houſe,</hi> are underſtood thoſe only that heard the
Word of God and believed. Whence it is anſwered by denying the
conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Some other arguments occur, which make a number without ſtrength.</p>
            <p>FIrſt,<note place="margin">§. 8. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſme examined.</note> it is argued from generall promiſes, made to the godly and their
ſeed, <hi>Exod. 20. 6. Pſal.</hi> 112. 2, &amp;c. Whence it is gathered, that God
makes a difference betwixt the children of the godly and the wicked,
that he promiſeth bleſſing to thoſe, not to theſe, therefore the children
of the godly are to be baptized, not the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The promiſes recited, are firſt generall and indefinite; ſecondly,
for the moſt part concerning corporall good things; thirdly, with the
exception of free election; fourthly, to be underſtood with the implyed
condition of faith and repentance, and ſo they ſerve not to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>SEcondly,<note place="margin">§ 9. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 22. for Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49. 22. it is foretold that <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould bring

2. The ſenſe is not that they were formally baptized, with the rite of

of the principles of the oracles of God, the foundation, milk for babes,
nor of impoſition of hands for ordination to ſpecial function in the church,
for that, though ordinary, yet not likely to be put among the principles,
the foundation, milk for babes, therefore it remains, that it was the laying
on of hands on children formerly baptized in infancy, which though cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
made a Sacrament by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed, yet being
freed from the abuſe were very uſefull, as being an Apoſtolicall ordinance,

<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. ſerved for, the reaſon to prove that it could not be either
for healing, or giving the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe they were miraculous or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
is not cogent; for though they were by more then ordinary
power, yet were they frequent in thoſe times, and might well be put among
the elements to be in thoſe days firſt learned: nor is the reaſon cogent to
prove it could not be the impoſition of hands in ordination, for ſpeciall
function in the Church; for it is more likely that it ſhould be meant, which
it is certain was ſtill in uſe, and to continue to be uſed, and therefore it was
needfull to be taught younglings, as well as the doctrine of baptiſmes:
then laying on of hands for confirmation of baptiſme, of which there
is no certainty (though pretended examples) in Scripture, be brought to
give ſome colour to it; nor is impoſition of hands in ordination unfitly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled

<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. were on the baptized; yet this proves not the baptiſme of
Infants in the Apoſtles dayes, unleſſe it could be proved that it was
uſed after the baptiſme of Infants only, for a confirmation either of
the baptiſme, or baptized. Or the contrary, it is apparent out of
<hi>Tertul. de corona militis, c.</hi> 3. that in the primitive times the baptiſied
did make his confeſſion at baptiſme, <hi>ſub manu antiſtitis,</hi> that is, the

of hands, which after was made a diſtinct Sacrament, called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
was either a part or appendix of Baptiſme: and many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages

            <p>THe ſecond Argument followeth:</p>
            <p>That which agreeth not with the Lords inſtitution of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,<note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note>
that is deſervedly doubtfull.<note place="margin">§. 15. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the inſtitution of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant-baptiſme, confirmed.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the rite of Infant-Baptiſme agrees not with the Lords inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Baptiſme, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved, becauſe Inſtitution is the rule of exhibiting
worſhip to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Minor <hi>is proved from the words of Inſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Going therefore, diſciple ye all nations, baptizing them.</p>
            <p>Whence I gather thus:</p>
            <p>That rite agrees not with the Lords inſtitution of Baptiſme, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which they are baptized, whom the Lord appointed not to
be baptized.</p>
            <p>But after the rite of Infant-Baptiſme, they are baptized whom the
Lord appointed not to be baptized, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is manifeſt of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved: The Lord appointed not Infants to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
<hi>Ergo.</hi> The Antecedent is proved;</p>
            <p>Thoſe, and no other, the Lord appointed to be baptized, who have
been made diſciples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:113333:18"/>
But this cannot be ſaid of Infants. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The argument is confirmed from <hi>John</hi> 4. 2. where it is ſaid that
<hi>Jeſus made more diſciples,</hi> then, <hi>that he baptized:</hi> firſt it is ſaid that he
made diſciples, then baptized.</p>
            <p>Some one perhaps will ſay that Baptiſme of Infants is elſewhere
inſtituted, although not here.</p>
            <p>To which is anſwered, Let he that can, bring forth that inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the doubt will be looſed.</p>
            <p>But infants may be diſciples, for they may be ſanctified by the
Spirit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, Infants may be ſanctified by the Spirit of God,
purged by the blood of Chriſt, ſaved by the grace of God, my minde
abhorrs from the doctrine of them that aſſert, that Infants not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
neceſſarily periſh, or are deprived of the Kingdome of God,
nor do I doubt, but that the Elect Infants dying in infancy are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
yea if it ſhould be made known to us that they are ſanctified,
I ſhould not doubt that they are to be baptized, remembring the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Peter, Act. 10. 47. Can any man forbid water, that theſe
ſhould not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghoſt as we?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then you will ſay [make diſciples] in that place, may be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
as that it may include infants?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It follows not; but this only follows, that in eaſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
we may depart from the ordinary rule: But the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
rule is, make diſciples, that is, by preaching the Goſpell, make
diſciples, as appears from <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15. and baptize them, to wit,
whom you have made diſciples, and in the ordinary courſe of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
we muſt follow the ordinary rule.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome one will except, that Chriſt teacheth that ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
ſhould be baptized, but that the ſpeech is not excluſive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Refut.</hi> But it is meet he remember, who ſhall thus except, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
be the rule of worſhip, it is neceſſary that he that ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the worſhip, binde himſelf to the rule, otherwiſe he will
deviſe will-worſhip, and arrogate the Lords authority to himſelf:
Surely the Apoſtle in the buſineſſe of the Lords Supper, inſinuates
this, when being about to correct the aberrations of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
concerning the Lords Supper he brings forth theſe words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.

            <p>Beſides as Chriſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 4. 8. argues from the inſtitution of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113333:18"/>
Marriage, againſt Divorce for a light cauſe, and Polygamie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is ſaid, Two, not more then two ſhall be one fleſh; ſo in
like manner it may be here argued, Chriſt ſaid Baptizing them,
and not others, therefore theſe and not others are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>But as for him who gathers from this place, infants are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
becauſe Chriſt commands all Nations to be baptized, verily
he is faulty. 1. In caſting away that reſtriction that Chriſt hath put.</p>
            <p>2. By determining that all men whatſoever are to be baptized, ſo
that this is not a priviledge of believers and their children, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with them, to all Infidels and their children.</p>
            <p>And in very deed, however aſſertors of Infant-baptiſme, crack of
a priviledge of believers and their offeſpring, not only the uſuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of baptiſing any little children offered, but alſo ſayings prove,
that men have gone far, not only from Chriſts inſtitution, but alſo
from the principles, upon which, men at this day are buſie to eſtabliſh
Infant-baptiſme. I ſhall prove this by ſome inſtances. In the 59. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>Fidus,</hi> from which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is wont in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputations
againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> to take his proof for Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
and to which Writers attribute much, although that I may ſay
no worſe, without cauſe, this reaſon is put, why it was not aſſented to
Biſhop <hi>Fidus,</hi> who thought that an Infant was not to be baptized,
afore the eighth day, according to the Law of ancient Circumciſion,
<hi>We all rather judged, that the mercy and grace of God is to be denied to
none, that is born of men.</hi>

howbeit for the preſent the Sons were branches broken off, for unbelief,

and is become a God to us and to our ſeed, the ſeed muſt be holy, with
holineſſe of the choſen nation, and holineſſe externall of the Covenant,
notwithſtanding the Father and Mother were as wicked as the Jews,
who ſlow the Lord of glory.</hi>

though both their Parents be profane, if thoſe who are inſtead of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to them do require Baptiſme for them, and give their promiſe to
the Church for their religious Education, ſeeing they may lawfully be

            <p>Laſtly, if this Argument be not of force, Chriſt commandeth
firſt to Diſciple, and then to baptize thoſe that are Diſcipuled; to
exclude Infants from Baptiſme; neither will the argument be of
force, from 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 28. Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him
eat,</hi> to exclude infants from the Lords Supper, for by the like cluſion
this argument may be rejected by ſaying, that the ſpeech of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
is not excluſive, and is to be underſtood of receiving the Lords
Supper by perſons grown only, yea, verily, neither will the argument
be of force from the inſtitution of the Supper, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26, 27. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
only believers are to be admitted to the Lords Supper. If any
reply. But the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. &amp; 11. hath declared, that the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
is excluſive, the ſame may be ſaid of the inſtitution of Baptiſm,
from the following Argument.</p>
            <p>THE third Argument is taken from the practiſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> which is the beſt interpreter of our Lords
inſtitution,<note place="margin">§ 16. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles practiſe againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant-baptiſm confirmed.</note> from whence the Argument is thus formed:</p>
            <p>That tenet and practiſe, which being put: Baptiſme cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles did adminiſter it, agrees
not with the practiſe of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But the tenet and practiſe of Infant-baptiſme being put; Baptiſm
cannot be adminiſtred, as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles adminiſtred
it, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is of it ſelf manifeſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved; Before the Baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> even the
Jews did confeſſe ſins, the Apoſtles before baptiſme did require
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113333:19"/>
ſhews of faith and repentance, but this cannot be done in the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
of Infants: The <hi>Major</hi> is proved by looking on theſe places,
<hi>Mat. 3. 6. Luk. 3. 10. Act. 2. 38. Act.</hi> 8. 12, 13. and <hi>ver.</hi> 37. when
the <hi>Eunuch</hi> had ſaid to <hi>Philip, What letteth me to be baptized? Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
anſwered, <hi>If thou believeſt with thy whole heart thou maiſt;</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the defect of faith to be an impediment of Baptiſme, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 18.
<hi>Act. 20. 47. Act. 11. 17. 18. Act. 16. 15, 31, 32, 33. Act. 18. 8. Act.</hi>
19. 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 16.</p>
            <p>This Argument is confirmed, for if it be rightly argued from
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28 That the Lords Supper is not to be granted to Infants,
becauſe ſelf-examination is pre-required, by like reaſon we may ſay
Baptiſme is not to be yeelded to infants, becauſe repentance and
faith are pre-required, <hi>Act. 2. 38. Act.</hi> 8. 37. and that of thoſe
who are deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to whom the promiſe was.</p>
            <p>THE fourth Argument is taken from the practiſe of the next<note place="margin">Arg. 4.</note>
Age after the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">§. 17. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the practiſe in the Age next the Apoſtles againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm confirmed.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That tenet and practiſe is doubtfull of which it cannot be proved
that it was in force or uſe, in the next Age after the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But it cannot be proved that the tenet or practiſe of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
was in force or uſe in the Age next after the Apoſtles, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is of it ſelf manifeſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved by the teſtimony of <hi>Lodovicus Vives</hi> above
recited, to which <hi>Voſſius in theſibus Hiſtorico Theologicis,</hi> of Infant-baptiſme,
joynes the teſtimony of <hi>VValafridus Strabo,</hi> and by the
examining of places brought to that purpoſe, and by the continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of queſtions propounded to the baptized in Ages following,
and other tokens from Councils and Eccleſiaſticall writers, which in
Hiſtoricall buſineſſe are wont to beget credit.</p>
            <p>The words of <hi>Walafridus Strabo,</hi> who lived about the year 840.
in his book <hi>de rebus Eccleſiaſticis, Chap.</hi> 26. are theſe, We are alſo
to note, that in the firſt times the grace of Baptiſme was wont only
to be given to them, who by integrity both of body and minde were
already come to this, that they could know and underſtand what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is to be obtained in baptiſme, what is to be confeſſed and believed,
what laſtly, is to be obſerved of them that are born again in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:113333:20"/>
THe fifth Argument:<note place="margin">Arg. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That which in ſucceeding Ages,<note place="margin">§. 17. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the wrong originall of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt it.</note> in which it was in uſe, was
in force, 1. as a Tradition not written; 2. Out of imitation of Jewiſh
Circumciſion; 3. Without univerſall practiſe; 4. Together with the
error of giving Infants the Lords ſupper, and many other humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
under the name of Apoſtolicall traditions; That is deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
doubtfull.</p>
            <p>But in ſome ages after the firſt from the Apoſtles, the tenet and
practiſe of Infant-Baptiſme was in uſe, 1. as a tradition not written,
as appears from <hi>Origen, Hom.</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Of which book neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
let me add the cenſure of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> on the Homilies of <hi>Origen</hi>
upon <hi>Leviticus, But he that reads this work, and the enarration of
the Epiſtle to the Romans is uncertain whether he read</hi> Origen <hi>or</hi> Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus.
And the teſtimony fetched from theſe books for Infant-Baptiſme,
is ſo much the more to be ſuſpected, becauſe <hi>Auguſtine,
Hierom, &amp;c.</hi> rely (ſo far as yet is manifeſt to me) on no other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
then of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his fellow-Biſhops in the Councel, of
which mention is made <hi>Epiſt. 59. ad Fidum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, out of imitation of Jewiſh circumciſion, as the doubt
of <hi>Fidus,</hi> in the 59. Epiſtle of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>Fidus,</hi> intimates, though
there were alſo other reaſons of Infant-baptiſme; as the opinion of
the neceſſity of Baptiſme to ſalvation, and the greedineſſe to increaſe
the number of Chriſtians, and perhaps the imitation of heatheniſh
luſtration of little ones; and ſome other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, without univerſall practiſe: for it is manifeſt that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi>
although born of <hi>Helena</hi> his mother, a Chriſtian, was not
baptized till aged, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the life of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> written by
him. The ſame is manifeſt from the book of Confeſſions of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>
concerning <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hmſelf, whoſe mother <hi>Monica</hi> was a
Chriſtian. The things which may be drawn out of <hi>Theodoret, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>
and others, concerning <hi>Theodoſius, Alipius, Adeodatus,</hi>
and many others (although my books, and notes out of them are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to me, by reaſon of the injury of the times) unleſſe I be deceived
will evince that (though in the Churches of thoſe times, little ones
were baptized, yet) many were not baptized, whoſe baptiſm its likely
the Church would ſooner have diſpatched, if the opinion of Baptiſm
that now obtains, had then obtained.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, together with the error of giving the Lords ſupper to
Infants, as is manifeſt out of the book of <hi>Cyprian de lapſis,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113333:20"/>
And that many other Inventions of men under the name of
Apoſtolicall tradition, out of a wrong liking of Judaiſme, did then
prevaile, as the <hi>Paſchall ſolemnity, &amp;c.</hi> is ſo obvious to him that reads
Fathers and Eccleſiaſticall writers, that no man will need proofe,
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in very deed, as of old, becauſe the rite of Infant-baptiſme
ſeemed to be of ſo great moment againſt the Pelagian hereſie, and
for the authority of the Councell under <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the Councel of
<hi>Milevis, Auguſtine, Hierom,</hi> and others, rather then from any ſolid
argument out of Scripture, in former ages, Infant-baptiſme prevailed;
ſo in this laſt age, ſome modern men ſeem to imbrace this tenet of
Infant-baptiſm, out of horror of mind, leſt they ſhould go headlong
into the pernicious errors of former Anabaptiſts, and their mad fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or leſt they ſhould ſeem to deſert the leading men of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches, or move troubles in the Church; rather then from
perſpicuous foundation in the Scriptures. Which they will think
that I have not ſaid as one that dreams, who ſhall read what <hi>Robert</hi>
Lord <hi>Brook</hi> hath in the end of his Treatiſe concerning Epiſcopacie,
<hi>Daniel Rogers</hi> in his treatiſe of Baptiſme, and others elſwhere.</p>
            <p>THe ſixth Argument follows:<note place="margin">Arg. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That which hath occaſioned many humane inventions,<note place="margin">§. 19. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant-baptiſme, from humane inventions oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by it confirmed.</note> partly
by which Infant-baptiſme it ſelf may be under-propped, partly the
defect in the policy of the Church, which in very deed is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by the lawfull uſe of Baptiſme, Of that it is deſervedly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
whether it be not in it ſelf weak and inſufficient for its proper
work.</p>
            <p>But the matter is ſo in the buſineſſe of Infant-baptiſme,</p>
            <p>Ergo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved by inſtances: they are,</p>
            <p>1. The uſe of ſureties in Baptiſme, which is an humane invention,
for a ſhadowy ſupplement, and I had almoſt ſaid ſporting, of that
profeſſion of faith which at firſt was made by the baptized in his
own perſon.</p>
            <p>2. Epiſcopall confirmation, in which the Biſhop layes hands or
anoints the catechized, that Baptiſme, or the baptized may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
and they made capable of the Lords ſupper.</p>
            <p>3. The reformed union, by examination, confeſſion, ſubſcription,
of the received doctrine in the Church, before the communion of

very deed are deviſed to ſupply the place of Baptiſme; for by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
according to Chriſts inſtitution, a perſon is exhibited a member
of Chriſt and the Church, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 13. Gal. 3. 27. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
            <p>THe ſeventh Argument:<note place="margin">Arg. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That which hath occaſioned many errors,<note place="margin">§. 21. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant-baptiſm, from the Errors oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by it, confirmed.</note> that is deſervedly

            <p>But the practiſe of Infant-baptiſme hath occaſioned either the
birth or foſtering of many errors, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is proved by inſtances:</p>
            <p>1. That Baptiſme conferres grace by the work done.</p>
            <p>2. That Baptiſme is Regeneration.</p>
            <p>3. That Infants dying, are ſaved by the faith of their parents, faith
of ſureties, of the Church receiving into her lap: which is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
alone to the grace of God by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>4. That ſome regenerate perſons may utterly fall from grace.</p>
            <p>THe eighth Argument:<note place="margin">Arg. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That which hath cauſed many abuſes and faults in Diſcipline,<note place="margin">§. 20. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant-baptiſm, from many abuſes cauſed by it, confirmed.</note>
and Divine worſhip, and Converſation of men, that is deſervedly
doubtfull.</p>
            <p>But Infant-Baptiſme is ſuch, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is proved by enumeration.</p>
            <p>1. Private baptiſme.</p>
            <p>2. Baptiſme by women.</p>
            <p>3. Baptiſme of Infants not yet brought into light.</p>
            <p>4. Baptiſme of Infants of uncertain progeny, whom we call
children of the earth and world.</p>
            <p>5. They are baptized in the name of the Lord, who know not the
Lord, nor have ever conſented, or perhaps will conſent to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the name of our Lord.</p>
            <p>6. It hath brought in the admiſſion of ignorant and profane men
into the communion of the Church, and to the Lords ſupper: for who
can deny rightly, the right of the Church to the baptized?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:113333:21"/>
7. It perverts the order of diſcipline, that firſt a man be baptized
and after among the catechized.</p>
            <p>8. The Sacrament of baptiſme is turned into a meer Ceremony,
yea into a profane meeting to feaſt together.</p>
            <p>9. Men forget Baptiſme, as if they were never baptized, ſo that it
hath the force of a carnall rite, not of a ſpirituall Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>10. It takes away, or at leaſt diminiſheth zoale, and induſtry in
knowing the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>THE ninth Argument.<note place="margin">Arg. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That is deſervedly doubtfull,<note place="margin">§. 22. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from unneceſſary diſputes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant-baptiſme, confirmed.</note> that yeeldeth occaſion to many

determined by any certain rule.</p>
            <p>But the tenet or rite of Infant-baptiſme is ſuch,</p>
            <p>Ergo.</p>
            <p>It is proved by inſtances.</p>
            <p>1. Of baptizing the Infants of Excommunicated perſons.</p>
            <p>2. Of baptizing the Infants of Apoſtates.</p>
            <p>3. Of baptizing the Infants of ſuch Parents as are not members
in a gathered Church.</p>

               </gap>he Infants of thoſe, whoſe Anceſtors were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,

            <p>THE tenth reaſon of doubting is,<note place="margin">Arg. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That in the midſt of the darkneſſe under the Papacythe ſame men
oppoſed Infant-baptiſme,<note place="margin">§ 23. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant-baptiſm from the oppoſition to it in the middeſt of Popery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</note> who oppoſed invocation of Saints, prayer
for the dead, adoration of the Croſſe, and ſuch like; This is manifeſt
out of the 66. Sermon of <hi>Bernard,</hi> on the <hi>Canticles,</hi> where of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques
(as he cals them) who he ſaid boaſted themſelves to be Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
of the Apoſtles, and name themſelves Apoſtolique, he hath
theſe words, <hi>They deride us, becauſe we baptize Infants, becauſe we
pray for the dead, becauſe we ask the ſuffrages of the Saints,</hi> and in his
140. Epiſtle to <hi>Hildefonſus,</hi> Earl of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> he complains of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi>
the Heretique, formerly a Monke, that <hi>He tooke away holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
Sacraments, Churches, Prieſts, that the life of Chriſt is ſtopped
to the little ones of Chriſtians, while the grace of Baptiſme is denied,
and they are not ſuffered to draw neer to ſalvation.</hi>

From the Epiſtle of <hi>Peter Abbat. Cluniacenſis,</hi> to three Biſhops
of <hi>France,</hi> againſt <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> and <hi>Henricus,</hi> holding errors, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
into five heads.</p>
            <p>1. That little ones are not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>2. That Churches or Altars ought not to be made.</p>
            <p>3. That the Croſſe of our Lord is not to be adored or worſhipped,
but rather to be broken and trodden under feet.</p>
            <p>4. That the Maſſe is nothing, nor ought to be celebrated.</p>
            <p>5. That the good deeds of the living, nothing profit the dead; That
we are not to chaunt to God. <hi>He ſaith, that the hereſie of the</hi> Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruſians
<hi>was received in the Cities of</hi> Gallia Narbonenſis.</p>
            <p>And from <hi>Lucas Oſiander</hi> his Epitome of the Eccleſiaſticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
<hi>Cent. 13. l. 1. c.</hi> 4. at the year 1207. where he accuſeth the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes</hi>
as conſenting with the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which I adde, That in the ages neer the Apoſtles,</hi> Tertullian
<hi>and</hi> Gregory Nazianzen <hi>diſſwade the baptiſme of Infants, unleſſe the
danger of death happen. The words of</hi> Tertullian <hi>are in his book of
Baptiſme,</hi> c. 18. Therefore for the condition and diſpoſition, alſo age
of each perſon, the delaying of Baptiſme is more profitable: Yet chiefly
about little ones; for what need that the Sureties be alſo caſt on dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
who themſelves may by mortality be wanting to their promiſes,
and be deceived by the comming forth of an evill diſpoſition. The Lord
ſaith indeed, Do not prohibite them to come to me; let them come when
they are grown, let them come when they learn, let them be taught
when they come, let them be made Chriſtians when they can know
Chriſt. Why doth innocent age haſten to the remiſſion of ſinnes? ſhall
it be done more warily in things ſecular, that to whom earthly ſubſtance
is not committed, divine ſhould? Let them know how to ask ſafety,
that thou maiſt know to give to him that asketh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> in his 40. Oration of holy Baptiſme:</p>
            <p>For which we are to uſe all diligence, that we miſſe not the common
grace. Some one will ſay, let theſe things be concerning them that ſeek
Baptiſme: but what may you ſay concerning them that are yet babes,
and neither perceive loſſe, nor grace? ſhall we alſo baptize them? Yes
by all means, if any danger urge; for it is better that they be ſanctified
without perceiving it, then to go away unſealed or unaccompliſhed.
And the reaſon of this, to us, is Circumciſion on the eighth day, being a
certain typical ſeal, &amp; offered to them that had not yet the uſe of reaſon;
as alſo the anointing of the poſts, which by things without feeling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113333:22"/>
the firſt born. But for others, I give my opinion that they ſtay
three yeares, or a little within this, or beyond it, when they may be able
to heare and anſwer ſome myſticall points, if they cannot underſtand
perfectly, yet being thus ſtamped, they ſhall ſanctifie both ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
with the great myſtery of conſecration.</p>
            <p>THe eleventh reaſon of doubting,<note place="margin">Arg. 11.</note> is, Becauſe the Aſſertors of
Infant-Baptiſme little agree among themſelves,<note place="margin">§. 24 The Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant-baptiſm, from aſſertors dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about the ground of it, confirmed.</note> upon what
foundation they may build Infant-Baptiſme. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others of
the Ancients draw it from the univerſality of divine grace, and the
neceſſity of Baptiſme to ſalvation. <hi>Auguſtine, Bernard,</hi> and others,
bring the faith of the Church as the reaſon of baptizing Infants:
Others, among whom is the Catechiſme in the Engliſh Liturgie, put
as the reaſon of Infant-Baptiſme, the promiſe of the Sureties, in the
place of the faith and repentance of the baptized. The Lutherans, the
faith of the Infant; others, the holineſſe of a believing Nation; others,
the faith of the next parent; others, the faith of the next parent in
covenant in a gathered Church. This difference of the maintainers of
Infant-Baptiſm, deſervedly cauſeth doubt concerning the thing it ſelf.</p>
            <p>THE laſt,<note place="margin">Arg. 12.</note> and that a weighty reaſon of doubting is, becauſe Infant-Baptiſme
ſeemes to take away one, perhaps the primary end of
Baptiſm; for many things argue that it was one end of Baptiſm, that
it ſhould be a ſigne that the baptized ſhews himſelf a diſciple, and
confeſſeth the faith in which he hath been inſtructed.</p>
            <p>1. The requiring of confeſſion by <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles,
was wont to be before Baptiſme, <hi>Luk. 3. 10. Act. 8. 35. Act.</hi> 16. 31.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The frequent manner of ſpeaking in the new Teſtament, which
puts Baptiſm for Doctrine,</hi> Act. 10. 37. Act. 19. 3. <hi>ſhews this.</hi> Beza
<hi>in his Annot. on</hi> Act. 19. 3. The anſwer is moſt appoſite, in which they
ſignifie that they profeſſed in Baptiſm the doctrine propounded by <hi>John,</hi>
and confirmed by uſe of Baptiſme with which they had been baptized,
whereby they had acknowledged Chriſt but very ſlenderly.</p>
            <p>3. The form of Chriſts inſtitution, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. compared with
the phraſe as it is uſed 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. Or, <hi>were you baptized into the name
of Paul?</hi> implies the ſame. On which place <hi>Beza,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third reaſon is taken from the form and end of Baptiſme, in
which we give our name to Chriſt, being called upon, with the Father
and Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:113333:23"/>
4. That which is ſaid, <hi>Joh. 4. 2. He made and baptized more diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
And <hi>Mat. 28. 19. Going, make diſciples in all nations, baptizing
them;</hi> Intimate this. And if, as ſome affirme, Baptiſm was in uſe
with the Jews, in the initiating of proſelytes into the profeſſion
of Judaiſme; this opinion is the more confirmed. But in Infant-Baptiſme
the matter is ſo carried, that Baptiſme ſerves to confirm a
benefit, not to ſignifie a profeſſion made: and ſo one, perhaps the
chief end of Baptiſme is voyded. And here I think it is to be minded,
that the uſuall deſcription of a Sacrament, and ſuch as are like to it,
That it is a <hi>viſible ſigne of inviſible grace;</hi> hath occaſioned the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding
of both Sacraments, as if they ſigned a divine benefit,
not our duty, to which in the firſt place the Inſtitution had reſpect.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to ſome, that Infant-baptiſme ſhould be good, becauſe the
Devil requires Witches to renounce it. Which reaſon, if ought worth,
might as well prove Baptiſme of any Infants, Baptiſme by a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,
good; becauſe theſe the Devil requires them to renounce, as well
that which is of the Infants of believers, by a lawfull Miniſter. But
the true reaſon why he requires the Baptiſme of Witches to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by them, is not becauſe the Baptiſme is good in reſpect of
the adminiſtration of it, but becauſe the Faith mentioned in the form
of Baptiſme, is good; and they that renounce not their baptiſme,
do ſhew their adherence to that faith in ſome ſort, which cannot
ſtand with an explicite covenant with the Devil. Nor is the aſſuming
of baptiſme in ripe yeares by thoſe who were waſhed in infancy, a
renouncing of baptiſme, as ſome in their groſſe ignorance conceit;
but indeed a firmer avouching of baptiſme according to Chriſts mind.</p>
            <p>This more likely might, be inferred from the Devils practiſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring.
Witches to renounce their baptiſme; That the profeſſion of
Faith is the main buſineſſe in Baptiſme, which ſhould be before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
if it were rightly adminiſtred after the firſt pattern.</p>
