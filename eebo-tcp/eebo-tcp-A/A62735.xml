            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince it hath been a Custome from one Generation to another, for all sorts of Writers to creep into
<pb facs="tcp:49846:3"/>
the Light at first with their well-set Apologies; it may justly seem in vain now (when there is nothing left to be said) for me to travel in that kind, wherein the Wits themselves have been stranded (as it were) before: But as for Vs, who are Divines by Our Profession, it might possibly be better to confess ingenuously, That it is as much our duty (as occasion or acceptance may oblige us) to Write as to Preach the truth. Nor can such an exigency be ever wanting while they that are weary of our Scribbling, will
<pb facs="tcp:49846:3"/>
help off our Impressions: for they see some reason for it. And it is most likely to be this, They may perceive that all is not truth that is in Print; but much more that disguised truth is the fittest of all to serve the turn of errour; which is not of the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence in reference unto all opinions. For how we shall be saved is another matter than how we shall be re-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursed with a Notion only. We have as frequent need to bring all Metals to the Touchstone or the Scale, as the Goldsmiths have, and in
<pb facs="tcp:49846:4"/>
certain Points to be scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, even to a Grain, since the Filings of Gold are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as for this Essay in pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ticular, which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to present unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon light through Your hands, I must confess, <hi>Sir,</hi> that although I wrote it not on purpose to oblige or disoblige a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Party; yet I cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, that as it cometh home to certain Points at which I aimed not at first; so there may be divers that may take themselves to be more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:49846:4"/>
in it than I was aware: for whose sakes I may be the more sorry, that I have also written in some confusion, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Books came to my hand, in this obscurity (as You know best, who have been my chiefest Lender) than as my method lay in the first Scheme, wherein it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed. And if I beg leave here to give You a further Prospect into that than I have done before, the rest of my Observers may be prepared the better for it.</p>
            <p>Since the Prime Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the only Standard both of
<pb facs="tcp:49846:5"/>
Truth and Purity, and the Scripture it self (<hi>tanquam Index sui, &amp; obliqui</hi>) the only Rule whereby to prove the Reports of Ancient Writers, which may be many ways seduced, or imposed on by others; I thought by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring these together to set forth what I could discover of the true Church, from the first beginning to the end (at least) of the first Century af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Our Lord's Nativity; having a due regard both to the outward and inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of it, waving or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring unto others, what I
<pb facs="tcp:49846:5"/>
found done to my content be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I weighed with my self the Subterfuges of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, in writh'd or feign'd An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities only; and of divers modern Sects, in the real obscurity of the first Ages, both of the Old and New Testaments: which it may be divers of them would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wish to be left under a Standing Veil still, than to be discovered by any other Lights than their own. And if I say no more at first, it may be 'tis because I know not how far I may be able to proceed, though I have the
<pb facs="tcp:49846:6"/>
whole Substance in my rude Draughts already.</p>
            <p>I have been informed, that the Great Bishop <hi>Montague</hi> had designed to accomplish a Refutation of <hi>Baronius</hi>'s Annals; but he lived to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish little else (of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign) beyond his <hi>Apparatus.</hi> And that it was among the <hi>Belli Pensieri</hi> of Mr. <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> to <q>take a review of the original Principles of the Primitive Church. Which he purposed should reach to Our Saviour's, and the Apostles Lives, and
<pb facs="tcp:49846:6"/>
their immediate Successors, for four or five Centuries, till Interest or Policy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd over true Devotion.</q> But alas! for ought appears, these dyed with him.</p>
            <p>But what shall I say for my self at last, in that I have not only thrust these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers forth under Your Name in the Front, but also fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my self with the same in the Rere, by pressing one or two unusual Requests from You? For the first, sure it can be thought no other than the least expression of gratitude
<pb facs="tcp:49846:7"/>
(howsoever rude) that can be made (as the World goes now) to an uncorrupted Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. And for the second, let them that blame Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension, but shew first that they are able to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as well, or (at least) to imitate Your Example; and then they shall escape the better in exchange of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: In the mean while it is no matter who shall tell them, That Learning and Vertue, such as Yours, in an Ancient House, is the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Nobility, and like to raise You <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To which some others have fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applyed this Answer: That if <hi>Adam</hi> had not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the whole Earth would have been a kind of Paradise to the sons of men; but that, that which was set forth for <hi>Adam,</hi> was adorned for him (in a special manner) as the Prince, and head

               <p>Whereas, if there be any mystery at all to be observed in it, it may seem to have been this, That God would not leave <hi>Adam,</hi> to abide in the wide world (at large) as his own master, and Lord of all besides, without any homage to be paid to himself, his Maker; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he would impale him (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confinement) within a certain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious place, wherein he would be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, in a more especial manner, by him and his, that were to constitute an holy Church in the state of innocency, if he had held it. Unto which intent, God took <hi>Adam</hi> into a kind of implicit Covenant (but not the same with that, which some do take for the Covenant of Works) with himself, and to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Sabbath, he annexed (as a kind of Sacraments) <hi>the Tree of knowledge</hi> for his caution;<note place="margin">Gen. 2.2, 3, 9.</note> and <hi>the Tree of Life</hi> for his comfort,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> as a pledge of immortal felicity, in case of his obedience.

out it. And that the slaying of Beasts prefigured this, the common consent of Christians hath made it manifest, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since the death of Christ, did not only cease to sacrifice, but declare all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to be a denial of it, and a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of Him afresh. And the power of God hath so wrought, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Gospel came, the Heathen Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices also decayed by degrees.

               <p>On another hand, who will dare to say, That it was lawful to sacrifice (which was the special Sacrament of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in lieu of which the Papists would set up their Sacrifice of the Altar, <hi>tanquam incruentum</hi> only, as a proper Sacrifice of the like kind) without an institution? Or who can shew the institution before the practice? A Point that is like to move the Kidney in two sorts of men.</p>
               <p>The first can never prove, That God did directly institute this Ordinance of sacrificing, the most substantial part of his worship, which, no doubt, from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> unto <hi>Moses</hi> (whatever he added to it) was not without confession and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing of sins, so far as the Sacrifices were Sin-offerings, that is, of expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or atonement; or without prayers, if they were but Peace-offerings, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of propitiation for obtaining of benevolence; nor without certain words

of Benediction, or Thanksgiving, when they were oblations of inanimate things for the blessings that God had bestowed, or continued to them. How do they then stand so stiffly on it, that nothing is to be admitted in the worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, without a positive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, extending to all the material cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, (at the least) when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find so much as a syllable of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this first Sacrament at all?</p>
               <p>In the New Testament, we find no institution neither (which will touch them nearer still) of the Lords Supper itself (which all hold for an Ordinance, and a Sacrament, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As for Baptism, indeed, our Lord speaks positively, and expresly (as if they might inferr, that this ordinance of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation were only instituted; and not the other, which they account worthily, of greater excellency) <hi>Go teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

               <p>When we meet with any Divine No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among the Heathen Writers (which are not a few) we may take all the rest, that they had not from the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> (by which name they seem to have known in general the Hebrew people) to have been clearly from the light of Nature, or from some old Traditions, traduced by their Poets, which were their ancientest Philosophers. When there are any Passages quoted out of the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Rabbins in favour of any Gloss or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, we are to consider whether that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49846:20"/>
Author lived before our Saviours birth, or after: If before, how far suspicious of the leven of the Pharisees; if after, how much tainted with the reprobate imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the unbelieving <hi>Iews,</hi> (which yet some do swallow as a Loche;) or, in fine, how far free from contradiction, (those blinded people, out of hatred to Christianity, having many ways belied one another, in delivering of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Rites and Traditions.) In Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Controversies, where the Authority of Fathers and Councils is quoted, the times, circumstances, occasions, interests and powers, are either to be added or substracted, as Grains are in the weight of Gold. But the present scope and design of Parties may seem to give us the best light (if we can discover it) into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern opinions, what to judge of them. I will therefore here endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect that of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> (as far as I am able) because it stands in my way now, and is like to stand in my light hereafter, (as I proceed) if I do not utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it.</p>
               <p>The design of <hi>Socinianism</hi> is not to destroy all Religion, without which they could not make a Sect; nor yet to deny the Gospel in express terms, (lest they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49846:20"/>
be questioned of <hi>Iudaism</hi> or <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> which would work nothing else to their purpose besides a prejudice) but by consequence only. Yet because they draw as near to the Borders of Atheism as those of <hi>Poland</hi> do to the <hi>Grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi>'s, they have a mighty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note>. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That natural Religion is only moral, and that he which is just shall be saved,

Or, (as my Author amplifies it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto their sense, and not his own) That it is incredible that God should have ordained such a Law unto posterity, and that <hi>Moses</hi> and all other sacred Writers should pretermit it as a thing of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that it is a rash thing to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce imaginary Laws. It is to be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49846:23"/>
That it is <hi>sallacia in homonymia,</hi> and may be solved easily by distinguishing betwixt Laws imperative and indicative: for as it is a rashness to introduce the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, without shewing of the express Precept; so it is a like rashness to deny the other (by way of true construction) as made more in favour than the other; and implying the same authority and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, in case of violation, as the other. Wherefore under the name of a Law we must know that a Rule, direction, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or any signification whatsoever, from a Sovereign power, obtains the name of a Law indifferently, to all his loyal Subjects, without any Act or Edict whatsoever. For who will dare to diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the nod of a Prince (if he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it right) without the pain of displeasure, or other penalties? Who will venture to keep his place, if a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral point with his Staff or Finger, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting any motion? And that this Law of Sacrifices was of this latter sort, I am ready now not only to prove, but to demonstrate unto any clear and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced man, by these two irrefragable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; 1. Because, though God in all Ages left to humane prudence the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of such things as were agreeable
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49846:24"/>
only unto humane order, yet he never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it (so depraved especially as it is since the Fall) to excogitate any way of worship whatsoever; much less an intire way to please him, such as Sacrifice, with all its appurtenances, ever was. Which if I take for the assumption of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I believe it will not be denied in its kind. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Offering of Sacrifices could not be of any mens excogitation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>major</hi> likewise will hold its own, unless an instance can be given in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing besides Sacrifice it self, which I believe cannot be done. And if they still insist no less on that than before, we say, It is very strange that so important a thing as Sacrifice (about which, God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards establishing but a better order, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed <hi>Nadab and Abihu for offering strange fire before the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. 10.1.</note> 
                  <hi>which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them not</hi>) should be the sole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
               <p>But if it be said further, Why might not God (accepting of Sacrifices, which men had offered of their own accord) after make an Ordinance of them, as Christ himself did of Baptism, in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Iews</hi> before? Or of the Bread and Wine that was used at the Passover, to frame his own Supper by it, according
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49846:24"/>
to their use? I answer, That for Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, if it had been grounded in Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical washings, it would have availed the Objectors somewhat; but that which was grounded on the Law, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by it before, might well be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, and varied by the Giver of the Law. And so for the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; when he abolished the Passover, he took Bread and Wine out of it, as he had taken a Rib out of <hi>Adam,</hi> and made another Creature. There is not the least of humane invention therefore left in either of these, having both their first Originals from God, before men were conversant about them. In sine, if it be urged, That if Sacrifices were by no Law, it remains that they must needs have their Original from the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, bethinking themselves what service was proper for them to offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Maker, Lord of life and death and all; and that none appeared like to Sacrifices of living Creatures, and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other precious things: they shall then make way for my second Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> That,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because illumination came between, therefore Sacrifices must needs be from God, and not of man. In
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49846:25"/>
which I shall be put to prove, <hi>first,</hi> That illumination came in, and, <hi>secondly,</hi> that it amounted to a Law; and then I shall be rid of this too.</p>
               <p>Now in the touching upon this Point, methinks I cannot but foresee that my Adversaries are ready to compound with me by some concession, <hi>viz.</hi> That God is not deficient to them that use their right reason, to illuminate them some way; yet as by the use of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reason, and not by ungrounded infusions, or outward revelations, any more than he did in the Case of <hi>Bezaleel,</hi> (whom <hi>he filled with the Spirit of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 31.3, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge,</hi> to fit all things for the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle) and yet he wrought as an Artist still. But I am not so much afraid of my Argument, as to admit of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position with them. I grant to them likewise that <hi>Bezaleel</hi> was enabled and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled (so as they say) to work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship only; but I say, That neither he nor any other did ever begin or continue any true way of worship, without a previous revelation, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner, from God.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied (in the first place) but, That if illumination may be a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49846:25"/>
betwixt an imperative Law, and the use of reason, that then there may be (what we call) an indicative Law, betwixt these extremes, amounting in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unto some express of positive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Let us therefore begin with this, and shew, <hi>first,</hi> That there was such a thing; <hi>secondly,</hi> That it amounted to as high a Law to the <hi>First Adam</hi> to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as this word did after the <hi>Second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had spoken it, <hi>As oft as you do this, do it in remembrance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The first appeareth, <hi>viz.</hi> That there was illumination before Sacrifice, these two ways:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that <hi>Cain</hi>'s Sacri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ice was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, when it did not please God for the manner of the Offering; for the Text saith,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> that after, God had respect to the Offering of <hi>Abel,</hi> and not of <hi>Cain</hi>; so that <hi>his countenance fell.</hi> God was so far from excusing his obedience, that he rather put him in mind to amend it than to refrain, <hi>If thou do well,</hi> saith he, <hi>shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou dost not well, sin lyeth at the door</hi>; (and <hi>Cain</hi> knew what that was by his Father <hi>Adam</hi>'s punishment for sin) but if thou do well, <hi>unto thee shall be Abel's desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</hi> Judge you
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49846:26"/>
therefore, whether <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Abel</hi> first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented sacrificing. If it had been wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cain,</hi> would God have spoken so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to him? If it had been righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Abel,</hi> the younger Brother, whom <hi>Cain</hi> hated, would not <hi>Cain</hi> have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to take example from him? But unto such straits are these reduced, who because they do not read that <hi>Adam</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, would take it for granted that he did not at all; and so that <hi>Adam</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without any Form of Religion, (it may be a hundred years or more) till his Sons invented one.

previous unto these' Sacrifices, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries have been made sensible, and are well aware of it: I mean the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Abel,</hi> more accepted than his Brothers. Which having been said by <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> (or the Author to the Hebrews) to have been <hi>offered unto God by faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.4.</note> 
                  <hi>as a more excellent Sacrifice than Cain's; by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and by it, he being dead yet speaketh</hi>: we may clearly conclude, That he sacrificed in a right obedience to some gracious intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the good pleasure of God, which was instead of an imperative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, if there were none (though we conceive there might be, though it be not mentioned) before.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49846:28"/>
is impossible to please God. For he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently seek him.</hi> And he also saith, that <hi>by faith Abel offered unto God.</hi> Is not this <hi>argumentum ad hominem,</hi> if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he affirm (as his Followers do) that Sacrifices were of humane excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only? For cannot God be known but by faith? And can <hi>Abel</hi> offer by faith, and yet according unto humane excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation only (reasoning in it self what was fittest to be done, and so doing) which in <hi>Socinus</hi>'s sense is taken to be an exclusion of faith, and directly contrary to it?</p>
               <p>And if <hi>Abel</hi> had offered without faith, the Apostle testifies that he could not have pleased God; but in that he did please him, with a witness he shews, that it was by such a faith as <hi>Cain</hi> had not, though he could not have offered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out revelation neither.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49846:28"/>
such a revelation, he had sinned; nay, if he had but done such a thing in doubt, whether he had warrant for it, or no; those other words of the Apostle might have been sit to be applyed,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note>
                  <hi>He that doubteth is damned</hi> in the case: <hi>for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is not of faith is sin.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Cain</hi> sinned not in sacrificing, according to the revelation of God to his Father <hi>Adam</hi>; for he sacrificed with faith, or belief of the Duty to be done, and he obeyed the outward part, as many men do at this day (who have not the faith of <hi>Abel,</hi> or of right Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) but he sinned in his hypocrisie, having malice in his heart, and no love to God, nor respect unto his promise. And this you may take for a good reason why his Sacrifice could not be so acceptable as his Brothers.

                  <hi>And all these having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise,</hi> but eyed and expected it.

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Socinus</hi>'s second Topick propounded to be examined, viz. Whether, because men might possibly invent Sacrifices, as not against the Law of Nature, it must needs follow that they had their rise from thence. A contrary way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propounded, by way of demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the subtilty of his way noted. That there were divers other Laws be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moses,</hi> in force; shewed also that he did not record the Laws, but the practice only.</head>
               <p>AND now, that I may bring <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (or his Adherents) off with the more advantage or disadvantage, which may happen, since we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary designs; <hi>they</hi> to admit as little need of Christ, and so, to do as little honour to him, as needs must; and <hi>we</hi> do him all the Right that the Scriptures or the Catholick Church hath ever done: I come to his second Topick, <hi>A possibili ad necessarium,</hi> that because it was possible (or not impossbile, but) that by the light of Nature (reasoning and excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating what was fit to be done in honour
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49846:31"/>
to the great Creator, to set up some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous service to be performed to him) the Offering of Sacrifices might come into their minds, that therefore it must needs be so, and no otherwise; there being nothing in it contrary to the Law of Nature, since God did afterward confirm it.</p>
               <p>In answering of their former reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from a particular Negative to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Affirmative, we proceeded by the way that is as strong as theirs was sleight; I mean, by demonstration from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to the cause (the same way that we prove a God) for where there was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, encouragement and penalty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, there the Law it self (the cause of these) was also demonstrated, by a necessary consequence. And so in handling this their other Topick, <hi>A pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibili ad necessarium,</hi> I shall go near to requite them by arguing quite contrary, <hi>A necessario ad impossibile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, first, What kind of arguing is this? There is no Command revealed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a matter of such moment as sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing; and therefore there was none, nor any reason to be given why such a thing should be omitted. And yet to say that it is possible and likely (of as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49846:32"/>
great moment as it is)that men should find it out by the use of right reason, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this is less revealed than the other? And less reason to be given why or how it should be first devised? We say still, it was absolutely necessary, that after the Fall there should be sacrificing; but that it was utterly impossible that man should invent it of himself. And if <hi>Socinus</hi> doth not ground his own <hi>Hypothesis</hi> upon Scripture, wherefore doth he call for Scripture, Scripture? And when we shew him Scripture, what avails it in the case of Sacrifices, when he shall set the same reason that invented them, above the Scriptures; giving it authority to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them (not so as right reason, but) as the reason of <hi>Socinus</hi> shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? Is not this to appeal always to himself? And what hath he deserved of the truth, that we (that revere the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture indeed) should defer so much au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to him? Do we not see that he alledgeth Scripture only to baulk us, and admitteth it not to inform himself? But let us appeal, however, unto such as will hearken what the Scripture saith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>

the other aggravation) cut off <hi>Onan</hi> in his prime? Shew me the Laws, if you are able; and yet they were of such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that their breach (you see) was Capital. I instance in Laws (which is <hi>ad idem</hi> to the Question) since it nothing moves them when we shew, That divers things are recorded in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as delivered by <hi>Moses,</hi> (who was directed unto brevity) which we cannot find at all in him:<note place="margin">Jude 14.</note> as <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Prophecy, <hi>Lot</hi>'s perturbations for the wicked <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5, 7, 8.</note> Noah</hi>'s preaching to the old World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, the fourth Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> was not the place wherein <hi>Moses</hi> was to set down the Law of Sacrifices, which he was after to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>So that these two Points remain, in the whole, to discover the fallacies of our Adversary, and to vindicate the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> first, That after the Fall, Sacrifices were absolutely necessary towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Secondly, That it is utterly improbable, and morally impossible, that any man should invent them; so that from the very first they should have been acceptable unto God on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

But what though? Will they be any more asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in this, than in their sleighting of both the Sacraments of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (of which they acknowledge Christ himself to have been the Author) while they drive them to another scope, and question the necessity of their continuance?

(<hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus tamen sententiae,</hi> saith my Author, <hi>nescio an quenquam adjutorem habeat.</hi>) But in the mean time he leaves us as much to admire what he did with the Beast, if he did not burn it, being slain: Did he rather bury it, to with-hold a Sacrifice by fire? Or did he spare all his Flock to be immortal, while Man alone was subject to mortality? Or what need had <hi>Abel</hi> to bring such Sacrifices as these but once a year, the profits whereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose

               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49846:37"/>There are two shifts obtended over this authority to avoid the manifest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency and cogency of it. First, That he makes no mention of inanimate Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in the Case; but it is confessed that he had spoken somewhat of them before, <hi>viz.</hi> That they availed little to the Point in hand, the expiation of sin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he doth not say, that the Beasts which <hi>Abel, Noah,</hi> or <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> sacrificed, were offered unto God, <hi>explicatâ aliquâ ipsius Lege,</hi> by any mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Law of his; but only by some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine enlightning (it may be) of their minds, not common unto all, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted only unto some of the best of men: And this they think maketh not at all against their own supposition. Which trifling baffling, I shall also endeavour to uncase presently, that when I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed I may the sooner wind up all that doth remain of this Argument upon its last bottom.</p>
               <p>We say in summ, That the Law of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing was revealed unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and no other; and only taught by, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him: That no Sacrifice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part was ever of any avail at all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect to that which was made by blood. And we have proved how the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49846:37"/>
first illumination or direction amounted to a Law; and shall shew the manner, in order, as we can come to it. We ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reject the fallacious insinuation, as if only extraordinary mén did sacrifice; and we say, That <hi>Cain</hi> and all his did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice (one way or other) as well as <hi>Seth,</hi> there being no need of any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond illumination. But the main subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lyes about the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the first, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate Sacrifice, or no; and if they did, Whether by their own natural reasons, with nothing else but some remote assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of illumination, such as a man may have by study? When we therefore say further, That Sacrifices were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary after the Fall, for the reparation of <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity; we must distinguish against the Sons of <hi>Cain,</hi> or the Magnifiers of his Sacrifice by inanimate things (if they were of more worth) above <hi>Abel</hi>'s, which was by the choicest Animals that he had; as if both alike were no more but returns of thanks to God, by a visible token, for his outward benefits, according to their several kinds: I say, we must distinguish betwixt Sacrifices of expiation, or atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for sin, (which they deny) and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49846:38"/>
those others, whatsoever they were, that were Propitiatory only, or Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical. And we say, That they were all absolutely necessary (but especially the first) and all alike revealed, before they could be tendred unto God.</p>
               <p>Now why <hi>Socinus</hi> thinks so meanly or indifferently of Sacrifices, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to salvation, is not far to seek. For he holds, (as we have hinted before) 1. That the light of Nature alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this excogitation, was sufficient; 2. That natural Religion is only moral, which Sacrifices are not; 3. That there is no such thing as expiation, or satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for sin; but that it is done away by merely pard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First, In a way of Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; which was not so obscurely as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely tendred to him. For after his Fall, Expositors have observed, that Gods beginning with the Serpent first, to sentence him (who was the first in fault) imported a reservation of greater mercy to them that were but drawn in, and so betray'd. And when he had said,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>I will put enmity betwixt the Woman</hi> (a Type of the Church) <hi>and the Serpent</hi> (the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil) <hi>and betwixt his Seed</hi> (the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

World) <hi>and her Seed</hi> (the Elect) that they were given out of hand to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that they should not dye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, as they had deserved; but should live to see a various Seed. And when they heard, in the close, that <hi>the Seed of the Woman should bruise the head of Satan,</hi> whereas his Seed should only <hi>bruise the heel</hi> of the other, by temporal tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; they had light enough given them to perceive that they should not only obtain a redemption by that blessed Seed promised, but also a certain Victory at the last: which some of the ancient Rabbins understood as relating to their <hi>Messiah.</hi> But if any one will rather chuse to be frivolous with the modern <hi>Iews,</hi> it is in vain to stand to beat the truth into them with a Mallet.</p>
               <p>Surely, none found the effects more of God's severity or goodness, imported in the whole judgment, than our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents themselves; since they both suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more troubles in the flesh, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained more favour than any of their Posterity.<note place="margin">

conspicuous and idoneous worship, to be rendred unto God; and affirm, that Sacrifices had their original from the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, inasmuch as they were not contrary to the former; (granting that they were not necessarily implied in the former) and say (besides) that what <hi>Abel, Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> might do (in this kind) might be indeed by some especial Divine way; so that it was not common unto others, but only proper to themselves, or such excellent men as they: they have given us the last hints of Argument to proceed, and to conclude on somewhat in the close.</p>
               <p>We have shewed before, the vanity of their reasoning, <hi>à possibili ad necessarium,</hi> from a thing possible to the certainty of the thing, or to the probability either. For who ever thought, that a thing not repugnant must needs be, or be most likely, at the least? How many instances might be given to expose such a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to laughter? But the way which I propounded last was, to detect their legerity, by arguing, <hi>à necessario ad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibile,</hi> from a thing necessary to a thing impossible. I have shewed, that Sacrifices were necessary to do away sin: if they like not that, yet they seem not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49846:44"/>
to deny, but that they were apt and fit enough to set forth some conspicuous worship and service unto God. And if this sacrificing for either end, was a Duty not revealed, nor likely, nor possible to be excogitated by any man; then man was obliged to an impossibility by nature (at least excogitating) which is absurd, <hi>Quia nemo tenetur ad impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will they say, that it was not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the beginning to offer any Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at all, but only to set up some way of worship; and that another way might have been invented, if this had not been fit enough? They themselves are not able (in this light of day) so long after, to shew what that other way might have been. Will they say, they deny not some direction; but that it came in use (<hi>divinâ quâdam ratione</hi>) they know not how, but by mens using of their right minds, the government of God (it may be) over-ruling them? This, I have noted before, was the shift of the old <hi>Pelagians</hi>; who finding some Grace to be undeniable,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vt supra cap.</hi> 2.</note> would have it all to be placed in the natural gifts of knowledge, Free-will and moral Vertues, together with the benefits of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49846:45"/>
and Government: but all this (as I have also shewed before) is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to constitute a Religion, which must needs come from some Law impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and revealed from God himself; much less a Covenant betwixt God and man, or a certain sign thereof, as Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was, <hi>viz.</hi> Of our first Parents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by entring into the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Gather my Saints together unto me</hi> (he says, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.5.) <hi>those that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice.</hi> Which was not the sign of the Covenant by <hi>Moses,</hi> but only circumcisio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. But from which of the first reasons (however o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled) should it proceed? From <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s? He was at an utter loss, and if he had gone about such a thing (of his own head) more apt to fall into the snare of the Tempter again, than to hit it right towards God; From <hi>Cain?</hi> He was a Reprobate; From <hi>Abel, Noah</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> according to such respective enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings as they had? Then so many good men, so much variety of sacrificing; which was all but uniform until the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore come to the last winding up of the botom. 1. It was not probable, 2. It was morally impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49846:45"/>
that any man should invent sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, so as to please God thereby, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was not probable, that either <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Abel</hi> should invent the sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of living Creatures, (since of <hi>Cain</hi> there remains no further Question, as to his own person, whatsoever his Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents did, because he brought only of the fruits of the ground) as any acceptable service unto God. For <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> (for their parts) they being due to death themselves (from which they were but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved only in respect of temporal death) it cannot well be imagined, that one of the first thoughts that should enter into their minds, should be to kill any of their lower Fellow Creatures; as being a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>raid in themselves to see what natural death might be, much more a violent one,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.20.</note> in any other; more especially, wrought by their own hands, which had brought all other things into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage with themselves, howsoever inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. And as for <hi>Abel,</hi> he could have no less estranged apprehensions from the like slaughter,<note place="margin">Prov. 12.10.</note> 
                  <hi>For a righteous man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth the life of his Beast, but the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies of the wicked are cruel</hi>; even as the very Sacrifices of the Heathen.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49846:46"/>
And <hi>Abel</hi> besides was a Shepherd, which sort of men are so tender of their Flocks, that <hi>David</hi> encountred a Lyon and a Bear in their defence; and our Saviour himself saith,<note place="margin">John 10.10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>The Thief cometh not but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy; but the good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. So that it was morally impossible, that such good men as these should ever devise such a way as this of their own heads, or approve of it in their own conceits, if they had not been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a mystery in the Case. For it would have been a sin against the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to have slain his Creature, (for no mischief done, nor yet for food) if he had not required Sacrifice, or the death of the innocent (which he valued less) instead of the nocent, which he loved more. What was his speech to <hi>Ionah? Should not I spare Niniveh that great City,<note place="margin">Jonah 4.11.</note> wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons, that cannot discern betwixt their right hands and their left, and also much Cattel</hi>? The Children and the Cattel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocent alike, and so far Objects of Divine compassion, according to their different worths and natures.</p>
               <p>We hear what they say, That these
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49846:46"/>
did it to acknowledge the right and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Lord of life and death, and that it was not unnatural, because that God confirm'd it afterwards by <hi>Moses,</hi> and Christ in fine abolish'd it, which he never did any Law of Nature, which is eternal and immutable.</p>
               <p>But if they did this to acknowledge the right of the Lord of life and death only, why did they take his right from him? Was that the proper way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it? For if they slew the Creature in their own right (before God had put it into their hands) they wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Lord of life by bare killing, much more by presenting of such a death, as an acceptable token to him. To the Lord of life, a living Present is a fitter token than a dead; for he delighteth not in the death of any of his Creatures, he willeth not so much as the death of a Sinner, but rather that he should turn and live. But as the same is the Lord of death by his own free dispensation, for <hi>again he saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 90.3.</note> Return ye Children of men</hi>; so he will be avenged on them that take this out of his hand,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.35</note> to hasten the end of any of his Creatures,<note place="margin">Psal. 94.1.</note> having once said,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.19.</note>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as also,<note place="margin">Matth. 23, 35.</note> that on the persecuting World <hi>might come all the righteous blood shed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel</hi> unto the utmost crucifying of Christ and of all his Members.</p>
               <p>Nor was <hi>Abel</hi> suffered to live so long, as to leave any Issue of his own, wherein he might have survived here on Earth in another manner, (which might a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle have alleviated the loss of him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his broken-hearted Parents) God reserving for him <hi>a better name than that of Sons and Daughters.</hi> But, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it seems, that both his death was permitted, and his issue prevented, for two other ends, which I may point at here, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the Curse, and 2. That the Promise, might both obtain their respective turns.</p>
               <p>For God had said first unto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed; and I will put enmity between thee

and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</hi> And unto the Woman he said, <hi>I will greatly multiply thy sorrow.</hi> And unto <hi>Adam, Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns also and Thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread, till thou return unto the ground whence thou wast taken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first,</p>
               <p>It was denounced against the Serpent, and against the man, more extensively; but against the Woman (<hi>tanquam medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um tantùm participationis</hi>) as the weaker Vessel, more remisly, though sad enough, <hi>In sorrow shalt thou conceive.</hi> But the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the promise it self passeth through the Woman by a stroke darted through the Serpent, and reacheth to the man (<hi>tanquam objectum tantùm partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pationis</hi>) as the primary object of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy only; since the Woman was of the Man, and all Mankind was to be the like thereafter, till the very promised Seed should come from the bowels of a Woman only. So that as Woman was taken out of Man at first, Man was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Woman afterwards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

generation in both; but the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that came by the latter to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, was infinitely a greater benefit than the constitution of a certain Sex or <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of Womankind before.</p>
               <p>And for so much of the Serpents Curse as glanceth also terribly on the Posterity of man,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> the Lord had said, <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed</hi> (poor Woman! that She herself must bear against her will!) <hi>and her Seed</hi> (which God should chuse, and She not know which was which) but the Seed of the Serpent was named first.

               <p>Of the competition likewise betwixt the two Seeds it is said further, <hi>It shall bruise</hi> the Serpents <hi>head,</hi> but the Serpents <hi>Seed shall bruise</hi> the others <hi>heel.</hi> Now the Seed of the Woman (if that was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>) was so far from beginning at all with the Seed of the Serpent (so much as to tread upon its tail, much less to bruise his head) that it was not only bruised in the heel by a small hurt from the Serpent, but in the head it self, by the death of <hi>Abel,</hi> quite contrary to what might be expected.</p>
               <p>But the Answer is, Though <hi>Cain</hi> knock'd his Brother in the head, yet the Seed of the Serpent did but bruise the heel of the Church (which was the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Seed) in the person of <hi>Abel,</hi> who was the first Type of Christ, <hi>qui patiendo vicit,</hi> who overcame, and so broke the head of the Serpent by his sufferings.

                  </q>
Wherefore as Christ arose from the dead the third day, and then triumphed glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously over Principalities and Powers; so did <hi>Abel</hi> rise again (to the benefit of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49846:50"/>
the Church) in the person of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Seth,</hi>

                  <hi>For God,</hi> said <hi>Eve, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew</hi>; by whom the Serpent was to be sped at last.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, there are two further Points to be discreetly traversed, 1.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.3.4.</note> That <hi>Adam</hi> lived nine hundred and thirty years (and it is likely <hi>Eve</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what near the matter, whether more or less) and begat other Sons, not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and Daughters, whereof the name of never an one is at all recorded. 2. That some penitent issue is not obscurely shewn to have issued from <hi>Cain</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">ver. 19, &amp;c.</note>For all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> not named, we may take it for granted that they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abode in their Fathers Tents (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Sisters to Wives, who were next to be taken) or went off with <hi>Cain</hi> to help him build and replenish his City; being nevertheless of the Seed of the Woman (or of the true Church) so long as they retained the Worship, the Rites, the Rules, and the Moral Laws, that they carried off from their Fathers house. And others of them cleaved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Seth,</hi> and holp to make up his Family, because the Earth must needs be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49846:51"/>
and Children go off to further distance. And thus we may conceive that the true Church was far from failing betwixt the death of <hi>Abel,</hi> and the birth of <hi>Seth,</hi> howsoever the necessity of lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or civil accommodation might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Members of it.

of the World, to the World's end, should become the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> through faith in the blessed Seed promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, who was to be made of God the Heir of all things visible and invisible; by which faith they should be after bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as <hi>Abraham</hi> himself was before.</p>
               <p>Now to exercise this faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to make him a pattern to all poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it pleased God to delay this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise for the space of twenty eight years,<note place="margin">Ab Anno Mun.

               <p>He no sooner had received the first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral promise (mentioned above <note n="*" place="margin">With a second assurance, delivered as a new promise, pointing out the Land in particular, which he had been commanded to survey.</note>) but God drove him out of <hi>Canaan</hi> into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> by famine (as was touched before) where he was in fear of being killed for <hi>Sarai's</hi> sake.<note place="margin">Gen. 13.7</note> Then he soon finds himself (after his return) engaged in a War to rescue <hi>Lot,</hi> leading forth three hundred and eighteen of trained Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, born in his own house; besides some Auxiliaries of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49846:60"/>
Confederates, under the Conduct of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Eshcol</hi> and <hi>Mamre,</hi> (in whose Plain at that time <hi>Abram</hi> sojourned, when the tidings were brought unto him) which happened after the promise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the third time, in these words, <hi>Lift up now thine eyes,<note place="margin">Gen. 13.14, 15, 16.</note> and look from the place where thou art, Northward, and Southward, and Eastward, and Westward. For all the Land that thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy Seed for ever. And I will make thy Seed as the dust of the earth, which cannot be numbred.</hi> In which promise the temporal blessing is only pointed at, and that Land in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, more amply than before.</p>
               <p>Some considerable time seems to have passed between, e're God appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abram</hi> again with these comfortable words,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Fear not, Abram; I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. Abram</hi> is sensible that these words relate to the three former promises; yet doubting, lest he should be mistaken in the meaning of them, he makes bold to complain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, That (for all his former promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) he remained Childless still, and no other Heir but <hi>Eliezer,</hi> his Steward (a Stranger of <hi>Damascus,</hi> though born in his house) appeared likely to inherit all
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49846:60"/>
his Substance. Which moved God to compassionate his Case, and to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to him in a fourth promise, that he should have an Heir out of his own Loins,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.6, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>And he believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him for righteousness.</hi> Yet after that, presuming farther, to ask a sign, though God vouchsafed to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to his request; yet he caused <hi>an horror of great darkness to fall upon him in his sleep,</hi> in (or after) which he gave him to know, that his posterity <hi>should serve unto the fourth Generation, till the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Amorites was full.</hi> However, when this heavy agony was over, God was pleased to amplisie his temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, in extending the bounds of it <hi>from the River of Egypt, unto the great River Euphrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Sarai,</hi> thinking these promises to be made to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band only, and not unto her self (find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the Case stood with her) gave her <hi>Egyptian</hi> Handmaid <hi>Hagar</hi> to him,<note place="margin">Gen. 16.2.</note> desiring (at least) to have some little part in the Land promised, by her own Maid; which She was not like to have by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This was the tenth year after the promise at the least; but as soon as She conceived, <hi>Sarai</hi> was iealous of her,<note place="margin">Ver. 3.</note>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:49846:61"/>
and by hard usage wrought her flight: and so gave birth unto a great mystery or two, before the Son of the Concubine could be produced.</p>
               <p>What made <hi>Abram</hi> so continent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and so constant to his barren Wife <hi>Sarai</hi>? Did he think it unlawful to take a Concubine?

satisfying of his flesh? Or doth he do it the better to please his Wife, even as <hi>Adam</hi> pleased <hi>Eve,</hi> and fell by it? Or, in sine, is not he himself also touched with a little spice of unbelief, in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance unto <hi>Sarai,</hi> as well as she?</p>
               <p>In my opinion (howsoever some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors do seek to blanch it) the faithful <hi>Abram</hi> was at this time imposed on by his Wife <hi>Sarai,</hi> and not excusable of some infirmity in the Case. Though he stedfastly believed the promise, yet hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it had not been revealed to him, that it should be by <hi>Sarai</hi>: By whom should he therefore try, but by her whom <hi>Sarai</hi> herself had recommended to him? It happened therefore as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment unto <hi>Sarai</hi>'s diffidence, that her Handmaid <hi>Hagar</hi> (having conceived, and thereupon imagining that she and hers should go away with all at last) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to despise her; and to <hi>Abram</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he should have such a Lout as <hi>Ishmael,</hi> by a foul <hi>Egyptian.</hi> Of whom yet (as a Son by Nature) he was so fond,<note place="margin">Gen. 15. ult. &amp; 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.</note> that when God renewed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise the fifth time of the blessed Seed, thirteen years after the birth of <hi>Ishmael,</hi> enough to let him know that <hi>Ishmael</hi> was not the Seed intended; yet he could not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49846:62"/>
forbear to intercede for him after this manner, <hi>O that Ishmael might live before thee</hi>:<note place="margin">Gen 17.18.</note> As if <hi>Abram</hi> could e'en have been contented that <hi>Ishmael</hi> might have been the man.</p>
               <p>But it may not fare better with <hi>Abram</hi> than with his Forefathers, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> before him; for as <hi>Adam</hi> had <hi>Cain</hi> for his First-born, and <hi>Noah</hi> one, or other of the Aliens; so must <hi>Abram</hi> too (the election of Grace having sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome been observed to have followed primogeniture, while all other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges were annexed to it). And as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Cham</hi> were born to persecute the true Church, before it was yet in being, or but yet in its under growth; (like the <hi>red Dragon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 12.4.</note> in the Revelation, that <hi>stood before the Woman that was ready to be delivered, for to devour her Child as soon as it was born</hi>) so it was to fare with <hi>Ishmael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 21.9.</note> who first scoffed at the Feast of <hi>Isaac</hi>'s weaning, and was after planted in his own Issue upon the skirts of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> among the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites,</hi> to be ready to join as far as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, with the enemies of the Race of <hi>Isaac.</hi> So that God would have out of the same Loins of <hi>Abram</hi> both the Curse and the Blessing to have their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49846:62"/>
appointed course, according to his own purpose, without respect unto the favour that he bore to <hi>Abram</hi>!</p>
               <p>In fine,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.24, &amp;c.</note> the Apostle himself warns us of a further mystery, Why <hi>Ishmael</hi> should come between the promise, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of it; and why he was to be born before <hi>Isaac</hi> the Heir of the promise, <hi>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the Law, Do ye not hear the Law? For it is written, That Abraham had two Sons, the one by a Bond-maid, the other by a Free woman. But he who was of the Bond-woman was born after the flesh, but he of the Free-woman was by promise. Which things are an allegory; for these are the two Covenants, the one from the mount Sinai, which gendreth unto bondage, which is Agar: for this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth unto Ierusalem, which now is, and is in bondage with her Children. But Ierusalem which is above, is free, which is the Mother of us all,</hi>&amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that the further mystery beyond this (that <hi>Israel</hi> should first suffer under <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage before they should be free) was this, That the Law which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth unto bondage must needs come first; whereof this <hi>Hagar</hi> and her Son <hi>Ishmael</hi> were a Type or Allegory.

               <head>CHAP. XV. At the fifth renewal of the promise God augmented the names of <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rai.</hi> And required a Covenant from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his Seed; the effect of which was, That he would be their God, and they should be his people.

               <p>NOW, when it pleased God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his promise, at the fifth course when <hi>Abram</hi> was ninety nine years old, and <hi>Sarai</hi> past Child-bearing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto Nature; he added an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of augmentation in the midst of <hi>Abram</hi>'s name, and in the end of <hi>Sarai</hi>'s; that the one should thereafter be called <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the other <hi>Sarah</hi>: the reasons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (to refer the rest unto the Cabbalists) are given in the Text. And so the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise it self is exhibited in ampler terms
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49846:64"/>
than before, and <hi>Sarah</hi> expresly shewed to be, in her own Person, the Woman that should conceive this Seed, and the set time, <hi>viz.</hi> at that <hi>set time in the next year,</hi> after God had done talking with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 17.21, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>and went up from him.</hi> But <hi>Abraham</hi> is now given to understand, that according unto this Grace, he must enter into a Covenant with God for himself, and for his Seed after him; wherein God would also condescend to be one Party of the Covenant with him; which in effect was this, That God would be the God of him and his Seed, and that he should be their only God. In token of which Covenant, (as a recognizance or acknowledgment of it) God required of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he and his Seed, <hi>every male at eight days old should be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the foreskin of the flesh; and all that were born in his house, or bought with money of any stranger, which was not of his seed</hi>; under penalty of being <hi>cut off from his people, whosoever should break the Covenant,</hi> in remaining uncircumcised after this. So <hi>Abraham</hi> began with <hi>Ishmael,</hi> or with himself, it is uncertain whether; but to me it seems that it was with himself. So that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s heart being formed by faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49846:64"/>
God would also now have all of the same profession to be signed with the same Sign, whereby his visible Church and people should be distinguished from others, and Sacramentally sanctified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himself. Which mystery is therefore next to be enquired into with the greater diligence.</p>
               <p>It appeareth by it self what circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is: The only thing to be admired is, Why it should please God to make an holy Ordinance of so obscene a thing as Circumcision , (<hi>saltem in adultis</hi>) at the least in grown men, that were to be made Proselytes; whom, one would think, the pain should not more keep off than the shame of the thing, in the eyes of common men: And to what ends (especially) he did require it: Which may draw in all the Question here, so far as it doth relate unto the times of the Old Testament: for of the remainder (if God permit) there is more to be said hereafter. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is no Polemical Discourse in its first intention, I shall endeavour to be the briefer in the stating of it.</p>
               <p>This Question therefore may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, First, As it hath been blanched or coloured, to make it more plausible

               <head>CHAP. XVI. The true ends of Circumcision, I. Civil, to distinguish them from other Heathen people or corrupted Worshippers; which was a Bridle to them, as restraining them from mixt marriages and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and given as a mark to make them odious to the Gentiles, and the Gentiles an abhorrency to them. 2. Moral, to put them in mind of purity of heart. 3. Spiritual and Mystical, in respect, <hi>First, Of Abraham; Secondly,</hi> Of his Seed, and <hi>thirdly,</hi> houshold. 4. Of the whole Church. Why <hi>Ishmael</hi> must be circumcised, <hi>Arminius</hi> taxed; why the Sons of <hi>Keturah</hi> were also to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, and in fine all the Servants.</head>
               <p>THE ends of Circumcision (in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) seem to be partly Civil, whereby the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation should be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from others; partly Moral, to teach them purity; and partly Typical, or Spiritual, in respect to the holy Seed, and the Mysteries thereafter to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>

after the words cited before, <q>But (saith he) there is also another reason, <hi>viz.</hi> That all such as are of this Faith, have one certain sign of conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against any that should thrust in amongst them: For Circumcision is such a thing as no man will admit but for Religion sake. And thus Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision is a Covenant [S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a sign and seal of a Covenant] which our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> made, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are circumcised enter into the same, <hi>viz.</hi> to believe the Unity of God; as God faith, I will be a God unto thee, and unto thy Seed after thee. And this reason (saith he) is as firm and valid as the former, and it may be more solid.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:49846:70"/>But this (in fine) was most pertinent to <hi>Abraham</hi> in particular: Whereas, at the making of the promise once before, <hi>Abram had said,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.8.</note> Lord God, whereby shall I know</hi>? He hath now a Sign or a Token given him in his own Flesh,<note place="margin">The wound was notso grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, as the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was comsorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for herein he saw, That from his Loins should come that Blessed Seed, which should purge his soul from all corruption.

                  </note> whereby he might rest the more assured (thereafter) that Christ should be born of his Seed, according to the Flesh, out of his Loins, and of the Womb of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> and no other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then if we look upon Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision with respect unto his Seed, as an Ordinance for ever, to be begun with <hi>Ishmael</hi> (his Reprobate Issue) before the Son of Promise was any otherwise conceived: But in the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> we shall find some further matter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to detain us in the way, even though we were in haste before.</p>
               <p>This is (indeed) one of the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons assigned by the Fathers and the School-men why Circumcision was given unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> as to his Person, <hi>viz.</hi> To be a Sign to him of that faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he believed, and was to believe, that Christ should be born of his Seed.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49846:71"/>
had this been all, it had sufficed that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> alone bad been circumcised in his own Person; whereas, if it had been so, there could no Covenant have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, comprehending all his Seed, and all his houshold, together with himself. The Questions that arise for the clearing of this Point are three, Firth, Since <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac,</hi> who was to be born, was declared to be the Son of the promise, and <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> not; why must <hi>Ishmael</hi> be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised into this Faith, and be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this Covenant, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Isaac</hi> was born? Secondly, Why the Sons of <hi>Keturah</hi> afterwards?

               <p>For the fifth of these: Must he that was an Enemy by Nature, in that he must lose the inheritance that he stood so fair for before, and an Enemy by God's appointment; be circumcised into a Covenant of thankfulness and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for <hi>Isaac,</hi> who was to be his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planter, as much as <hi>Jacob</hi> (after) was of <hi>Esau</hi>?</p>
               <p>We must take all together: The whole promise made to <hi>Abram</hi> (at the very first) amounted unto thus much,

                  <hi>I will bless thee, and make thy name great,<note place="margin">Gen: 12.2, 3.</note> and thou shalt be a blessing; and I will bless them that bless thee, and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</hi> And again it is said,<note place="margin">Chap. 18.18, 19, &amp; 22.18.</note> not only that <hi>Abram should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a great and mighty Nation,</hi> but that <hi>all the nations of the earth should be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in him.

Ishmael</hi> had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto brought up in his Fathers house, (to the twelfth year of his Age) and taught to sacrifice, which he understood no more than Circumcision; but he must submit to both. He was so far from being excluded from the state of Grace, or the hope of Glory, that he was a principal Member of the visible Church, before the Son of promise was conceived. Neither was he circumcised into the blessings of <hi>Isaac</hi>'s house in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but of his Father <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, the Father of the Nations to descend by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise from <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and into him that was the utmost Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all faith,<note place="margin">Hag. 2.7:</note>

that only the very promised Seed should be circumcised, for <hi>Isaac</hi> himself did not afterwards know whether his Son <hi>Efau,</hi> or his Son <hi>Jacob</hi> should be the man, till he was as blind with Age as he was with fondness of his elder Son. I am not of the mind of <hi>Arminius,</hi>

               <p>Yet it cannot be said but that the house of <hi>Abraham</hi> was enough to season both the Mother and the Son with some piety, as appears by divers passages of <hi>Hagar,</hi> and by <hi>Ishmael</hi>'s returning, after he had been turned out of doors, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist <hi>Isaac</hi> in the Burial of his Father.<note place="margin">Gen. 25.9.</note> However, as he had been a Scoffer in his own Person, so he continued to be a Persecutor in his Posterity, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the blessing inherited the curse, which was opposed to it,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.3.</note>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49846:73"/>
bought with <hi>Abram</hi>'s money, to obtain liberty upon the pretence that they would not be cirumcised. Nor was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Hyrcann's</hi> blamed in later times for compelling the <hi>Edomites,</hi> when he had subdued them, to be circumcised, but commended rather. The reason of their Circumcision (besides the share which they had in the desire of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) was partly to propagate the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, if they went off; and partly to constitute and fortifie the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church, if they continued in the Tents of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Such was the Church which it pleased God to form to himself from the beginning; such the Materials of it! And how many of these had true Grace in their hearts, besides <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, and his Wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> and (it may be) his Steward <hi>Eliezer,</hi> before <hi>Isaac</hi> was born; I leave the <hi>Brethren</hi> that are most concerned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.

               <p>For the first: No doubt, while they were young, and lived in their Fathers house (which necessity would teach him

to build, as well as to make himself Cloaths) but that <hi>Adam</hi> offered for himself and all his Children; but when they were able to go abroad, and set up a Tent of their own, to be filled with their younger Brethren and Sisters, and their Children; then of common Right, <hi>Paterfamilias,</hi> the head of the house, was their Priest, and in Case he sacrificed, all the houshold were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently consecrated to assist him by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Ordinance of God, because that which he required could not otherwise be done.</p>

There he instructed them, there he prayed and offered up praises unto God (more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the Sabbath Day) and did all, in substance, that belonged unto Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ever after. But against this that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage seems to make, that when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Cain, Where is Abel thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> He replyed, <hi>I know not: Am I my

               <p n="2">(2.) It might so happen that one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them might be absent; and yet their Father (who led a careful and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential life) might offer for which of his Sons came;<note place="margin">Job 1.5.</note> as <hi>Iob</hi> did for all his Sons when they were absent. Yet I know nothing to the contrary, but that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> when they had housholds of their own, might have Altars so too, the mystery of <hi>oneness</hi> of Altars being not as yet revealed.</p>

And thus the worship of God came to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> unless any small circumstances might be added to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, after God had given certain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts unto <hi>Noah,</hi>

Of those which <hi>Abraham</hi> made at <hi>Sichem, Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> and <hi>Beersheba,</hi> with his Grove there, which was drawn into an ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and the like afterwards forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</head>
               <p>WE read, first, of Altars of Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Testimony (which were usually magnificent:) Secondly, Of Altars for Burnt-Sacrifice, Meat and Drink-Offerings and Peace-Offerings and the like; and thirdly, Of an Altar of incense, in after-times, all opposed to the Idolatry of the Heathen.</p>
               <p>Of the two first (which belong only unto this place) we may consider the matter and the form. For the matter, they were simple, of Earth or Stone, (and not of Brass, as they after were in setled times) as we may learn by the first Institutes that were delivered by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49846:80"/>
                  <hi>Moses,</hi> who according to God's directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on digested many things into Law and Rule, which were but only of good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample before.<note place="margin">Exod. 20, 24, 25. &amp; Deut. 27.5, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>An Altar of Earth</hi> (saith he) <hi>shalt thou make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy Burnt-offerings, and thy Peace-offerings, thy Sheep and thine Oxen: In all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. And if thou wilt make me an Altar of Stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn Stone</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs had no time for that, nor, it may be, ready Work-men; possibly by Providence, as the next words may shew the reason</note> 
                  <hi>: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the form therefore, if it was for remembrance only, as for thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and a glory; they made it greater, or it may be neater; but yet so, that it might be sit to be used as an Altar for service upon all occasions. Let us see what examples we have of any of these, since it may be questioned whether they did not more hurt than good (as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of time it happened unto <hi>Moses</hi>'s Brazen Serpent) for the Heathen find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, might either demolish them in revenge,<note place="margin">Exod. 34.13 &amp; Deut. 7, 5<hi rend="sup">..</hi> &amp;c. 12.3.</note> (because the <hi>Israelites</hi> were commanded to abolish theirs) or else prophane them by some new Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49846:81"/>
or Consecration to an Idol; and so offer Sacrifices, even unto Devils, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Altars; or else they might become occasions of division among themselves, which we are about to note hereafter.</p>
               <p>It was in use from ancient times, as from <hi>Seth</hi>'s Pillars (if there be any truth in that) and from the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> for men to raise some Structure or another, in remembrance of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements or fortunes: And (it seems) that the true Worshippers delighted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in erecting Altars, than any other Fabricks: But if they were not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly for the service of sacrificing, why should they do so?</p>
               <p>I find therefore, as I hinted, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, Altars were erected for a threefold end. First, For Monuments of thankfulness for some mercy or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; Secondly, For tokens of a Covenant, (or for a Testimony) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther betwixt God and man, or betwixt man and man; Thirdly, For ordinary resort to the whole acceptable service of God, not only on their Sabbaths, but on every Day of the Week, and on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions: All of these pious, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God; not only before the Law,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49846:81"/>
but till the Temple was built; and (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some occasions) even after that.</p>
               <p>First, We find of <hi>Abram,</hi> that after God had appeared to him in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and had assured him that that was the Land which he would give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Seed;<note place="margin">Gen. 12.7, 8.</note> that <hi>he built an Altar upon the Plain of Moreh, near unto the place of Sichem</hi>: But that he forthwith <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved thence, unto a Mountain on the East of Bethel,</hi> (called so proleptically, since <hi>Iacob</hi> was the first that named it so, that is, the House of God; which for divers mercies and manifestations of God became a place famous to posterity) <hi>and pitched his Tent, and there he built an Altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord</hi>: as if he had not done so at the Altar before, but had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set it up as a Monument of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto God, who had so graciously appeared to him near <hi>Sichem.</hi> Which Notion is favoured the more by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, that when <hi>Abram</hi> returned from <hi>Egypt,</hi> he repaired unto the place betwixt <hi>Bethel and Hai,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ch. 13.3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>where his Tent had been at the beginning, and there called on the name of the Lord</hi>; returning not to the Altar at <hi>Sichem</hi> at all, by any thing that we can find. Neither might
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49846:82"/>
it seem lawful or expedient for him to demolish any Altar of thanksgiving, or any other, that by erection he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated and dedicated unto God, for fear left the Heathen should prophane them, who might be likelier to sleight them, as having Altars enough of their own, called by the names of one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Idols. As the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers did also call the Altars which they erected by some special name,<note place="margin">Gen. 13.18.</note> for a Memorial.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XX <hi>Abraham</hi> had many Tents, and, as a Prince, had a Despotick Power over them, that (through all their Tents) were born in his house. That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs occupied much Land, and were no burthen, but a profit to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries wherein they sojourned, <hi>viz.</hi> Freely in the wasts, where the Pasture was; and by Purchase, Covenant and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promise, when they pitched near to any great City, or populous place.

               <p>Now whereas we read that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and, after him, <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob pitched their Tent,</hi> in the singular number; it may seem that this is not to be restrained more than needs, but to be extended so as the circumstances do direct us.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>And lot also had Flocks and Herds and Tents,</hi> (in the Plural Number) Gen. 13.5.</note> The enquiring into which will lead us to consider and perceive what manner of temporal or spiritual lives they enjoyed in their respective pilgrimages; God having so provided for the honour of his Church, that he would not therewithal afford them all
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49846:83"/>
kind of temporal enlargements or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations; nor leave them (long) in any uncomfortable state.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.9.</note> that <hi>by faith Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange Countrey, dwelling in Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles</hi> (in the Plural Number) <hi>with Isaac and Iacob, the Heirs with him of the same promise.</hi> By which we may collect that the Tents were many, and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like a <hi>Praetorium</hi> to the rest. Out of which <hi>Abraham</hi> drew three hundred and eighteen men, to pursue the Seizers on his Nephew <hi>Lot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 14.14</note> (who was permitted to be taken, that <hi>Abraham</hi> might redeem <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Melchizedech</hi> might thereupon bless <hi>Abram</hi>) which were all said to have been <hi>born in his own house.</hi> Certes, if all in one Tent (and you cannot imagine that they all lodged continually under the Cope of Heaven) it must have been a very large one; but if it had been so,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.4, 5, 6.</note> he would not have entertained three Angels (whom he took to be but Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) under a Tree, without the doors.</p>
               <p>As for his power over all these, it was absolutely Despotical, as the Princes round about him. He taught them the Laws that they were to obey; and he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49846:84"/>
might punish as he thought sit, without account to any other Prince, any more than the Prince to him, whosoever he was. Which is sufficiently declared by <hi>Bertram</hi> in the same Chapter, cited more than once before.</p>
               <p>And if we think sit (in the next place) to consider what extent of Grounds these Sojourners might occupy, and by what Right, since they were but Strangers in the places where their Dwellings or their Changes were, it may dart a little further light unto us.</p>
               <p>It cannot be doubted, but <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Herdsmen, with their several Ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and Families, took up much Ground, because that <hi>Lot</hi> and He were forced to part, since <hi>the Land was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear them,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> 13.6.</note> that they might dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, because that both their substance was exceeding great</hi>; which was in Flocks of Sheep and Goats, and in Herds of other Cattel, as Bullocks, Horses, Camels, Asses, Mules, and such other Breed as those Countries did afford.</p>
               <p>Now although it be said, that <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the Land</hi>; yet <hi>Abram</hi> said unto <hi>Lot, Is not the whole Land before thee? If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49846:84"/>
to the right. And Lot beheld the Plain of Iordan, that it was well watered, and he dwelt in the Cities of the Plain, and pitched his Tent towards Sodom: But A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram dwelt in the Land of Canaan.</hi> Nor could <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> afterwards when the Stock was much encreased, and the Families (it is likely) more, but occupy Land accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Question is, <hi>Quo jure,</hi> by what Right these Strangers took up so much Ground in a Strange Countrey, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped wars about Plats, wherein they sate down, and (in all probability) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched themselves, for the better security; and about the Tracts round about them, which they filled with their Herds and Flocks.</p>
               <p>We must remember (to set us right here) that from the Flood to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to <hi>Abram,</hi> there is but about four hundred and twenty two years rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, which is too little to imagine all places to be replenish'd in; so that while the Inhabitants that were, lived in walled Towns for safety; and studied Arts and Sciences (to which the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi> ever were addicted) and were employed in the cultivating of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49846:85"/>
nearer Fields, and planting of their Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, the coming of these Strangers with their Stocks, and pitching about them, (like a standing Fair or moveable City) brought both Trade and plenty to them, while the waste Grounds might be left at large, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice unto any Native of the Country; which brought also encrease of Gold and Silver to the Patriarchs.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, he kept at a distance from all the idolatrous Cities, and entred not at all into them without some great occasion,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.16 &amp; 20.1. &amp; 23.3. Ch. 13.12. &amp; 14.16. &amp; 19.1.</note> as Famine and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress once or twice, and to treat with the men of <hi>Kiriah-arba</hi> for a Burying-place for <hi>Sarah</hi> but <hi>Lot</hi> being indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly mingled amongst the men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> happened once to be taken captive amongst them by the four Kings, and after hardly escaped from being destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them.</p>
               <p>And if it ever fell to their conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to pitch nearer to any City, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peopled place, so that there might be any danger of interfering with them. Then they either made some Purchase, or some Confederacy, or Compromise, with the Princes or people there, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49846:85"/>
an inviolable peace amongst them. And when <hi>Abraham</hi> was about <hi>Gerar,</hi> he did all at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 21, 22.</note>For when <hi>Abimelech</hi> and his Chief Captain <hi>Phichol</hi> observed that <hi>Abraham</hi> grew great, they thought it good policy to take caution of him by a solemn League, made by Oath, That <hi>he should not thereafter deal falsly by Abimelech, or his Son, or Son's Son; but according to the kindness that he had found in the Land, wherein he had so long sojourned. And Abraham sware, and both of them made a Covenant.</hi> At the making where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Abraham</hi> did reprove or gently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with <hi>Abimelech, about a Well of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which Abimelech's Servants had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently taken away from his, though Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham himself had digged it.</hi> And he made a Present to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that he might enjoy the better Right to it: But of the Land about, there was no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion made between them. However, when <hi>Abraham</hi> planted a Grove about the Well, and set up an Altar there, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing many days in the Land of the Philistines, no doubt he became a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser; at least of some Tenant-right or other for the time: both the Grove
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49846:86"/>
and the Well being to rest to him and his, as their propriety<note n="*" place="margin">In the Plain of <hi>Mamre, Abraham</hi> had also such a Confederacy, that he got <hi>Mamre</hi> himself, with <hi>Aner</hi> and <hi>Eshcol,</hi> to join with him in the pursuit of the four victorious Kings; which was a bold and brave attempt of theirs. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.13, 24.</note>.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Abraham</hi> bought the Field and Cave of <hi>Machpelah,</hi> it may seem that he intended to make no other use of it, but for a Burying-place, though it cost him four hundred Shekels of Silver, of currant Money with the Merchant, which amounts to about an hundred Dollars,<note place="margin">Jun. in not. <hi>A Shekel of Silver,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genteus, 2<hi rend="sup">f</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Matth. 26.15.</note> as <hi>Iunius</hi> doth account, (which before Navigation came to an height, was no inconsiderable Summ;) but as others, it might amount to two hundred and fifty Crowns.</p>
               <p>Once more, (and no more that I can find) When <hi>Iacob came to Shalem a City of Shechem,</hi>

And he erected there an Altar, and called it El-Elohe-Israel,</hi> that is, God, the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> So that his Purchase seems to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49846:86"/>
have been partly to prevent exceptions, in that he had pitched his Tent upon part of <hi>Hamar</hi>'s Patrimony, and partly, that he might erect his Altar of Worship in the most convenient place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the other Tents were pitched, for the benefit of the Drove.

               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:49846:88"/>Let us next consider (before we leave them) some of their restraints and incommodities, under which it pleased God to discipline and train them up unto a growing Church.</p>
               <p>We have a kind of Emblem of it in the Case of the <hi>Rechabites,<note place="margin">Jer. 35.6, &amp;c.</note> whose Father Ionadab commanded them, saying, Ye shall drink no Wine, you, nor Your Wives, nor your Sons, nor your Daughters for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Neither shall ye build house, nor plant Vineyard, nor have a Field, nor any Seed. But all your days ye shall dwell in Tents, that ye may live many days in the Land, where ye be Strangers. Only, for fear of the Army of the Chaldeans,</hi> (say they) <hi>we dwell at Ierusalem,</hi> for a time, even as <hi>Abraham</hi> might do in <hi>Gerar,</hi> or in <hi>Hebron,</hi> whose example that devout man seemed to recommend unto his Children and their Posterity for ever; and so to become more extraordinary Votaries than any of the <hi>Nazarites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Wine indeed, it was not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Patriarchs; but they could not have it of their own, since they could not be so well setled as <hi>Noah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9.20.</note> 
                  <hi>who began to be an Husbandman, and planted a Vineyard, and he drank the Wine, and was drunken,</hi> belike as unaccustomed to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49846:88"/>
it too.<note place="margin">Gen. 19.23.</note> Even as it happened unto <hi>Lot,</hi> whose Daughters got the Wine (no doubt) from the inhabitants of the Land: But since the Patriarchs had no such intimacy with their wicked Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.5, 6, 7, 8.</note> we read of no other Beverage that they had, but <hi>Milk</hi> and Water. And such were their frugal entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with <hi>Cakes made ready upon the hearth, and a little Butter, Veal, or Kid,</hi> fetched (as occasion served) from the Flock. And, that we may likewise think, might much conduce to their encrease of Wealth, since they made much ado a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the approach of any Visitant, that came for kindness only, as a rare thing.</p>
               <p>As for the Fields, which <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> purchased, we have noted before, that the one was for no other use but a Burying-place, and the other for his Booth and his Altar, even as men at a Fair pay for the Ground they break or occupy for the time.<note place="margin">Acts 7.7.</note>For S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

unto houses, that <hi>he dwelt in Tabernacles</hi> (which are no more comparable unto Houses, than the Ship-Cabins to the Chambers of a Palace) with <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> the Heirs with him of the same promise; though for <hi>Isaac</hi> it seems that he was not lodged under the same Roof with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but was enlarged enough in Family to have a Tent of his own,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having therefore no Lands, what should they do with Seed? This might be the Cause why they were so oft di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed by Famine, if there were a little Drought; because the Husbandmen of <hi>Canaan</hi> seem to have been but few, and might easily be brought to have little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for their own necessities. And by these occasions happened the chiefest of the troubles of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s life, that have been touched before.</p>
               <p>Which things considered and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I cannot but wonder at some mens accessions, so near unto that <hi>Socinian</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; as if the Fathers of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did but only live according unto

temporal promises, as they were in part from time to time fulfilled to them. So apt are men sometimes to dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Antiquity, as if nothing in the latter Ages could either happen or be done like what was then; and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times to look upon the same as meer dotage, even as young men when they hearken to old mens Tales think that they themselves are able to do much more and better. Or, as others pretend, that the modern Ages must needs be far more knowing, because they stand upon their Shoulders, while they are but growing up unto their Elbows; at least more pious by revelation and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: whereas more knowledge is lost than can possibly be repaired, and more piety than the declining Age of the World is likely to restore.</p>

               <p>WE may perceive by what hath been hinted before, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life our Father <hi>Adam</hi> lived after his transgression, <hi>viz.</hi> praying and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing in earnest expectation of the Seed promised, in whom all Sacrifices were to cease: And poor <hi>Eve</hi> (to make amends) travelled continually with the desire of obtaining it (as She hoped) in her own person. Wherefore when She brought forth her first-born,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.1. 25, 26.</note>She said, <hi>I have gotten a man from the Lord.</hi> And when She came again in process of time with <hi>Seth,</hi> She said, <hi>For God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me another Seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</hi> So that the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

being to the Seed of the Woman, it is conceived to be some reason why they were allowed usually to name their own Children. And when <hi>Seth</hi> had <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosh,</hi> it is further said, That <hi>then men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to call upon the name of the Lord,</hi> that is, the Sons of God began to sever themselves from the Sons of men, or the Race of <hi>Cain,</hi> and to worship apart from them.</p>

Behold what Record is left of his exactness, his heavenly mindedness, his holy contemplations, and indesinent Communion, and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49846:91"/>
in walking <hi>with God</hi>; who had endued him with the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and sanctity to such a measure, that (wanting nothing else but Vision) God translated him from Earth to Heaven in the middle of his days,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.5. in the 365. year of his life. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.23.

               </p>
               <p>When it is therefore said of <hi>Noah,</hi> That he was <hi>a just man, and perfect, and one that walked with God</hi>; and that he endured long (as <hi>a Preacher of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>) the contradictions of Sinners, <hi>while the Ark was in preparing</hi> (which was about a hundred and twenty years by account) we may guess whether he was not also like to <hi>Enoch.</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holy speculations of these expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Long-livers, were dry, or more unlearned, than the shorter-lived and shorter-sighted casts of the Ages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, may be well conjectured by the Book of <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 42.16, 17.</note> who lived hundreds, and <hi>died full of days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for all the Saints (in general) of the Old Testament, let us see what their inward piety was; from <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful, till the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ: that I may clear this Point, <hi>Vnam esse omnium fidem,</hi> that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49846:91"/>
there was but one faith of all Believers, the same with ours, faith in Christ, which was the strength of all their lives and hopes; and not any carnal blessings whatsoever. Which I think worthy, in this place (as if it were once for all) to state and prove, and answer such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as may be made against it.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s private Devotions, they appear in his Visions, Expostulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Intercessions with Almighty God. <hi>Isaac</hi>'s in his meditation and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er recorded; <hi>Iacob</hi>'s in his vows and wrestlings, whereby he did prevail with God, and obtain the name of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the state of the Question moved, it needs no further explication, when it shall be remembred, that it speaketh not of faith under any common Notion, (by which it might be diversly divided) but of faith taken properly and strictly for faith in Christ; of which it is asserted, that such a faith was in all Believers from the beginning; more especially from the promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in his Seed <hi>all the Nations should be blessed.</hi> And, according unto true method, the next Proceeding must be to prove it by Authority and Reason.</p>
               <p>First, In the Old Testament, (not to

And though after my skin Worms destroy this Body, yet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for my self, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another, though my reins be consumed within me.</hi> In which words it is plainly manifest that <hi>Iob</hi> understood that the Seed promised was to be the Redeemer, that he should come in the Flesh, and after that to Judgment at the Day of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when he should glorifie them that had believed in him. All these even as we believe now. In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Isaiah</hi> we read this, <hi>Thus saith the Lord who redeemed Abraham</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Isai. 29.22.</note>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the New Testament our Saviour testifieth thus much more of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in particular,<note place="margin">John 8.56.</note> 
                  <hi>Your Father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it, and was glad.</hi> First, He might see it by the Scriptures, which were extant before him: for (as I hinted before) it is not safe to think that God had left his Church for above two thousand years, without Record, only to favour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49846:92"/>
Tradition, which in such times might have been erroneous, or in others corrupted; or too weak (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Monuments) to have kept so many important Genealogies, as have been collected and digested by <hi>Moses</hi> as the Spirit of God directed him, (and therefore thought fit to save no more but his Books unto Posterity) and so to have transmitted them by memory alone. Nor may it be convenient to imagine that God by revelation only discovered unto <hi>Moses</hi> all that had passed before, as if he had left himself in the Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without witness. Secondly, He might know it by the Sacrifices, which he was to offer for the doing away of sin, which he knew to be the life of the lower Creatures instead of man, till the Redeemer should come; and this he might know (in a more especial manner) by the Precept dispensed with, which he had received, to offer up his only Son. Thirdly, He might know it by Vision and Revelation; since when God had admitted <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, as a Type of Christ, to be a Mediator for sinful <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 18.17, 18.</note> he had said, <hi>Shall I hide from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham that thing which I do, seeing that Abraham shall become a great and mighty
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49846:93"/>
Nation, and all the Nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him; and since he will instruct his Children after him, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>And if it be asked further, Why, what could he see in this day that should make him glad, more than the <hi>Iews</hi> that descended from him, who expected nothing more than temporal greatness at the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s coming, which seems to be the literal meaning of the promise? Let us hear how our profound Bishop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> descanteth on it:<note place="margin">Resp. Serm. 8. on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</note> 
                  <q>Why should <hi>Abraham</hi> (saith he) so desire to see this day two thousand years, and more, after his own were at an end? How was he concerned in it? Yes, Christ's birth he needed, and he had good by it. Will ye hear it from his own mouth? Thus he setteth down his Case,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Ecce ego pulvis &amp; cinis; Lo! I am but dust and ashes</hi>: Dust refers us to <hi>Dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.</hi> But why Ashes? He was not made of these: This sure refers to somewhat else. Ashes (we know) come of fire: Without it they are not made. So that besides death to resolve him into dust, he saw a fire
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49846:93"/>
to turn him into ashes. He saw it in his Vision when the Sun was down,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.</note> and it was Night, and <hi>a great fear or horrour fell upon him</hi>; he saw <hi>Cliba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num fumantem,</hi> a fiery Furnace. Blame him not, if after such a Night he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to see such a Day, and was glad when he beheld it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, it is a vulgar errour which represents the <hi>Iews</hi> of the ancient times (whatsoever the modern think) as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for no other than a King, when their <hi>Messiah</hi> should come; for they looked for such a Saviour as should be withal the greatest Prophet that they had ever had.

                  <hi>he laid up the Stones,</hi> by advice, <hi>until there should come a Prophet, to shew what should be done with them.</hi> And was not this the Question put to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist,<note place="margin">John 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Art thou that Prophet, or do we expect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> And the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> spoke (no doubt) the sense of <hi>Israel</hi> when she said,<note place="margin">John 4.25.</note>

If he guided their Kings, they expected another kind of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; if he inspired their Prophets, they expected another kind of Prophet, when the time should come; if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to their Priests according to the Law, they knew that they needed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advocate or Intercessor in many Cases; neither were they satisfied with any of their Sacrifices,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note>

Or, if any delegation of Government was unto Christ, under compromise (as was mentioned before) did he himself destroy, who was said to be the Mediator (likewise) before of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Testament?

               <p>THE first Objection was, That a few choice persons only had any special notion of the <hi>Messiah</hi> to come.<note place="margin">Obj. 2.</note> The next is, That of those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry choice persons so little was known, as could not be a sufficient ground of such a faith as we account to be a justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying or a saving faith in Christ; since of the Prophets, to some one was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one part of this mystery; to some others a little more; to no one the whole. Nay, it is to be gathered from that place of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.<hi>Peter</hi> quoted before, that some of them had Commission to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49846:103"/>
prophesie more than the meaning whereof was revealed even to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves For he saith, <hi>Of which salvation the Prophets</hi> (that prophesied) <hi>have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and searched diligently of the Grace that should come unto you,</hi> (and not unto themselves) <hi>unto whom it was revealed</hi> (at the last)<hi>that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you. Which things</hi> (for all their Prophecies) <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels desired to pry into.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us,<note place="margin">Resp.</note> first, consider the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved (or to be believed) betwixt them and us; and, secondly, then <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo,</hi> of the manner of their Faith and ours, how far they agree or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
               <p>First, If they and we do agree in the same Creed (which is called the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Creed) then certainly we both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in <hi>side credendâ,</hi> in the Faith which is to be believed. But why we should not be taken to agree in this, since eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Article of it may be articulately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the Old Testament, there can (indeed) be no other reason given than that which is insinuated, <hi>viz.</hi> That though the substance be there; yet it lyes scattered, and was not revealed (so
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49846:103"/>
much as in the matter) all at once; nor the end clearly understood by them, to whom the matter it self was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Now if this Creed (which is sufficient) be but understood confusedly by many of ours, and yet we take it to be ground enough for a saving faith to be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as they know in part; how much more may we extend our latitude of Charity to the Saints of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who believed upon the matter as much as some of ours, before it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in such an order?</p>

God, who could do wonders, would redeem them, and all Mankind, one way or other, in the general (they knew not how) we are left in a maze.</p>

               <p>In this posture we therefore find the Mediator of both Testaments, as exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all his Offices under the first; for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49846:108"/>
protection, direction and doing away of sin, in such an extraordinary way as all the other expedients of the Ceremonial Law could not come near. The Ark it self contained the Law of the ten words, which when the people had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.8.</note> saying, <hi>All that the Lord hath spoken we will do,</hi> it became a Covenant of Works to that people, and to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though a Rule and Obligation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Mankind, that should come to know it. And when God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that this should be laid up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in the Ark, and placed in the Holy of Holies; the Ark came to be called the Ark of the Covenant, or of Testimony.

               <p>But as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> speak about their Consubstantiation, that <hi>Christus vestitus,</hi> Christ clothed in the Elements, is there received by the worthy Communicant; so I doubt not but I may safely say, that <hi>Christus vestitus verbo suo,</hi> Christ clothed with his own Word, ever was and is the adequate Object of the Faith of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; wherein he was and is received to salvation, and to all other ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses whatsoever.

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>I think I have gone somewhat near to prove to indifferent men, that many of the Saints of the Old Testament had a greater insight into the main scope of the very promise about the person and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ, than diversmen might have thought before; and that they had the right use of their faith unto justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we have now. The only Point wherein it may seem that some may stick, is, whether in the multitude it was not a confused faith, and not distinct enough to be what ours must be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:49846:121"/>To this therefore it is to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That saving faith relyeth not on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one promise whatsoever (abstracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) by it self; nor yet that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises which are certainly to be believed are of use to all men: so that all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are of no more consequence unto us than unto them.</p>
               <p>Next it is to be remembred what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.20.</note> that <hi>all the promises of God in Christ are Yea, and in him Amen.</hi> So that how much or how little soever the Saints of the Old Testament embraced of the promises, they embraced of Christ, as implicitly contained in them: which wrought in them the like obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hope and perseverance as in us, so as to carry them beyond carnal things, to the things heavenly and spiritual. Which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> (again) elaborately proves to us, in the eleventh to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews; and that they looked more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Seed wherein all the Nations should be blessed,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.10, &amp;c.</note> and <hi>another Country and City, which hath foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God,</hi> than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Land of <hi>Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In fine, we shall find somewhat that is implicit in the best faith of any of ours; and if we shall consider how short that faith may be, which others of ours may have, (unto salvation t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o) and so compare it with theirs, we shall think the less strange of any thing that has been said of theirs before.</p>
               <p>Do we not all believe the Gospel, not knowing how much may be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it? Do we not engage ourselves in Baptism to obey, not knowing what shall be required of us? Like <hi>Abraham,</hi> who when he was called, obeyed, and went out, not knowing whither he went. Are we not in frequent doubts and fears both about the promises that we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace as we are able, and about our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to be ordered so that at last we may obtain them? Was it a weak faith in that Martyr, that went drooping to the Stake, not so much for fear of death, as for the pressure of desertion that then lay upon him? And yet he durst not recant to save all, (as they might think) both Soul and Body too. But the Spirit of Glory came upon him
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49846:122"/>
in an instant to bear him up above all. In fine, when we shall consider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ours that have some faith of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence (as we otherwise distinguish) and, in the judgment of Charity, do stand fair towards salvation in the end, are ignorant of the mystery of Christ, whom they profess; not knowing how to apply themselves to the mercies of God, through him alone, nor the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his merits, or benefit of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for them; in a word, nor th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For better were those of them who knew how to apply the mercies of God in Christ, not knowing the name of Christ; than such of ours as have heard the sound of the Gospel, and do not understand so much of the meaning of it, as they before.</p>

                  <q>Why would they see and hear? To wit, that they might perceive more clearly and largely that which they scarcely discerned, but slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and obscurely before.

               </p>
               <p>There remains nothing to be cleared more, but what is shadowed by the Veil of <hi>Moses,</hi> in the latter end of the last Objection: For if the Veil of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies was but thin, and the Prophecies so clear; why were all the Jews so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, especially the Disciples of our Lord himself, about any true or proper thing relating to <hi>Messias</hi> when he came?</p>
               <p>It hath been hinted before, that they generally knew how he was to be both the Son of God, and the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> to be born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and to be the greatest Prophet and King that they ever had. Now it is a further Question
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49846:124"/>
among the Schoolmen (to whom I may refer you) whether <hi>Moses</hi> knew more of the <hi>Messias</hi> to come than <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> more than both: and so on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of all the Prophets, home unto <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, even as his coming was the nearer. But I confess my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on carries me to think, That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ceasing after <hi>Malachi,</hi> and the <hi>Pharisees</hi> arising to repute under the first beginnings of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> (which will be noted in its place) and not long after combining with the Scribes to the corruption of the true Religion; that this mystery was on purpose veiled (more than before) by the Providence of God, and malice of the Instruments of Satan.</p>
               <p n="1">(I.) By God's Providence, who would have, the Restorer to appear in the worst of times.<note place="margin">Luke 18.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Could the Son of man then</hi> (any more than at his second Coming) <hi>find faith upon the Earth?</hi> If they had known him generally,<note place="margin">Acts 3.15.17.</note> durst the rest of them have <hi>crucified the Lord of life and glory?</hi> Wherefore when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> preached to their conviction, that they might not be driven to despair, but to repentance of such a sin; he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thus to insinuate with them, <hi>And
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49846:125"/>
now Brethren, I wot that through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ye did it, as also did your Rulers.</hi> And had not Christ suffered, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Glory, how could he have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Kingdom promised of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>So that left the Disciples themselves (that had been trained under the Paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogy of the Scribes and Pharisees) should become impertinent Hinderers of their Masters ways, if they had known to what they tended; the spiritual myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Christ were sparingly delivered to them before he suffered, and fully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was risen. Once, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had said unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 9.44, 45.</note> (somewhat to prepare them for a change) <hi>Let these sayings sink down into your ears; for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men; they understood not this saying, but it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 16.21, 22, 23.</note> And again, when <hi>Iesus began to shew unto his Disciples how he must suffer and be killed, and rise again the third day; Peter took him up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord; this shall not be unto thee.</hi> (for <hi>Peter</hi> meant to fight for him) <hi>But Iesus turned, and said unto Peter, Get

               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) As for the malice of Satan, and his Instruments. He himself could have no greater stratagem (so far as he could discern the tokens of Christ's coming, more than mortal men) than to blind their eyes before-hand that they might not know the day of their visitation; but that they might be defeated, and disappointed of all their perverted, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal expectations, and so become offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him to the death: In sine, that by the murder of the Son of God, he might bring many souls to Hell; and the ancient people and Church of God to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruine and destruction, as shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happened. And who knows but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan might understand the Prophecies of these things, and so set himself to work, as the readier instrument to bring them all about, as he desired?</p>
               <p>But for his Under-Instruments, they
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49846:126"/>
chiefly were the Scribes and Pharisees, whose corruptions our Saviour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bends himself to discover and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove on all occasions. And if you ask me, what could they do? I answer, they had in a long tract of time before, put such carnal glosses on the Scripture, out of their designs (sometimes against their own Princes, sometimes against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>; but always to get both gain and authority among the people of the <hi>Iews</hi>) that sitting in the Chair of <hi>Moses,</hi> as Expounders of the Law and of the Prophets; they utterly perverted the true sense and meaning thereof: and that especially about the <hi>Messias,</hi> who was generally expected (almost throughout the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and beyond it) when he came. And when he was come,<note place="margin">Matth. 2.4.</note> who should be enquired of but the Pharisees whether he was indeed the Christ, or no? And they generally deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; for the Character of his Person agreed not with their ancient Glosses, or their present ends or interests.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot omit what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Notions learned men have of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Rabbins, especially of such whose Writings remain as accounted written before our Lord was born, or shortly

               </p>
               <p>So that in the opinion of <hi>Cheminitius</hi> all the errours and perverseness of the ancient Pharisees are couched in the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud</hi> (which is one of the most ancient <hi>Iewish</hi> Books we have) The <hi>Talmud</hi> it self has been replenished and corrupted more than it was at first. All that is in it (howsoever) has given Rules and Bounds to all the <hi>Rabbins</hi> that have written since; from whence it follows, that we can hardly tell wherein to believe or trust the most applauded of them. They contradict the Scriptures (often) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of their own Customes, and one another no less; and if any man thinks to illustrate one part of a Text by some of their suggestions, he may be as apt to leave the other darker than before. In fine, the <hi>Iews</hi> of later times know what they know of their own Rites by learning only, and have ever had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Christians to study with them, and exceed them, as the more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gain such knowledge, and to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say such friends as they.

               <head>CHAP. XXXIV. Certain Corollary Rules preliminary to the answering of the first Objection. That <hi>Jacob</hi> sent his Sons to <hi>Joseph,</hi> as a foreign Prince, for a favour; but not unaccompanied; considering, 1. Their concern; 2. What weight of money they might take with them in so many Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, if only to lade ten Asses. 3. What the length and hazard of the way. The four next Objections briefly answered.</head>
               <p>TO the first good Rule, these others may be joined as succedaneous Corollaries. First, That the sense of the Scripture is its own authority, more than the Critical position of the words; warranted by several Quotations in the New Testament, out of the Old. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That necessary consequence is all one with the Text it self; neither was a good Inference ever sleighted. Thirdly, That in such Historical Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Scriptures as do veil (or are inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop'd with) a mystery, we are, in a manner,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.22, 23.</note> directed to a further indagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> where he tells us, (what
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49846:133"/>
else we should have hardly found) that one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Sons by a Bond-maid, and another by a free Woman, did by an Allegory exhibit to us the difference of state betwixt Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> and the New <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or betwixt the Law and Grace, Bondage and Liberty. Fourthly, That by comparing Passages, one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth best expound another. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which Preliminaries, I address my self to answer the first Objection, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answer to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. 1.</note> It is still to be remembered, that it is above two hundred and ten years since <hi>Abram</hi> armed three hundred and eighteen trained Servants born in his own house, to pursue the Kings that had taken <hi>Lot</hi> Prisoner: And if seventy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons only in two hundred and ten years (or thereabouts) might become such an incredible number, (as the possibility hath been demonstrated) what may we think of three hundred and eighteen more, in the same Family, Partakers of the like Blessings, so far as their encrease was the encrease of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s wealth and strenght? But (not to be entangled with too many difficulties) to think mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, <hi>Iacob</hi> could scarce have less than a thousand souls within his Tents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But why (then) did he send
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49846:134"/>
his ten Sons only, with their ten Asses, to buy Corn for them all? Could they bring enough? Or did they only bring for <hi>Iacob</hi>'s own Tent, and leave the rest to live on Roots, or Nuts and Almonds, with which (it seems, by the Present, that) the Land abounded?</p>
               <p>You must remember <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Dreams,<note place="margin">Gen 37.7, 9.</note> that <hi>their sheaves should do obeysance to his sheaf, and the Sun and the Moon and the eleven Stars</hi> also; and then you must consider his present state, and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Nations thereabouts.<note place="margin">Ch. 41.38.</note> 
                  <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> was advanced to be chief Minister of State under <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own advice, he was appointed to take up the fifth part of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for seven years together, of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, against seven other to ensue of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain famine, according to the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dream.<note place="margin">Ver. 54.</note> And when the famine came in all parts,<note place="margin">Ch. 42.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Iacob heard that there was Corn in Egypt (for Ioseph had gathered Corn as the sand of the Sea, very much, until he left numbring, for it was without number)</hi> but not to be had, save only from the hands of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or his chief Minister; and therefore (you may know) he sent his ten Sons (and not his Servants) to do their obeysance
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49846:134"/>
for Corn; But not without Attendance, as we may easily collect from divers cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances: as, 1. From the Concern that they had; 2. From the money that they carried with them; 3. From the hazard of the Journey, and the length there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>As for their Concern, they had every man his own Family, and did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eat in <hi>Iacob</hi>'s presence: Nor could they live on Nuts or Almonds any more than the <hi>Egyptians</hi> on their Fruits,<note place="margin">Gen. 47.19.</note> who were forced to sell their Lands, and their Persons too, to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that they might have Bread.</p>
               <p>For their money,<note place="margin">Ch. 43.35. Ver. 21. <hi>We opened our Sacks, and behold every man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For their Journey, it could be little less than two hundred miles directly from <hi>Hebron</hi> unto <hi>Caire</hi>: If they brought but each man an Ass-Load, what might they spend by the way? Or what might they have to divide amongst them when they came home? Certainly so little,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49846:135"/>
that there would have been no end of going or coming; whereas (by virtue of what they brought) they were able to subsist (it seems) a good while e're <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> could be prevailed with to venture <hi>Benjamin,</hi> though <hi>Simeon</hi> lay at stake till their return. And for the way, it was never to be passed without a lusty <hi>Caravan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 16.12.</note> for fear of the <hi>Ishmaelites,</hi> (of whose Progenitor it was said, That <hi>he should be a wild man, and that his hand should be against every man, and every mans hand against him</hi>) and the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who wanted Cornespecially.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Answer to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. 2.</note>And now the Answer is the easier to the second, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the search they went not so much by Pole, as by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, the Heads of which were the Leaders and the Purse-bearers for all the rest of their Retinue. And in <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s own Sack (as it was designed) the prize was found.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Answer to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. 3.</note>To the third, we answer, That if there were any Servants at all, there might be Asses enough, so that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters needed not to foot it back, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home with so slender provision, as is imagined. And if there were no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,<note place="margin">Chap. 45.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

also, without any one man (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) to assist them.</p>
               <p>It may seem rather by <hi>Iudah</hi>'s fear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the losing of the Asses that they were not a few,<note place="margin">Answer to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. 4.</note> than that his Father was poor; and for <hi>Iacob's</hi> Present, let it be compared with other Presents of the same time; nay,<note place="margin">1 Sam 25.18.</note> with <hi>Abigail</hi>'s a long time after, when one would think that she should have stretched to pacifie the wrath of <hi>David.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXXV. The last Objection answered, by shewing, That the circumcised Servants were part of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s household, that could not be parted withal, without loss, scandal and prejudice to the Church of God; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>1.</hi> Children of the faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. 2.</hi> Graffed into his Seed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarriages. <hi>3.</hi> Distinct in Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. <hi>4.</hi> Yet (possibly) some snare unto the Israelites, by retaining a smack of their old Idolatry.</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Answer to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. 6.</note>NOW I cannot be unsensible how loth some will be to admit many rude Herdsmen (who were still apt to be at debate with their Neighbours) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, the only Church of God; lest it should be prophaned by them, and prove an interruption to the promise: yet I must needs shew them that these were no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens from the Commonwealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> but were really constitutive members of that growing Body.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I think it will not be questioned but that these were part of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s house or houshold, who dwelt in the Tents

of <hi>Iacob</hi>: and then it is expresly said,<note place="margin">Gen 46.1, 31, &amp;c.</note> that <hi>Israel took his journey with all that he had. And Ioseph said unto his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and unto his Fathers house,</hi> (distinct from them) <hi>I will go up, and say unto Pharaoh, My Brethren and my Fathers house, which were in the Land of Canaan, are come unto me. And the men are Shepherds; for their trade hath been to feed Cattel, and they have brought their Flocks and their Herds</hi> (more than twelve men could manage) <hi>and all that they have, that ye may dwell in the Land of Goshen,</hi> which was a fertile Tract a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the mouth of the <hi>Nile,</hi> or the tongue of the Red Sea, nearest unto <hi>Canaan,</hi> and neglected by the <hi>Egyptians.

                  <hi>And Ioseph placed his Father and his Brethren in the best of the Land, in the Land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. And he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished them and all his Fathers houshold with bread, according to their Families.</hi> Which shews that some of the Servants also were of some account, and had

their own Families, enough to people the rest of <hi>Goshen</hi>: So that <hi>Ioseph</hi> wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept them at a distance from the sight of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for fear of State-jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</p>

                  </gap>s it lawful for <hi>Iacob</hi> or his Sons to turn them off, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon them. For their Circumcision was an indelible Character; so that it would have been a reproach to <hi>Israel</hi> to have exposed any of his unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, or to have cast them into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of revolting to Idolatry, after once they had been joined to the Church by the sign and seal of the righteousness of faith, even of the same faith with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in whose Seed all the Nations of the Earth were to be blessed; and these (in particular) as the first-fruits of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Children of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Heirs of the better part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; and not excluded from their lots in the other part neither, as we trust to shew hereafter. Neither was there need to put off these for any misdemeanour, since every Head of an house had power of life and death, and other punishments, and that without appeal to the Supreme,<note place="margin">Gen. 38.24.</note> as is manifest in the Case of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Tamar,</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:49846:137"/>
when it was told <hi>Iudah,</hi> that she was with Child of whoredom; saith he, <hi>Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.</hi> And though specious things are said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ancient use of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church;<note place="margin">Videsis Bertr. cap. 2. &amp; <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>'s Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, Book 5. chap. 2. Exod. 4.24.</note> yet it seems to me, that hitherto (and long after) there was no cutting off from the people, but by death: wherefore an Angel met <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> with a drawn Sword, and sought to have slain him, for his neglect of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising of his Child.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor let any one admire at this that follows. They became the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi> by a kind of adoption or insition into the Stock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by marrying of the Daughters of <hi>Israel</hi>; and so, in course of time, they became one Kindred with them. For who should they give them to besides?<note place="margin">Gen. 34.15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>We cannot give our Sister to one that is uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised</hi> (said the Sons of <hi>Iacob</hi>) <hi>for that were a reproach unto us. But if ye will be as we be, then will we give our Daughters unto you, and take your Daughters unto us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.</hi> Trouble not your self about disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for they were <hi>bene nati,</hi> well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, who were born in the same house;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49846:138"/>
emancipate also (<hi>tanquam liberi aut li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berti</hi>) by Circumcision, and they lived all upon one Stock, so that there could not be any want amongst them. But the truth is, the dignity of Degree and Pedegree went to the prime Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents male, from the Loins of the twelve Patriarchs of <hi>Israel</hi>; which may seem to be the true reason why we find in the Genealogies such an account as this,<note place="margin">Numb. 26.35.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. These are the Sons of Ephraim</hi> (for instance of one) <hi>after their families, of Shuthelah, the family of the Shuthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hites; of Bacher, the family of the Bach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites; of Taban, the family of the Taba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>— And the rest are numbred in gross only, to be in all thirty two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, and six hundred Families. But the Patriarchs themselves were put to harder shift for Wives (even unto tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass) because they could not take their Sisters, or go any more to their Unkles houses to be matched, as <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> had done before. It remaineth (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that these Hinds, Husbandmen,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.2.</note> or Stewards (such as <hi>Eliezer</hi> was to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>) were far from being Supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraries, or Aliens from the Covenant, or Church of God; and that they never went out of it after once they were
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49846:138"/>
called or brought in, and joined to it by the sign of Circumcision.</p>
               <p>Only this may be doubted, <hi>viz.</hi> That these people (taken out of <hi>Chaldea, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Arabia,</hi> or any other parts) and joined only by Circumcision, (some of them (no doubt) by compulsion, lest others should be cut off for them) might not prove so good Members as could be wished; but they retained still a smack, and had an hankering after their old Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Which sin continued uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably amongst all, (one seducing another) till the captivity of the Tribes: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their return, when <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> forced the <hi>Edomites</hi> to be circumcised, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a way for <hi>Herod</hi> to come and to subvert their whole Estate. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was for that, God himself fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw these inconveniences; and yet he would not prevent them: as some of the Separation think they are able to do in their Societies, by so often drilling of them, that at last they lose their first matter, order and consistency.</p>

Which it is not like that he should carry about him, with other necessaries, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you should imagine him to have been a kind of Walking-Tavern in a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

                  <hi>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy Servant; for with my Staff I passed over this Iordan, and now I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come two Bands.</hi> 
                  <q>With a Staff (saith Bishop <hi>Hall</hi>) goes he over <hi>Iordan,</hi> doubtful and alone, (not like the Son of <hi>Isaac</hi>) and is fain to lye <hi>sub dio,</hi> when an Angel appeared to comfort him. And when <hi>Laban</hi> heard of his Sisters Son, he might expect a like E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage as fetch'd <hi>Rebekkah</hi>— but now as he comes, so he uses him. He fled from a cruel Brother to a cruel Unkle: And as his Mother had cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly (by deceiving <hi>Isaac</hi>) substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for Elder; so now <hi>Laban</hi> as cunningly deceiveth him, by giving him the Elder instead of the Younger, whom he loved.</q> Wonder not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Equipage of the Sons of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and of their whole descent into

                  <hi>Egypt,</hi> is described without any pomp at all; for so I could lead you forward to <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Threshing-floor, and to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Flocks; and shew you how great thing were always veiled, and good men lowly: But these also were both of the principal Families of <hi>Israel,</hi> as may be observed hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, considering that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was a great Courtier, and a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician; and that we have observed his cunning in getting the fairest and fertil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Tract of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for his Father and his Brethren, on colour of their being Shepherds: In the next place let us note some of his Ceremonies (howsoever) whereby he wrought the ingratiating of his own Kindred with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 42.</note>When his Brethren came first into his presence (he knowing them, but they not him) <hi>they bowed down themselves before him, with their faces to the Earth</hi>; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what kind of reverence the proud <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> did expect. <hi>Then Ioseph remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the dreams which he had dreamed of them,</hi> and like a crafty Statesman (to get what he could out of them, and to make them fit for what he presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended) he spake roughly to them,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49846:141"/>
and dealt as hardly, keeping them three days in ward, and speaking to them by an Interpreter; nay, he took <hi>Simeon</hi> from them as a Pledge, and bound him before their eyes, and sent them away (the first time) in fear.</p>
               <p>But the next time,<note place="margin">Gen. 43.</note> as soon as <hi>Ioseph</hi> spied <hi>Benjamin</hi> in their Company, <hi>he said to the Ruler of his house, Bring these men into my house, and slay, and make ready</hi> (a place that will trouble them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, who would perswade us, as if the <hi>Egyptians</hi> then did eat no living Creature) <hi>for these men shall dine with me at noon. Then he brought Simeon forth unto them</hi> (who, no doubt, looked ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the worse for his detainment) <hi>And they made ready the Present against Ioseph came in, and made many low obeysances</hi>; but he spake very kindly to them.</p>
               <p>Then that <hi>Ioseph</hi> might reserve Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to himself in the sight of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he caused himself to be served at a Table of State; and that there might be no interfering, he caused his Brethren (knowing their scruples about eating of unclean meats, or with uncircumcised men) to be served at another Table by themselves: And knowing also the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> (who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49846:142"/>
upon the <hi>Hebrews</hi> as prophane to them, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> could be unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> if they did not also scorn them as Shepherds) he caused them to eat in the same presence apart; so that all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and there was no exception: but they drank and were merry, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> had ordered the matter; and, no doubt, obtained favour with such <hi>Egyptian</hi> Courtiers as there were then admitted at the entertainment.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 46.28.</note>Now when <hi>Iacob</hi> drew near unto <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shen,</hi> he thought it a fit Ceremony, for his part, to send <hi>Iudah</hi> before (as his Harbinger) to prepare for his reception by his Son <hi>Ioseph,</hi> in the state wherein he then was. And <hi>Ioseph</hi> hastened in his Chariot (to meet him as a Prince) and to do honour to his aged Father. And so instructed all his Company how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves before <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But since policy did require that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> should not see all, civility and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude seemed to prompt <hi>Ioseph</hi> that he should present (at least) the chief of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s beneficiaries before his face; and he thought it enough to present but five of them to do or to receive that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. It is like, the most personable and fashionable of his Brethren, that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49846:142"/>
were the Sons of <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> rather than of the Concubines; who, we are not to doubt, made their reverence unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as the Master of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Ceremonies should direct them.</p>
               <p>But as for his venerable Father, he brought him in, (after them, which was ever esteemed the more honour) <hi>and set him before Pharaoh.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 47.7, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>And Iacob bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Pharaoh,</hi> (after his own way, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Prince, and Priest of the most High God, or as a congratulation only of his favours.) And so when he went out (after short communication by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters) he blessed him again. And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> accepted of their addresses, and seems to have been pleased and satisfied with them.</p>
               <p>Thus was the way made for <hi>Israel</hi> and his Children, to be planted in <hi>Rameses,</hi> (which I take to be a fenced place, with a Territory, situate upon the jaws of the seven-mouth'd <hi>Nile</hi>) and for his Hinds and Herdsmen to pitch where they liked in the Province of <hi>Goshen,</hi> So the former of these needed Tents no longer; for when <hi>Ioseph</hi> sent for them, he had said from <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s mouth,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Come unto me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt. Regard not your

               <p>'Tis true, the place might be called <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meses,</hi> by anticipation, as that which was called <hi>Luz,</hi> was after called <hi>Bethel,</hi> by <hi>Iacob</hi>'s nomination; but that there was an habitable Town or City before <hi>Iacob</hi> came thither, I doubt not; both because of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s recommendation of his father to a good place, and because of the situation of it, as a necessary For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress against Out-livers of another Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. However, some are of opinion, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> themselves might build that City (as the <hi>English</hi> did <hi>Calais</hi>) while they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 1.11.</note> (before the Task-masters set them to work to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it more, as a Treasure-City, and a Bridle to themselves, from escaping, as well as to keep out others) against com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sence; for throughout their prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they were instructed that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was their inheritance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting (daily) as good a Call to return out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as ever they had to come thither.

                  <hi>I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again?</hi> And said not <hi>Ioseph</hi> on his death-bed unto his Brethren,<note place="margin">Gen. 50.24.</note>

That he lived by faith, like <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi>; yet the want of Ordinances such a trouble to him as to <hi>David.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. IF any one admire how <hi>Ioseph</hi> could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> live so many years, first, in <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi>'s, and then in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s house, so as to escape the <hi>Egyptian</hi> idolatry or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions; they may observe, that he was noted in both places to have a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Spirit in him than the Magicians; and so to have been left the more to himself in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> (after) was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> till a particular charge was brought against him concerning his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Nay,<note place="margin">Gen. 44.18. &amp; 45.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s being <hi>as Pharaoh and a Father unto Pharaoh</hi> (after he came to Court) exempted him from any jurisdiction or inspection whatsoever; for who durst say unto <hi>Pharaoh, What dost thou</hi>?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:49846:149"/>2. If it be further questioned, What private Religion <hi>Ioseph</hi> could have unto himself, or what exercise or practice of it, in the house of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>? Could he have any private Altar? Or, if he had, any one to serve at that Altar, or to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship at it, besides himself? Or, could he have any Closets adorned with the Reliques of <hi>Noah, Sem, Eber, Abraham, &amp;c</hi> or any other holy things? or what did he do? I answer,</p>
               <p>First, He did as his Father <hi>Iacob</hi> had done before in the idolatrous house of <hi>Laban</hi>; where I cannot think that he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had or needed any Altar, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumstances of devotion. In his way to whose house (notwithstanding) <hi>he set up the stone that he used as a pillow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 28.28.</note> 
                  <hi>for a pillar, and poured Oil upon the top of it, and called the name of the place Bethel,</hi> that is, the house of God; vowing that it should be so to him, if God should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him safe to his Father's house, and that he would offer the tenth unto him, of all that God should give him; as if he would make that Stone an Altar, and that place such a place of worship, as <hi>Gilgal</hi> and <hi>Shiloh</hi> after were. But this Pillar (you see) was erected <hi>pro futuro</hi> only.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:49846:149"/>Secondly, Yet I doubt not but <hi>Ioseph</hi> might have erected an Altar of testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or thanksgiving, or for Peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (at the least) as others did upon special occasions, (before and after the Law) even till the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if such occasion were. But we read not of it; peradventure God would not suffer his own name to be prophaned by setting up an abomination to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> before their faces, nor <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s service, to be prejudiced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. For although the Father of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the ordinary Priest of his own house; yet any man apart (as <hi>Iacob</hi>) might erect an Altar, and offer his thanksgivings thereupon, using such as he had about him like so many <hi>Levites</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all sanctified by the Sacrifice, if the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Altar and the Sacrifice were right.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If <hi>Ioseph</hi> had any outward part of Devotion to accomplish, it may be he might have found some (of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers) not unmeet to be assisting to him.<note place="margin">Gen. 42.18.</note> For in his handling of his Brethren (while they took him for an <hi>Egyptian</hi>) <hi>he said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the third day, This do and live; for I fear God</hi>: As if he would have them think no other, but that there was some
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49846:150"/>
piety in <hi>Egypt</hi> as well as amongst them whom he knew. And when they made Apology unto the Steward of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s house about their money, the Steward said unto them,<note place="margin">Gen. 43.19, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Peace be to you, fear not: your God, the God of your Father hath given you treasure in your Sacks, I had your money.</hi> As if this Steward could speak the language of <hi>Israel,</hi> and was not unacquainted with the God of <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It may seem that <hi>Ioseph</hi> worshipped God with the like respect to his Fathers house, and the Sacrifices of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered there; and with the like respect unto the Land of promise, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when he opened his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow towards the Temple, and prayed for the restitution that was promised: in the mean while they were both abridged of the outward Ordinances, and lived by their faith in the promises of God. We have spoken enough of <hi>Daniel</hi> before; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> is as clear for <hi>Ioseph</hi> when he saith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.22.</note> 
                  <hi>By faith Ioseph when he was a dying made mention of the departing of the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones</hi>; reckoning him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest, <hi>who through faith obtained a good report, not having yet received the promise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:49846:150"/>Fifthly, Nay, by the History it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that as <hi>Moses by faith when he was come to years refused to be called the Son of Pharaohs Daughter, esteeming the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt</hi>; so it had fared with <hi>Ioseph</hi> before. All the pleasures of that Heathen Court, and all the submissions of that Heathen People, infused no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther satisfaction into his spirit, but that he must be contented (that he might be Protector of <hi>Israel</hi>) to abide without, as an Alien from his Fathers house, and to be deprived of the holy Ordinances of God: For when he was about to dye,<note place="margin">Gen. 50.24.</note> he said unto his Brethren, <hi>I dye, and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this Land</hi> (of bondage, where I have been detained and afflicted with you, in expectation of the promise made unto our Fathers) <hi>unto the Land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob: God will surely visit you</hi>; and he took an Oath of them about carrying his bones from thence. Nor was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his worst Quarters when he said, <hi>Wo is me that I sojourn in Mesech,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 120.5.</note> 
                  <hi>that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though good men may be saved without the Ordinances, where God himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrs

them; yet they cannot live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably without them: Which they may do well to consider, who (if they have but a reasonable excuse for it) had as lief be planted in the utmost <hi>Indies,</hi> as in the midst of Churches. So we see what union <hi>Ioseph</hi> held in his separation both with the Church Catholick of all Believers, and also with the house of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> in particular.</p>

And so for Election; Whereas S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> gives us ground for two distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons uncontroulable, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Election both of Jew and Gentile, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the state of Grace, by believing of the Gospel, answering to the Election of the Jews alone (from the times of the Law) unto special Covenant and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge. 2. Of a certain Election of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (not so large as the other) unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, according to the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God. This hath occasioned the Schoolmen and the modern Polemical Divines (by scanning of the terms, and sisting what might be drawn from them) to come in with a distinction between (like a kind of superfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tation) of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Election absolute or conditional (for of the general Election of some people more than others unto special means, they dare not question over boldly; or enter farther into this Secret of Providence, than Travellers dare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Stove of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ew, the Question is not so much, Whether it be without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as without respect of sin? If there be a particular Election of persons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally only; then, Whether Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hangeth in suspense? or, being from eternity, proceedeth according to God's foreknowledge (<hi>vel saltem per scientiam mediam</hi>) with a respect to his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, according to works foreseen, of merits condign or congruous, (as the Schoolmen speak) or according to faith or Evangelical obedience (at the least) foreseen and foreknown; which pleaseth some of ours well enough, though they have much difficulty and difference in the explaining of their meanings?

               <p>BUT the failing of <hi>Iudah</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tamar</hi> (if it were not greater) might yet seem more unlucky of the two, and more prejudicial in the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence unto the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> than the other; inasmuch as two misbegotten Children came thereby to be reckoned to the ruling Tribe of <hi>Israel,</hi> and not only to have equal part with others, but to have inheritance from <hi>Iudah,</hi> all alike with <hi>Shelah.</hi> Doth God abhor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest and adultery, and yet suffer the choicest Blessings of all to descend to their Issue? Or how is it that <hi>David</hi> and Christ should come to descend from this <hi>Pharez,</hi> rather than from <hi>Shelah?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:49846:160"/>Now about the first failing of <hi>Iudah</hi> we may say, That if <hi>Iacob</hi> had had the power of the blessing in his own hands (as he had not) it was not exception e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough against him to put him by; nor in the streights wherein they were, can one be sure that there were no more strange Wives within the Tents of <hi>Iacob,</hi> but only <hi>Shuah</hi>'s Daughter. However, God was pleased to take the punishment of <hi>Iudah</hi>'s fault home unto himself, and he brought it home to <hi>Iudah</hi>; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Shelah</hi> was, he gave him but three Sons in all, two of which he permitted to be such wicked <hi>Canaanites</hi> as were not to be born withal; so that the Lord himself slew them, and in the stead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made him father other two, which he least intended.</p>
               <p>But on second thoughts, neither was the latter fault so great as the first, nor the consequence so bad as you imagine.</p>
               <p>See what an Acquaintance had <hi>Iudah</hi> gotten by wandring away from the Tents of <hi>Israel,</hi> and searching out for some good house or other wherein to solace and caress himself;<note place="margin">Gen. 38.1.</note> 
                  <hi>He turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.</hi> And he, it seems, as having a design upon his Friend (so called) hold
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:49846:161"/>
him unto <hi>Shuah</hi>'s Daughter, with whom <hi>Iudah</hi> was taken in his vagary. Which friendship (howsoever) continued till after her death, (good men being sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome forward to shake off even their Back-friends:) So that <hi>Hirah,</hi> being with him to comfort him, was as ready to help him at another turn, (even as lewd Suburbers delight to draw in Country-men into the Stews) and to wait for him (like a Pander) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his prank, while he suffered him (rather than himself) to go aside unto a seeming Harlot: and when <hi>Iudah</hi> came back, to carry a Kid for him unto the Woman, to redeem <hi>Iudah</hi>'s pledges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was ashamed to send by any but a Stranger. So that <hi>Iudah</hi> seems to have continued still under the same or like temptations, as long as he retaineth this acquaintance. And it is by his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that we must endeavour to excuse him; whereof this Heathen <hi>Hirah</hi> was the first.</p>
               <p>Then we must consider, that it was but simple fornication, upon surprize (and without design) that <hi>Iudah</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himself to be drawn in by; whereas his marriage was a setled reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. And that God suffered him to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:49846:161"/>
be thus betrayed (punishing one sin by another, and the consequences of it) for his injustice in denying his third Son <hi>Shelah</hi> unto <hi>Tamar</hi>; which he was bound to do by a known Law amongst them: Or for his distrust in God, lest he should take away <hi>Shelah</hi> for doing his Duty, as he had done the other two for wickedness.</p>
               <p>Add to this the subtilty of <hi>Tamar</hi> (who was a Free-woman of <hi>Israel,</hi> by her marriage unto <hi>Er</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Iudah,</hi> whatsoever she was before) that knew where the soft place was in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>'s Head, and meant to be meet with him, inasmuch as she had been of a long time wronged, and saw no other likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of redress but this: for the Law (as we may learn more clearly by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of it) was this,<note place="margin">Deut. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>viz. If Brethren dwell together, and one of them dye, and have no Child, the Wife of the dead shall not marry without, unto a Stranger; her Husband's Brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to Wife, and perform the duty of an Husband's Brother unto her. And it shall be, that the first-born which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his Brother, which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:49846:162"/>The Law (then) obliging <hi>Tamar</hi> to live within, under a Widow's guise, and not to marry without, but expect; she had (indeed) <hi>Onan</hi> given to her; but he hating to <hi>raise up Seed unto his Brother</hi> (more than to lye with a taking Woman) <hi>spilt his Seed upon the ground,</hi> thinking (it may be) after that to go into fruitless dalliance.<note place="margin">Gen. 38.10.</note> 
                  <hi>And the thing displeased the Lord, so that he slew him also</hi> after his Brother <hi>Er.</hi> The reason of <hi>Onan</hi>'s sin is to be understood, <hi>viz.</hi> Because he would have the eldest Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Right extinct, and be eldest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; whereas if he had begotten a Son on <hi>Tamar,</hi> even that Son should have carried the birth-right from him. And when <hi>Tamar</hi> had remained still a shady Widow, in hope of <hi>Shelah,</hi> and she saw that he was grown, and not given to her, she began not only to despair of an Husband, but of an interest in the house of <hi>Iudah,</hi> which ought not to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her: It was the least of her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (therefore) to play the Harlot, whatever <hi>Iudah</hi> meant; for being sped by him, she put on her Widows Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments again, and betook herself to her former place. So that she may seem no more to blame than an honest Woman,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:49846:162"/>
that puts her self into an Harlots place, and so defrauds her own Husband.</p>
               <p>Ay, but the Law was, That the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and not the Father-in-Law should raise up Seed unto the first Husband, How then can <hi>Tamar</hi> be excused for tempting, and lying with the Father?</p>
               <p>We must not take <hi>Tamar</hi> for a scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Casuist, (though she meant not to be an Harlot, but contained ever after, as it is most likely <hi>Iudah</hi> did, of whose refraining there in mention, but of his marrying again we read not) but for an interested, wronged Person, that sought to right herself the best she could: For if she conceived, she should be wrapped up in the inheritance of her Issue, which <hi>Iudah</hi> could not abandon; or if not, yet <hi>Iudah</hi> could not wrong her any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But take the Case as it will bear: For a Brother to lye with his Brothers Wife or Widow, in any other Case than this, is incest; And it is no more incest in the Father-in-Law, so far as touching of bloud is intended (for the Father-in-Law has no more blood in his Son's Wife that never conceived) than in the Brother: There is only the reverence of Descent, that is more. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49846:163"/>
of another Descent (<hi>viz.</hi> of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) being the reason of the Law that allows the dispensation, it is the less wonder that <hi>Tamar</hi> should lay aside the respect of reverence only to a Father, that would hold her still under greater wrong, unless she laid this Veil aside, and put another on: which is all that I have to say for her.</p>
               <p>But as for <hi>Iudah,</hi> as his soul hated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest, so neither was he guilty of it (in the least) as he was beguiled. And though his two Sons <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zarah</hi> were misbegotten (by mistake) on <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>; yet they were not base-born, but came by due Right into their Father <hi>Er</hi>'s Lot, as much as if <hi>Shelah</hi> had begotten them, who ought to have endeavoured it: So that <hi>Iudah</hi> (by God's permission) did but supply his Son's place as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his with-holding him. And when God had pardoned all this to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> neither his Father, nor his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren eyed him the worse; but God himself prospered him the more: For whereas his Brethren had all more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than he, when they came to be numbred, at their going out of <hi>Egypt, Iudah</hi> had seventy four thousand,<note place="margin">Numb. 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49846:163"/>
and upwards, whereas no other Tribe could come within ten thousand of His.</p>
               <p>If all this doth not satisfie, let us hear the pious Bishop a little further:<note place="margin">Bish. <hi>Hall</hi>'s Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Thamar.</hi>

                  <q>I find not many of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Sons more faulty than <hi>Iudah,</hi> who yet is singled out from all the rest to be the Royal Progenitor of Christ, and to be honoured with the dignity of the birth-right, that God's Election might not be of merit.

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE You were pleas'd to request my poor assistance in the soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the following Question, to shew my readiness to serve You, I set my self about it: I confess, at first I expected nothing but dry A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical matter to work upon; but upon farther consideration, I found the Subject You had given me, of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive nature than so, fit to be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with other more useful considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49846:165"/>
and capable of a more noble im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement than I am able to bestow upon it; yet such as that is, here You have it. Your Question is this,</p>
            <p>How from seventy Males only,<note place="margin">Gen. 46.47.</note> in no longer space than two hundred and ten years,<note place="margin">Deut. 10.22.</note> (as your Chronologer reckons) wherein the Israelites sojourned in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> there could be produc'd at their first numbring in the Wilderness no less than six hundred and three thousand,<note place="margin">Numb. 1.46. &amp; 3.39.</note> five hundred and fifty, from twenty years old and upwards, besides the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> which amounted to two and twenty thousand Males, from a Month old and upwards; and how the probability of this may be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so as to stop the mouths of such as <hi>Porphyry</hi> and <hi>Celsus,</hi> without refuge to a vast multitude of Twins, or a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous continuance of the power of generation in that people more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, of which we have no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in prophane Writers?</p>
            <p>To this I doubt not but to return such an Answer as shall satisfie any reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, and your self in particular; and having done that, I think I shall have done all that You expected from me, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the silencing such as are of <hi>Celsus</hi>'s
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49846:165"/>
and <hi>Porphyry</hi>'s Creed in this matter; if such as they may properly be said to have any Creed, whose Faith revers'd, consists in disbelieving.</p>
            <p>Nor is this the only good effect of such undertakings, (if duly perform'd) For although Christians, believing the holy Scriptures to be from God who cannot lye, do generally take God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's word for the truth of those things that are there revealed, without a strict scrutiny and examination of the things themselves; yet if after assent given to the holy Scriptures as the word of God, those amongst them who are qualified with abilities, especially such as Your Self who serve at the Altar, and whose lips preserve knowledge, do search and dive into the particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of any thing there related, of an unusual and surprizing nature, such as this seems to be at first view; and when upon such search, the thing appears upon rational grounds, not only possible but, very likely to be effected: This not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puts to silence the ignorance of fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish men, but highly confirms Believers themselves in their most holy faith, and encourages them on other occasions to acquiesce and rely intirely on the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49846:166"/>
truth of God's word, when their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited finite faculties cannot fathom the reasons either of the thing or Command revealed.</p>
            <p>Without any farther Preface there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Give me leave, Sir, to affirm, That in the matter before us there is no need of flying to an extraordinary multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Twins; I say, Extraordinary; for there is no reason to exclude it in the ordinary course of nature, because we see it frequently happen amongst our selves, and I believe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> might be more frequent among the Israelites, even from natural causes, such as the simplicity of their Diet above ours, and the more fertile pregnancy of that Climate, where Nature is more perfect, and better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested by the nearer approach of the Sun who quickneth all things, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by Philosophers to have a peculiar influence in the work of generation; insomuch that it passes for an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled Maxim amongst them, and a kind of <hi>Postulatum,</hi> that <hi>Sol &amp; homo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hominem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as little need is there of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous power of Generation, unless we will multiply miracles unnecessarily, by styling every eminent Blessing by that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49846:166"/>
Title, which is sent in performance of a promise; then indeed the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of this people would pass for a miracle of the first rank: For never was any promise oftener reiterated than this, as if the Benediction vied in proportion and analogy to the nature of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it self, which consisted in number. Had the Israelitish Women been all old <hi>Sarahs,</hi> nay had they been young <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chels</hi> or <hi>Rebeccahs,</hi> and their Husbands confin'd to them, nothing less than a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle could have done it: But as it is, it holds no higher denomination than that of a very great Blessing, which I look upon as a <hi>medium</hi> betwixt the ordinary course of Nature and a Miracle, and much nearer of kin to the former than the latter; because there is nothing in it either <hi>praeter</hi> or <hi>contra Naturam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The several promises of encrease be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, being the foundation whereon I shall build my Superstructure, it will not be amiss to take a transient view of some of them, and the wording of them; where we shall find a most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable exuberancy, good measure, press'd down, and running over; such as these, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.16. <hi>I will make thy seed,</hi> says God to <hi>Abraham, as the dust of the earth:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49846:167"/>
so that if a man can number of dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</hi> Gen. 15.5. <hi>And</hi> God <hi>brought</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>forth abroad, and said, Look now towards Heaven, and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them; So shall thy seed be.</hi> Gen. 22.16, 17. <hi>By my self have I sworn, saith the Lord, That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the Sea-shore.</hi> And although we may think that this promise was partly made good in <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s other Sons, and also in <hi>Esau</hi>; from all which great Nations were descended: yet that is a mistake, for although they did seem materially to make good these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of encrease, yet formally they did not, <hi>quatenus</hi> a promise; but they were thrown in by God <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and on the account of other bye promises, such as that to <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. and were mere <hi>Anomala's</hi> in respect of the main Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.12. <hi>For in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac shall thy seed be called:</hi> To whom the Promise is renewed in Person, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.3, 4. <hi>I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy Father, and I will make thy seed to multiply as the Stars
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49846:167"/>
of Heaven.</hi> Then the same promise is renewed again (twice) to <hi>Iacob,</hi> not to <hi>Esau, Gen.</hi> 35.11. where God u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers it in with this remarkable Preface, <hi>I am God Almighty,</hi> and therefore able to perform what I promise in spight of all opposition from Men or Devils: The Promise it self runs thus, <hi>Be fruitful and multiply; a Nation and company of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shall be of thee.</hi> Where the first part is but a repetition of the Blessing given to <hi>Adam</hi> for peopling the whole World at first, and afterwards to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons for re-peopling it, when it had been destroyed by the Floud; as if little <hi>Goshen</hi> were to be equivalent to the whole World besides: at least, it was to be God's Nursery or Seed-plot, where he raised almost his full number of Stocks, and only transplants them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Canaan,</hi> insomuch that if they had continued but twenty years longer in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they would have encreased to a greater number in that short space than they did in four hundred seventy three years that they were in the Wilderness and <hi>Canaan,</hi> as I shall demonstrate. So that it was <hi>Egypt</hi> where all these several promises, as to number, do chieftly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate at last and discharge themselves,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49846:168"/>
as all the Rivers do into the Ocean: And this appears farther yet from the last of all these Promises, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.3. <hi>Fear not, Iacob, to go down into Egypt: for I will THERE make of thee a great Nation.</hi> Which Promise is limited to the time of the Israelites sojourning in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and is exactly contemporary with the two hundred and ten years in the Question now handled: So that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of God himself was highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to see this Promise performed within that compass of time: and when once that is expired, then they who were preserv'd before, intire as it were in the hollow of his hand (as I shall make appear at large) were delivered up to several wasting judgments in the Wilderness, such as the Earth opening her mouth to swallow up the two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty <note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 16.2, 3, 5.</note> Princes of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, famous in the Congregation, men of renown, their Wives <note n="‖" place="margin">Ver. 27.</note> and their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ones, and all that appertain'd <note n="†" place="margin">Ver. 33.</note> or adher'd to them in that revolt; besides this, they are smitten with four several Plagues of Pestilence, and in several Battels great numbers fall by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Swords. And <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.6. <hi>The Lord sent fiery Serpents among the people,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49846:168"/>
who bit them: so that much people of Israel dyed.</hi> And that mighty power which was wholly employed for their preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion during the two hundred and ten years of their abode in <hi>Egypt,</hi> is, after their delivery thence, employed to their destruction on several provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from their sins, <hi>When Iesurun waxed sat and kicked</hi>; whereas their miserable and afflicted condition in <hi>Egypt</hi> was a means from God of making them more humble, and therefore more fit for the Divine protection, till such time as he had made good that promise to <hi>Iacob</hi> before recited, <hi>Fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will there make of thee a great Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides these several promises to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> we read <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16. that when the last of these upon his death-bed, adopting <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi> for his own, transferr'd this Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon them also, saying, <hi>Let them grow into a multitude,</hi> the Margin reads it, <hi>As Fishes do encrease</hi>; and that You will allow, Sir, to be even faster than by Twins. Their great Sacrament also of Circumcision <hi>in partibus genitalibus,</hi> I take to be a most proper <hi>Memorandum</hi> and Token of this Promise of encrease.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49846:169"/>
But although this Promise had never been made, nor Circumcision instituted; yet would it be but reasonable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, That that Primitive Blessing, <hi>Be fruitful and multiply,</hi> which was given in the Garden, should have a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent accomplishment in God's own enclosure the Church, than amongst His and His Church's Enemies; especially considering the Circumstances of the Jewish Church and people, that they were to subdue Nations great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before they could be setled in the promised <hi>Canaan:</hi> And when they were setled there, they were environ'd with Nations round about, like a Garden in the midst of a Forest of wild Beasts, who would be continually breaking in upon them to devour them, if God had not proportioned their numbers to a competency of defence and resistance, and the whole Church would have wanted that Priviledge and Blessing, which was the lot of many private Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>viz.</hi> Not to be ashamed when she spake with her Enemies in the Gate.</p>
            <p>Having spoken of the Promise, the next thing will be, to consider the means of its accomplishment; which I take to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49846:169"/>
be two especially: The first is, The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Concubines; which they could not cashier without differing from the examples of their Ancestors. And doubtless that Custom which was introduced at first by <hi>Lamech,</hi> was not only connived at (but encouraged by God's appearing to <hi>Hagar,</hi> and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing so bountifully in the behalf of <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael, Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11.) in order to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Promise of Encrease in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and in God's appointed time, and in imitation of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> did that Nation retain that Custom, not only in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but even till <hi>Shiloh</hi> came. I shall confirm the truth of this by two or three Quotations only, out of the learned <hi>Selden, De Iure Naturali Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> &amp;c. where he cites <hi>Maimonides</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Fas est cui<expan>

               <hi>Selden</hi> in the same Chap. 7. Book 5. quotes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Augustine</hi> saying, <hi>Prolis gratiâ Patres sanctos ex Abraham &amp; ante Abraham, quibus Deus, quòd ei placuerint, perhibet testimonium, usos fuisse conjugibus, neminem oportet du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitare Christianum, quando quibusdam e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam singulis plures habere concessum est, ubi ratio fuit prolis multiplicandae, non variandae appetitio voluptatis.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are so over-run with <hi>Grotius</hi> in <hi>England</hi> of late years, that nothing will go down with our modish Divines but what <hi>Grotius</hi> has chew'd for them; and if He does but say it, down it goes, right or wrong; insomuch that they can no more write without <hi>Grotius, Grotius,</hi> than a Carmelite Nun can drop her Beads without exhibiting particular devotion to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> her pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Patroness, the Lady of Mount <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi>; I therefore refer You to his Second Book and Fifth Chapter <hi>de Iure Belli ac Pacis,</hi> where he speaks to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Selden</hi>'s Rabbies. And if it were both lawful and commendable to have secondary Wives of Concubines,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49846:170"/>
it is not to be doubted but that it was generally practised, though the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures speak but little of it; because there is but little occasion to speak of any Concubines. In the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Judges</hi> there is a Relation concerning a Levite, who with his Concubine came to lodge in <hi>Gibeah</hi> of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> where the lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inhabitants forced his Concubine till she dyed in the Street; whereupon the Levite makes no more Bones of his old Familiar, but slices her in pieces, and sends a part to every Tribe, except <hi>Benjamin,</hi> where the fact was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; who refusing to deliver up the men of <hi>Gibeah</hi> to Justice, the other Tribes, to revenge the murder and the injustice of the <hi>Benjamites</hi> in protecting the Murderers, proclaim War against them; which cost the bloud of above fourscore thousand men: And upon this great and remarkable occasion the Levites Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine is mentioned, which otherwise would never have been taken notice of in the Scripture. But although neither this Concubine nor her Husband had been mentioned, it would have been but a weak Argument to have said that no Levite ever had a Concubine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then none had been mentioned at
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49846:171"/>
all; for this Levite had had a Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, though this fatal accident had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happened, which was the only occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of informing us particularly that a Levite ever had a Concubine. The like may be concluded of the twelve Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and their Descendents in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> though the Scriptures say nothing of their Concubines; for I have already observed, that that was the main criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal time to make use of that advantage for encrease, and that liberty was too pleasant and agreeable to corrupt Nature to be laid aside upon a sudden, or waved; we see both <hi>Reuben, Gen.</hi> 35.22. and <hi>Iuddah, Gen.</hi> 38. were brisk and sanguine men, and therefore more likely to be fond of having Concubines than their chaster Progenitors. Flesh and blood is highly pleased to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in matters of this nature; and our Saviours denying this Priviledge by reducing marriage to its primitive insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution between one Man and one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and paring away the Appendix of Concubinage, making no <hi>medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween such marriage and fornication, might be no small stumbling-block to the Jews, and might make some of them like the young man in the Gospel, to go
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49846:171"/>
away sorrowful, for that they had, or at least intended to have, beloved pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions of this nature. And as it might be and still is some disadvantage to the ready embracing of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the abridging of this liberty; so the allowing and encouraging of it was the Master-piece of Policy in that great Impostor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and prov'd too powerful a Bait to draw the World af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. And although the present Jews are not over-fond of this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and make but sparing use of it; yet the reason of this abstemiousness is not at all on the account of Conscience, (for they do in some measure practice it to this day) but by reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of it: For since the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Country and Temple by that Heathen Emperor <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and his Son <hi>Titus,</hi> (who yet by God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence were made the Revengers of the precious bloud of Christ) they have been scattered abroad upon the face of the Earth, and by the just Judgment of God they are generally look'd upon with an evil eye, and are become <hi>ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium humani generis,</hi> liable not only to the just and real disgust of Princes, but to their very Capricio's, and to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49846:172"/>
at every turn out of their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and they who have occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move housholds often, have little reason to be fond of encreasing their luggage and their lumber.</p>
            <p>From what has been said, I think it appears highly improbable that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and their Posterity in <hi>Egypt</hi> should on a sudden quit that Custom which claimed the possession of so many years as from <hi>Lamech,</hi> long before the Floud, down to <hi>Iacob</hi>; and therefore we are not to measure their Corn by our cut Bushel, nor their encrease by what is now adays, when that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Concubinage is (or at least should be) taken away. And yet we are not without examples of prodigious fertility where there has been neither Miss nor Concubine in the Case: I my self have seen a Woman within four miles of my own house at <hi>Winchfield,</hi> whose eldest Son <hi>Iohn Hawkins</hi> (that dyed but last year at about ninety years of Age, being healthy and strong, and a man of a very good understanding) told me, that there were no less than seventy five in a Room together at one time that ask'd his Mother blessing, Children, Grand-Children, and Great
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49846:172"/>
Grand-Children, besides above forty more that were not present. <hi>Famianus Strada, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Bello,</hi> tells us <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> Mother to the famous Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> liv'd to see a hundred and fifty ask her Blessing, that were descended from her. And our own Chronicles mention one <hi>William Somerset</hi> Earl of <hi>Worcester,</hi> who was so numerous in his Off-spring, that he could reckon more Children of both Sexes than all the Earls of <hi>England</hi> besides, and this was within this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. And <hi>Fuller</hi> in his Worthies of <hi>England</hi> speaks of a Lady <hi>Temple,</hi> who saw above six hundred that were descended from her own Body, if I am not mistaken; whereas <hi>Iacob</hi> himself had but twelve Sons: And although each of them might have the like number, yet the eleven that went with him into <hi>Egypt</hi> had but about five a piece at the time of their going thither, reckoning one with another, which yet is as great a number as I shall have occasion for in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Before I dismiss this business of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubinage, it will not be amiss to enquire whence the Hebrews were stock'd with such a number of Women more than Men; for every Man having but one
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49846:173"/>
Concubine besides his Wife, the number must be double, which is the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable proportion: For though some like <hi>Iacob</hi> might have more one, yet 'tis probable that others might imitate <hi>Isaac,</hi> and have none at all. I find in my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Hale</hi>'s most learned and judicious Discourse of the Origination of Mankind, a little Book quoted with a great commendation, written as I think by one Captain <hi>Grant,</hi> who among other most ingenious Observations from the Bills of Births and Burials in <hi>London</hi> for almost a hundred years together, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates that the number of Males to Females is as fifteen to thirteen, which is eight Men to less than seven Women; the wife Providence of God allowing that redundance in the Males for Wars and Shipwracks, and other accidents, to which Men are more exposed than Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. But although Providence should have furnished the Israelites with as great a redundance of Women (the same Providence sheltring this people from Wars under the protection of the Egyptians, and they being Shepherds, not Mariners) yet still there will want a great supply to make the number of Women double to that of Men: And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49846:173"/>
whence can this supply come, but from the neighbouring Quarters of the Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites and others? We see <hi>Moses</hi> takes one of his Wives from thence, the Daughter of <hi>Iethro,</hi> who seems, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.9, 10, 11, 12. to be a pious good man, and a true Worshipper, and not tainted with Idolatry as most of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianities were, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their descent from the Father of the faithful, and their retaining Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for those Texts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.25, 26. are grosly misrendred, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mede</hi> has evidently proved. Nay, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that the Isrealites might be furnished with Handmaids or Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines from their Neighbours the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; for that abomination or antipathy which the Egyptians had for eating Bread with the Hebrews, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.32. seems to have been on the account of their Prosession only, as they were Shepherds, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.34. and to have been little else but an aversion to the smell of a Tar-pot, which by mutual converse would easily wear out, and be laid aside. For that reason which Interpreters give of this abomination, <hi>viz.</hi> Because the Israelites eat Flesh from which the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians abstained, and more than that,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49846:174"/>
the Flesh of the Oxe and Sheep which were the Idols or Representative Gods of the Egyptians; this seems to me to be of little force; for then they must have had all other Nations in abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that eat Leeks or Onions, as well as the Israelites for Flesh.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Porrum &amp; Caepe nefas violare, &amp; laedere morsu:</l>
               <l>Faelices Gentes, quorum haec nascuntur in hortis</l>
               <l>Numina!—</l>
               <l>—Quis nescit qualia demens</l>
               <l>Aegyptus portentae colit?</l>
            </q>
            <p>The more probable account of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy is given by <hi>Bochartus</hi> in his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>; and by <hi>Grotius</hi> out of <hi>Manetho,</hi> the most ancient Egyptian Historian, who says, that on the account of the different manner of life of the Shepherds of <hi>Egypt</hi> from the rest of the people, there arose in ancient times dreadful Wars, and the Shepherds getting the mastery revenged themselves with fire and sword, and burnt down the Cities, which made them be hated ever after; so that the antipathy seems to have been of the same nature with that of French and Spaniards now, and of French
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49846:174"/>
and English heretofore; when Wars and emulation stirred up hatred, which in the ordinary people is not forgotten to this day: Notwithstanding, this spight and emulation was among the men only, who were the mutual Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and was not extended to different Sexes on either side, so as to abate that kindness and inclination which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grassed by Nature for its own preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as appears by the intermarriages of French and Spaniards now, and of French and English formerly; as our Histories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly testifie. The like may be said of the Hebrews and Egyptians; for we find there was a friendly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence and neighbourhood amongst them, nay they sojourned with the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites in their houses, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. the Egyptian Midwives are made use of by the Hebrew Women in their extremity of Child-bearing, and express so much compassion towards them as to disobey <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for their sakes, and then excuse their so doing with a lye, notwithstanding they are said to fear God. But that which is more than to take a Concubine, we find that <hi>Ioseph</hi> takes to Wife the Daughter of the Priest of <hi>On,</hi> and by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49846:175"/>
her had <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasseh,</hi> who gave denomination to one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Tribes, an honour denyed to the rest of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Grand-Children; their Mother being an Egyptian was no Bar in the way, the Males only in all the Genealogies of the Hebrews being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for the Seed. So then if <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> might take a Wife notwithstanding the abomination which the Egyptian men had for the Hebrews, much more might others take Concubines in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that great Hebrew of the Hebrews, <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, whose beloved <hi>Agar</hi> was an Egyptian. Thus much I thought fit to say of this matter, that when I had stated the numbers of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men among the Israelites, I might not be brought to an after-reckoning about the Concubines.</p>
            <p>The next advantage for encrease and multiplying, one would think should be the longaevity of those times; but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I question whether that were any such advantage; for as they continued to get Children longer, so they began later. <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> were forty years of Age before they married, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> a great deal older; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Nature was not so forward then as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49846:175"/>
it is now; but as it came to its period later, so likewise to its maturity; and the reason why it arrives at its journeys end the sooner now, may be because it treads swifter paces to perfection, Nature observing a due proportion in its three great Stages, Maturation, Vigour and Decay: according to that true Proverb, <hi>Soon ripe, soon rotten</hi>; to which answers, Later ripe, later rotten: And we see, that those Creatures which are ripe for Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at two or three years old, as Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Cows, though they far exceed Man in strength, yet they seldom live to be much above twenty years of Age. Now although the first Descendants into <hi>Egypt</hi> for a hundred years or more, might in all probability live to a greater Age than Men do now; so from what I have now said, I think 'tis probable also that they married later, whereby we should lose <hi>à parte ante</hi> almost as much as we should gain <hi>à parte post,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the work of generation longer: I shall therefore suppose the Age of Man then to be the same that it is now, for it seems to have had a gradual decrease from the time of the Floud till the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> or a little before, who in the 90<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Psalm, which was of his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49846:176"/>
states the Age of Man at three-score and ten, and that Men were so strong that they came to fourscore years, which is usual in our days. We must not therefore state the Age of the Israelites in <hi>Egypt</hi> at a hundred and ten, or an hundred and twenty years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Moses, Aaron</hi> and <hi>Ioshua</hi> arrived to those years: For doubtless <hi>Moses</hi> speaks not in that Psalm as a Prophet of what would be hereafter, but as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Philosopher and Observer of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the people whom he led, and these turns that Observation into Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pious Contemplation of the vanity of our nature. And the great Age which those three Worthies arrived at was a peculiar Blessing from God on their particular Persons (not common to others) for the ends of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they being highly favoured of God, and chosen Instruments for that great and wonderful administration in the Wilderness, and for the plantation and settlement of God's Church and people in the promised <hi>Canaan</hi>: And of <hi>Moses</hi> in particular it is said, that his eye was not dim, nor his natural force aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.7. at a hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of Age; which could not be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49846:176"/>
by the ordinary power of nature, when the generality of Mankind attained but to fourscore, and that with labour and sorrow, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. but by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary blessing and support of the God of Nature, in whom we live and move and have our being; nor is this to be lookt upon as any other than part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward to him who was faithful in all God's house, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.7. Nay, the kindness of God seems to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend even to his dead Body, as well as to his living, bearing it away (as it were surreptitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sly) in his owns arms, digs his Grave with his own hands, and covers him with Earth; thus bereaving the rebellious. Tribes of the honour of his Interment, to perform his Obsequies Himself, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.</p>
            <p>This longaevity therefore of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs affording little or no advantage above the shorter lives, but more early pregnancy of the latter Generations in <hi>Egypt</hi>; I proceed to that which You will say was a great advantage indeed, which is the second means that conduc'd to bring about the accomplishment of the Promise of multiplying the Posterity of <hi>Iacob</hi> exceedingly, that is, with more than the usual encrease of the rest of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49846:177"/>
Mankind; and that is, The watchful Providence and protection of that God who promised: And indeed I am apt to think, that the vast encrease of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites proceeded more from God's great care in the preservation of those that were born, than from their own extraordinary fertility above all other people, that had both Wives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines as well as they. For although the Promise contained fruitfulness as well as multiplication, yet that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised only as the means conducing to that end; so that if their fertility sufficed for that, both parts of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise were exactly fulfilled, though there were no exuberant Numbers of Super-numeraries, as it were for food for those three great Devourers, Famines, Wars, and Pestilences; they being exempted from those three Calamities by the special Providence of God over them: But lest this should be thought to be said <hi>gratis,</hi> I shall therefore endeavour to prove it.</p>
            <p>And in order to that, it is worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, That <hi>Moses,</hi> who writes the History of this people from the very Creation, dispatches that great interval of above sixteen hundred and fifty years
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49846:177"/>
from the Fall to the Floud, in three Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters, <hi>viz. Gen.</hi> 4, 5, 6. whereas the rest of the Book, which is no less than forty four Chapters, is spent wholly on no longer an interval than to the death of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> which is searce six hundred and sixty years; and still the nearer he comes to his own times, the more his History swells, like great Rivers, the farther from the Spring the larger they grow, by the confluence of more streams: For although his inspiration to write truth, was equal throughout, yet the Tradition, which (for the most part) furnished him with the Subject matter of that truth was not equal; the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first Ages being very scanty, and almost worn out as it were by pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through so many hands: whereas those things which were transacted at a less distance of time, could not so easily either be forgotten or corrupted; so that these came in greater number, more intire and certain, and cloathed in their particular circumstances: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it seems to me highly improbable that <hi>Moses</hi> should be ignorant of any considerable Calamity that besell this people, that was of so late a Date as their coming into <hi>Egypt</hi>; which was but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49846:178"/>
about thirteen years before he himself came into the World, and therefore the knowledge of it had been easily handed down to him from so small a distance, without the help of supernatural reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which he was also furnished withal, to supply the defects of Oral Tradition in that History which he wrote. Now if he could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it, and yet concealed it, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this cannot be supposed without questioning his fidelity as God's own Historiographer, who yet has this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony even from God himself, That he was faithful in all his house, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.7. that is, in all that wherewith God entrusted him, whereof the penning this sacred History was a part. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his fidelity, his tender affection to this people, for whose sake he quitted the glory and pleasures of the Egyptian Court, refusing to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, and afterwards in the Wilderness desires God to blot him out of his Book, rather than they should be destroyed; I say this tender affection could not suffer him to omit the recording any considerable calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that befel their Community, and that with as much commiseration, and in

as relenting a strain, as he does the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Taskmasters. And though they had fallen into the hands of God himself, by some raging Pestilence, and not of man (as the other was) yet doubtless his great piety would not have failed to have pointed out those sins which provoked that judgment, nor to have celebrated God's mercy for saying to the destroying Angel, <hi>It is enough.</hi> This therefore being cleared, That <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> could neither be ignorant nor silent of any considerable Calamity that besel this people in <hi>Egypt,</hi> let us in the next place see whether he mentions or but hints at either Famine, War or Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>As for Famine, we read of none, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is as little also said of their being oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by War or Invasion on their small Territory by the Neighbouring Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites and Arabians, or any others: nor
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49846:179"/>
is it probable that the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> made any use of them in their Wars, they being Strangers charitably sheltered for their Brothers sake, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Egyptians. For when they were but few, they could afford but sorry assistance; and when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came many, 'twas no policy to arm a Province of Strangers in the Bowels of the Country, and teach them the Art of War: And when they began to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, the Egyptians were so far from this, that they grew jealous of them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.10. lest when there fell out War, they should join unto their Enemies, and fight against them. As for the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, we find not one word of that neither: That they were very subject to the Leprosie, is very certain; and though it be as certain that that was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad it, as much as it did Women in Child-bed,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49846:179"/>
because it appoints Rites and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings after recovery in both Cases, and both together, <hi>Lev.</hi> 12, 13, 14. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it appoints more large Offerings and more Rites for cleansing the recovered Leper, than in the othe Case, to denote the impurity of the one to be far greater than that of the other; the one being according to the Law of Natures Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, the other an accident and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease and the consequent of sin. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this denotes the impurity to be of a different nature, and far greater; yet does it not denote the danger to be greater: the Law by appointing the Rites of cleansing seems to suppose in general the recovery of both; and though some might dye of the Leprosie, so likewise did some in Child-bed: but that it was any way comparable to the Plague, properly so called, is no way credible; there b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that in particular, because the Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pposed the Plague mortal. I remember I have read in some Author, whose name I have forgot, as not worth remembring, of the same stamp with those Gentlemen You menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Porphyry,</hi> How that the Egyptians desired nothing more than to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49846:180"/>
be rid of the Israelites, and that that Army wherewith <hi>Pharaoh</hi> pursued them according to <hi>Moses</hi>'s relation, this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor says went to drive them out of the Country as a Herd of unclean Beasts and noysom Lepers. Now although this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be notoriously false, yet it affords this Observation, That the Leprosie was not accounted mortal, like the Plague of Pestilence; for surely then this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, who seem'd to me to be more Knave than Fool, would not have made the Egyptians to have followed the fatal scent so close at the heels with their King at the Head of them, by whose life they swore. Nor had it been any more for <hi>Moses,</hi> but only to have commanded out a Brigade or two of Lepers, and by that means have seen that literally fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led which was promised afterwards, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 23.10. <hi>One man of you shall chase a thousand</hi>; or else he might have fac'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and placing death and destruction in the Front, easily have saved the expence of a Miracle, and in this posture have march'd back again to their beloved old Quarters, as this Author supposes them. The Leprosie therefore being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> no such mortal Nature, and there b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing no hint of any other Epidemical Disease of a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49846:180"/>
fatal Nature amongst this people during their abode; I therefore conclude that they were guarded by God's especial Providence in this respect, as well as from the direful effects of War and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>But this will yet appear with greater evidence, if we take a view of God's tender affection and care over this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in supporting them under those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which he was pleased to suffer to be brought upon them. During the life of <hi>Ioseph</hi> all was well, and they liv'd at great ease by means of his interest at Court, nay their happiness seems to be of equal continuance with the memory of that good man; but he being gone to his Fathers, and to his Grave in peace and honour, at length in process of time, it is said, (<hi>Ex.</hi> 1.8.) that <hi>there arose a King which knew not Ioseph,</hi> nor how service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able he had been both to Prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the time of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s calamity. And he taking notice (<hi>ver.</hi> 9.) that the Israelites were more and mightier than his own people, he seems resolved to put a stop to their growing numbers, to keep <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> from overflowing, and Israel within his Banks: <hi>Come,</hi> says he ver. 10. <hi>let us deal wisely with this people, lest they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49846:181"/>
and it come to pass, that when there falleth out any War, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them out of the Land:</hi> By which means part of his Territories would have been unpeopled, and he would have lost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half his Subjects, or rather Slaves. And in order to accomplish this Project of checking their numbers from grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an ungovernable bulk, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. therefore did they set over them Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters to afflict them with their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: Nor were these Taskmasters neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the execution of their Office, as appears by these several words which the Holy Ghost makes use of to set forth the misery of this poor distrested people, such as Affliction, Oppression, Rigour, Burdens, cruel Bondage, all manner of Service, fighting, crying, groaning, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of Spirit, and <hi>ver.</hi> 14. life it self is become bitter; and <hi>chap.</hi> 2.11. there <hi>Moses</hi> finds an Egyptian bastinading a poor Hebrew Slave at such an inhumane rate, as it provoked the meekest of men to become both his Judge and his Executioner upon the place. And doubtless, the slavery of the Spanish Mines at <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> no nor of the Turkish Gallies, is to be compared
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49846:181"/>
to this of <hi>Egypt</hi>; for there the Masters interest pleads for the preservation of the Slave, whereas the very design of this seems with more than barbarous drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make their Souls quit their harras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Bodies, and by destroying a great part of the present Generation, prevent their multiplying in the next. But what is the effect of all this barbarous cruelty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.12. The more they afflicted them, the more they grew; though the Bush was on fire, yet was it not consumed.</p>
            <p>The second Project of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s to give a check to their encrease was, By tampering with the Midwives; But here God defeats him again; for they feared God (<hi>ver.</hi> 17.) and did not as the King commanded them. Then in the third place, the same Command is issued out by Proclamation to all his Subjects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. And then <hi>Moses</hi> is born, and strangely preserved, even by the Tyrants own Daughter, whom God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards employs as the chief instrument of their delivery, in spight of all Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian policy and force: So vain is it to fight against God; and if He be for Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> do his worst. It is also remarkable, that besides the destruction
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49846:182"/>
which fell to the share of the Egyptians at the Red Sea, two of the ten Plagues are of the same nature with those which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> intended against Israel: For as he intended to diminish their numbers, by crushing them into their Graves by heavy burthens and intolerable, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.45. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.6. so God diminishes <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s people with the Plague of Hail, which crush'd all that were abroad in the Field, even to the Earth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.25. And the death of the first born of <hi>Egypt</hi> seems to retaliate what he would have done by the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives; though this be threatned indeed on a more general account, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.22, 23. <hi>Thus faith the Lord, Israel is my Son, even my first-born; let my Son go, that he may serve me: And if thou refuse to let him go, behold I will slay thy Son, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thy first-born.</hi> Now if God appear thus eminently, not only to preserve Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael intire from being diminished in his promised numbers in the midst of this Furnace of afflictions, but even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay in kind that vengeance which was intended against them, certainly he would not destroy them himself by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine or Pestilence; nor is there any reason to suppose that there was not an
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49846:182"/>
even hand of Providence over them for good in one respect as well as another, and at one time as well as another. Can we think that God who promised <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 46.3. to go down with him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and surely to bring him thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, would leave him one minute whilst he was there, unless we think the God of Israel to be some times like booted <hi>Baal,</hi> whom the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> wittily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids to be taking of a journey? I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, that as they were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily supported under their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> so likewise that they were guarded from those three Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Famine, War and Pestilence; and that it may be truly said of these, as it is of the Plague of Hail, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Only in the Land of Goshen, where the Children of Israel were, was there no hail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then that these People were thus cherished under the wings of Gods special Providence and protection from those sweeping Calamities which the same God inflicts upon other particular Nations; and that frequently, not only as the Punisher of sin, but as the great Governour of the World, and for the good of the whole, in order to keep the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49846:183"/>
Race of Mankind within such Bounds, that the Creatures may suffice for food and clothing, which they could not do if those three great Correctives were wholly intermitted but for one Century; I say what wonder is it, that they who were thus cherished by God as a Father and Sponsor, and under his immediate protection, (unless that protection it self be a wonder) should be so very fruitful in respect of adult numbers, though they were not prodigiously fruitful above the Egyptians and other people, in respect of the number of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants born, who had both Wives and Concubines as well as they? For as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, so particularly the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are frequently subject to very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable abatements in their numbers, by those three calamities before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, especially the Pestilence in that sultry Climate, where the River <hi>Nile</hi> every <hi>Iune,</hi> which is a hot time of Year also, leaves abundance of mud upon the surface of that flat Country at his return into his old Channel, which must needs send forth noysom smells and vapours into the Air; from whence arise Plagues and other Epidemical Diseases, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where people live at ease and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49846:183"/>
and crowded together in Cities: whereas the Israelites manner of life, they being Shepherds, whose business lyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the fresh open Air, might be a means from God of the preservation; and that which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> intended for their ruine, in all probability was a means to secure them from Epidemical Pestilential Diseases. For it is a great truth, that the Plague it self is no Plague to clean and pure Constitutions, and seises those only whose Bodies, by feeding plentifully and living at some ease, contract vicious humours, which the infectious Air sets into a high fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which it could not do if those hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours were not there, they being the only Fuel of that fatal combustion: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all the Colledg of Physicians, though <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Aescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi> himself were joined with them, could not prescribe a more Sovereign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against the encrease of humors than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did to these poor Drudges, <hi>viz.</hi> the Leeks and the Onions, the Garlick and Cucumbers of <hi>Egypt</hi>; and if they would mend their Commons with Bread, they must get it, not with the sweat of their Brows only, but of every joint and limb: so that they were as clean as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49846:184"/>
Horses for a Race, and might bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to all infection. But when once they remove out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from making Bricks without Straw, and had little to do but only to stalk easie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Wilderness, and sometimes to lye at Anchor, and to surfeit upon Quails and Manna, till it run out at their Nostrils, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.20. Then while the luscious Flesh was between their teeth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.33. they are smitten with a very great Plague: and at the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, those who went to search the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> dye of a second Plague; and at the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, there fourteen thousand and seven hundred dye of a third Plague; and Chap. 25. there twenty four thousand dye of a fourth Plague; they being now both naturally sitted by their luxury, and morally qualified by their sins, for this Judgment. But we hear not a syllable of any one Plague amonst this great people during their bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who were therefore great and numerous, because guarded from this and the like Judgments. For should God have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed them to those devouring Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Famine, War and Pestilence, that had been but the way to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelled
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49846:184"/>
the means of performing his own promise, like one who travels in a Circle, and having trac'd the whole Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, arrives at length (and not advances) but to the same Point from whence he first set forth.</p>
            <p>I can never think that the Egyptians (whose wisdom is celebrated even in Divine Writ, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.22. as an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and excellent Qualification in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> himself, whom God chose out of all the Tribes to be his own Lieutenant or Deputy in governing the Israelites) were such ill Politicians, or that they whom the annual Overflow of their great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taught to be the great Masters of Practical Geometry even to <hi>Greece</hi> it self (which it is impossible to perform without good skill in Arithmetick) should be such ill Arithmeticians, as not to be able to do that which I do now, <hi>viz.</hi> sit down and compute the number that would arise from seventy men by their Wives and Concubines, though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man had been as fruitful as <hi>Gideon,</hi> who had threescore and ten Sons; and then judge whether these Strangers might not in time become dangerous to the State, and with a less auspicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation than that of <hi>Nile,</hi> overflow
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49846:185"/>
the whole Country, and like the Frogs enter even into their Kings Chambers. Now the reason why this fagacious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not foresee this vast encrease of the Israelites must proceed from hence, That they saw no such prodigious fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them to make them encrease faster than themselves, and they being many thousands for one Israelite. Nature (they thought) would still hold the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the same. They could not but foresee by former experience, mortalities and plagues, those Correctives of the excels of humane generations, whereby God seems to say to the overflowing O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of Mankind, <hi>Hitherto shalt thou come, and no farther.</hi> But then they look'd upon this Judgment in the same Notion that <hi>David</hi> does, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.5. <hi>As an Arrow that flyeth by day</hi>: And for that reason they thought they saw it with their eyes falling promiscuously on the Israelites, as well as on themselves, not dreaming of that Pestilence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.6. <hi>which walketh also in darkness,</hi> and beside the track of all humane conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, raging in the Cities of <hi>Egypt</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its usual Periods in that hot Country, but making a skip or pass-over at <hi>Israel,</hi> and forbearing to curtail his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49846:185"/>
promised numbers in their Geometrical Progression towards infinity, which I now come to state more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>And what wonder is it if every man under these circumstances which I have discoursed of, should have five or six Sons apiece, and as many Daughters, reckoning one with another; for though some might not have so many, so others might have a far more numerous Issue: Many a poor Cottage here in our less pregnant Climate can furnish out a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Stock, honestly begotten, by one Wife only. Certainly, no man that considers what has been said, can think this an unreasonable supposition, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he consider also what <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>Psal.</hi> 127.4. <hi>Lo Children and the fruit of the womb are an heritage and gift that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Lord,</hi> and also how eminently this truth appeared in the Wives of their famous Progenitors, <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who were all successively barren till God made them otherwise; and it is very probable, that as there was not one feeble Person, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105.36. so there was not one barren person among their Tribes. But because that by accidents and natural infirmities some of these
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49846:186"/>
may reasonably be supposed to dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to maturity, or at least, before they have the like number of Children; I will therefore suppose no greater number than four Sons live to contribute their Parts to the next Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by getting five or six Sons like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, whereof four live to do the like, and so on till two hundred and ten years be expired.</p>
            <p>In the next place I will suppose that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of these four may be Father of his first-born at twenty four years of Age compleat; for the life of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now contracted, as I have before shewn, to seventy years, it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to suppose that they made more haste than their long-liv'd Ancestors to secure an early share in the promise; and if they might be Soulders at twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of Age, <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.45. certainly it is no unproportionable supposition to think they might be Fathers of their First-born at twenty four. This will appear more probable yet, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the more early pregnancy of that Climate, being almost under the Tropick; whereas it is a common thing in our colder Situation of 52 Degrees latitude to anticipate that Age: Add to this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49846:186"/>
what the learned <hi>Selden</hi> tell us, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>De jure Naturali Gentium apud Hebraeos: Necessitatem Matrimonii Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto fructificandi seu propagationis mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicationisque, eo usque sanciri docent Rabbini, ut ita eo teneri Masculos omnes, ut quicunque expleto vigesimo aetatis anno (&amp; sunt qui de minori aetate heic pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiant) Vxorem non duxerit, eum in illud committere seribant: nisi aut assiduo Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis studio incumbat, aut, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because of this early commencing Fathers, it is probable (as I have before observed) that they continued Proleta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians the less time, I will therefore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that these four Sons are all born in twenty four years more, that is, by such time as their Father is forty eight years of Age compleat, and upon these three suppositions I frame the Calculation annexed.</p>
            <p>The usual way of reckoning Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and calculating their numbers, is by Geometrical Progression, and in this present Case according to the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions premis'd, the proportions of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Generation would run thus: 1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I find that at last in the Conclusion this way does not give a distint view of the Grand-Sons,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49846:187"/>
whereof a very considerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are born within that Period which is allowed to the immediate Sons only, and by that means the account is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed and confused at last, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have thought of another way. And although the eldest Son may have his first Child before the Father has his last; yet for clearness sake, and to avoid confusion, I suppose the Father to have all his four Sons before his eldest Son has ever a Child; not that it was always really so, but to keep the account of each Generation distinct by it self, from interfering with that which succeeded, which would have been more intricate if I had supposed the Father and Son to have had Children born the same years both together; I therefore suppose in the Table annexed, that every man has one of his four Sons every six years: so that his youngest Son is born six years before his eldest Son has a Child. This Table has but two Columns or Ranges of Figures, the first contains every sixth Year from <hi>Iacob</hi>'s coming into <hi>Egypt,</hi> in every of which and no other (for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctness sake) I suppose the Children to be born, the number of whom is placed in the other Column over against
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49846:187"/>
each Year. But this Column contains the number of Children which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from one man only, as suppose from <hi>Adam,</hi> in two hundred and ten years on the suppositions laid down; if mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed by three, it will give the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers arising from the three Sons of <hi>Noah</hi>; if multiplyed by seventy, it will give the numbers of the Children of Israel, which are as follows:

This account agrees exactly with that of <hi>Moses</hi> at their first Muster in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.46. where all of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years old and upwards, fit for War, are computed at six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty, and in the next Verse it is said, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites were not numbred among the rest, but by themselves, <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.39. where the Males from a Month old and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards amount but to two and twenty thousand: Now if you allow eight thousand one hundred and eighty of these to be twenty years of Age and upwards to sixty eight, and then add
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49846:188"/>
that number to the number of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tribes fit for War, which is six hundred and three thousand, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and fifty, then the total Summ will be the same with that which arises by my Computation, <hi>viz.</hi> six hundred and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven thousand, seven hundred and thirty, where none are taken in that were born before the hundred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fourth year from their coming into <hi>Egypt</hi>; so that none are above sixty eight years of Age of these six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eleven thousand, seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty, at their going thence, and none under twenty: which being so near the mark, I think the Total number of Males and Females cannot be very wide from the truth.</p>
            <p>As for that ascititious Tribe, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, I have put them down at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at four hundred thousand, which is not so much as two thirds of the Males from twenty years old and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to sixty eight, by eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand seven hundred and thirty. For though I have formerly hinted, that one Concubine to each man was the most probable number; yet perhaps they might be without Concubines for some years after they were married, till
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49846:188"/>
such time as their appetites beginning to be cloy'd with one and the same Dish, their stomachs began to hanker after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Course.</p>
            <p>As to the way of computing the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble annexed, I need not say as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> does, <hi>Here is wisdom, let him that hath understanding count the number</hi>; for he that has but so much understanding in Arithmetick as to perform Addition on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may do this, and therefore, Sir, I will trouble You no farther about that. You will find that I have not confined my self precisely to two hundred and ten years, but to two hundred and twelve; which yet is less than either S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Walter Raleigh, Helvicus</hi> or <hi>Petavius</hi> do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for the Israelites stay in <hi>Egypt</hi>; and yet I have not supposed any Children to be born after the two hundred and tenth year, but only that they stayed two years more, to this end, that I might begin my Computation of those that were twenty years old, and upwards, fit for War, with those that were born in the Year 192. But having such good authority as those three learned Chronologers, I think I need make no farther Apology, <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> allowing no less than two hundred
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49846:189"/>
and fifteen years for their abode there.</p>
            <p>But I must not forget my promise that I made, to demonstrate that if the Israelites had continued in <hi>Egypt</hi> multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying at the same proportion that they did whilst they were there, they would in eighteen or twenty years time have encreased to a greater number than they did in four hundred and seventy three years afterwards. For so many years it was, according to <hi>Helvicus,</hi> from the time of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to the time that <hi>David</hi> caused <hi>Ioab</hi> to number the people, whereof I find two Lists returned, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24 and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. This last is the larger List, and therefore I will pitch upon that, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to eleven hundred thousand. But <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> were not counted among them, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.6. For the King's word was abominable to <hi>Ioab.</hi> But if ten Tribes give eleven hundred thousand, what shall two Tribes give at the same proportion? And the Answer is, Two hundred and twenty thousand; which added together make, One million, three hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand men that drew the Sword, that is, that were twenty years old and upwards, to about seventy. Now if
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49846:189"/>
we suppose that the Israelites <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years more, that is, to two hundred and thirty years, then they who were born in the two hundred and tenth year will be full twenty years old, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we begin there, and add all the numbers together up to the year one hundred and sixty two inclusively, they make nineteen thousand and fifty two; which being multiplyed by seventy, make one million, three hundred thirty three thousand, six hundred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is, thirteen thousand six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty more than they were at the latter end of <hi>David</hi>'s Reign; <hi>Quod erat demonstrandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, Sir, do You judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God Almighty was not as good as his word to <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen 46.3. <hi>Fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great Nation</hi>; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this might not be done without mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of miracles for their production, only by covering them under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his wings till their calamities were past. For my part, I think they do equal disservice to the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who needlesly swell and aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize passages of Scripture into Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Miracles, such as this I have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49846:190"/>
been speaking of, and that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.53, 54, 55. by the Doctrine of Transubstantiation; and those who will solve all the <hi>Phaenonema</hi> of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Proceedings, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Mysteries of Faith, such as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, the Incarnation of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> by bringing them down to the Level and Comprehension of our frail understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as the Pelagians and Socinians. For they who maintain, that this vast en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Israelites could be effected no otherwise than by constant Twins, they do by that means make it look like an absurd Romantick Tale, as if it were impossible to be effected, unless every Israelitish Woman were like a Dorset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire Ewe, which seldom brings forth less than two Lambs at a time; whereof their own History does not so much as pretend to make mention. But I hope I have in some measure evinced the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the thing upon rational grounds, at least in such a measure as could well be expected from a Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, who was never vers'd in this work of generation: And perhaps it was for that very reason that You were pleas'd to single me out to discuss this Question,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49846:190"/>
from among the rest of your more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Acquaintance that were married, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a charitable regard to that Chess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board-Proverb, (which You know We have sometimes occasion to make use of) <hi>That a Stander-by sees more than the Gamesters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I must not part with You so, without a more serious farewel and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on this occasion, and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing my hearty thanks for putting me on this useful and pleasant underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; for by that means You have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to me an occasion of searching more narrowly into the <hi>series</hi> of God's Providence over the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> bringing the greatest events to pass by despicable, nay contrary means in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane appearance at the time when they were transacted: <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Brethren by selling him to the Ishmaelites thought verily to have defeated the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his aspiring Dreams, and by that very means send him (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he pass'd through a Prison too) to be no less that the Vice-Roy of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in that capacity their Sheaves come above twenty years after to do obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance to his Sheaf, and the Sun, Moon and Stars to fall down before him, <hi>Gen.</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49846:191"/>
37. and he becomes their great Patron and Protector, and in the place of God to them and their Posterity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.19. I have before observed how God defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at every turn the secret Plots and Machinations that were designed for the ruine of his Church and People; and have not We seen fresh instances of the same nature even among our selves at this day, as well as in every Age since the time of the Reformation, wherein God Almighty has hitherto delivered us from the hands of our Roman Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters, and I trust he will yet deliver us? For the reviving and cherishing of which hopes and trust in the good Providence of God, I must owne my self more beholden at this time to your obliging injunction, than You can be to me for my slender performance; which yet if it contribute, though but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely, to the clearing of any weighty truth which You shall undertake, it will be an additional satisfaction, as it was the only design and intent of,</p>

            <head>A SECOND QUESTION Propounded by the Author, <hi>viz.</hi> CONCERNING The <hi>multiplying of Mankind until the Floud.</hi>

            <p>ALthough in contemplation of your great pains and bounty to my self and the Commonwealth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I should not (in civility) come in with another Question, <hi>tanquam ex postliminio</hi>; yet, <hi>Extremum hunc, Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusa, mihi concede laborem</hi>! It is said, That <hi>Cain,</hi> being cast forth from the presence of God, in process of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>Enoch,</hi> and built a City after his name (being, it is likely then, at mans estate.) After which it is set forth, in order of Writing, though not of time, that <hi>Adam</hi> begat <hi>Seth,</hi> in the hundred

and thirtieth year of his Age, who had <hi>Enos</hi> by name; in whose time men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to call upon the name of the Lord, or to be divided (as I take it) in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions: I would fain know how far the World might be peopled by that time <hi>Enos</hi> was fit to go forth from his Fathers Tents, and to have a Tribe, Hoard, or Family of his own; so that still the chief Family might retain to <hi>Adam,</hi> and the next numerous to <hi>Cain,</hi> and more people yet, to make up the house of <hi>Seth,</hi> or any of his Descendents. And if this appear for three hundred years in all, both the true Church and the false may be discovered, and what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of people may be conjectured to have been destroyed by the Floud. Which is the humble request of,</p>

               <hi>RUDYERD</hi>'s ANSWER TO THE Second Question.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR kind acceptance and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able interpretation of my former Essay, obliges me to do no less than to attempt the answering Your other Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>ex postliminio,</hi> as You call them. And in order to that, I have calculated the numbers that might arise from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and their Posterity, upon these following suppositions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they had a Son every fourth Year, and a Child every second Year; so that there is one Year for breeding, and another or nursing: For 'tis not to be imagined, that <hi>Eve</hi> bred up her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by hand, or that, when Mankind began to multiply, they should be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49846:193"/>
of that unnatural curiosity and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ninceness which prevails so much nowadays, of nourishing their Infants at a strange Dugg. But that there might be such frequent births as this amounts to, is not improbable; considering that Mankind was at that time for especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under the Divine Benediction of encreasing and multiplying, in order to replenish the Earth, which was nothing else but a Wilderness, and altogether as useless (except for wild Beasts) as the <hi>Chaos</hi> it self, till such time as it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Inhabitants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That these Children, being born of Parents of a far more durable althle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Constitution than men are now, and being form'd out of the more pure principles of Nature, as She came untain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the hands of her Creator, were not such Rickety Pulings as they are now in the decrepit Age of the World: there were no <hi>mala stamina vitae</hi> derived from diseased, feeble, intemperate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but <hi>fortes creantur à fortibus.</hi> I therefore suppose that they very rarely made such untimely <hi>Exits</hi> as frequently happen among us, but that every one of these attained to perfect Age; or at least, that at such a time as God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49846:194"/>
own Colony, the Earth, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Planters, He might bless them extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily with such a number of Twins as might make ample reparation for those who were cut off young by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and infirmities; so that they might increase as fast as that proportion which I have stated, though not according to it: And yet I am not of the general o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Rabbins, that upon this great occasion of peopling the World, there were few single births, but all were Twins; and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Selden</hi> out of them, and the Oriental Traditions, gives us the name of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Sister Twin, and of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>'s two Sister Twins: But perhaps this may be but a Rabbinical fancy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Cain</hi> and all that were born after him, had their first-born at sixty five years of Age, as is recorded of <hi>Mahalael</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi>: For although none are said to begin so early besides in that whole Genealogy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. down from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah</hi>; yet we are not to think the eldest Son is always named. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Augustin</hi> is clearly of this opinion, <hi>libs</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. <hi>De Civitate Dei, Video esse credibile, inquit, non hic primogenitos fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sse commemoratos, sed quos successio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ordo poscebat,</hi> with much more to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49846:194"/>
the same purpose a little after. For <hi>Moses</hi>'s great aim is to draw down the direct Line only of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Jewish Nation. The like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly in the Genealogy of our Saviour in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Matthew,</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> is said to beget <hi>Isaac; Isaac, Iacob; Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Iudah; Iudah, Pharez; Iesse, David; David, Solomon</hi>; whereof not one was the eldest Son of his Father. Nay, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodius</hi> out of Oriental Traditions says, That <hi>Cain</hi>'s eldest Son was born, when his Father was but thirty years old: And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Selden</hi> quotes <hi>Cedrenus</hi> affirming, that <hi>Adam</hi> had thirty three Sons and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty seven Daughters, and yet none of these are mentioned by <hi>Moses,</hi> save only <hi>Cain, Abel</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> and not so much as one Daughter, without which the Race of Mankind must have come to a full stop immediately. And if <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity to the Flood had no more Children than whose names are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Moses,</hi> there had been little need of opening the Windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and pouring out an Ocean to drown them; for as to the quantity of water, they might all have been drown'd in a Trash-pool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And seeing there were many more than what are mentioned,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49846:195"/>
what necessity is there to suppose that those which are mentioned were always the eldest? <hi>Credat Iudaeus</hi>—</p>
            <p n="4">4. I suppose that <hi>Adam</hi> might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue getting Children till six hundred years of Age, seeing <hi>Noah</hi> had <hi>Sem, Ham</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> after five hundred, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.32. But I shall have no occasion to carry on my Calculation so far in order to answer your Queries, which require no more than to the Birth of <hi>Cainan,</hi> when his Father <hi>Enos</hi> was ninety years old, which is just three hundred twenty five from the Creation. As for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that might be destroyed by the Floud, they cannot be conjectured from any Calculation which falls short of that time (as You imagine) for the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion keeps no certain proportion that I can find: only You may guess the World to have been throughly stock'd with Inhabitants, and perhaps more than at this day. For <hi>Petavius</hi> in his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book <hi>de Doctrina Temporum, c.</hi> 14. and <hi>Temporarius</hi> in his Chronology before him, gives an evident demonstration (as my Author says) that within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of two hundred and fifteen years after the Floud, the number of coexist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Individuals would amount to a vast
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49846:195"/>
multitude, and I believe more than is in the World at this day, <hi>viz.</hi> above twelve hundred millions. Which is a swifter way of encreasing than arises by my computation; for in 325 years there arise but 116779 Males, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the like number of Females there will be in all but 233558; which yet I think is abundantly sufficient to answer your Queries about <hi>Seth</hi> and <hi>Enos,</hi> though there were but half this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or, which is all one, if I had suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to have had a Son but every eighth year.</p>
            <p>The only seeming difficulty is, to find out Inhabitants for <hi>Cain</hi>'s City; for by my Computation I can make but a hundred eighty seven Males in the World at the birth of <hi>Seth</hi>; and <hi>Cain,</hi> according to my former suppositions, could have but sixteen Males of his own Posterity, and certainly none else would accompany the wretched Murderer, and thereby banish themselves from the face of the Earth, and of God himself, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14, 16. Now seventeen Males would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute but a large Family, nor is it to be supposed that so small a number, whereof a good part were but Children too, could give a Place the denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49846:196"/>
on of a City, or of a Town, though we should suppose it such an one as <hi>Caesar</hi> describes our British Towns at his first footing here, <hi>Commentariorum lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Oppidum Britanni vocant, quum Sylvam impeditam vallo atque fossa munierant, quo incursionis hostium vitandae causâ convenire conjueverunt.</hi> But to solve this doubt I answer, That what is here said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.17. That <hi>Cain</hi>'s Wife bare <hi>Enoch,</hi> and that He builded a City, and called it after the name of his Son <hi>Enoch,</hi> is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by way of anticipation; as if <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> should have said, This is that <hi>Enoch</hi> whose name <hi>Cain</hi> gave to the City which he afterwards built in process of time, when his Posterity began to encrease. And al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hough this be the first City men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, yet 'tis very probable that <hi>Adam</hi> built the first City, being so much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the World at Man's Estate, wherein he was created, as to be <hi>Cain</hi>'s Father; And what need <hi>Cain</hi> have given any name to his City, if there were no other City in the World beside? For names are for distinction, and are useless where there is but one of a kind. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. it is said of <hi>Sem, Ham</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet These are the three Sons of Noah, and of them was the whole earth overspread</hi>;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49846:196"/>
and the next Verse says, <hi>Noah began to be an Husbandman, and planted a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard:</hi> But no rational man can conclude from hence that the whole Earth was peopled before <hi>Noah began to be an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, and planted a Vineyard.</hi> So I say, Although <hi>Cain</hi>'s City be mentioned before the birth of <hi>Irad</hi> and <hi>Mehujael, Gen.</hi> 4. yet it does not at all follow that therefore it must be built before they were born, because we see many things in this History hinted at in order of Writing first, which fell out last in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time; as in that instance I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons, and you your self instance in your Letter, in this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Cain</hi> and his Posterity, which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> seems to clap in a Parenthesis: And supposing <hi>Enoch</hi> the Son of <hi>Cain</hi> to be Contemporary with <hi>Seth,</hi> though it be probable he was something later, the Parallel will run thus.</p>

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49846:197"/>And yet the History of <hi>Tubal Cain</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched before <hi>Seth</hi> is spoken of, though he were Contemporary with <hi>Enoch,</hi> who is five Generations remov'd from <hi>Seth:</hi> So that there is no reason to conclude that <hi>Cain</hi>'s City was built before <hi>Irad</hi> was born, only because it precedes in the History. And perhaps it was not built in a hundred years after, nor received the name of <hi>Enoch</hi> many years after that, till such time as there were more Cities in the World, and <hi>Cain</hi> himself grew old, and weary of the splendid toil of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, and so admitted his eldest Son to a Partnership in his Superintendency; thereby to ease himself of part of his care, and secure the Succession in the right Line; for which <hi>Cain</hi> seems to have been very zealous: For by calling his City <hi>Enoch,</hi> no man could mention it, but at the same time he must declare, by the very name of it, to whom it did belong. In this, <hi>Cain</hi> seems to me to have play'd the <hi>Machiavel</hi>; and no wonder, since our Saviour himself tells us, that <hi>the children of this world are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser in their generation than the children of light.</hi> But certainly it was no policy for <hi>Cain</hi> to secure the Dominion of this City to his Son, by calling it after his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49846:197"/>
Son's, and not after his own name, till such time as he himself grew old, and willing to resign up his cares as well as his Glory: For had he done it whilst he was young and likely to live, unless <hi>Enoch</hi> was an honester man than his Father, it would have been a greater temptation to him to have murthered his Father, than ever <hi>Cain</hi> had to murder his Brother. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> seems to have gone this way to work; for he setled his Son <hi>Darius</hi> in the Throne during his own life, and a common thing it was among the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperors: Nay, <hi>David</hi> himself did so by <hi>Solomon,</hi> to prevent his elder Son <hi>Adonijah</hi> from coming to the Throne, and many of the Roman Emperours as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd those whom they intended for their Successors, in <hi>Consortium Imperii:</hi> And perhaps this part of King-craft might derive its Original from <hi>Cain.</hi> But if any are so wedded to their own opinions, as to think that this City must needs be built before <hi>Irad</hi> was born, because 'tis related first, I shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to that fond conceit, provided they allow this definition of their City, that it was <hi>Spelunca Latronum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas it is urged by the Prae-Adamites, that the World was peopled
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49846:198"/>
very well before <hi>Cain</hi> slew his Brother, because <hi>Cain</hi> says Every one that meeteth him will slay him: All that I can gather from hence, is, That <hi>Cain</hi> spake more reason than the Prae-Adamites: For what reason is there, now that the World is peopled, for a Murtherer to conclude that every one that meeteth him will slay him? Does not many a Murtherer escape by flying amongst men, and hiding himself in the Crowd? So that there is no need of puting a mark upon such an one for fear he should be kill'd, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. there is more need of a mark now that he may be known, and brought to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. Nay, the Prae-Adamites are so far from establishing or strengthning their opinion from this Text, that <hi>Cain</hi> spake greater reason, by how much the World was the lesser; for that was an high aggravation of the murder, and made it look more black and notorious than it would do now that the World is well stock'd with Inhabitants, as it would have been a greater crime to have rob'd the good Samaritan of his Two-pence, than to have stollen the same Summ out of <hi>Craesus</hi>'s Treasury. And by reason of this scantiness of the Race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49846:198"/>
the matter became the more known, even to all the World, who would be sure to tell their Children of this inhumane act, which made him the discourse of all, —<hi>cunctorum volitare per ora,</hi> and they would be sure to describe the villany from head to foot; and the Race of Mankind continually encreasing and spreading farther from its Center, Nature seem'd to send the Hue and Cry after him, and <hi>Cain</hi> might well conclude, that that and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance would overtake him both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that every one that meeteth him would slay him. But lest I should seem guilty of something of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by murdering Your patience with a tedious long-winded Epistle, I here take occasion to tell You, That I have done; or, which is all one, to subscribe my self,</p>
