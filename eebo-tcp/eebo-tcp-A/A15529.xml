         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

good helps and means to bring to light the hidden vnderstanding of the Scripture. For, certaine it is, as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Arts and Sciences, bee they Grammar, Logick, or the rest, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diuinitie, which is the Arte of Arts, and Queene of Sciences, can either bee taught or learned without Precepts and Rules; And as it cannot be practised, so can it not bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood without speciall fit Rules to guide vs in the Interpretation. For the most of these Rules, especially such as bee deriued from ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I am beholden to <hi>Flaccius Illiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi> the rest I either collected out of later moderne writers, or by my owne obseruation. I haue also added an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all the Rules which bee drawne immediately out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: To the other, which be collected out of Ecelesiasticall Authors, I haue (for the most part) ioyned both Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

and Examples, to explane them the better. Some of these Rules doe further our vnderstanding in the Old: some in the New Testament: and some in both. Some of them will steed vs in the Doctrines, some in the words and formes of speeches vsed in the Scriptures: and some serue to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne vs in the studie and practise of the word. Whatsoeuer vse or worth they bee of, (which I verily hope will be much and manifold,) I dedicate them, to all the Faithfull whersoeuer throughout this land, dispersed.</p>

An answer is framed to my hand by <hi>Moses</hi> the

                     <hi>Dius</hi> an Historiographer of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> rehearseth the Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and Questions that <hi>Salomon</hi> sent to King <hi>Hiram,</hi> saying, that it cost him very much in that hee could not open them, vntill at length he found a yoong man of Tirus (named <hi>Abdenan</hi>) who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered to him the most part of


<pb facs="tcp:20776:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them: Poets write that Sphinix was wont to set forth a reward of freedom and libertie, to him that could absolue his Riddle.</p>
                  <p>We finde in the booke of Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that <hi>Sampson</hi> put forth a hard question, how meat could come out of the eater, and sweet out of the fierce? an elegant rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, consisting in contraries; for he that eateth, and he that giueth meat: also, he that is fierce and bitter, and he that is sweet, are opposites, of contrary natures; Hee also promised a reward to him that could read his riddle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ambrose</hi> (as he is cited by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martir</hi>) demanded the cause why <hi>Sampson</hi> made his probleme, and he saith, that because men in feasts, when they haue well drunke, are wont to be somewhat full of talke, and to rebuke others too intemperately, which for the most part turned to contention;


<pb facs="tcp:20776:72"/>
therefore to auoid that, graue men were wont to put forth rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles or problems, omitting dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous talke, and turning their mindes to the exposition of things put forth: whose example <hi>Sampson</hi> followed, and set a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for him that could open his question; to shew that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and sharpnesse of minde ought to be rewarded; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, ignorance and foolishnes ought to be shamed and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: thus farre are the words of <hi>Ambrose.</hi>
