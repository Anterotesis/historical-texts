         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O time can wear out the memory
of thoſe favours which I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from your hands; You were of
the firſt that gave me a viſit, when
few durſt adventure themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame roof, being by the good providence
of God, neceſſitated to leave a place ſorely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with the Peſtilence; and labouring under
a Feaver, wherewith preſently on my departure
God pleaſed to afflict me: and were eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the mean accommodations, which in thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:55700:3"/>
ſtraits could be provided for me and my reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
brother, with both our wives and families,
all caſt upon the ſame condition at that time; &amp;
you made it appear that your eyes affected your
hearts, in giving a free invitation to me, and
thoſe that had dependance upon me, to your
houſe, aſſoon as with ſecurity we durſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
over any mans threſhold, where for many
moneths we had free and liberal entertainment.
If <hi>Paul</hi> in an Epiſtle did remember the like from
<hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> (with ſpecial obſervation, that he
was not aſhamed of his chaine) my heart muſt
needs have checked me, if having opportunity
of Epiſtling according to received cuſtom, you
ſhould have been forgotten. <hi>I</hi> ſhall not be
aſhamed of the language of beggers, if they have
learnt it from ſuch a hand; <hi>The Lord grant unto
you, that ye may finde mercy from the Lord in that
day.</hi> In your houſe I had not only leiſure to
make a good progreſſe in this Work, but ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
accommodation from your accompliſht Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.
So that you have not only a deſerved
intereſt in the Author, but in the Work it ſelf;
upon ſight of one part, you have often called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me for publication of the whole. So that if
the Reader reap any benefit, he may ſee how
<pb facs="tcp:55700:3"/>
large a ſhare in the thanks is yours. I know you
affect not <hi>Panegyricks,</hi> neither am I fitted for
them, nor was ever accuſtomed to them. There
is much publiſhed to the world of one of you in
the life of your reverend Father, to whom I have
often in my thoughts applied that of Doctor
<hi>Hall</hi> concerning learned <hi>Whittaker; Who ever
ſaw him without reverence, or heard him without
wonder?</hi> Having led the Reader through his
glory, they adde: <hi>And yet his name with the
lively picture of his perſon lives, in his worthy
ſonne, Maſter</hi> Samuel Hilderſam; <hi>whoſe learning</hi>
Cambridge <hi>knew, when he was Fellow of Emmanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
Colledge; and whoſe preſent Miniſterial labours, and
pious converſation at Weſt</hi>-Felton <hi>in</hi> Shropſhire, <hi>do
perpetuate the honour of his Reverend Father; whoſe
memory he doth much reverence; and whoſe rich
vertues both perſonal and miniſteriall he doth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
imitate.</hi> And it is not little that is ſaid
of the other, where it is remembred, that
<hi>you were propounded by him, for a meet wife
for his deareſt ſonne;</hi> and recorded <hi>that he was
heard with affection to ingeminate theſe words;
Never man had a kinder daughter in Law.</hi> To
be a follower of ſuch a precident, and to be
found worthy of ſuch a Teſtimony, is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb facs="tcp:55700:4"/>
glory, than all the noble blood that ran
through the veines of the greateſt of either of

books wherewith the world is cloyed, it might be

me was how to proceed to the beſt advantage of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
conflicts are highly weariſome, and ungrateful, there
is much time ſpent with very little ſatisfaction to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
even where moſt ſatisfaction is given to an adverſarie
He muſt be followed in ſuch paths that he goes, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
are not very acceptable to the Reader to accompany.
And for the buſineſſe in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> the vindication of a
beleevers faederall holyneſſe till the ground work be right
laid, and well underſtood, the ſuperſtructure in any ſuch
diſpute (managed in the moſt dextrous way that is conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
will ſcarce ſettle thoſe that are weak, and not yet well
informed or eſtabliſhed. I judged it therefore a way moſt
ſatisfactory, and of greateſt and moſt probable hopes, for
the clearing, not only of this Controverſie, but many more
now in agitation, to adventure upon a full Treatiſe of the
Covenant, which God hath entered with man, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
diſpenſations, and diverſifications of it; whether ſuch
as were occaſioned by mans fall, or that God according to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55700:6"/>
his Sovereignty, by his juſt Prerogative hath been pleaſed
to order; where this is not in ſome meaſure clear, many
truths of great weight muſt needs lie obſcure. Maſter <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
words in his Preface to the Reader before his <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes</hi>
of Juſtification are very remarkable: <hi>It is not in ſtudies</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>as it is in manifactures, that one man may begin
where another left; but every man muſt fetch it from the very
principles himſelf, neither can we take the words of thoſe that
have ſtudied it before us for that is neither a ſound nor ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
knowledge</hi> (quoting Mr. <hi>Pemble,) thence it comes to paſſe
that while we are buſie in examining our fore fathers inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and poſterity imployed in trying our Examinations, neither
we nor they have much time to adde any thing for the encreaſe
of learned knowledge.</hi> Now the Covenant muſt needs be the
principle where we muſt begin to get knowledg of the ſeals
of the Covenant; This way therefore (reſting on divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance)
I have choſen, quickened to it as by the excellency
and great concernment of the ſubject, ſo alſo by the deſires
of many that this thing in a juſt Treatiſe might be handled;
And when my thoughts were moſt full of it, and buſieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, and ſome preparations made for the work; the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
by letter ſolicited, that I would enlarge my <hi>Birth-priviledge,</hi>
and ſit it to theſe preſent times, and he would ſee
it publiſhed; Hereupon I went on in the work (a Scheme of
which follows here in an Analytical Table) in which I have
received help from many (as my ſlender furniture, and
ſtrength with leaſure to attend the peruſal of them would
give leave) yet I have tied my ſelf to follow none; I think
there is ſcarce any thing in which I am ſingular, I have ſo
much childiſh fear as ſcarce to dare to wall in publick where
I am alone, yet in ſeveral things I ſhall be found to diſſent
from others, and thoſe of eminent name with whom I
ſhould bluſh to have any thoughts of compariſon: There
are diſſentings among thoſe that are of higheſt repute. In
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55700:6"/>
ſuch caſe no inferior can agree with both parties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt not be deemed any piece of arrogance or ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
to leave the one: where I am put to it to differ, the
Reader ſhall finde my reaſon, together with my opinoin. If
better light lead him another way, I ſhall never deſire that
he ſhall go with me blindfold, or leave the truth to have me
his companion, yet leaſt in leaving me, he ſhould let go the
truth it ſelf, I ſhall only requeſt an unprejudiced and unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſs'd
judgement; If he bring a blood-ſhot eye, all will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
of a wrong colour. It cannot be hoped but that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
through ſo many particulars, I ſhall meet with oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome hands; I would only let ſuch know firſt, that
I have made no man my adverſary out of will,<note place="margin">The Authours diſſent from ſome. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> as deſirous
to be a man of contentions. I ſometimes cloſe with my
greateſt adverſaries, and ſometimes diſſent from my moſt

me another way. 2. That I have wrote nothing but that

that have vented, but many yeers have held my thoughts,

I ſhall meet with ſuch dealing as I have found, to have my
words by enterchange made not mine, but the adverſaries
own, my Arguments miſrepreſented, and held out to the
halves; I ſhal give thoſe leave to hold up and purſue quarrels
with their own fancies. My years and employments, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55700:7"/>
with my weakneſſes, will be a ſufficient Apology to
hold me back from intermedling in ſuch trifles. And for the
Reader that would read for ſatisfaction, I would acquaint
him,</p>

                  <p>Scondly, That I have made it my ſtudie to leave out
no piece or part, which may be fairly looked for within this
Verge, but have endeavoured to take the whole into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
ſtudying to avoid two extreams, the one much
prejudicial to the Reader in Treatiſes of this nature, to
give us a bare skeleton of bones and ſinewes, leaving their
Readers to clothe them with skin and fleſh: Theſe ſerve
better to help their memories that are already ſeen in the
ſubject, then to help thoſe with ſatisfaction that are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
verſt in it, <hi>Memoriae mater ingenii noverca.</hi> I would
learned <hi>Ameſius</hi> in his <hi>Medulla Theologiae, Caſes of Conſcience,</hi>
and other learned Works, had not, affecting brevity, herein
been defective. Sure I am, the Reader might well wiſh, that
learned <hi>Camero's</hi> work <hi>De triplici foedere</hi> had by his own
hand been more inlarged, &amp; that he had ſpoken more fully;
where his Reader may ſee cauſe juſtly to cloſe with him, and
given in his Reaſons eſpecially in ſeveral differences (which
he aſſigns beteewn the Old (which he calls the ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Covenant) and the Covenant of Grace, where many
ſuppoſe they have cauſe to diſſent from him. The other
extream might be the Readers benefit, but would have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55700:7"/>
been my burthen, and that is an enlarged full diſcourſe on
every particular Divinity-head, that may occur in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of this Subject, a way which reverend Maſter <hi>Ball</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
I have heard it from thoſe that received it from
his own mouth, that his purpoſe was to ſpeak on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Covenant, all that he had to ſay in all the whole
body of Divinity; a work that the whole Church might
wiſh (had not Divine providence determined otherwiſe)
that he had enjoyed life to finiſh. That which he hath
left behinde gives us a taſte of it, and the advantage the
Church might have received by it. I have thought it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to handle each particular, ſo as might well anſwer
expectation in reference to the preſent ſubject: To ſpeak
of Chriſt as a Mediatour of the Covenant, and to ſet forth
the diſtinct parts of his work in ſuch mediation without
handling the whole of the work, and all the Offices inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to his Mediatorſhip: To ſpeak of his death ratifying
the Covenant of grace, waving the controverſie of the
extent of it, in the intention of God, or purpoſe of
Chriſt; It is ſufficient to me to aſſert Faith to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Covenant neceſſary to be put in by us to
attain the mercies in the Covenant, to ſpeak of it ſo far
as is here concerned without a large Treatiſe of the nature,
requiſites, and life of it; ſo I may ſay of godly ſorrow, ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
from ſin, ſincerity of obedience, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thoſe particulars relating to this ſubject, which
are moſt controverted, and in this age diſputed, I have ſpoke
to more at large; to inſtance in ſome. The conditions of
the Covenant of Grace, as well to the <hi>an ſint?</hi> whether
there be any ſuch conditions at all? which in our times by
ſeveral hands out of ſeveral Principles is denyed; Or the
<hi>Quae ſint?</hi> what theſe conditions be? laying down rules and
helps for the better diſcovery of them. The ſuppoſed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
between the old and new, Whether ſuch that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55700:8"/>
injurie to the Covenant, under which the Fathers lived,
under <hi>Moſes</hi> his adminiſtration, or before his dayes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it a meer carnal Covenant, conſiſting of temporal
promiſes, as the poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
there, or at the leaſt a mixt Covenant, and no pure
Goſpel-Covenant, and the ſeals ſuitable? Or ſuch that
put too great a limit to the Covenant in Goſpel-times ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
it onely in the elect regenerate, excluding all profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ones not yet regenerate, not onely from Covenant-mercies,
but all Covenant-terms, not admitting any to
ſtand in any relation to God, but thoſe only whom his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath changed, making the call of God in the largeſt ſenſe
convertible with Election, and the ſeal of Baptiſm to be of
no greater latitude (unleſſe by miſtake miſ-applied) than the
ſeal of the Spirit, and determining it in the perſons of the
elect (about which the meer congregational men and the
Antipoedobaptiſts agreeing in the former, do differ) that
they excluding the ſeed, and leaving them in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
(hope of education excepted) with the Heathens:
In theſe and ſome others, as the Reader may meet withall,
I have been more large, in ſuch things where all agree, or
where it much skills not, whether we agree or differ (as in
what place, whether on earth, or heaven, man had enjoyed
immortality in caſe he had not ſinned) what need we to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
matter of contention, our work is to make up brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
(were it poſſible, ſo far as it may ſtand with truth) and
not to widen them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I have not ſo tied up my ſelf to the expreſſe
immediate doctrine of the covenant, but that I have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
drawn Corollaries or Inferences leading to other
things of neer relation to, and neceſſary dependance upon
this of the Covenant; I ſhall not need to give inſtance,
the Reader all along will meet with them, ſuch as I thought
would be uſeful, and to the judicious not ungrateful, ſome
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55700:8"/>
of them practical, that the whole of the Book might not
be found to be Polemical, ayming at leaſt at that which
the Poet ſo cries up—<hi>Omne tulit punctum, qui miſcuit u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lci.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, For that part in which <hi>Infant-Baptiſme</hi> and its
grounds are particularly vindicated from <hi>Antipoedobaptiſts,</hi>
the Reader may ſee their arguments and corrupt gloſſes
are examined, onely as (according to my method laid
down) I have been neceſſitated, and ſo, that the Covenant
had not been vindicated according to my duty, in caſe that
had been neglected; And here thoſe that pleaſe to heed
may ſee; Firſt, the dependance that this Controverſie about
<hi>Infant-Baptiſme</hi> hath on the doctrine of the Covenant;
that a Scripture Covenant cannot be aſſerted, but Infant-Member-ſhip,
Infant-Baptiſme in the latitude, as now ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
uſed by Paſtors in their Congregations, muſt be
upheld. Secondly, the order in which this controverſie is
here carried, may ſo much the rather invite the Reader to
it, ſeeing what is in oppoſite Authors laid down ſcattering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without regard to any head of doctrine in the Covenant
to which it doth relate, here it is reduced to its proper place,
and carried on in that manner as an orderly Treatiſe, and
not a perſonal conflict; following adverſaries no farther
than as they ſtand in the way, to cloud the truth that is there
proſecuted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though many advantages are hereby neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
that might have been taken, which adverſaries uſe
to proſecute to the uttermoſt, and theſe adverſaries would
to the height have improved; yet I am very well pleaſed,
making it my buſineſſe, that my Reader may not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
but edified. Thirdly, the Scriptures that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and ordinarily agitated in this controverſie of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm,
are not only urged, but a juſt Analyſis of
the context opened, the full ſcope and drift laid down, ſo
that it may appeare that the words are not enforced, but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55700:9"/>
of themſelves in their native ſtrength commend that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to us; that of <hi>Jerome, Apol. adverſus Jovinian</hi> much
takes with me, <hi>Commentatoris officium eſt, non quod ipſe velit,
ſed quid ſentiat ille quem interpretatur exponere; Alioqui ſi
contraria dixerit, non tam interpres erit quàm adverſarius e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
quem nititur explanare;</hi> And let the impartial and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
judge whether ſomewhat more cleare light is not here
added to their full meaning and the adverſaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sophiſmes
more cleerly detected. Fourthly. The leaſt blow which Mr.
<hi>Tombes</hi> received (purpoſely intended for him) was from Mr.
<hi>Baxters</hi> hand, which work contains many irrefragable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to aſſert Infants Church-Memberſhip, and Baptiſm
from ſeveral Scripture-Texts, if not of themſelves plain, yet
made plain, ſo that he needs not bluſh at his Title; but
he doth not make it: his buſineſſe fully to anſwer Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on the contrary, where he is moſt full, I have been
moſt brief; where he is moſt brief, I have been more large;
he hath ſatisfied his Reader, I hope the Reader will ſay that
I have in that part done ſomewhat for ſatisfaction of my
adverſary.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The laſt part of this Treatiſe (as the advice
on the top of the leaf may ſignifie) is no more than a new
Edition of, with an ample addition to my <hi>Birth-priviledge,</hi>
which above my expectation found ſo good acceptation,
onely handling it there Sermon-wiſe, as fixt on a proper
Text, and here by way of Treatiſe, as a branch of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Covenant, I was put to it in a great part to
change the methodand texture of it, ſo that it may rather
ſeem to thoſe that compare them, a new frame, with much
borrowed from it, than the ſame reprinted and enlarged;
and there I have endeavoured ſatisfaction to that which
ſome have ſaid in the way, admitting Infants not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Parents-priviledges, but qualification: not
as they ſtand in relation to God, but as they fill up their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55700:9"/>
relation, which new limit I hope I have diſcovered to
be unwarrantably put, caſting thoſe out which the
Church (according to the mind of God) from <hi>Abraham</hi>
to this time hath received, to the diſquiet of our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and multiplication of our ſad, and deplorable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, I have made it my buſineſſe to avoid all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies
and unneceſſary dilatations, being ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to ſpeak <hi>multa in paucis,</hi> and not to put the Reader to
paines to finde out a little which may ſerve his purpoſe
in much, affecting brevity ſo farre as may be without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity:
In all which, I ſhall only requeſt two things of
the Reader, and both of them ſuch that God himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">A double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt made to the Reader.</note> Not to have the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the
Lord of glory with reſpect of perſons, that he do not take
an eſtimate of doctrinal points, or controverted opinions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the outward garb in which men appear, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of any dignity, relation power, or any ſuch circumſtance
whatſoever; If this once prevail, opinions will be taken up,
not according to the ſtrength of truth, that is ſeen in them,
but according to the quality of him that vents them; they
will judge of the faith by the men, not of the men by the
faith, and upon this account on all hands truth is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
And as men in their reputations ebbe and flow, their
judgements of things muſt hold up or fall. Truths ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
will be caſt off, barely on the low repute, and meane
condition of ſuch that do deliver them: Though Chriſt
ſpake as never man ſpake, and al treaſures of wiſdome were
hid in him, yet it was enough againſt him that he was a
Carpenters ſon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 55: that none of the Phariſees
and Rulers beleeved in him, or ſided with him, <hi>John</hi> 7. 48.
A poor man may ſave a City, and never the leſſe his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
deſpiſed, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 16. ſometimes becauſe they are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55700:10"/>
not men of our intereſts that hold it, they make not up
a party for us. The more conſiderable the intereſt is,
the greater the hazard (in theſe caſes) truth runnes. <hi>Paul</hi>
being brought before a Councel, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. had not a man of
whom we can read for him, but all againſt him, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
becauſe it did not appear that his opinions ſerved any of
their Intereſts; when he obſerved this, and ſaw their Intereſts
divided, and that his adverſaries made two parties, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
himſelf to be for the Intereſt of the one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in point of the Reſurrection to be for the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
againſt the Sadduces, bred up in that way, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted;
hereupon having not a friend before, now he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
<hi>There aroſe a great cry, and the Scribes that were of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
part aroſe, and ſtrove, ſaying, We find no fault in this man,
but if a ſpirit, or an Angel hath ſpoken to him, let us not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God,</hi> Verſe 9. now and not before he muſt be heard.
Upon the ſame terms that truth is caſt off, errour is received
and taken in, nothing muſt be gainſaid, that men of name, &amp;
men of Intereſt will appear to own; yea, relations, kindred,
and affections this way gained, are mightily prevalent, to
work into Faction and take up Tenents. As diſeaſes many
times run in a blood; ſo alſo opinions where they take in a
kindred, often very few eſcape. Twenty Sermons, were <hi>Paul,</hi>
yea, Jeſus Chriſt in the Pulpit, would not ſo take to
ſettle men in the truth, as one poor Letter, or
ſimple ſenſeleſſe three-pennie Pamphlet from the
hand of a childe, a brother, or ſiſter will work to
draw into Errour. I will not here undertake to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
who are meant by children in that ſpeech of our
Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> 12. 27. It appears that
it ſpake ſome relation, that drew affections, and
therefore whereas Chriſt is cenſured to caſt out Devils
by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the chief of Devils, when any of theſe
do ſuch a work, they are cryed up in another manner.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55700:10"/>
It was a true Obſervation of him that ſaid, <hi>Omnia diota

                  <p>The ſecond requeſt of mine is, that men take heed of
having mens perſons in admiration, becauſe of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
we have ſeen the miſchief that reſpect of perſons

That way that men can either ſave themſelves from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and hold where they are, or riſe up to a greater height,
the world is apt to take, and the Religion of that ſide ſhall
be theirs. Hence it is, that when godlineſſe ought to be

and ſtate Religion is almoſt the faith of every man. Thoſe

depart the leaſt from the very height of their own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for it, but they will have all others upon account of
their prevalency come into it: ſo that <hi>ſelf</hi> is no other than

ſaw that that was a mighty motive to draw a party in war,
to have the gift of vineyards, and oliveyards, to be the
fountain of honour, able to make Captaines over thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
hundreds, fifties. It is no leſſe to draw on a party
in Religion, as every turne of State reſpective to Religion
is a clear evidence: If theſe ſtumble upon truth, they yet,
hold it upon ſuch carnal motives, that they are neither true
to it, nor receive the comfort of it: Make truth then the
greateſt advantage, there is glory enough in it, without
any farther garb to have it in admiration: own it though
with a ſcracht face where you find it; though you be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
at loſſe, it will bring an hundred-fold with it.
If I can but gain theſe things at thy hands, I ſhall not

vertantur.</hi> The great myſteries of Religion, thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Beamings of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe which
were ſhed abroad, for the begetting of ſpiritual heat
and life in the beleeving heart, were often eclipſed, and
their influence much debilitated, through the intervening
body of cloudy Controverſies. This way Satan gained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Church in its Infancy, which gave occaſion to that
good admonition, we have upon record from the bleſſed
Apoſtle, Heb. 13. 9. <hi>Be not carryed about with diverſe and
ſtrange doctrines, for it is a good thing that the heart be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
with grace;</hi> What theſe <hi>diverſe</hi> and <hi>strange doctrines</hi>
were, Interpreters have their different thoughts, which I
ſhall wholly wave; the Reader may yet obſerve the Apoſtle
hinting at, and tacitely reproving, the proneneſſe that was
in men eagerly to purſue, ſtudiouſly to ſweat, and tug a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
empty notions, whileſt the ſpiritual ſenſe, and feeling
of truth in the heart, was little heeded. The ſame Apoſtle
traces Satan in the ſame deſign among the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Cap.
2. Which puts him upon that pathetical exhortation, Cap. 3.
To <hi>ſeek the things that are above,</hi> to lay out their zeal, and
centre their affections upon things of a more ſolid, ſublime,
and ſpiritual nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the application of Chriſt in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55700:12"/>
power of his death, and precious in-comes of his Spirit for
the mortification of luſt. What unſpeakable advantage this
continued enemy of a beleevers life and comfort hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our age (not to mention the ſpoyles made in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening)
our preſent breaches, ſad decays, two
fully evidence; yea, ſo fully, that did not a graciory
word uphold, and everlaſting armes fix themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath,
our ruines had been uncapable, of any further
breach. In the midſt of theſe aſtoniſhing providences,
and terrible diſpenſations, the Lord (ſuch is his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and goodneſſe) hath brought forth meat out of the
ſtrong, and honey, out of the deſtroyer. Theſe windy
ſtormes have through rich grace more deeply rooted ſome,
whileſt others have been toſſed to, and fro; theſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
colliſſions have brought forth much light; thus Satan
lyes bleeding under his own weapons. Among other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
treaſures which the Church through mercy doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
here thou mayeſt ſee truths of the greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to beleevers polemically vindicated, practically im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
that mens judgments might be ballanced, and their
hearts feel the weight of truth, both which neceſſarily make
up a beleevers acquaintance with the truths of Chriſt as they
are <hi>in him.</hi> The Covenant of grace both in its ſure mercies,
and diſtinguiſhing priviledges, is a truth of the greateſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
appearing rather as a glorious conſtellation, than
ſhining with the light of a ſingle ſtarre; It is a rich Cabinet
of Diamonds, rather than any ſingle jewel. How far the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Authour (my ever Honoured and endeared Father)
hath been ſerviceable in the hands of Chriſt for the unſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this rich Cabinet, the abundant acceptance which
this Treatiſe found from men eminently judicious, when it
was wrapped up in the ſwadling bands of blurred papers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it went abroad, doth fully ſpeak. I need not adde thoſe
many ſpecial acknowledgments from ſome of the ableſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55700:12"/>
pens in the Nation, which after the Authors death were
found upon the file in his ſtudy; much might be ſpoken by
me, did not my relation to him command a ſilence; the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Princes tongue would break no bonds; when violence
was offered to his father; give me leave to apply that to the
Reverend Author, which ſometimes was obſerved of the
<hi>Athenian</hi> Orator, that in his publique diſcourſes, he did not

And if I may without envy adde holy <hi>Melancthons</hi> pythy
verſe upon <hi>Luthers</hi> picture, <hi>Fulmina erant linguae ſingula
verba tuae.</hi> But I ſhall forbear, craving only thy patience,
in receiving an account, how far thy gain will be doubled,
in this ſecond Edition: In the <hi>firſt,</hi> the Learned Author was
neceſſitated to take notice of ſeveral controverſies, which
were then ſtarted, theſe afterwards growing more perſonal
(&amp; therefore only beautiful in their ſeaſon) are in <hi>this</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
waved, and truths aſſerted in <hi>Theſi.</hi> In the <hi>firſt,</hi> ſeveral
expreſſions (through the natural brevity of the Authours
ſtile) were obſcure, and occaſioned the readers ſtumbling,
In <hi>this</hi> they receive an additional light, what paſſages might
ſeem abſtruſe, now are enlarged. In the <hi>firſt</hi> the method was
unavoidably clouded in ſeveral places through digreſſions,
and appendices, In <hi>this</hi> each head is digeſted in its proper
place. In the <hi>firſt,</hi> ſeveral things were omitted which now
upon ſecond thoughts, and deeper wading into the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
herein handled, are by the learned Authour in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted;
And the whol of this don by the Authors own hand,
which he had no ſooner taken off, and ſent it to the Preſſe,
but the Lord diſpatched a fiery chariot for him, which took
him away to the enjoyment of <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf; what thou read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of him now, was ſealed with his death. They that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his ſtate, and frame of ſpirit in that juncture
of time when it was finiſhed, muſt needs teſtifie, there was
no room for any carnal end to byaſſe, or ſelf-intereſt to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55700:13"/>
ſteer his notions. Reſpective to the doctrine here aſſerted,
I ſhall aſſure thee from the mouth of this bleſſed Author,
that as he ſweetly laid down his life, in clear, and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
aſſurance of glory, ſo he dyed without the leaſt Scruple
in any of the truths here vindicated. I ſhall no longer enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thee in the porch, but give thee poſſeſſion of the houſe,
craving only thy Candor in the peruſal of it; orphane chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
though under the eye and care of endearing friends, yet
ſometimes may feel the want of a parental wing, I am not
without fears that this Orphane Treatiſe, may complain of
ſom Errata's, through the Authors unexpected death, the ſlow
progreſſe of the Preſſe, and my great diſtance from it. The
God of truth teach thee how to profit, break every ſhell,
that thou mayeſt taſte of the kernel, clear up truths to thy
apprehenſion, and imprint them upon thy heart, ſo prayes
he, who beggs thy prayers for him, becauſe he is</p>

with it. This Tropical figurative, and the native proper ſenſe
muſt be carefully diſtinguiſhed, and may by no meanes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
by thoſe that will underſtand the true nature of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and avoid thoſe manifold miſtakes, into which ſome up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this a lone account have been carried:<note place="margin">Figurative ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the word Covenant.</note> The figurative accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the word, are diverſe, ſometimes the homage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
or duty covenanted for, is called a covenant by way of
Synechdoche, ſeeing a covenant between a Superiour and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
doth comprize it, ſo <hi>Jerem. 34. 13. I made a Covenant with
your fathers, in the day that I brought them out of the Land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
which Covenant is no other then the Law that he gave
them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 2. Sometimes the promiſe annext, is called by
the name of a covenant, by a like Synechdoche, Gen. 17. 7. <hi>I
will eſtabliſh my covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after
thee, in their generations for an everlaſting covenant, to be a God
unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee, Gen.</hi> 9. 11. Sometimes the
Seal is called by the name of a Covenant, by way of Metonymy of
the adjunct, ſerving to ratifie and confirme a covenant, <hi>Gen. 17. 10.
This is my covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and
thy ſeed after thee, every man-childe among you ſhall be circumciſed.</hi>
Sometimes Chriſt the Mediatour of the covenant is called by a
like figure, the covenant, <hi>Iſa. 42. 6, 7. I will give thee for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of the people, and light unto the Gentiles.</hi> Sometimes the
Lord Chriſts undertaking, to work the graces covenanted for, in
the hearts of his people, in the way of his power, exerted in the
converſion of ſinners, is called by the name of a covenant, <hi>Jerem.
31. 33. This is the covenant that I will make with the whole houſe of
Iſrael, after thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their
inward parts, and write it in their hearts;</hi> of which more in its
own place. Sometimes a covenant is taken for that peace, which
uſually followes upon covenants, <hi>Job 5. 23. Thou ſhalt be
in league with the ſtones of the field, and the beaſts of the field ſhall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55700:19"/>
be at peace with thee,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 18. <hi>In that day I will make a covenant
for them with the beaſts of the field, and with the fowles of heaven, and
with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the bowe,
and the ſword, and the battel out of the earth, and will make them to
lie down ſafely.</hi> When yet neither a Law, nor a Promiſe, nor
Seal annext, nor yet the Mediatour, or any undertaking of his,
can be a covenant properly ſo called. A Law from God with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
annext, aſſented to by man, is a covenant; and when a Seal
is added, there is a condeſcenſion to our weakneſſe, for the more
abundant ratification and confirmation of Gods ſtability in his
Promiſes. In our enquiry after ſuch covenants, which God in his
gracious condeſcenſion is pleaſed to enter with man the general
nature of a covenant muſt be held, every <hi>species</hi> muſt partake of
its <hi>Genus;</hi> We muſt not make Gods covenant with man, ſo farre
to differ, from covenants between man and man, as to make it no
covenant at all; we muſt alſo obſerve that which differences it
from covenants meerly humane, that covenants divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
be not confounded together. In order to which we muſt
know that in every covenant properly ſo called, theſe requiſites
muſt concur.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Requiſites in a Covenant.</note> it muſt not be of one alone, but at leaſt of two parties,
one can make no bargain or agreement. Secondly, there muſt
be a mutual conſent of theſe parties. When <hi>Nahaſh</hi> the Ammonite,
offered to make a Covenant with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> on condition that he
might thruſt out all their right eyes, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. the Iſraelites
refuſing and running the hazard of a fight, rather then undergo
it, here was no covenant. Thirdly, each party muſt engage
themſelves one to another, for performance of ſomewhat cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
for, whether debt, duty, or promiſe. When <hi>Abraham</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
with the Hittites for a burial place for foure hundred She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 15, 16. There was a covenant properly ſo called,
having apparently in it all requiſites of a covenant. So alſo in
<hi>Jeremies</hi> purchaſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 10. and the Levites hiring of himſelfe
to do the office of a Prieſt, <hi>Judg. 17. 10. Micah</hi> and he mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agree, he is to do the office of a Prieſt, and <hi>Micah</hi> is to pay his
covenant-wages; ſo that he hit right of the nature of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that defined it to be <hi>A mutual agreement between parties
upon Articles or Propoſitions on both ſides, ſo that each partie is tied
and bound to perform his own conditions.</hi> This holds forth the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55700:20"/>
nature of a covenant, and is common to all covenants,
publick and private, divine or humane, differencing it firſt from
a Law or Precept, where there is a command out of ſovereignty
propounded, without any obligation or engagement on the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
or Commander. Secondly, from a ſingle promiſe, where
there is a ſignification of the will of him that makes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
touching ſome good to him to whom the promiſe is made,
without any reſtipulation, from him; And to let paſſe ſeveral
Diviſions of covenants, little pertinent to our purpoſe (which
may be ſeen in Civilians and Politians, particularly in <hi>Grotius
lib. 2. De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis, cap.</hi> 15.) and to ſpeak to ſuch, which
may give ſome light to the preſent work. Covenans of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
properly ſo called, are either between equals, where either
party may indifferently indent with other,<note place="margin">Diſtinctions of Covenants.</note> neither ſtanding enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to other, otherwiſe then by covenant, as in the inſtances
before, mentioned. The Prieſt was not engaged to officiate for
<hi>Micah,</hi> nor <hi>Micah</hi> to give money or rayment to the Prieſt, but
by, vertue of contract, one was the others equal, in regard of
any dependance one upon the other. Or elſe they are between
Superiour and Inferiour, the Superiour condeſcending to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour,
to deale by way of covenant, when yet the whole that
is required by him, is of debt, and might without agreement or
ſtipulation be required and exacted. This ſuperiority and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority,
is either mixt and imperfect, or elſe it is abſolute and
ſovereigne: Mixt and imperfect ſuperiority, and inferiority, is,
between parent and childe, maſter and ſervant, equal in
being, but Superiour and Inferiour in relation; Of this nature was
that of <hi>Iſaac</hi> with <hi>Eſau,</hi> Gen. 27. 34. <hi>Take I pray thee thy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
thy quiver and thy bowe, and go out to the field to take me ſome
veniſon, and make me ſavoury meat, ſuch as I love, that my ſoul may
bleſſe thee before I die; Eſau</hi> was tied as a childe to do what
<hi>Iſaac</hi> required, though he had hinted or promiſed no bleſſing;
Superiority and Inferiority, abſolute and ſovereigne, is only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and his creature, no other is an abſolute Superiour;
and ſuch is the covenant, when God enters covenant. It is of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
that God makes a Law; It is of condeſcenſion and
goodneſſe that he enters covenant, in which man may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
but muſt accept, profeſſedly accepting, and in ſincerity of
heart performing, what God in covenant demands; yet it is a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55700:20"/>
covenant, and properly ſo called, that he enters with his creature,
eſpecially that which he enters with mankind, having all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients,
and fore-named requiſites of a covenant, as in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
(God willing) ſhall be demonſtrated. God is engaged to
retribution, and man to fealty, and either of both by conſent.
Covenants between any parties, whether Superiour and Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
or equals among themſelves, are either ſimply and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch without any farther ſolemnity, or ceremony, or any thing
more then is eſſentially neceſſary in a Covenant, a mutual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
between each other on ſuch termes and propoſitions
as are mutually agreed. Or elſe they are covenants with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ceremonies, ſolemnities, wayes of ratification and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation;
as inſtances might be given in covenants, both hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and divine; As the committing the words of the Covenant
to writing <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 10. Calling in witneſſes, in the ſame place,

covenant which God pleaſes to enter
with man, eſpecially with fallen man, under which we are,

for his ſervice, or at all to have underſtood the iſſue and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55700:21"/>
yet he is pleaſed to wave ſuch right, and to deal by way
of covenant, and that in this way here mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſons why God deals with man in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-way.</note> That his people might be willing in the day of his power,
<hi>Pſalme</hi> 110. 3. Obedience extorted, contributes not that honour
to him, whom we obey, we confeſſe a neceſſity in our ſelves to

bond man ſerves his maſter, one volunteer that goes out of
choice, more honours an expedition, then ten that are preſt by
power for ſervice, only waiting an opportunity by ſlealth, out of
diſlike, as <hi>Davids</hi> ſouldiers out of ſhame, to quit the ſervice,
<hi>I Sam.</hi> 19. 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to vanquiſh all temptations, and overcome all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
that may occurre in mans way of obedience; <hi>Adam</hi> in
innocency was foiled by a temptation, which he had overcome, in
caſe he had heeded the terms of the covenant, the curſe that was
threatened, and the promiſe that was contained in it; man in his
fallen eſtate undergoes many tryals, and is encountered with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of temptations, had he not a word on which he might hope, a
word of promiſe in way of covenant from God; he could not ſtand,
but of neceſſity muſt periſh.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that love rather then fear might principle man in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
as ſeeing more of goodneſſe to induce, then of wrath to
ſcare him into it; God will have his ſervants, ſons. The free honour
of a childe to his father, rather then the compulſory fear of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
pleaſes him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for the aggravation of ſinne; The more of condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
goodneſſe, bounty, and love appears, in Gods way of dealing;
the more of equity is ſeen, and the more ingratitude and folly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in mans diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, for mans greater conſolation; An up-right-hearted
man findes abundance of peace, in his covenant entered with
God; when he prayes and ſeeks the greateſt mercy in prayer, he
is able to ſay, <hi>In thy faithfulneſſe anſwer me, and in thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
Pſal. 143. 1. <hi>Paul</hi> can ſay, that <hi>God the righteous Judge ſhall
give him a Crown of righteouſneſſe,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8. Having engaged
by covenant, righteouſneſſe ties him to make good his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
This is Gods end, in his entrance of covenant, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of it by oath, conſequently, in committing it to writing,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55700:21"/>
and confirming it by ſeal; <hi>That by two immuntable things in which
it was impoſſible for God to lie, we might have a ſtrong conſolation,
who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us,</hi> Heb.
6. 18. Theſe ſtrong conſolations were the end of God, in rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his Covenant, They are the ſupport, and Spirit reviving cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
to his people in Covenant; See the reſult of the Pſalmiſts
meditations, <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy
comforts delight my ſoul,</hi> Pſalme 94. 19. <hi>I will both lay me down in
peace and ſleep, for thou, Lord, only makeſt me dwell in ſafety,</hi> Pſalme
4. 8. <hi>The Lord is my light and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I feare?
The Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom ſhall I be afraid?</hi> Pſal.
27. 1.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, for the greater terrour of the adverſaries of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when they ſee themſelves engaged againſt them, and God
ſtands in a covenant unviolable engaged for them; when they
ſee, that their work is to ruinate and deſtroy him that God will
ſave. Hence it is while their Rock ſells them not, one of them
chaſes a thouſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight, <hi>Deut. 32.
30. Paul</hi> in bonds can make <hi>Felix</hi> tremble on his Throne, <hi>Acts
24. 25. Hamans</hi> wiſe-men, and <hi>Zereſh</hi> his wife ſpake words of
terrour, upon experiment made, <hi>If Mordecai be of the ſeed of the
Jews, before whom thou haſt begun to fall, thou ſhalt not
prevaile against him, but ſhalt ſurely fall before him,</hi> Eſter
6. 13.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, the Lord hereby puts a name, and an honour upon his
people. <hi>David</hi> took it to be an honour to be related to <hi>Saul,</hi>
and, ſo to become the ſonne of a King, much more then, is it an
honour to be brought into this relation to God. This honour
have all the Saints, and they are taken into covenant for honour
ſake, <hi>The Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as he hath promiſed thee, and that thou ſhouldeſt keep all his
Commandments; and to make thee high above all Nations which he
hath made, in praiſe, and in honour, and that thou mayeſt be an holy
people to the Lord thy God,</hi> Deut. 26. 18, 19. They are, the portion,
the inheritance, the children, the eſpouſed ones, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
elſe that ſpeaks a neer relation is theirs.</p>
                  <p>This was Gods way of dealing (I doubt not) with the Angels
though (we being not intereſted in it) there is no neceſſity that
it ſhould be written for our learning: Sure we are, it was his way
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55700:22"/>
of dealing with man, as well before his fall, (as preſently ſhall be
ſhewn) as out of more abundant grace and condeſcenſion for
his reſtitution. And not mentioning for preſent any more,
then that which is eſſential in the covenant, of God with man,
I ſuppoſe it may be thus held out to us:<note place="margin">The Covenant between God and Man defined.</note> 
                     <hi>A mutual compact or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
between God and man upon juſt and equal termes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by himſelf, in which God promiſes true happineſſe to man, and
man engages himſelf by promiſe for performance of what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</hi>
This deſcription here laid down, comprizes the way of
God, in every one of his covenants with man both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his fall, under Old and New Teſtament-revelations, all that
is eſſential in any covenant that he enters; Equals covenanting
do either of them article and indent, but God condeſcending to a
covenant, man muſt not article, but muſt aſſent, and engage
for performance of what is preſcribed, otherwiſe it will hear the
nature of a Law, but not of a Covenant. It is true, all men are
bound upon tender from God, to accept; It was the ſin of Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
and heatheniſh people, to ſtand out whenſoever the Goſpel
was preached; but they were no covenant-people till they gave
their aſſent, and then they were received as a covenant-people,
and baptized. Exceptions cannot be taken againſt, or challenge
made of this definition of covenants in general, nor of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
which God in particular entereth with man; and theſe
ſtanding, they will give us light, and afford us ſingular help for a
right underſtanding of the covenant of God, entered with
man in the ſeveral ſpecies, and diſtinct wayes of adminiſtration
of it.</p>

the latter, is, called a <hi>covenant of Grace,</hi> though indeed, the fountain,
and firſt riſe of either, was the free grace, and favour of God.
For howſoever the firſt covenant was on condition of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and engaged to the reward of Works, yet it was of Grace,
that God made any ſuch promiſe, of reward to any work of man,
when man had done all (even in that eſtate) which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
he was ſtill an unprofitable ſervant, he had done no
more then duty, and no emolument did thence accrew to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
It was enough that he was upheld, and ſuſtained of God in
the work, to live in him, and upon him, when the work was done he
might have been juſtly annihilated. If merit be taken in a proper
ſenſe, <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency was too low for it, all his work being
an homage due, no profit redounding to God, and the work
bearing no proportion to the reward. But a more ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

that lies in the way, is to be removed, otherwiſe, not only,
all that which I have ſaid; but alſo, all that which I ſhall ſpeak

promiſes, by way of legacy bequeathed life and ſalvation to
him, but hath entred no covenant properly ſo called (as theſe

good, is to prove from Scripture the name and the thing, that
the word <hi>Covenant</hi> is there, and the thing, in the proper nature
of it, which the words hold out; and all of this reſpective to
the tranſactions between God and fallen man. The word we
finde in places without number, it were a needleſſe labour to
give inſtances, when every Reader is able to furniſh himſelf with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55700:23"/>
ſuch multitudes. But when this cannot be denyed, the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of the ſpeech is objected. It is called by the name of a
Covenant (as is ſaid) when in ſtrict propriety of ſpeech, it is no
covenant; But to avoid this, the thing it ſelf may be as eaſily
proved as the word, and when we have <hi>nomen,</hi> and <hi>nominis ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
then we have a covenant, not equivocally not yet analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
but properly ſo called. And here I may deal liberally with
any adverſary, and undertake to make proof, not only of all the
eſſentials of ſuch a covenant in Scripture, but the uſual adjuncts,
not onely of all, that makes up the nature, but all acceſſories u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
added to the ſolemnity of covenants. The eſſentials or
real properties of a covenant, are contained in the uſual definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which afterwards we ſhall ſee laid down from ſeveral hands,
all of which are in ſhort compriſed in theſe words, <hi>A mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of parties with ſtipulation on both ſides.</hi> Parties, conſent, and
mutual engagement is all that is required to the ſame being of a
covenant; when two parties agree, and either of them both, have
their conditions to make good, there is a covenant or bargaine;
ſee it exemplified in ſeveral inſtances given, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. All of theſe
we finde in that one place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17, 18, 19. in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
that God enters with his people, <hi>Thou haſt avouched the
Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his wayes, and to keep his
Statutes, and his Commandments, and his Judgements, and to
hearken to his voice: And the Lord hath avouched thee this day
to be his peculiar people, as he hath promiſed thee, and that
thou ſhouldeſt keep all his Commandments; And to make thee high
above all Nations which he hath made, in praiſe, and in name, and
in honour; and that thou mayeſt be an holy people unto the Lord thy
God, as he hath ſpoken.</hi> There are the Covenanters, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>his
people;</hi> There is conſent on both parties, <hi>Thou hast avouched,
the Lord hath avouched;</hi> And there is a <hi>ſtipulation</hi> on both
ſides; On Gods part, <hi>To make them high above all Nations; which
he hath made, in praiſe, and in name, and in honour:</hi> On the
peoples part, <hi>To keep all his Commandments, to be an holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
There are covenant-mercies from God to his people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which of grace he engages himſelf; and there are covenant-duties
unto which man ſtands engaged, <hi>Pſal. 103. 17, 18. But the
mercie of the Lord is from euerlaſting to everlaſting, upon them that
fear him, and his righteouſneſſe unto childrens children; to ſuch as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55700:24"/>
keep his Covenant, and to thoſe that remember his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

of it. 1. Covenants uſed to be written<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for memorial for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
and ſo is the covenant, between God and man, as in Old,
ſo in New Teſtament-times. <hi>Theſe things are written that you
might believe, and that believing you may have everlaſting life,</hi>
John 20. 31. 2. Covenants uſed to be confirmed with <hi>outward
viſible ſignes,</hi> as the killing of beaſts, <hi>Gen. 15. Jer.</hi> 34. this was done
in the old adminiſtration, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. Half of the blood was ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon the Altar, to denote Gods entering of Covenant, <hi>verſ.</hi>
6. The people alſo were ſprinkled with blood, to ſhew their
voluntary entring into covenant, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. And in the new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
a new and unheard of ratification was uſed, the blood
of the Mediatour of the Covenant, <hi>Math. 26. 27, 28. This
Cup is my blood in the New Teſtament, which was ſhed for you, and
for many, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> This latter is a plain alluſion to
the former, in which you may finde. 1. A threefold agreement.
Either of both theſe were covenants. 2. Either of both theſe,
had their ratifications and confirmations. 3. Either of both were
confirmed with blood. 2. A threefold difference. 1. The former
was the Old covenant, which was antiquated; This is the New.
2. The former was ratified, and ſanctified with the blood of beaſts:
This is ratified and ſanctified, in the blood of Chriſt. 3. That blood
could never take away ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. This was ſhed for many, for
remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, covenants uſe to be confirmed by <hi>ſeal:</hi> ſo, is, this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
between God and his people, which is to be ſpoken to
elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>As the being of a covenant is thus plentifully proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-teſtimony, ſo we might as amply prove it by arguments
drawn from thence.<note place="margin">Arguments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the proper nature of it.</note> The Churches of Chriſt are eſpouſed unto
Chriſt, <hi>Hoſ. 2. 19, 20. And I will betroth thee unto me for ever;
yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſſe, and in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in loving kindneſſe, and in mercies; I will even betroth
thee unto me in faithfulneſſe, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi>
2 Cor. 11. 2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one husband, that I may

54. 5. Thy Maker is thine Husband, the Lord of hoſts is his Name,
and thy Redeemer the holy One of Iſrael, the God of the whole earth
ſhall he be called.</hi> And wives are in covenant with their husbands.
Their ſinnes againſt God are branded with the names of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Whoredomes; and theſe are not barely diſ-obedience of a
Command, or neglect of a favour, but breaches of covenant.
The Churches of Chriſt are ſervants of Chriſt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. houſhold
ſervants, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 19. and ſervants are their Maſters by covenant.
Their ſinnes in this relation are not barely obſtinacy, ſtubbornneſs,
or ingratitude, but they are charged with treachery, falſehood,
dealing falſely in covenant, and their hearts being not ſtedfaſt in
covenant. It is above me to conceive, how man can be a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breaker,
(not alone reſpective to man, but God, as he is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
charged) when there hath paſt no covenant between God
and him. They may queſtion, whether there were ever any ſuch
thing, as a covenant in the world, that deny this to be a covenant,
in the proper nature of it; ſome objections raiſed in their due place
will be anſwered.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Covenant of Grace is between God and man; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Christ.</head>
                  <p>HAving aſſerted a covenant in the proper nature of it, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
before I proceed further on, to give differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this covenant of Works, and the covenant of Grace, to
ſpeak ſomething by way of Explication, covenant being taken in
ſo various and ambiguous ſenſes, or at leaſt ſo many ſenſes put
upon it, which I take to be a miſunderſtanding of the Scripture-covenant,
I ſhall lay down certaine Explicatory Propoſitions for
clearing of the thing in queſtion. And the leading on ſhall be
this. <hi>The Covenant of grace is between God and man, between
God, and thoſe of fallen mankinde, that he pleaſes to take into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
God and man are the two parties in the covenant; It is not made
between God and Christ.</hi> This is ſo plain, that a man might think
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55700:25"/>
there needed no words about it, but that there are ſome that will
have man to be no party in it, and that it is entred onely with
Chriſt on behalf of thoſe that God hath choſen in Chriſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
To this I ſhall ſpeak firſt by way of conceſſion, yeelding to
them of this opinion, theſe three things that follow. 1. That there
is ſuch a covenant of which they ſpeak, which was entred between
God and Chriſt, containing the tranſactions which paſſe between
the Father and the Sonne, the tenor of which covenant we find
laid down by the Prophet, <hi>Eſay 53. 10, &amp;c.</hi> and commented
upon by the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. There we ſee, firſt the work that
Chriſt by covenant was to undergo, <hi>To make his ſoul an offering for
ſinne,</hi> that is, as elſewhere is expreſt, to give his life a ranſome
for many, and as he covenanted, ſo he did, <hi>He became obedient to
death, even the death of the croſſe,</hi> Phil. 2. 8. and that, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this covenant entred, Chriſt himſelf ſpeaking to it, and
of his work in it, ſaith, <hi>John 10. 18. This Commandment have I
received of my Father.</hi> Secondly, the reward that he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
which is laid down by the Prophet in many words. 1. <hi>He
ſhall ſee his ſeed,</hi> ver. 10. As <hi>Iſaac</hi> being received from the dead
in a figure, ſaw a ſeed, had an innumerable poſterity; ſo the
Lord Chriſt who was received from the dead in truth; hath his
ſeed in like manner, beleevers innumerable, which are called
his ſeed in reſemblance to the ſeed of man. 2. <hi>He ſhall
prolong his dayes,</hi> not the dayes of his ſeed, as ſome would have
it, making this one with the former, and rendring the words <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debit
ſemen longaevum,</hi> being delivered from death, he ſhall live and
reign eternally, <hi>Revel. 1. 18. 3. The pleaſure of the Lord ſhall
proſper in his hand;</hi> he ſhall irreſiſtibly do whatſoever is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
pleaſure to be done in the work of mans ſalvation. 4. <hi>He
ſhall ſee the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied;</hi> upon this
work done, he fully enjoys the whole of all his deſires. 5. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide
the ſpoile with the ſtrong.</hi> He obtains a perfect victory, hath a
plenary and full conqueſt over every adverſary. 2. We yeeld that
the whole of theſe covenant-tranſactions; between God and
Chriſt, was on our behalf. Making his ſoul an offering for ſinne,
he offers it for thoſe that are fallen by iniquity; All is, (as is there
ſaid) for the juſtification of many. Whatſoeve it is, that upon
the work done redounds to himſelf, yet the reaſon of undertaking
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55700:25"/>
was for us, <hi>Vnto us he was borne, unto us he was given, He was
wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, he
was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification;</hi>
He endured the mulct, and we reap the benefit. 3. We confeſſe
that it is the work of Chriſt that we enjoy a being in covenant, as
it is his gift that we enjoy the bleſſing of Ordinances. But when
all theſe are yeelded, the truth muſt be aſſerted, that there is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to which Scripture conſtantly ſpeaks, which is entred of
God with man, and not with Chriſt, which me thinks with much
eaſe might be made to appear.</p>
                  <p>1. There are frequent teſtimonies of Gods entry of covenant
with his people. 1. With the leading perſons in the covenant,
which ſtand as the root of many thouſand branches, which are
their off-ſpring in covenant. He entred covenant with <hi>Abraham,
Gen. 15. 18. Gen.</hi> 17. 2. The like he enters with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 26. 3.
with <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 35. 11. and therefore he is ſo frequently called
the <hi>God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob.</hi> And the covenant of
God is alike known by the name of the covenant with <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac and Jacob.</hi> 2. He enters covenant with the whole body of the
people of <hi>Iſrael, Deut. 5. 1, 2. Hear O Iſrael, the ſtatutes, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which I ſpeak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and
keep them, and do them. The Lord our God made a covenant
with us in Horeb, the Lord made not this covenant with our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but with us, even us who are all of us alive this
day;</hi> And this whole viſible body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not
Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>There are teſtimonies of</hi> Iſraels <hi>entrance into covenant
with God,</hi> Deut. 29. 10, 11, 12. Ye ſtand this day, all of you before
the Lord your God; your Captaines of your Tribes, your Elders, and
your Officers, with all the men of Iſrael, your little ones, your wives,
and the ſtranger that is in thy Camp, from the hewer of thy wood,
unto the drawer of thy water, that thou ſhouldeſt enter into covenant
with the Lord thy God, and into his oath which the Lord thy God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
with thee this day, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 50. 5. Gather my Saints together unto
me, thoſe that have made a Covenant with me by ſacrifice, <hi>Deut.</hi>
26. 17. Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to
walk in his ways.</p>
                  <p>3. The particular time, and place of Gods entrance into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with his people, is, in Seripture noted likewiſe. In <hi>Horeb</hi> as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55700:26"/>
we have heard, which was the firſt yeare of their coming out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> the third moneth, <hi>Exod</hi> 19. 1. Again, in the fourth year,
the eleventh moneth, the firſt day, <hi>Deut. 1. 3. Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12.
compared. <hi>This day</hi> ſaith the text. Now, there was no day, in
which the covenant of God, with Chriſt, was entred, no day,
when it was not entred, but it was from all eternity, as, all
the works of the Trinity are, <hi>ad intra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Covenant duties are impoſed, to walk before the Lord,
to be <hi>perfect,</hi> to be an <hi>holy, peculiar people,</hi> Gen. 17. 1.
Exod. 19. 6. Theſe are not impoſed upon Chriſt, but upon
Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>5. The people of God have the praiſe of keeping, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the blame of covenant-breaking, which praiſe of faithfulneſs,
and blame of perfidiouſneſſe is aſcribed to them, and not to Chriſt
Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>6. They that have the ſeals of the covenant given them,
are in covenant; but man receives the Seales, both of
Baptiſme and the Lords Supper; as, the people of God of
old, did Circumciſion, and the Paſſeover, therefore, man is in
covenant.</p>
                  <p>7. If the covenant were made, with Chriſt, and not with man,
then he is a Mediatour between God and himſelf, and not between
God and man. This is plain, in that he is the Mediatour of the
covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> between perſons in covenant; But he is not a
Mediatiour between God and himſelf, which were abſurd to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
but between God and man, <hi>There is one Mediatour between
God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>There is only I think that one difficult text of the Apoſtle to be
objected againſt this thing, <hi>Gal. 3. 16. Now to Abraham and his
ſeed, were the promiſes made. He ſaith not, and to ſeeds, as of many;
but as of one, and to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt,</hi> from whence ſome
conclude, that the covenant was entred of God, with no other
of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, but with Chriſt, conſequently not with man,
but with Chriſt only. As this was not in my thoughts in my
firſt Edition, ſo, I ſhall not now (as I ſoon might) weary my
ſelf, and reader, in wading into all the difficulties about it, being
ſuch as have occaſioned, not onely the Jewes to inſult, as <hi>Calvin</hi>
obſerves but <hi>Hierom</hi> (the greateſt Linguiſt among the ancients)
to ſpeak words unworthy of ſuch an Apoſtle, which I ſhall ſpare
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55700:26"/>
to repeat, and, all, upon the occaſion of the Apoſtles words,
<hi>That the promiſes, were not made to Abraham, and his ſeeds, as of
many, but his ſeed, as of one,</hi> on which the forenamed father ſays,
<hi>Running over the whole Scripture, both with his eye, and memory;
he doth not finde the word ſeed ever uſed in the plural number, but
alwayes in the ſingular, whether it be in the better, or worſe ſenſe.</hi>
But <hi>Gomarus</hi> on the words takes him up as being too ſhort in his
memory, and quotes <hi>Samuels</hi> ſpeech, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 15. to the contrary,
where the word is uſed plurally, <hi>Rivet</hi> indeed, <hi>Exercit 108. in
Geneſ.</hi> ſeemes to help him out, though he do not mention him,
affirming, that the word [ſeed] is never uſed in the plural number,
for the poſterity of men; but always collectively uſed in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
number. The place objected in <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpeaking of the ſeed
of the earth, but <hi>Ravanellus</hi> on the Apoſtles behalf, pleads, <hi>That it
is uncertain, whether the word be only uſed of the Hebrews in the
ſingular number, for though it be not uſed plurally, in the Hebrew
Text of the Old Teſtament, yet it cannot thence be gathered, that
the word hath onely the ſingular number, and wants the plural;
when it is without all doubt, that all the words which have been in
uſe with the Hebrews, are not to be found in the Old Teſtament.</hi>
Howſoever, I am not the man, from whom a ſatisfying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on theſe words may be expected; others more able, that
have travelled in it, may be conſulted, yet I doubt not, but enough
may be eaſily ſaid, to vindicate it from this gloſſe that is here
put upon it, and to make it appear that this text will not bear
this doctrine, that the covenant of grace is not entred with fallen
man, but with Chriſt only, which may appear by theſe following
Reaſons. 1. There is no ſafe oppoſing any one difficult text (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which Expoſitors are at ſo much difference among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
againſt, ſo many that are full, and clear againſt it. The
texts that are againſt it are (as I may ſay) without number, and
this, I think, ſtands alone, with any colour for it. Thus the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
have adventured to faſten their purgatory on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13, 14
and ſome few like difficult places. 2. The word covenant is not in
the text, neither under the more proper word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, nor yet
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>promiſes,</hi> in the plural number, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
again, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. in the ſingular, and a promiſe, and a
covenant (as <hi>Paraeus</hi> on the words obſerves) much differ. 3. If
they will needs underſtand by promiſes to, a covenant with, as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55700:27"/>
every covenant is a promiſe, though every promiſe be not a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
they differ as the <hi>Genus</hi> and the <hi>Species,</hi> yet there is that
in the text, (as Maſter <hi>Bulkley</hi> in his Treatiſe of the covenant
obſerves) which makes againſt them, they ſay this covenant is
made with Chriſt, and with none but Chriſt; but in the text, it is
otherwiſe, <hi>Abraham</hi> is made a party in the covenant, as well as
Chriſt, which ſerves to overthrow their excluſive particle.
4. <hi>[Christ]</hi> here in this place may be taken collectively, as <hi>[ſeed]</hi>
is uſually taken, and ſo the word is taken, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 12. As the body is
one, and hath many members, &amp; all the members of that one body, being
many, are one body; ſo alſo is Chriſt.</hi> And ſo Mr. <hi>Bulkely, Diodati, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,
Gomarus,</hi> and our laſt Annotations upon the words expound
it. 5. Being underſtood of Chriſt perſonally (which with ſubmiſſion
to better judgements, I confeſſe moſt ſatisfies me) it muſt not be
underſtood of Chriſt, as a party in Covenant, for bleſſedneſſe;
but as a Mediatour making bleſſed. There are many promiſes
in Scripture made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
there is much difference among interpreters, to which of theſe
promiſes this text refers; The Reader, if he pleaſe, may conſult
<hi>Paraeus</hi> on the words, and <hi>Junius</hi> in his parallels, but to what text
ſoever it is, that theſe words do refer, I am confident that the
Apoſtle ſpeaks not, of any bleſſedneſſe received by covenant; but
a promiſe of making Nations bleſſed, and this is not indeed to
[ſeeds] as of many, but to [ſeed] as of one, which is Chriſt;
which I gather by comparing the words in hand with <hi>v.</hi> 8. of the
ſame chapter, <hi>and the Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the
Heathen, through faith, preached before the Goſpel to Abraham, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.</hi> This is the promiſe that
this Text holds out, which is not a covenant for bleſſedneſſe, but
a promiſe to make bleſſed repeated againe, <hi>verſe 19. The Law
was added, becauſe of tranſgreſſions till the ſeed ſhould come, to whom
the promiſe was made,</hi> which is not Chriſt, collectively, or myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but perſonally conſidered, not entring covenant but as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour
of the covenant. So that this text ſerves nothing for this
purpoſe. A learned Writer indeed ſayes, <hi>It is beyond my brain
to conceive that God ſhould immediately make a Covenant with us,
who were children of diſobedience, and of wrath, who could not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any ſuch covenant and conditions.</hi> That Chriſt hath a
hand to bring us into covenant, before was yeelded, and how far
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55700:27"/>
he hath a hand further to carry on; the covenant may be yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſidered, but man is a party in covenant, and as God
may make promiſes, and give good things to fallen man, ſo he
may enter covenant with him likewiſe.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The outward and not the inward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> 
                     <hi>and not the inward Covenant, is, moſt exactly
and properly called by the name of a Covenant,</hi> which I thus make
good: 1. That covenant to which the definition of a covenant
doth belong, hath exactly and properly the nature of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
this none can deny: The definition ſets out the nature of
the thing defined; But the definition moſt actly belongs, to the
outward covenant, not to the inward; This is plain; An agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of parties, on tearms and Propoſitions is the definition of
a covenant: Now the outward covenant, is an agreement on
tearmes and Propoſitions, as I have abundantly declared,
in that covenant God engages himſelf to man for his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and man engages to faith and obedience. The inward
covenant hath no tearmes or Propoſitions at all, for man to
make good, upon account of his covenanting: ſeeing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55700:28"/>
of the conditions of the Scripture-covenant, is his very
entrance into the inward covenant. He that believes and repents
keeps covenant, nothing more is expected of God, or promiſed
by man: But beleeving, and repenting, is the firſt cloſing with God
in covenant, according to them that ſpeak of an inward
covenant. 2. A covenant to perform conditions is a covenant
properly ſo called; But the outward covenant, not the inward,
is a covenant to perform conditions, This is plain: The conditions
in the inward covenant, are the covenant. 3. That which confounds
entrance into covenant, and keeping of covenant, is no covenant
properly ſo called; In a covenant properly ſo called theſe are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct:
But the inward covenant confounds entrance into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and keeping of covenant, and therefore in exact propriety of
ſpeech is no covenant.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The outward,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The outward Covenant is moſt uſually in Scripture called by the name of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> 
                     <hi>and not the inward Covenant, is, moſt uſually in
Scripture, called by the name of a Covenant;</hi> which is plaine,
in that, they that have no part, or portion, in the inward cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
are, yet ſtill ſpoken of, in Scripture, as people in covenant;
God calls all <hi>Iſrael</hi> his people, and that upon covenant termes;
<hi>Deut. 29. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 11, 12, 13. Al of thoſe, that thus covenanted with God,
were not in the inward covenant. This people at their worſt, and the
wroſt among them, are called the people of God, as by thoſe that
were ſtrangers to this covenant: <hi>Theſe are the people of the Lord,</hi>
(ſay the men of <hi>Babylon) and are gone forth out of his land,</hi> Ezek.
36. 20. ſo, alſo by the Lord himſelf <hi>Jer. 2. 32. Can a Bride forget
her attire? yet my people have forgotten me dayes without number.</hi>
How often doth God own <hi>Iſrael</hi> as his people, when he yet brands
them as a <hi>rebellious, revolting, ſtiff-necked, treacherous, and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
people.</hi> They that forſake the covenant of God, that break
covenant, that deale falſely in it, upon whom God brings a
ſword to avenge the quarrel of his covenant, are in the outward,
not in the inward covenant: But ſuch there be among Gods
covenant-people, as he frequently complaines, that break cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
&amp;c. Theſe, are not then, in his inward, but outward cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The great objection is, (and all that carries colour againſt
this</hi>) Jer. 31. 32, 33. <hi>where the Lord differencing the Old and
New covenant, ſaith,</hi> This is the covenant that I will make
with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Judah:</hi> not according to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55700:28"/>
the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took
them by the hand to bring them out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which my
Covenant they brake, although I was an husband to them, ſaith the
Lord: But this ſhall be my Covenant that I will make with the
houſe of Iſrael, After thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put
my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will
be their God, and they ſhall be my people. <hi>That is alone the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
covenant, and the elect regenerate are alone within it. The
inward covenant then is called in Scripture a covenant, and is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
propriety of ſpeech a covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwer, I ſhall have further occaſion to ſpeak to
this Text. In this place I ſhall only put ſome Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>1. Whether thoſe that carry this Text to an unconditionate
covenant, and reſtrain it alone to that which they call the inward
covenant, do not make the covenant in the time of the Law, and
that in Goſpel-times eſſentially different, and conſequently, either
make two covenants of grace, diſtinct, in kind; or thruſt all that
were under the Old covenant, out of all hope of ſalvation, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all Interpreters, who make theſe covenants, one in ſubſtance?
See the laſt larger Annotations on the words.</p>
                  <p>2. Whether ſuch an Interpretation, do not utterly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
New-Teſtament-light, which holds out the New covenant in
like latitude with the former, in which many are called, but few
are choſen; and where conditions are as explicitely, and fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
as in Old Teſtament diſpenſations?</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Whether, when Scripture ſpeaks of things, in oppoſition
to mens erroneous conceits, (for a further Explanation of
them, and rectifying mens judgements in them) it do uſually lay
down a full, compleat, and formal definition, to which nothing is
to be added? or whether it doth not, uſually ſupply that, in
which men through miſtake were defective and ſhort? And
whether thoſe Texts,</hi> Eſay 58 6, 7. Is not this the faſt that I have
choſen, to looſe the bands of wickedneſſe, to undo the heavy burdens,
and to let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye break every yoak? Is it not
to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that
are caſt out into thy houſe, when thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou cover
him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thy own fleſh? <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 15,
16. Did not thy father eat and drink, and do juſtice and judgement,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55700:29"/>
and then it was well with him? He judged the cauſe of the poor and
needy, and then it was well with him; was not this to know me, ſaith
the Lord? <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 27. Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the
Father is this, to viſit the fatherleſſe and widows in their affliction,
and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the world, <hi>are not parallel to
this text in their way of delivery. And in caſe we cannot finde a
full definition of a religious Faſt in that of</hi> Eſay, <hi>nor the whole of
it that makes up ſaving knowledge in that of</hi> Jeremy, <hi>nor the whole
that makes Religion compleat in that of</hi> James; <hi>why is it that we
ſhould earneſtly contend, that the full nature of a covenant is
in this text expreſt, being fully parallel in the way of delivery to
thoſe other texts.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Men enjoy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and intereſt in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments upon account of the outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>it is upon the account of the outward Covenant, and not
the inward, that men enjoy priviledges of Ordinances, and intereſt in
Sacraments;</hi> Men that are ſo far honoured as to enjoy an outward
covenant, have juſt title to theſe priviledges. It is in behalf of
the Jew outwardly that the Apoſtle having ſo decryed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
reſpective to the approbation of God, puts the queſtion,
<hi>What advantage hath the Jew? what profit is there of Circumciſion?
Rom.</hi> 3. 1. The Jew and Circumciſion are there one; A Jew
outwardly, and circumciſion in the fleſh, go there in equal
latitude. He that by nature is a Jew (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15.)
is of the circumciſion; And to theſe, the Oracles of God are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
<hi>The inſtruments, deeds and evidences of the covenants,</hi>
ſay the laſt Annotations. It was the priviledge of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 147.
19. Rom. 3. and then, the priviledg of no other Nation; Now it is,
the priviledg of all, ingraffed in their ſtead. This is confeſt, even
by a great part of thoſe, that underſtand the inward covenant,
(or covenant keeping to acceptation,) almoſt whenſoever they
mention a covenant, in that, they baptize infants, upon covenant
grounds, even all their infants that make a covenant profeſſion,
and that upon juſt warranty. It is further plaine in reaſon, The
outward covenant muſt have priviledges ſuitable to it ſelf, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
there is no manner of benefit, or advantage of it. This pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of the Sacrament is ſuitable, being outward, as the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is outward; This is elſewhere ſpoken to at large, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall hear forbear.</p>
                  <p>I have indeed been challenged for this diſtinction of an outward
and inward covenant, as though I had been the ſole Authour of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55700:29"/>
it, when all know that it is a diſtinction, that of a long time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Divines hath been in common uſe; and in caſe it had not
been commonly received, I ſhould have forborne the uſe of it.
As, I heard <hi>Mr. Ball,</hi> once in diſcourſe, ſay, that he denyed
any ſuch diſtinction, of an outward, and an inward call to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
all calling being external, unleſſe the man called were
a Prophet, that which men terme, an inward call, being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
qualifications fitting for the work: So that I deny, in exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of ſpeech, the inward covenant, is any covenant, but the
anſwer of the ſoul, unto that which the covenant requires. And
whereas it is ſaid of me by way of conjecture. <hi>It is probable that
he thus diſtributes them, from the bleſſings promiſed, whereof ſome
are inward, and ſome outward; for though he explain not himſelf
fully, yet I know no other ſenſe that it will bear.</hi> To this I ſay, that I
thus diſtinguiſh them, to apply my ſelf to the Readers underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that hath been accumſtomed, ſo to call them; and further I ſay,
that men, that barely covenant, and keep not covenant, have
onely priviledges that are outward, They are viſible Church-members,
and they have viſible Church-priviledges, and thoſe,
who anſwer to covenant engagements (which uſually is called
the inward covenant) have priviledges both outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
A Jew outwardly had outward priviledges, A Jew inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(that is, he that anſwered to his outward profeſſion, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
God in ſpirit) hath both thoſe that were outward and
inward. It is further ſaid, <hi>It is evident that his outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
hath no ſeal; for it is a Covenant</hi> de ſigillis conferendis; <hi>If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it have a ſeal, it is either the ſame which is promiſed, or ſome other.</hi>
What this Authour means, when he ſays, it is a covenant <hi>de ſigillis
conferendis,</hi> I am to learn; If he mean that the ſeal follows the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and is put to, after the covenant, ſo it is in all covenants
whatſoever. He ſayes, <hi>they no where tell us, what is the ſeal of their
outward covenant;</hi> me thinks, we had no need to tell, what the ſeal
of that covenant was, that the Jew entered; was it not circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
and did there not another follow, <hi>viz.</hi> the Paſſeover?
Now I tell him that Circumciſion and the Paſſeover, were, and
Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, are, ſeales of this covenant. The
Nation of the Jewes were in covenant, as our Authour (though he
would, yet) muſt not deny; They were not all in the inward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
and yet they had theſe ſeales. He ſays, we are bound to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55700:30"/>
give the ſeals to ſuch, <hi>Vocation which is effectual only to bring men
to an outward profeſſion of ſaving faith, is larger then election, and
makes men ſuch, whom we are bound to baptize;</hi> And ſuch we ſay
have right to them. And to help him a little further. Thoſe men,
that he ſayes the Church muſt baptize, though without right,
we ſay, are truely in covenant, and have right; when he knows,
what a childe he is to baptize, he knows, who we ſay, are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and have covenant-right to baptiſme; ſo that a ſecond
covenant, of which he ſpeaks, to give right to a firſt, is a ſtrange
fancy. But ſeeing I am no better underſtood, I ſhall endeavour
(if it may be) to clear my meaning in certain poſitions which here
follow.</p>

                  <p>1. <hi>THoſe that take upon themſelves a Chriſtian profeſſion, being
ſeparate for God, calling him by the Name of Lord, that have
Ordinances of God as their inheritance, that acknowledge a Deity, and
no other but the true Deity; a neceſſity of worſhip, and none but the
Chriſtian worſhip, theſe with me are in Covenant with God,</hi> as was
the whole ſtate of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the whole face
of the viſible Church of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that were ingraffed in
their ſtead. This to me is plain, in that they are the <hi>Church</hi> or
<hi>Churches</hi> of God, <hi>Act. 7. 8. Gal. 1. 2. The called of God,</hi> Matth.
22. 14. <hi>The people of God,</hi> Iſa. 1. 2. Pſal. 90. 7. <hi>They ſacrific'd
to the true God,</hi> Pſal. 50. 7. Are the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> Gen. 6. 1. Deut.

Pſal. 148. <hi>ult.</hi> God profeſſing himſelf to be their God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 7.
Are <hi>children of the Covenant,</hi> Acts 3. 35. <hi>Saints,</hi> Pſalme 90. 5.
Acts 26. 10. 1 Cor. 14. 33. <hi>Believers,</hi> Act. 8. 12, 13. Acts 21. 20.
Luke 8. 13. <hi>Diſciples,</hi> Matth. 10. 1, 4. Acts 9. 1. &amp; 15. 10.
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Acts 11. 26. That all of theſe imply a covenant-ſtate;
and that unregenerate men, have in Scripture, all this honour, is
clear; Theſe therefore with me are in covenant. I know, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55700:30"/>
as to all of theſe elogies, it is anſwered in a word, that they are
<hi>equivocal.</hi> An anſwer that I can ſcarce take into my thoughts
without horrour; as though Gods Oracles were all over, from
one end of the Bible to the other, like thoſe of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and there
were no reality, either in their ſeparation for God, or gifts that
they receive from God, (as illumination, conviction, faith) or
priviledges that they enjoy; When there can be no plain denial,
that all of this here mentioned, argues a covenant-ſtate, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
are taken. <hi>It ſeemes</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>he takes all to be in
Covenant that bear the name, [Chriſtian.]</hi> And then queſtions;
<hi>What? Though they know not what Chriſt or Chriſtianity is? Is
taking a name, entring into Cevenant? The poore</hi> Indians <hi>that by
thouſands are forced by the</hi> Spaniard <hi>to be baptized, are ſaid to know
ſo little what they do, that ſome of them forget the name of [a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian]
which they aſſumed.</hi> And does not our Authour think that
a man may take as plauſible exceptions againſt his words, (where
he ſaith, <hi>The rule is, That a ſerious profeſſour of the faith is to be taken
for a true beleever,</hi> if he would travel as far as <hi>India</hi> for it,) as he
doth here againſt Gods Word? Do not we know, that force
may make, theſe poor <hi>Indians,</hi> to appear ſerious in their profeſſion?
And it is wonder, that it ſhould be ſo ſtrange with him, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a name, ſhould be entring covenant, or at leaſt that it
ſhould imply a covenant-ſtate: Let him conſult <hi>Iſa. 4. 1. In that
day ſeven women ſhall take hold of one man, ſaying, we will eat our
own bread, and wear our own apparel; onely let us be called by thy
name to take away our reproach;</hi> and thoſe manifold Scripture-Texts,
which expreſſe the relation of Gods covenant-people to him,
in theſe words, <hi>A people called by his Name;</hi> or <hi>on whom the
Name of God is called.</hi> Diſtinction ſhould be put, between chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the covenant, by deſcent from parents in covenant, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Jews or Chriſtians, (who continue their covenant-relation,
till they profeſſedly caſt it off, notwithſtanding their ignorance)
and ſuch that of meer aliens are to be received, having no other
title then their own preſent qualification. This ought to be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
as well, in renouncing their old falſe way, as embracing
the preſent, as we ſee it was, in thoſe coverts through the <hi>Acts</hi> of
the Apoſtles, and, is not to be, without ſome competency of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
diſcerning the evil of their former courſe, and the happineſſe
attainable in the preſent. And, I am eaſily induced to believe,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55700:31"/>
that more knowledge by the induſtry of teachers, is now required,
then was in the primitive times, ſeeing there is not ſo much of God,
by miracle to perſwade, and as it were to over-rule: So that it is
not a naked taking of a name that is intended, but that which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with it ſtill attends upon it: As a wife is called by her husbands
name, and withall, makes her abode in his houſe; ſo it is with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
people, and was with <hi>Iſrael;</hi> They bore the name of God,
and they made abode in the Church of God, enjoying his
Ordinances as their inheritance. It is objected, <hi>God oft beſtowes
his Word on Infidels, and in England there are men that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
the truth of Scripture, and eſteem it a fiction, and yet for credit
of men come ordinarily to the Congregation. Theſe have the Word
given, and ſo have other unregenerate men, but not by Covenant that
I know of,</hi> That God doth beſtow his Word on Infidels, to me is
ſtrange: It is true that he often tenders it to them, but in caſe they
remain Infidels, they put it away from them, and beſtowing implies
not only a tender but an acceptance. It was the great advantage
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> above other Nations, that to them was committed the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of God, when others had not that honour. And to ſpeak,
of Gods giving his Word by Covenant, is a moſt improper ſpeech,
ſeeing the Word is the very Covenant draughts; as though
we ſhould ſay, he gives his Word, by his Word. And theſe
ſure are no open deriders that for the credit ofmen, make ſuch a
publique profeſſion: this would work reſtraint, on the one hand,
as it puts upon profeſſion on the other. And in caſe any ſuch
thing be, though the Covenant is perfidiouſly broke, yet (as I
conceive) it is not totally caſt off, as long as an open profeſſion is
continued. What ſhall we ſay of thoſe, that take their ſons, and
daughters, to give them to <hi>Moloch?</hi> this can be no low crime, and is
an high departure from the true God, yet theſe bring forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
unto God; and they are Gods children, that they thus sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20, 21. So alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 35, &amp;c. <hi>Iſrael was
mingled among the Heathen, and learned their works, and they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their Idols, which were a ſnare to them; yea, they ſacrificed their
ſons and daughters unto Devils, and ſhed innocent blood, even the
blood of their ſons and daughters;</hi> Yet this, as appears caſt them not
out of Covenant; God notwithſtanding <hi>remembred for them
his Cavenant,</hi> ver. 45. This was therefore doubtleſſe but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
apoſtaſie; Taking in the worſhip of Idols, they did not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55700:31"/>
caſt off the worſhip of God: God was not totally caſt off
in <hi>Judah,</hi> neither did God caſt off <hi>Judah: Ahaz</hi> was of the
worſt of Kings, and yet his poſterity was reckoned among
the people of the Lord. Had the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time been, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
diſputants againſt a covenant-ſtate, as are riſen up now, the
Church of God had wanted an <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> He had never lived,
(much leſſe wrought ſo happy a Reformation) in the Church of
God.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Thoſe that are lookt upon by men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Poſit. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>as in Covenant with God,
and ſo ordinarily judged (as the people of Iſrael were) by the Name
that they bear, their abode in the Church, the profeſſion that they
make, and ſo accordingly stiled, are truely, and really in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
A man may know a man, to appertain to ſuch, or ſuch a
perſon, becauſe he ſees him in his family, hears him call him
<hi>Maſter,</hi> ſees him, ſometimes at leaſt, in his work, and knows,
him to have the repute of his ſervant; Though to know him to
be a faithful ſervant, requires more diligence of enquiry, and a
ſtricter ſcrutiny: So, a man may be as eaſily known, to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to Jeſus Chriſt; The ſame Characters make him known,
all that is required, to being in covenant, is, viſible, open, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
but ſincerity of heart in covenanting is inviſible, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.
And therefore the Jew outwardly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28. is called
by the <hi>Vulgar, Vatablus, Tremelius, Arias Montanus,</hi> and <hi>Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,
Judaeus in manifeſto;</hi> by <hi>Calvin, Judaeus in aperto;</hi> by <hi>Beza,
Judaeus in propatulo:</hi> The Jew inwardly, is called <hi>Judaeus in abſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dito,</hi>
or <hi>occulto:</hi> Their Church, or covenant-ſtation, giving them
thoſe great advantages after mentioned, was open and manifeſt.
Thoſe that ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> as, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21. are of thoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch
God to be their God, and God avoucheth them to be his
people. And therefore when they come with their ſacrifices,
though in their ſinnes, and God upon that account teſtifies againſt
them; yet he ſayes, <hi>I am God, even thy God.</hi> It is confeſs'd by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
adverſary, that <hi>we muſt judge thoſe that make profeſſion, to
be in Covenant with God: we muſt give them the name of Chriſtians,
and men in covenant with God, and we muſt uſe them as Chriſtians in
works of Charity and Ordinances, and Church-communion, and ſo
muſt uſe their children as Chriſtians children.</hi> And ſeeing reaſon
to judge ſo, according to Scripture-character of men in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
they are ſo. Either in this we judge right, or elſe we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55700:32"/>
upon miſtake, If we judge aright, then all is well: If we
miſtake, then, all in theſe proceedings is null. Water hath been
applyed to the child of ſuch an one, but no Sacrament diſpens'd;
and according to a mans hopes, thoughts or feares of his fathers
regeneration, are his hopes, thoughts and feares of his own bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
and conſequently of his intereſt in Church-communion;
for this, ſtands, or falls according to his fathers intereſt, or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſt
in the covenant. A grand Rule is laid down by the ſaid
Authour, <hi>That a ſerious Profeſſour of the faith is to be taken for a
true Beleever:</hi> and this being laid down, more are added. If this
Propoſition were a Scripture-Maxime then it would have borne a

Where God makes tender of the Goſpel, by his Miniſters to any
one out of covenant, there he makes tender of the Covenant;
and where a perſon, or people, profeſſedly accept, that is, engage
themſelves, (as myriads of thouſands did through the <hi>Acts of
the Apoſtles</hi>) this perſon, this people, each man of them is in
covenant. As Scripture calls them by the name of <hi>Saints, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
Beleevers, Chriſtians,</hi> ſo we may call them <hi>Covenanters.</hi>
They have all a ſanctity of ſeparation, which <hi>Camero</hi> ſayes, is real,
and arguments are drawn from thence to a right in Baptiſme,
There is in moſt of them, if not in all, ſome graces that are real;
either common or ſaving, and a covenant doth not wait, till the
termes be kept, and the conditions made good, before it hath the
being of a covenant. And whether theſe be every way ſincere, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way diſſembling, yet it is acknowledged, that they really oblige
themſelves: And God howſoever diſſembles not, but is bound by
himſelf, upon his own terms, which they profedly accept, to confer
all that the covenant holds forth, ſo that, whereſoever man is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
there a compleat covenant is made up, for Gods tender
goes before, and man is the laſt party, and compleats the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

                     <hi>and integrity of heart; or fully reality, in a mans
intentions, to ſtand to the whole of a Covenant, is not of the offence,
and being of it.</hi> Both parties ſtand engaged, upon their reſpective
termes, though one part ſhould have unſincere intentions. A
wife is a wiſe, and the marriage is compleat, when both parties
have publickly expreſs'd conſent though ſhe hold a reſolution
to be ſtubborn, refractory, profuſe, &amp;c. A man conſenting to
ſerve, whether in bare words, or taking earneſt, as is moſt uſual,
or by hand and ſeal, as in the caſe of apprentices, is a ſervant
although he intend with <hi>Oneſimus</hi> to purloyn, or take his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to be gone. Some thinks it makes for their advantage,
to ſay, that unregenerate men are unſincere in covenant; but that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55700:33"/>
conceſſion, utterly deſtroys them. If they be unſincere, or as
the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, not ſtedfaſt in covenant, then they are in
covenant, <hi>A propoſitione ſecundi adjacentis, ad propoſitionem primi

man, then it is true, that he is a man: that <hi>Peribomius</hi>
is a vicious man, then he is a man; that <hi>Judas</hi> is treacherous and
perfidious in covenant, then he is in covenant: A mans conviction,
that he is an unjuſt ſteward, or an unfaithful ſervant, doth not
conclude him to be no ſervant, or no ſteward, but the contrary.
And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>The differences muſt be taken notice of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
humane Covenants, and ours with God; or elſe all will be marred.
Men know not one another hearts, and therefore make not laws for
hearts, nor impoſe conditions on hearts: and therefore if both parties do
confeſſe conſent, though diſſembledly, they are both obliged, &amp; the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is mutual. But God offers to conſent only on condition that our hearts
conſent to his terms, and therfore if we profeſs, conſent, &amp; do not conſent,
God conſenteth not, nor is, as it were, obliged.</hi> This were ſomewhat
to purpoſe, in caſe it could be made to appear that Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
all being of a covenant between God and man, where the
all-ſeeing eye of God ſees not all integrity and ſincerity. But
Scripture-language which is the faſeſt for us to follow, being
(as we have heard) far otherwiſe, there is nothing marr'd in non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſervance
of any ſuch ſuppoſed difference; See <hi>Pſal. 78. 34, 35, 36.
When he ſlew them, then they ſought him; and they returned, and

Rest,</hi> Part. 3. Sect. 6. Which may be a faire anſwer to that
which is objected againſt me, that in my <hi>explication of Dogmatical
faith, I adde by way of excluſion [though not affecting the heart to a
full choice of Chriſt] where he ſeems</hi> (ſaith my adverſary) <hi>to imply,
though he expreſſe it not, that the faith that he meaneth doth affect the
heart to a choice of Christ which is not full. But if ſo, then, 1. It is
much more then aſſent, or a meer Hiſtorical, Dogmatical Faith.
2. But is the choice, which he intimateth real as to the act, and ſuited
to the object? That is, the real choice of ſuch a Chriſt as is offered,
and on ſuch termes? If ſo, it is juſtifying faith: If not, either it is
counterfeit, as to the act, or but nominal, as to the object, and is indeed
no chooſing of Chriſt.</hi> That which is real and true, is neither coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
nor meerly nominal, ſo far as they know, either Chriſt or
their own hearts, they undiſſembledly chooſe, and take to him, as
expecting to be happy in him, and not in any other object;
though too often it is upon miſ-information, and when they
come to a right underſtanding of the termes, they are in danger
to quit the way in which they might enjoy him. It is further
ſaid <hi>That, I think that there may be an undiſſembled profeſſion,
which yet may not be of a ſaving faith; But then I conceive,</hi>
ſaith one, <hi>it is not an entire profeſſion of the whole eſſential object of
Chriſtian faith,</hi> viz. <hi>of aſſent and conſent.</hi> In which he doth but
caſt duſt in his Readers eyes, in confounding the intireneſſe of
the object, and the integrity of the ſubject. There may be an
entire profeſſion of the whole eſſential object of faith, where
the will is brought in to make no more full choice, or conſent
then hath been ſaid, and the deſired integrity of the ſubject
wanting; I am told, <hi>It will be an hard ſaying to many honeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
to ſay that a man not juſtified may believe every fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
article, and withal truly profeſſe repentance of all his ſinnes,
and to take God for his Sovereign to rule him, and his chief good
to be enjoyed to his happineſſe, and to take Chriſt for his Lord,
and only Saviour, and his Word for his Law and Rule, and the
Holy Ghoſt for his guide and Sanctifer, and the reſt which is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to Christianity.</hi> I think it will be nothing hard for any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Chriſtian to ſay, that a man not juſtified, may believe every
fundamental article, as to aſſent, and that he may be convinc'd
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55700:34"/>
of the neceſſity of ſuch repentance, and accordingly to make
profeſſion of it, as <hi>Johns</hi> converts (who were not all juſtifi'd)
did, and were baptiz'd into it, or that ſuch an one may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
yeeld, that God hath right of Sovereignty and rule, and that
he is the chief good to be enjoyed for happineſſe, and that
he ought to take Chriſt for his Lord, and Saviour, &amp;c. and
that this may be done truly, not only as to reality of aſſent,
but as to reality of purpoſe to make this choice, ſo farre
as the man knows his own heart, or the minde of God in this
work, though there be not that integrity, to yeeld up himſelf

wider then the door of heaven; and Chriſt is ſo tender,
ſo bountiful, and forward to convey his grace, and the Goſpel ſo free an
offer, and invitation to all, that ſurely Chriſt will keep no man off:
if they will come quite over in ſpirit to Chriſt, they ſhall be welcome:
if they will come but onely to a viſible profeſſion, he will not deny them
admittance. <hi>This ſeems to me to ſpeak the mind of Jeſus Chriſt for

                  <head type="sub">The Covenant of Grace calls for Conditions
from Man.</head>
                  <p>A Third Propoſition which I ſhall here lay down,<note place="margin">The Covenant of Grace calls for conditions from man.</note> is, <hi>that
Gods covenant with man hath its reſtipulation from man, when
God engages to man, to conferre happineſſe upon him, he requires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
from him.</hi> This I know hath ſtrong oppoſition by men
of two ſorts, and they of different ſtamps, and for different
ends. The firſt deny all Goſpel-conditions, all covenant-termes
on mans part, to the end they may aſſert juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and without Faith, Salvation without Repentance, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
which though it be contradicted by abundant teſtimonies
of Scripture (placing unbeleeving, impenitent and diſobedient
ones in hell: under the wrath of God, yea ſuch unbeleeving, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
ones that have laid higheſt claime to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.
23.) yet it ſeems wholly to follow, and neceſſarily to be evinced
from this abſolute unconditionate covenant. If Chriſt have whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
finiſhed, not only the work of mans redemption, but alſo of
his ſalvation upon the croſſe, without farther work of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as one in a diſtinct Treatiſe hath made it his endeavour to
prove) then we may, as he there doth, decry, both our faith in
Chriſt, and Chriſts interceſſion for us. Herein one of late (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his wonted weakneſſe) is very induſtrious, and whereas
the Scripture tells us, <hi>Chriſt dwells in our hearts by Faith,</hi> Epheſ.
3. 17. he would prove, that Chriſt enters into us, without us, dwells
in the unbeleeving, and in reference to this opinion of his, he
makes it his buſineſſe, as, to deny Faith, in reference to Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſo, all Goſpel-covenant-conditions. <hi>All other covenants
beſides this were</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>upon a ſtipulation, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
was altogether upon conditions on both ſides. But in this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace,</hi> viz. <hi>the new covenant, it is far otherwiſe, there is
not any condition in this covenant, I ſay the new covenant is without
any condition whatſoever.</hi> And he further tells his hearers, that
<hi>he is on a nice point, Faith is not the condition of the covenant.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55700:35"/>
utterly diſtaſting the aforenamed opinions, of Juſtification
without faith, or ſalvation without obedience, or repentance
(which ſeeme to be the natural iſſue and neceſſary conſequents of
an unconditional covenant,) yet, with great reſolution do affirme;
the covenant to be without conditions, joyning in the premiſſes
with theſe heterodox teachers, but peremptorily denying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.<note place="margin">Arguments for a conditional Covenant.</note>
Againſt both of theſe that oppoſe it, either more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
or more innocently, I affirm (and might quote a cloud of
witneſſes) that the covenant of grace hath its conditions; which
to me is clear.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by the definition of a covenant, given in, by the Authour
before named, a few pages before his aſſertion before mentioned.
<hi>It is a mutual agreement, between parties, upon certaine Articles
or Propoſitions, on both ſides, ſo that each party is bound and tyed to
perform his own conditions.</hi> It is in the definition and of the eſſence
of a covenant in general (according to him) to have conditions,
yet this covenant in particular, with him, is without condition;
Here is a <hi>ſpecies,</hi> that partakes not of the nature of the <hi>genus,</hi> a
particular covenant that wants the eſſence of a covenant, which is
the ſame as though he ſhould finde us a man that is no living
creature, a Vine or Fig-tree that is no plant, a piece of ſcarlet
of no colour; ſuch a thing is this unconditional covenant. If the
eſſence of a covenant require it, then this covenant is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly by the expreſſe Texts of Scripture, which lay down
conditions of the covenant, either in expreſſe words, or thoſe
that of neceſſity imply a condition. See</hi> John 8. 51. Verily, verily,
I ſay unto you, if a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never ſee death.
<hi>Who ſees not there; Firſt, a Priviledge granted by way of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
Secondly, the condition on which it is to be obtained.</hi>
John 8. 24. If ye beleeve not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſinnes.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6. Whoſe houſe are we, if we hold fast the confidence, and
the rejoycing of the hope firme unto the end. <hi>Who knows not,</hi> If, <hi>to
be a conditional particle? All pardon and juſtification (if Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
may be heard) is ſuſpended on mens not beleeving,</hi> John
3. 16. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whoſoever beleeveth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting
life. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. He that beleeveth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved;
and he that beleeveth not, ſhall be damned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:55700:35"/>
Thirdly, by Analogy with the covenant of Works, entred
of God with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. This, on all
hands that (I know), is granted to have been conditional,
and who ſees not in the Texts mentioned, conditions as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
in the Goſpel, as <hi>not eating of the tree of knowledge of good
and euil,</hi> to man in Paradiſe? either, both, or neither, muſt be
conditional.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, from the nature of conditions in covenants. A
condition in a covenant, is ſomewhat agreed upon by the Parties
in covenant, upon performance of which the benefit of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is obtained, and upon the failing of it, the whole benefit is
loſt, and the penalty, whatſoever it is, incurred. In covenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
equals, either indent, and article what thoſe conditions
ſhall be upon defaylance of which the benefit is loſt, and the
penalty incurred. In covenants between ſuperiour and inferiour,
the ſuperiour doth preſcribe, and the inferiour doth yeeld. In all
covenants there are ſuch conditions, that upon performance or
failing of them, the covenant doth ſtand or fall: ſuch there are in
the Goſpel-covenant. There we are enjoyned to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
upon obedience to and performance of theſe, we reap the
benefit of the covenant. Upon failing in them the benefit is loſt, and
the penalty incurred. <hi>He that beleeveth not, ſhall be damned. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> There are then conditions
in this covenant.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, from the abſurdities that will follow upon the denial
of conditions on mans part in the covenant. Firſt, then man is
out of danger of being faulty in the covenant, he can be no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-breaker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He cannot be charged that his heart is unſteady
in it. This of it ſelf is plaine, He that is tyed to nothing, fails in
nothing; he that is engaged to no ſervce, neglects no ſervice; As
God hath that glory that he keeps covenant, ſo man hath that
Priviledge, that he is not in a capacity of breaking of it. The
Church might have ſpared that Apology for themſelves, <hi>that they
had not dealt falſely in the covenant,</hi> Pſal. 44. 17. ſeeing they were
under no ſuch engagement, that they could falſifie, or in any ſuch
capacity of being falſe; but we finde God complaining againſt
his People for breach of covenant, <hi>Jerem. 11. 10. Iſa. 24. 5.
Pſal.</hi> 78. 10, 37. we finde him giving out his threats to avenge
the quarrel of his covenant, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 25. Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55700:36"/>
Queſtioniſt (who ſeems contrarily minded) thought it an excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of validity, <hi>That it follows from his doctrine, that the New cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is never violated by any.</hi> I am ſure it follows from this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
that it is not in any capacity of violation. Secondly, then
we may ſay (as the Apoſtle in another caſe) <hi>Our preaching is in
vain,</hi> at leaſt to ſalvation vaine, the Goſpel in mans mouth
is no power of God to ſalvation. In faith or unbelief, in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
or unrepentant condition, in holineſſe or diſobedience,
God will ſave; he looks neither at faith, uprightneſſe, or any
qualification, when in a covenant-way he engages himſelfe to
conferre ſalvation. In caſe God doth not regard it, to what
end is there any paines to work a people to it? This I know ſome
Aſſertours of this doctrine will diſclaime, but let them ſhew how
they will avoid it.</p>

This argument, is againſt all being of covenants, as well as the
conditionality of them, as indeed, if conditions be denied, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a covenant is deſtroyed, and therefore it might have
been well brought in, where the covenant it ſelf was aſſerted, as
militating againſt the very being of it. But it cannot conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
be held out in both places, and therefore it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
here, and for anſwer, let us firſt take what is granted,
that uſually in covenants there is a mutual contract, and that
theſe words, Latine, and Greek, be uſed to imply ſuch covenants,
in which there are mutual contracts, and mutual performances, and
to which perſons are engaged on both ſides; and then let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

                  <p>And for the firſt, who does not know, that the word is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

<hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 13. A bare Seal, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. is (as we have heard) called a

Job 5. 23. <hi>They ſhall be in league with the ſtones of the field,</hi> the ſame

A covenant ſometimes in an improper ſenſe is ſaid to be made

it is an agreement between God and man concerning ſalvation promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and faith owing by man: And a Teſtament, becauſe it is eſtabliſhed
upon the promiſed death of the Son of God, and an heavenly inheritance
by it, ſo that it may not unworthily be called a Teſtamentary covenant,
or a Teſtament-covenant, by reaſon of the concurrence of both in one.
And after concludes, Simply it is a covenant by reaſon of the mutual
agreement between God and beleevers; Reſpectively a Teſtament, by
reaſon of the way, and manner of the chief and moſt eminent part in the
covenant, that is the promiſe of grace, whereby God promiſeth to be

latitude the word <hi>Berith</hi> is taken: <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>ſhewes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55700:38"/>
the limitation of it out of the Types and ſhadows of the Law in the
fifteenth, and following verſes when he ſhews that the grace of God,
was herein more eminent and conſpicuous, in that he gave unto his,
not a covenant, but a Teſtament, giving in his reaſons; becauſe a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
must have contained mutual conditions, which if either part did
not performe, the covenant were void; but a Testament is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of liberality and bounty, by which men are called and made
heirs without eying of any duty that is to be done by them.</hi> Here
by the way we ſee that in caſe it be a covenant (according to him)
it hath mutual conditions, and therefore he is (together with
<hi>Ravanellus, Gomarus, Vrſinus</hi> before quoted, to whom may be
added <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> on <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. giving the like definition)
wholly againſt thoſe who make this inference; <hi>That it cannot be
proved to be of the general nature of covenants, that there ſhould be
ſuch a convertibility, as that both muſt ſeal or contract or perform.</hi>
But for his poſition that God hath not given a covenant to his
people, I wonder how it ſlipt from him; Such unwary expreſſions
(in a ſeeming tendency to advance grace from pious perſons)
have made way for ſtrange ſuperſtructions. He might have ſaid,
that thoſe Types and Shadows of the Law, did argue it to be more
then a bare and common covenant, being ratified by blood,
which led to the blood of the Mediatour. And ſo <hi>Rivet</hi> (as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
him) anſwers,<note n="g" place="margin">Non hoc vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit Paulus in Epiſtola ad He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeos, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. ex ſimplici vocis ſignificatione arguere, ſed ex ipſius foederis circumſtantiis.</note>

but from the circumſtances of the covenant.</hi> But his denying it to
be a covenant, is that which I muſt oppoſe. He is large indeed
to ſhew in what latitude the word <hi>Berith</hi> in ſome Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Texts is uſed, as alſo the Latine word <hi>Foedus</hi> in prophane
Authors; All of which, ſhews no more but that the word in the
exact denotation and largeſt ſenſe of it imports no more then an ordination
or diſpoſition, yet that hinders not, but that as,
Interpreters generally render it, ſo, the received and accuſtomed
uſe of it, is, to hold out a covenant, bargaine, or agreement. As
the word <gap reason="foreign">

even for civil uſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 39. yea, rude congregated routs,
<hi>verſe</hi> 41. yet in the generally received ſenſe, it is taken for holy
Aſſemblies; So, it is with <hi>Berith;</hi> the word may admit of a
large ſenſe, but the received ſenſe is with more reſtriction. The
Jews had their covenants, man with man, <hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi>

Engliſh, do ſignifie mutual contracts, in which there are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
performances; and ſo the Hebrew word <hi>Berith</hi> in like
manner; this being according to the learned the genuine
ſignification of it. And if this were not the received ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it, how did the Objection before mentioned ever
come into any mans head, that the Apoſtle did bewray ignorance
in the Scripture-uſe of the word, in applying it to a mans Will or
Teſtament, and what needed ſo much pains for his defence in it?
<hi>Hierome</hi> on thoſe words, <hi>Gal 3. 17. This I ſay, that the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
confirmed of God,</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any compare the Hebrew volumes
and other Editions with the tranſlation of the Septuagint, he ſhall
find, that, where Testament is written, it doth not ſignifie a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but a Covenant, which in the Hebrew tongue is called</hi> Berith.
And in caſe Gods whole diſpenſations and Goſpel-communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(as <hi>Junius</hi> would have it) be a Teſtament onely, and no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
why is the world ſo abuſed with the word <hi>foedus, pactum</hi>
in Latine, covenant in Engliſh? By which all men underſtand
that which we call a covenant, no man underſtands a Teſtament;
why do we ſay covenant of Works, covenant of grace, if the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55700:39"/>
former onely were a covenant properly, and the other a Teſtament?
as though we ſhould cal, an Eagle, and a Lion both by the common
name of a bird, perſwading that a Lion were a bird, as well as an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle?
yet if it were a Teſtament properly ſo called, it would not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the conditionality, as Mr. <hi>Grayl</hi> out of <hi>Swynborn</hi> ſhews. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments
have their conditions, How comes it to paſs that Scripture
holds out ſo frequently that ſimilitude of a marriage, <hi>Iſ. 54. 5. Hoſ.
2. 19. 2 Cor. 11. 2. Eph.</hi> 5. 32. to ſet out this tranſaction? A marriage
contract is not a mans Teſtament: hath a wife barely a Legacie,
and doth ſhe enter no covenant with her husband? How comes
it to paſſe that turning aſide from God, after other lovers, is
called in Scripture by the name of whoredomes, adulteries, which
is the breach of a marriage-covenant? and how is ſin againſt God,
called a dealing falſely with God? we cannot deale falſely in the
covenant, if it be not a covenant, but a Teſtament; men may
carry themſelves unthankfully, but falſehood argues an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
How is it that we finde, in Old and New Teſtament-Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
mutuall engagements, between God and his people; of God
to them, of them to him, in caſe God hath vouchſafed them a
Legacie by Teſtament, in the death of his Son, and left them out
of covenant? And how is that, without Covenant, without
Chriſt, without God, without Hope, with the Apoſtle are one and
the ſame, when yet all people that have hope in Chriſt are out of
covenant? There be that ſay, <hi>The holy Writers do illuſtrate the New
covenant, rather by the Metaphor of a Teſtament, then a covenant.</hi>
Theſe ſeeme to make it neither a Covenant nor a Teſtament. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one knows that a Metaphor is a figure, whereby a word is
carried out of its proper ſignification into ſome other that carries
reſemblance with it. In caſe there be a metaphor in that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
then it is not proper, but borrowed; But as I beleeve that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
ſpake not by a Metaphor to God, when he ſaid, <hi>Gen. 18. 25.
Shall not the Judge of all the world do right?</hi> God abſolving and
and condemning the ſons of men, giving rewards, and inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
penalties, is a Judge properly ſo called; ſo I do not think
that God ſpake in any Metaphor to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when in the
chapter before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. he ſaith, <hi>I will eſtabliſh my covenant
between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee.</hi> God is a Judge of
all the earth, properly ſo called, and he hath entred a covenant
with his people, properly ſo called likewiſe. It is true, that we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55700:40"/>
that relation of God to his people, more clearly by
the Analogy that it bears to Judges, that are ſet up among men, for
abſolution of the innocent, &amp; condemning of the guilty, And ſo we
are holpen in our underſtandings of the covenant of God entred
with his people, by Analogy with the covenants, that are among
men; but, in neither of both of theſe, is the word taken out of its
proper ſenſe, and applyed to any other, that it will not properly
bear. I finde indeed an eminent Divine affirming, <hi>That a covenant
is not ſo properly ſaid, to be with God and man, as between man and
man,</hi> not denying the duty, which man owes to God, nor the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
by which he is obliged, but freely yeelding both; and
ſticking only at the conſent on mans part, <hi>which among men</hi> (he ſayes) <hi>is requiſite, and doth mutually concur to make the covenant va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.
But neither in the covenant of nature, or grace, is this conſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teceding
the validity of the covenant required in man.</hi> This I confeſſe
I am not able to reach. Nothing with me is more plain, then that,
conſent is pre-required in both theſe covenants: <hi>Adam,</hi> I confeſſe,
(as it is objected) was bound to conſent, yea, I will yeeld more, that
it is no more poſſible to conceive <hi>Adam</hi> to deny conſent, then the
Sunne to be without light; ſeeing in his natural motion he was
carried in that way of full conformity to God, that the Sun may as
well be dark, as <hi>Adam</hi> averſe from the will or tender of God; yet
if we could conceive a dark Sunne; it could not be a light to rule
the day; ſo if we could conceive <hi>Adam</hi> denying conſent to God,
in the tender of covenant, <hi>Adam</hi> had not been in covenant. For
fallen man it is clear; what held the Phariſees out of the New
covenant, but their non-conſent? rejecting the counſel of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
themſelves, <hi>Luk</hi> 7. 30. as alſo thoſe Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. who contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
and blaſpheming, <hi>judged themſelves unworthy of eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The covenant was tendered to all thoſe Gentile Nations, and
Cities where the Goſpel was preached, and all were bound to
yeeld aſſent, but where there was aſſent of faith, there the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was entered; where aſſent is denied, there they remained,
ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe; in the ſame way of
Gentiliſme, as though the Goſpel had never been tendered, or the
Name of Chriſt held forth. So that theſe things conſidered, I doubt
not but I have made it appear,</hi> That there is a mutual contract, and
mutual performances to which perſons are engaged, not only uſually
in covenants, but in all covenants. <hi>And that</hi> it is of the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55700:40"/>
of covenants, that there ſhould be ſuch a convertibility, as that
both muſt, if not ſeal, (ſome <hi>contracts are without ſeals</hi>) yet contract,
or performe, and where a ſeal is vouchſafed, must accept of it: <hi>and
that the definition of the covenant in the general is vindicated,</hi>
That God hath entred a covenant properly ſo called, with man, with
fallen man, in which there is a contract of this nature, and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to mutual performances, God condeſcending to it of grace, and
man obliged to it by duty, yet accepting voluntarily. <hi>Which (as
the former) might be confirmed by the authority of Divines of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency.
Mr.</hi> Ball <hi>ſpeaking of the covenant of God in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
entred with man, ſaith, It may be thus deſcribed.</hi> A mutual
compact or agreement betwixt God and man, whereby God promiſeth
all good things, ſpecially eternal happineſſe unto man, upon juſt, equal,
and favourable conditions: and man doth promiſe to walk before
God in all acceptable, free, and willing obedience, expecting all good
from God, and happineſſe in God, according to his promiſe, for the praiſe
and glory of his great Name. <hi>And</hi> Vrſin <hi>in his Catechiſme, page
91. defining a covenant in the general nature of it as before, he
ſaith, it is</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Foedus Dei eſt mutua pactio inter Deum &amp; homines, quâ Deus confirmat hominibus ſe futurum eis propitium, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſurum pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata, donaturum juſtitiam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam, Spiritum Sanctum, &amp; vitam aeternam per &amp; propter Filium Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem; viciſſim homines ſe obligant Deo ad fidem &amp; poenetentiam, hoc eſt, ad recepiendum verâ fide hoc tantum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficium, &amp; ad praeſtandam Deo veram obedientiam.</note> A mutual agreement between God and man, whereby God
confirmes to man that he will be merciful, forgive their ſinnes, give

by his ſon the Mediatour: In like manner men tie themſelves to God
for faith and repentance, that is, by a lively faith to receive this
mercy alone, and to yeeld true obedience to God. <hi>And</hi> Lucas Trelca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
in loco de foedere <hi>thus defines it.</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Foedus eſt pactum Dei cum homine, de foelicitate aeterna, certâ conditione ci communicanda ad Dei gloriam. Pactum cùm dicimus, intelligimus mutuam Dei &amp; hominis obligationem, ex ſtipulatione intervenientem, ut utrimque reddatur quod promiſſum eſt. Duae ergo ſunt partes foederis. 1. Promiſſio Dei de vita aeterna. 2. Obligatio hominis ad obſervationem conditionis a Deo praeſcriptae. Prima eſt libera; ſecunda eſt neceſſaria.</note> The covenant is an agreement
to God with man, concerning eternal happineſſe to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to man, upon a certain condition, to the glory of God. <hi>And
then explaining himſelf he ſays,</hi> When we ſay an agreement, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
a mutual obligation of God and man, by a ſtipulation inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
that what is promiſed on both parts, may be performed.
<hi>And farther ſaith,</hi> There are two parties of the covenant. 1. The
promiſe of God concerning everlaſting life. 2. The obligation of man
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55700:41"/>
                     <hi>for performance of the condition preſcribed of God; the first is free,
the ſecond is neceſſary.</hi> And in concluſion, ſuch a bottome I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
is laid in the Introduction, that will bear the whole fabrick
that follows after. <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Gomarus,</hi> are as oppoſite as may be,
one to the other in this diſpute about the covenant, as may be
ſeen in the Appendix to the firſt chapter: But they both agree in
this, that every covenant of neceſſity is to have mutual engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and performances. <hi>Gomarus</hi> denies that the promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi>
3. 15. containes the covenant of grace, becauſe no conditions are
there mentioned. And <hi>Junius</hi> to avoid conditions, denies that there
is any ſuch thing as a covenant between God and man, for if it
were a covenant, he ſayes it muſt have conditions. Therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to them both, if we grant a covenant, we muſt grant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and the full nature of the covenant, is in no Scripture laid
down, where we have not theſe engagements, or conditions, laid
down likewiſe. Some think to reconcile all this by the various ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the word. <hi>Sometimes it is ſouſed in Scripture, that the
free promiſe of God is thereby ſignified, and the reſtipulation of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
withit, God requiring man to engage by covenant to that which
he might require, did there no promiſe intervene; yet ſometimes in
Scripture, covenant doth ſignifie the abſolute promiſe of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reſtipulation, and of this kinde is that covenant in which
God promiſeth to give to his elect faith and perſeverance, to which
promiſe there cannot be conceived any condition to be annexed, which
is not comprehended in the promiſe it ſelf.</hi> So Learned <hi>Camero de
triplici foedere,</hi> Theſ. 1. 2. For this abſolute covenant here ſpoke
to, I deſire the Reader to obſerve what the ſame learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
hath farther in his third Theſis. <hi>This diſtinction of the
Covenant, doth depend upon the diſtinction of the love of God;
for there is a love of God to the Creature, from whence every thing
that is good in the creature hath wholly flowed; and there is the
acquieſcent love of God in the creature, and this the creature hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
not for any thing from it ſelf, but from God, as it was loved
with that firſt love of God: that love, for better underſtanding, we call
Gods primary or antecedent; this Gods ſecondary or conſequent love:
from that we ſay, doth depend both the paction, and fulfilling of the
abſolute covenant, from this depends the fulfilling of that covenant;
to which is annexed a restipulation, not ſo the paction, for that we
ſay depends on the firſt love.</hi> This antecedent love is wont to be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55700:41"/>
called <hi>Amor benevolentiae,</hi> which can be no more then a purpoſe or
reſolution in God for good to man. The ſecond is wont to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Amor complacentiae,</hi> a love of delight, or content. How the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
can be a covenant, or any covenant properly ſo called depend
upon it, as preceding the latter, I do not ſee.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this goes before the giving of Chriſt; the gift of Chriſt is
an effect of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. Now God covenants not with man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Mediator as <hi>Camero</hi> himſelf acknowledges; and therefore
this that precedes, can be no covenant made.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a covenant plainly argues an agreement, at leaſt in
tender from one, and profeſſed acceptation from the other party.
A covenant of parties at a diſtance, either party holding his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
reſpective to that where the diſtance is held, is the greateſt
abſurdity. Now in this abſolute covenant (as it is called) there
is not ſo much as a tender from God, much leſſe an acceptance
from man, and ſo, as yet a diſtance held, and therefore no cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
or agreement.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this ſuppoſed abſolute covenant, <hi>Jer. 31, 33. Heb.</hi> 8. 10.
hath mercies of two ſorts; graces, priviledges; And though men
contend that the promiſe of grace is abſolute, ſeeing there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pre-required of us, for the writing of this Law in our hearts,
yet the priviledge of remiſſion of ſins hath its conditions, <hi>Act. 10.
43. Act. 13. 38, 39. Act.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, none can claim any intereſt in, or take any comfort
from, this abſolute covenant, depending on the antecedent love of
God, preceding the conditional covenant, depending on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
love of God: before he hath entered the ſecond which is
conditional, and performed the conditions, and knows that he hath
performed them. This is clear, it is made, all ſay, with the Elect;
now none can claime his intereſt till he knows his Election, which
is made ſure only, by our ſaith, and new obedience, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that we have of our faith and new obedience. But it is enough
to me that a covenant comprizing a reſtipulation of our duty, is
here confeſt, which is the Goſpel way to ſalvation, without which,
the acquieſcent love of God is not attained. As to that Text, <hi>Heb.</hi>

on his part, let the covenant it ſelf be judge in this caſe; mark it
in <hi>Jeremy, Ezekiel,</hi> or in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In thoſe Texts there are graces mentioned; as Gods
work on the ſoule, and priviledges promiſed to be enjoyed.
Whatſoever is there ſet forth, as Gods work upon the ſoul, is
alſo required of man as duty, namely to <hi>be renued in the ſpirit
of his mind,</hi> Eph. 4. 23. <hi>To make him a new heart, and a new ſpirit,</hi>
Ezek. 18. 31. <hi>That the Word of Christ dwell in him richly in all
wiſdome,</hi> Col. 3. 16. It will be hard for any to point out a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of this nature, but it may be anſwered with a command,
as an obligation unto duty; As the precepts muſt not thruſt
out the promiſe, nor duty ſhoulder out free grace, So,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55700:42"/>
the promiſe muſt not deſtroy the precept; In that of <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
conditions on mans part are included, ſo as by the aſſiſtance of
grace to be performed. The tie lies upon us, on pain of loſſe
of all that the covenant promiſeth, and bearing all that-it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Suppoſe (<hi>ſaith one</hi>) there ſhould be a fault, of performing
in this Covenant, whoſe were the fault?</p>
                  <p>Anſw. <hi>The fault is his; who is chidden in Scripture, and beaten
for it, namely thoſe</hi> that did flatter God with their mouth, and lied
unto him with their tongues, whoſe heart was not right with him,
nor were ſledfaſt in his covenant, <hi>Pſ. 78. 36, 37. They,</hi> upon whom he
will bring a ſword to avenge the quarrel of his covenant, <hi>Lev. 26. 25.
are in the fault.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if there be conditions, then the covenant is not free, gifts
muſt be of abſolute grace and bounty, if a condition be required, the
freedome of the gift is deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is true of ſuch conditions, where there is merit in
the condition, whereby benefit accrues to him, that engages by
promiſe, holding proportion with the reward; But, here is nothing
indented by way of covenant, but that homage which is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
due, which God may challenge from us as creatures; without
either engagement unto, or exhibition of any reward at all for
their paines, and what he may require without reward, when he
covenants for it, the reward is free. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had made <hi>Eliezer</hi>
of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> his heir, upon his faithful ſervice, the inheritance
had yet been a free gift, and of grace conferr'd upon him. Make the
Propoſition univerſal, All conditions in promiſes deſtroy the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a gift in the thing promiſed, and then it is to be denied, A
covenant of grace would then be a contradiction, ſeeing it is no
covenant, (as hath been demonſtrated) without a condition. Then
the Prophet doth contradict himſelf in the tender of a covenant,
in the moſt free manner as is poſſible, <hi>Iſa. 55. 1, 2. Ho, every one
that thirſteth, &amp;c.</hi> even their conditions are required; <hi>Incline
your ear, and come unto me, Hear and your ſoul ſhall live; Let the
wicked for ſake his way, the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him
return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and unto
our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Here are free promiſes
with conditions; Men, who have not that ſovereignty, account their
gifts free, and yet require conditions from them on whom they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55700:43"/>
are conferred. An Alms-houſe is founded, and endowed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
conditions are put upon the Almes-people, to reſide in
ſuch an houſe aſſigned, to wear clothes of the colour and forme
preſcribed, or whatſoever elſe the Founder pleaſe, and yet the
gift is free. Finally, God cannot covenant with man, and keep
up his ſovereignty, if we leave out obedience in the Articles of
the covenant. The covenant is upon equal termes, if ſubjection be
excluded; to be a God in covenant, and not require ſubjection,
is the higheſt of contradictions.</p>
                  <p>A Learned Writer, after a large diſcourſe held of the right
that Redeemed ones have to the death of Chriſt before beleeving,
ſaith, <hi>Here may be obſerved the miſtake of thoſe, who winde up the
merit of Chriſt, as affecting God (as I may ſo ſpeak;) unto a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
engagement,</hi> viz. <hi>that we ſhall be made partakers of the fruits
of it, upon ſuch and ſuch conditions to be by us fulfilled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> It will be
worth our labour to enquire what is meant by the conditional
engagement, unto which he ſays ſome winde up the merit of
Chriſt, as affecting God with it; doth he mean ſuch conditions,
that as cauſes or impulſive motives take with God to enter ſuch
engagement? If this be the meaning, I ſhall freely yeeld that
there is no ſuch conditional covenant, that there is no
ſuch condition in any Covenant of God with man. In this
ſenſe Maſter <hi>Culverwell</hi> in his Treatiſe of Faith, <hi>page</hi> 143. takes
it, Having mentioned ſeveral conditional promiſes, (in which
faith is expreſſely required, and ſuch wherein it is neceſſarily
underſtood) he ſaith, <hi>In all which, faith is neceſſarily underſtood,
for the obtaining of the benefit promiſed. But yet in all theſe, faith,
is no condition properly ſo called, moving God to promiſe life.</hi> But ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it, in this reſtrained ſenſe, as moving God to promiſe life,
he much miſtakes himſelf, where he ſaith, <hi>That it confounds
the Law and the Goſpel, taking away a chief difference between the
covenant of works and the covenant of grace, page</hi> 141. Seeing
there was no condition, thus underſtood in the covenant of works;
There was not any ſuch good, accruing to God by any thing
that <hi>Adam</hi> was to do, that upon it, or for it, God ſhould make
the promiſe of life. God hath no motives out of himſelf, to
confer his rewards, Conditions taken in ſuch a ſenſe; will make
the covenant of grace, and the covenant of works all unconditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal.
But taking the word [condition] in the ſenſe, as, it is in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55700:43"/>
ordinary uſe, and as it properly ſignifies, for duty in covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented,
agreed upon, and aſſented to, on performance, or neglect
of which, the promiſe ſtands or falls, it is plain that there are ſuch
conditions in both covenants, equally, in one as the other. The
neceſſity of the concurrence of grace to the work of faith, will
as ſoon make it no duty as no condition, and many denying the
one, have learnt to deny either of both, as well duties, as condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Mr. <hi>Culverwel</hi> therefore conſeſſeth, that, faith in ſome
ſort may be called a condition, becauſe the promiſe of life is made
to perſons qualified with faith, <hi>page</hi> 143. and this conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
well underſtood (ſaith he) <hi>page</hi> 141. may be born. And if
underſtood, with ſuch a reſtraint as the word will not ſuffer (we
confeſſe) Chriſtians muſt not acknowledge it. This being premiſed,
let us look into the reaſons brought to back the former aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> All ſuch conditions, if ſpiritual bleſſings, are part of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
of the death of Chriſt, and if not, are no way fit to be conditions
of ſuch an attainment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are ſo parts of his purchaſe, that they are alſo our
act, The act of man by the power of God; God gives faith and
gives repentance, yet we beleeve and we repent, we may as eaſily
reconcile Chriſts purchaſe, with the nature of a condition, as
Gods free gift of grace with our duty, If the gift were of grace
and no duty required, then there were force in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This ridgidly followed, will diſingage man from all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to God, ſeeing all power to obey, is part of the purchaſe
of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It cannot be made apparent, how any ſuch conditional ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
can be aſcribed to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We finde ſuch a one in Scripture aſcribed to God, no
condition can in more plain terms be held our. In caſe we cannot
ſee how it can be, it were ſafer to lay our hands on our mouths; and
acknowledge our weakneſſe, then to withſtand ſo clear evidence.
He is pleaſed to give his Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, ſaith he,</hi> It leaves no proper place for he merit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This reaſon I can by no means reach. Chriſt may merit,
and upon what terms he pleaſes, confer what he hath merited; Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in us excludes merit in Chriſt, as well as conditions impoſed
upon u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. See <hi>Ball</hi> on the covenant, <hi>page</hi> 133.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:55700:44"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is very improperly aſcribed to God, &amp;c. Stipulation,
or engagements upon conditions, that are properly ſo, do ſuppoſe him
that makes the engagement, to be altogether uncertain of the event
thereof, for which the authority of Lawyers is quoted.</p>
                  <p>If conditions among men be of ſuch uncertainty, it doth not
thence follow, that it is ſo in thoſe conditions which God impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
on performance of which he conferres the mercies which he
gives in promiſe. If there be ſo much difference between moral
hope, and that Chriſtian grace which is wrought by the Spirit, that
the one is only poſſible, conjectural, uncertain and doubtful, the
other aſſured and never failing; The one often ending in ſhame,
The other never making aſhamed; Then there may be a like dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the conditions aſſigned by man, and thoſe aſſigned by
God, Men may be ſtill uncertain, yet God may be aſſured, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
being not left to contingency or the freedome of mans will,
(which is ſuppoſed to ſtand in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi>) but determined by the
act of grace which is not hid from him, whoſe hand works it in
the hearts of his people. This might ſeem to carry far rather force
againſt all conditions in the firſt covenant, which is yet granted
to be conditional, which for performance was meerly ſuſpended
on mans will, but hath no colour againſt the conditions of the
ſecond covenant, which God works of grace as he requires of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty.</p>
                  <p>One is pleaſed to ſay, <hi>Surely they are wide (if not very wilde) who
affirm that all the ſtipulations on the part of God, upon the death of
Chriſt are upon a condition, which himſelf knows to be impoſſible for
them to perform, to whom they are made,</hi> which among Wiſe men are
always accounted nugatory and null. And may not the like be
ſaid of exhortations, promiſes, threats, commands? God as well
knows our diſability to anſwer theſe, as to fulfil conditions, yet
they are neither wide, nor wilde, that acknowledge ſuch exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
promiſes, threats, commands, without abilities in fallen man
to anſwer them, farther then the concurrence of grace that is in
Chriſt Jeſus ſtrengthens them; There are many more Objections
raiſed by others which the Reader may ſee brought in, by Mr.
<hi>Grayl</hi> and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> and fully anſwered.</p>

                  <p>THe laſt Poſition that I ſhall premiſe, is, <hi>That God in his entry
of covenant with man in ſinne, doth ſo manifeſt his free grace,
that he ſtill keeps up his Sovereignty; ſo exalts mercy, that he
loſeth nothing of his rule and authority;</hi> His chief aime is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
the glory of his free grace, and to ſet out the riches of his great
mercy, that ſo noble a <hi>ſpecies,</hi> as that of mankinde might not for
ever periſh, yet he quits not man of his ſubjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
When the Angels fell, ſome ſtood, (whether the fallen or
perſevering number be greater, cannot be determined) but when
man fell, mankinde wholly was loſt, and unleſſe grace ſave, muſt
everlaſtingly periſh. As ſome, with the loſt Angels muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
on whom God will glorifie his juſtice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 41. So o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
muſt be veſſels of mercy, on whom his free grace ſhall be
ſeen, to make them as the Angels of heaven. Therefore love is
aſſigned as the alone impulſory motive; <hi>God ſo loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten ſonne,</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>God who is rich in
mercy, according to the great love, wherewith he loved us, when we
were dead in ſinne,</hi> Eph. 2. 5. Of this,<note place="margin">Mans fall by ſin was no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obligation to obedience.</note> all that expect to be ſaved by
grace, muſt be tender, that it be not obſcured; Gods deſigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to advance it, our care muſt be that it be not leſſened. In this
exerciſe of free grace, God yet keeps up authority and rule, power
and dominion ſtill is his. Man was made of God ſubject to a Law
and under dominion, having the law written in his heart from the
Creation, and he was not diveſted of it by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, nor yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from it by Chriſts Redemption. <hi>Corvinus</hi> indeed in his

guilt and wrath. But this is a manifeſt errour, Mans guilt can
never rob God of his Sovereignty, nor yet diſingage man from his
duty, Standing right with God, he is bound to homage; Under
guilt, he is bound both to homage and puniſhment; and to be
admitted to ſerve is not meerly of favour, but of dominion and
power. It was no great favour, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> found, in the
ſervice of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> to ſerve with acceptance is indeed a favour;
but neceſſity, and duty ties all that are under Sovereignty. As man
fallen, in right is a ſubject, though in his demeanour a rebel; So
in his regenerate eſtate ſtill he ows ſubjection. When God became
a Saviour to the Elect of mankind, he did not ceaſe to be a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigne.

Here I ſhall aſſert three things; Firſt, <hi>God in the days of
the Goſpel, keeps up the power and authority of his Law; the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it is still in force to binde the conſciences of beleevers.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>That this Law which God thus keeps up in force, is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and compleat rule to thoſe to whom it is given.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That
this Law binds, as given by the hand of Moſes.</hi> As to the firſt, when
I ſpeak thus, of the Obligation of the Law, I hope I ſcarce need
to tell in what ſenſe; I do take the Law, Not in the largeſt
ſenſe, for any doctrine, inſtruction, or Ordinance of any kinde
whatſoever, Men have their Laws and Directories: but I have
to deal with the Law of God: Neither do I take it for the whole
of the Word of God, all his will revealed in his Word, as it is taken,
<hi>Iſa. 2. 3. The Law ſhall go forth of</hi> Zion, <hi>and the Word of the Lord
from Jeruſalem.</hi> Nor yet as it is taken for all the Scripture of the
Old Teſtament, as in that Text of the Apoſtle, <hi>In the Law it
is written by men of other tongues, and by other languages I will
ſpeak to this people,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 21. Nor yet for the five books of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> as it is taken in the words of Chriſt, <hi>All must be fulfilled
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55700:45"/>
that was written in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 44. Neither do
I here underſtand the Ceremonial Law, which ſtood up as
a partition between Jew and Gentile, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 14. All that did
binde the Jews, and was not of force from God with the Gentiles,
is taken off from Chriſtians; There was a confeſſion of guilt; a
beaſt needed not to have been ſlain, if they had been innocent;
this held them under hopes that there was ſacrifice to take away
ſinne, impoſed on the Jewes till the time of reformation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.
10. as an Appendix to the firſt Table; fitted to the Jewes ſtate
and condition, as a ſhadow of good things to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1.
Nor yet the judicial Law, given to order the Common-wealth or
State of that people, farther then ſo much of it, as was of nature,
and then did bind the Gentiles. It is the Moral-Law that I meane,
that Law which was obligatory, not only to the Jews, but Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
for breach of which they ſuffered, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 27, 28. Neither
do I underſtand the Moral Law, as a covenant, upon obſervation
of which life was expected and might be claimed. This is utterly
inconſiſtent with the Goſpel. <hi>If there had been a Law that could
have given life, verily righteouſneſſe had been by the Law,</hi> Gal. 3. 21.
And this righteouſneſſe giving life, utterly overthrows the Goſpel.
<hi>If righteouſneſſe come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain,</hi> Gal.
2. 21. In which ſenſe I deny that the Jewes were ever under the
Law. The Law was not given as ſuch a covenant as ſhall God
willing be ſhewn. So the Moral Law and Ceremonial Law ſhould
militate one againſt another. The Moral Law holding them in
themſelves, looking for a righteouſneſſe of works, and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law leading them out of themſelves, unto a ſacrifice for
remiſſion of ſinne.<note place="margin">The Law hath a commanding power over beleeevers.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> was under no ſuch covenant, he

<hi>Abraham.</hi> But it ſtill hath the nature of a Law binding to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
it is for ever a rule, for the guide of our wayes. That
it was once of force, is without queſtion; and above all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and therefore I need not to multiply Old Teſtament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Scriptures for it; There is no repeale of it, it was never anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
and aboliſhed; therefore it is of force; Though a Law be
urged, yet if a repeal may be pleaded, there is a diſcharge. That
it is not repealed, I ſhall ſhew, and further that it is not capable
of any repeal. If it be repealed, then either by Chriſt, at his
coming in the fleſh; or elſe by his Apoſtles, by commiſſion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55700:46"/>
from him, after the Spirit was given; But neither Chriſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
nor the Apoſtles by any commiſſion from him did repeal it;
but inſtead of a repeale, did put a new ſanction upon it; Chriſt
indeed as ſoon as he publickly appeared in the work of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was charged that he came to deſtroy the Law; But this
he did utterly diſavow, and men of faith in Chriſt ſhould believe
him, profeſſing that he came not <hi>to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it.</hi>
Yea, that there is a greater ſtability in the Law in every tittle of it
in regard of the permanency, then is in heaven and earth, then is in
the whole frabrick of the world; And whereas the Scribes and
Phariſees were then thought to be the only ſtrict obſervers of
the rule of the Law, and the alone men that kept up the honour
of it, Chriſt aſſerts a neceſſity of a higher degree of obedience
then the Scribes and Phariſees ever taught or practiſed, <hi>Except
your righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,
&amp;c.</hi> which muſt be underſtood of righteouſneſſe inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
in conformity to the Law, as appeares in the precedent
words, where Chriſt holds diſcourſe about the Law, and is more
fully confirmed in the words that follow; Chriſt on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
openeth the commandments of the Law, ſhewing how farre
Scribes and Phariſees went in their righteouſneſſe, how farre we
muſt tranſcend them if ever we come to the Kingdome of heaven.
Neither did the Apoſtles by any Commiſſion from Chriſt repeal
it, but they add the ſame ſanction to it. <hi>Paul</hi> foreſeeing that
this very thing would be charged upon him, as it was upon Chriſt,
ſaith, <hi>Do we make void the Law through faith? yea, we eſtabliſh</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>the Law,</hi> Rom 3. 31. Our doctrine is a confirmation,
and no abolition of it. And both he, and other Apoſtles
frequently in their Epiſtles, urge precepts of the Moral Law, as

Chriſt not changing the Law of Creation, but taking to himſelf the

Mr. <hi>Burg, Vindiciae Legis,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Boltons</hi> Treatiſe of the true

much forgets himſelfe, who in a Treatiſe of the two covenants,
beſpeaks his Reader in theſe words: <hi>Conſider this ſeriouſly, that
if you be beleevers, and married to Chriſt, the Law hath no more
power over you then a dead husband hath over his relict and living
wife,</hi> which he preſently interprets of a commanding power,
and denies, <hi>that the Law hath any commanding power over a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever.</hi>
Which aſſertion of his, that it may be the more obſerved,
he puts into his Index: <hi>The Law hath no commanding power over
a beleever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Authour yet ſays, <hi>that the Law is a diſcoverer of,
and convincer of ſinne to beleevers, It is a curb to the pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of beleevers as well as of unbeleevers;</hi> But if a husband
cannot by reaſon of death command his wife, how can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
her of her faults, or be a curb or reſtraint to her? <hi>Job</hi>
was in right of command over his wife, as long as he had power
of reproof, to tell her of her folly, and to endavour to put a ſtop
to it. In his anſwer of an objection he yeelds, that <hi>though the
Law ſhould be dead to a beleever, and a beleever dead to the Law,
yet it doth not thence follow that they ſhould ſinne, muſt ſinne, or will
ſinne;</hi> Upon this ſuppoſition I ſay, there is not in them a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of ſinne, or poſſibility of ſinning. He further ſayes, <hi>There
would be no ſinne (were it not for a Law) for the Law gives (if I
may ſo terme it) a being to ſinne, and therefore is called the ſtrength
of ſinne, for if a man ſhould ſwear, covet, or kill, and there ſhould
be no Law prohibiting the ſame, doubtleſſe it would not be evil, for
the Law makes it evil.</hi> And if the Law hath loſt its commanding
power, then it can give ſinne no more being, yea, it hath loſt
its own being, power of command being of the eſſence of it.
If the Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> have no power of command, then,
I ſin not, if I kill. If that Law, <hi>Sweare not at all,</hi> have no power
of commanding, then, our RANTERS high oaths, are no more

is a dead husband. Firſt, I ſay, if he will be pleaſed to informe
me, how a dead husband rips up his wives faults, how he curbs
and keeps her in, (which he confeſſes is the Laws office to a

husband retaines power of command. The Argument is as well
of force, The dead husband hath no power to diſcover his wives
faults, to reſtraine, curb, or keep her in: But the Law is a
dead husband to beleevers; Therefore the Law hath no ſuch
power. It lies upon him to anſwer this argument to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

that the law is wholly dead, nor deny but that it may have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55700:48"/>
this office of command likewiſe. The power which the Law lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
is that which corruption gave it, which is irritation and
condemnation; Corruption never gave command to the Law, and
the death of corruption, through the Spirit, can never exempt the
ſoul from obedience, or take the power of command from it. Let
it be granted that the Law is the husband here mentioned, the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
is this. That as the Law through our corruption was
fruitful in mans nature to the bringing forth of ſinne and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
So Chriſt by the Spirit is to be fruitful in our nature to
bring forth works of grace to ſalvation, and ſo the death of the
Law is meerly in reſpect of irritation, or inflaming to ſinne; and
binding over to condemnation, not in reſpect of command. That
this is the full and clear ſcope of this ſimilitude, beyond which it
muſt not be ſtretched, plainly appeares, <hi>verſe 5. For when we
were in the fleſh, the motions of ſinnes which were by the Law, did
work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</hi> So that here
is nothing againſt the commanding power of the Law: God ſtill
keeps up his Sovereignty, and by this Law he rules the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
I wiſh our Authour would ſadly reflect upon that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his, <hi>The Law is not authorized by Chriſt to reigne and
rule in the conſciences of his people, For his Fathers peace, his own
righteouſneſſe, and his Spirits joy.</hi> There is none that ſpeaks of
the reigne of the Law in the conſciences of the people of God,
but God in Chriſt reigns, and by his Moral Law rules, for all theſe
reaſons, So farre are theſe from excluding his rule, by his Law in
his peoples hearts. If this rule of the Law be deſtructive
to Chriſts righteouſneſſe, then Chriſts coming for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
muſt needs be to deſtroy the Law, which Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes.
And the rule of the peace of God in our hearts, is
ſo farre from excluding his rule by his Law, that without it,
it can never be attained, <hi>Great peace have they that love thy
Law, and nothing ſhall offend them,</hi> Pſalme 119. 165. <hi>This is the
confidence that we have in God, that whatſoever we ask according to
his will, we ſhall receive, becauſe we keep his commandments,</hi> 1 John
3. 22. A Commandment hath a command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> power, and only
they that keep them have this peace ruling in their hearts. The
Spirits joy, and the power of the Law to command, are ſo farre
from oppoſing one the other, that the Spirit gives teſtimony of
Gods abode in no other but ſuch as confeſſe and yeeld to this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55700:48"/>
power. <hi>He that keepeth his Commandments dwelleth in him, and he
in him: and hereby we know that be abideth in us, by the Spirit which
he hath given us,</hi> 1 John 3. 24. And of like nature is that which
he further hath, <hi>Though the Law (the former husband) be dead to
a beleever, yet a beleever is no widow, much leſſe an harlot; for he is
married to Chriſt, and is under the Law of Chriſt, which is love.</hi>
If the moral Law reſpective to the power of command be dead,
then love is dead with it. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt reduces the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into two: Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> If then the
Law be dead, this love from the heart is dead, and ſo a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is either a widow or an harlot. Maſter <hi>Burges, Vindiciae
Legis,</hi> page 12. ſhews at large that <hi>to do a thing out of obedience
to the Law, and yet by love and delight, do not oppoſe one another,</hi>
which if the Reader conſult with his enlargement of it, he ſhall
need to go no farther for refutation, nor his own ſatisfaction.
Men are wont to expect in children and ſervants (much more in
wives) both love and obedience: If this rule hold, they
muſt quit the one, and cleave to the other; Either they muſt take to
love, without obedience, or obedience without love. Theſe
two which cannot be ſevered (if ye love and keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
this Divinity makes inconſiſtent. <hi>God gave Laws</hi> (ſaith
our Authour) <hi>to man to declare his own Sovereignty, and his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
duty.</hi> And we muſt tell him, that to keep up his Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and his creatures duty, he continues his Law. They that take
power of command from it, diveſt him of his Sovereignty, and
exempt the creature from duty. I know there are many evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if it might be to ſhuffle off, and evade this doctrine; if not
wholly denying the Law, yet weakening the power of it in Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-time.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay, <hi>that it bindes us as creatures, but not as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
And then it is to be feared, that they taking themſelves
to be above creatures in that they are Chriſtians, being raiſed in
a neerer relation to God, then meer creatures, they will take
themſelves to be diſobliged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if the creature be caſt into hell,
for tranſgreſſion; as a drunkard, an adulterer, a covetous
perſon, what will become of the Chriſtian? But it bindes both
as creatures and Chriſtians, Chriſt having put his ſanction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>

That Chriſt in the New Teſtament did not only abrogate the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial

Moral Law: That he came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it;
which fulfilling (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) is nothing elſe but a perfecting of it, and
addition of what was wanting: That we ought not only to obſerve
thoſe things that are given us of God, and not abrogated by Christ,
but thoſe precepts in like manner that are added by Chriſt. <hi>Much
more from many</hi> Socinians, <hi>and</hi> Arminians, <hi>may be ſeen in that

with the</hi> Papists, <hi>againſt the</hi> Proteſtants, That Chriſt doth not here

That Chriſt did not adde, new duties which were not commanded in

(<hi>i.e. Adams</hi>) fall, continued to be a perfect Rule of Righteouſneſſe,
and as ſuch was delivered by God on mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<hi>To theſe more might be added, but theſe are
ſufficient to ſhew the great conſent of Proteſtant Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I ſhall not reſt barely upon the authority of theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
but alſo offer to conſideration theſe following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.<note place="margin">Arguments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the perfection of the Moral Law.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. If the Law be not a fully perfect, and compleat Rule of
our lives, then there is ſome ſinne againſt God which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in the Law, This is clear; Deviation from any rule given
of God, is a ſin: Deviation from that, ſuppoſed additional rule,
is a ſin; But there is no ſin which the Law doth not condemn; <hi>Sin
is a tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 John 3, 4. <hi>He that ſins, tranſgreſſeth
the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If the Law alone diſcovers and makes ſinne known, then it
is a perfect, full, and compleat Rule; this is plain: <hi>Omne rectum
index est obliqui.</hi> But the Law alone diſcovers ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20.
This office is aſcribed there to the Law, which is no other but the
Moral Law. Had not the light of that Rule guided the Apoſtle
in this work, he had never made any ſuch diſcovery: And it is the
moral Law written in the decalogue that he means, as appears in
the quotation; <hi>I had not known lust, except the Law had ſaid, Thou
ſhalt not covet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That which alone works wrath, is the alone Rule and guide
of our lives. This is clear, in what ſenſe ſoever it is, that we take
working of wrath: whether we underſtand it of working of
wrath in man againſt God, as ſome do; Mans heart being apt to
riſe againſt him that will exerciſe Sovereignty over him, Or of the
wrath of God kindled againſt man; upon tranſgreſſion of the Law.
But it is the Law that works wrath: it is aſcribed to it, and it alone,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
                  <p>4. That which being removed will take away all poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſinning, that is alone the Rule of our obedience: This
is plain; were there any Rule, the tranſgreſſion of it would be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55700:51"/>
ſtill our ſinne. But the Law being removed, all poſſibility of
ſin is taken away: <hi>Where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi>
Rom. 4. 15.</p>
                  <p>5. If the Law only addes ſtrength to ſinne, <hi>viz.</hi> for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
then the Law is the alone rule of obedience: This
is plaine; Any other Rule whatſoever addes like ſtrength to
ſinne, and upon tranſgreſſion will condemne. But the Law
only addes ſtrength to ſinne, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 56. The ſtrength of ſin is
the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Either the epithite <hi>[moral]</hi> is not juſtly given to the Law;
or elſe it is a perfect Rule of manners, that is, of obedience:
This is plaine, for moral denotes, as <hi>Ameſius</hi> obſerves, that
uſe of it. But this epithite given to the Law, and appropriated to it,
was never (as I think) upon any ſuch account challenged. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Either this new Rule doth tranſcend the old Rule of the
Moral Law; requiring a more exact degree of perfection, as
<hi>Papiſts</hi> ſpeak of their evangelical counſels, and <hi>Socinians</hi> of their
additional Goſpel precepts, or elſe it falls ſhort and admits of
obedience in a degree more low. If it require obedience more
high, then even the doers of the Law, in the greateſt height and
poſſible ſuppoſed perfection; though equal to the Angels, are
ſinners: The Law might be fulfilled, and yet diſobedience
charged. If it fall ſhort of the old Rule (which it ſeemes is the
opinion of ſome who confeſſe an imperfection in our perſonal
righteouſneſſe, as it refers to the old Rule; and aſſert a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as it relates to the new Rule) then the new Rule allows that
which the old Rule condemnes, and ſo they bring in a diſcrepancy
between them and finde an allowance for tranſgreſſion. So that
I think, I have ſufficient authourity, divine and humane, with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that are cogent, to conclude that which I have aſſerted, That
the old Rule, the Rule of the Moral Law, is a perfect Rule, and the
only Rule.</p>
                  <p>Six ſeveral exceptions are taken againſt the<note n="a" place="margin">Exceptions taken againſt the perfection of the Law.</note> perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Law, or ſingularity of it, as a rule by a learned
hand.</p>
                  <p>1. It is demanded, <hi>What ſay you for matter of duty, to the poſitive</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">1. Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                     <hi>precepts for the Goſpel? of Baptiſm; the Lords day; the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and government of the Church, &amp;c? Is the Law of nature:
the only rule for thoſe?</hi> And foreſeeing what would be anſwered as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55700:51"/>
well he might, he addes, <hi>If you ſay, they are reducible to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
commandment, I demand, 1. What is the ſecond command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the affirmative part, but a general precept to worſhip
God, according to his poſitive inſtitution? 2. Do ye take the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>
de genere <hi>to be equivalent to the precepts</hi> de ſpeciebus? &amp;c.
To this I think I may anſwer out of his own mouth, where he
ſayes, <hi>The neglect of Sacraments is a breach of the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi>
In caſe we break the commandments in the neglect
of them, then the commandment requires the obſervation of
them. For which Maſter <hi>Burges</hi> Vindiciae Legis <hi>page 149. Balls</hi>
Catechiſme, <hi>Ameſius</hi> his Sciographia, <hi>Dod</hi> on the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Downhams</hi> Tables, <hi>Zanchy,</hi> each of them on this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;
and <hi>Cawdry</hi> and <hi>Palmer</hi> on the Sabbath, <hi>Part. 2.
Pag.</hi> 176. may be conſulted. For further clearing of this
point, we muſt conſider of the preceptive part of the Moral
Law, which alone in this place is our buſineſſe to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
1. As it is <hi>epitomized</hi> in the Decalogue, thoſe <hi>ten words,</hi>
as <hi>Moſes</hi> calls them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 28. Or elſe, as <hi>commented upon,</hi> and
more amply delivered in the whole Book of the Law, Prophets,
and Scriptures of the New Teſtament. 2. We muſt diſtinguiſh
of the manner how the Law preſcribes, or commands any
thing as duty, which is either <hi>expreſly,</hi> or <hi>Synecdochically,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>directly,</hi> or elſe <hi>interpretatively, virtually, and reductively;</hi>
I very well know, that the Law is not in all particulars ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely,
and expreſly delivered, but that, 1. The uſe, and beſt
improvement of reaſon is required to know, what <hi>pro hic &amp;
nunc</hi> is called for at our hands for duty. The Law layes down
rules in affirmative precepts, in an indefinite way, which we
muſt bring home by particular application, diſcerning by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Scripture Rules, with the help of reaſon (which ſometimes is
not ſo eaſie to be done) when it ſpeaks to us in a way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
as to preſent practical obſervation. 2. That hints
of providence are to be obſerved, to know what in preſent is
duty, as to the affirmative part of the commandment of God.
If that man, that fell among theeves, between <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and
<hi>Jericho,</hi> had ſate by the way, on the green graſſe, without any
appearance of harme, or preſent need of help, the <hi>Samaritane</hi>
that paſſed that way, had not offended, in caſe he had taken
no more notice, then the Prieſt and Levite did: But diſcerning
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55700:52"/>
him that caſe, as he then was, the ſixth commandment called
for that, which he then did, as a preſent office of love to his
neighbour, according to the interpretation of this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given by our Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 4. When the Phariſees
watched him, whether he would heale the man with the wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hand on the Sabbath day, He demands of them, <hi>Is it
lawful to do good on the Sabbath day, or to do evil, To ſave
life, or to deſtroy?</hi> It was not their minde that Chriſt ſhould
kill the man, onely they would not have had him, then to have
cur'd him: But not to cure when it is in our power, according
to Chriſts interpretation, is to kill. If diligent obſervation be
not made, the commandment may be ſoone tranſgreſs'd.
3. Skill in Sciences, and profeſſions is to be improved by men
of skill, that the commandment may be kept. The Samaritane
poured wine and oyle into the travellers wounds, knowing
that to be of uſe, to ſupple and refreſh them. Had he known
any other thing more ſovereigne, which might have been had,
at hand; he was to have uſed it. As skill in medicines is to be
uſed for preſervation of mens lives, ſo alſo skill in the Laws, by
thoſe that are vers'd in them, for the help of their neighbour, in
exigents; concerning his eſtate and livelihood. 4. We muſt
liſten to Gods mouth, to learne when he ſhall be pleaſed at any
time further to manifeſt his minde for the clearing of our way
in any of his precepts. There was a command, concerning
the place of publick, and ſolemn worſhip, <hi>Deut. 12. 5. Vnto
the place which the Lord your God ſhall chooſe out of all your Tribes
to put his Name there, even to his habitation ſhall ye ſeek, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhalt thou come,</hi> Now thou muſt depend on the mouth of
God, to obſerve what place in any of the Tribes; he would
chooſe for his habitation. When God commands, that all
inſtituted worſhip ſhall be according to his preſcript; This is a
perfect Rule implicite, and virtual; tying us to heed the Lord
at any time, more particularly diſcovering his will, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this duty to us. Was not the Law of worſhip perfect, to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> unleſſe it explicitely told him that he muſt ſacrifice his
Sonne? And if any take themſelves to be ſo acute, as to ſet up
a new Rule, as ſome are pleaſed to ſtile it, then they antiquate
and aboliſh the old Rule, and ſingularly gratifie the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian</hi>
party. Two Rules will no more ſtand together
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55700:52"/>
then two covenants; calling it a new Rule, men make the firſt
old: Now that which decayeth and waxeth old, is <hi>ready to vaniſh
away,</hi> Heb. 8. 17. It is added moreover, <hi>doth not the Scripture call
Chriſt our Lawgiver,</hi> and ſay the Law ſhall go out of <hi>Zion,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 3. And was not the old Law his? Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> I am ſure,
quotes that which belongs to the preceptive part of the Moral
Law, and calls it the <hi>Law of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6. 2. His Laws were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in the wilderneſſe, whom the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> there tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and provoked; This is plain, for they ſinn'd againſt the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
and from his hands they ſuffered. And who they tempted
in the wilderneſſe, ſee from the Apoſtles hand, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 9. And
as to the Scripture quoted, the words are exegetically ſet down in
thoſe that follow them. <hi>The Law ſhall go out of Zion, and the Word of
the Lord out of Jeruſalem:</hi> Which is no more, but that the Name of
the Lord, which was then known in <hi>Judah,</hi> ſhall be great from the
riſing of the Sun, to the going down thereof. It is further demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>And is he not the anointed King of the Church, and therfore hath le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative
power?</hi> For anſwer, I deſire to know what King the Church
had, when the old Law was, before Chriſt came in the fleſh?
The Kingdom was one and the ſame, and the King one and the
ſame then, and now, as I take it. <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt, and
Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven.</hi> The Gentiles coming in at the Goſpel-call, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame King, and in the ſame Kingdom. And if all this were
granted which is here pleaded for, it is no more then a change in
ſome poſitive, circumſtantial Rites, and what is this to the queſtion
handled by our Authour; <hi>That our righteouſneſſe which is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
according to the old Rule, is perfect according to the new?</hi> when
old and new in that which is naturally Moral, is one and the ſame.
When the Law required heart-ſervice, and love with the whole
heart, upon ſpiritual ends and motives, upon which account all
fell ſhort in their obedience, and performance, ſhall we ſay that
Chriſt did diſpenſe with any of this, that ſo the Rule being lower,
our obedience now may anſwer. Others that make <hi>Moſes</hi> and
Chriſt two diſtinct Law-givers and agents for God, in holding out
diſtinct precepts, give the pre-eminence to Chriſt, and account his
Law to be of more eminent perfection. This Authour on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſeems to make the Laws of Chriſt to ſtoop far beneath thoſe
of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:55700:53"/>
2. <hi>For Juſtification of this accuſation of the Moral Law of
imperfection,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Exception.</note> 
                     <hi>it is added,</hi> the Moral, taken either for the Law given
to <hi>Adam,</hi> or written in Tables of ſtone, is not a ſufficient rule for us
now, for beleeving in Jeſus Chriſt, no nor the ſame Law of nature as
ſtill in force under Chriſt. For a general command of beleeving all
that God revealeth, is not the only rule of our faith, but the particular
revelation and precept are part, &amp;c. <hi>To this I ſay,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. As before, I think I may anſwer out of his own mouth,
where he ſays, <hi>Neglect of Sacraments is a breach of the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
and unbelief is a breach of the firſt.</hi> If we break the
commandment in unbelief, then the Commandment bindes us to
believe.</p>
                  <p>2. Much of that which I have ſpoke by way of anſwer to the
former, may be applied to this likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>3. I ſhall hereafter ſpeak to this, that faith is a duty of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law, where the Reader may have further ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>4. If <hi>Adam</hi> had no command for faith, then he was not in any
capacity to believe, and by his fall loſt not power of beleeving:
And conſequently it will not ſtand with the Juſtice of God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
it at our hands, having never had power for the performance
of it.</p>
                  <p>5. I ſay, there was power in <hi>Adam,</hi> for that <hi>faith that juſtified,</hi>
but not to <hi>act for juſtification. Adam</hi> had that habit, and the Law
calls for it, from all that are under the command of it: But the
Goſpel diſcovers the object by which a ſinner through faith is
juſtified.</p>
                  <p>3. The ſame anſwer may ſerve to the third exception, which indeed
is the ſame with the former,<note place="margin">3. Exception.</note> only a great deal of flouriſhing is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed,
in diſcourſe of the underſtanding and will, paralleling
them with the Prefaces, grounds and occaſions of Laws, not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be repeated. And at laſt bringing all to the Articles of the
Creed, to which enough already is ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>4. It is ſaid,<note place="margin">4, Exception.</note> 
                     <hi>But what if all this had been left out, and you had
proved the Moral Law the only Rule of duty? doth it follow therefore
that it is the only Rule? Anſw.</hi> If the Moral Law be the only Rule
of duty, then I take it to be the only Rule; for I enquire after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but duty, and I take righteouſneſſe to be matter of duty,
and then the only Rule of duty, is the only Rule of righteouſneſſe.
It is further ſaid, <hi>Sure it is not the only Rule of rewarding.</hi> And I ſay,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55700:53"/>
Rewarding is none of our work, but Gods, and I look for a Rule
of that work which is ours, and that we are to make our buſineſſe,
I confeſſe an imperfection in it, to give life, but aſſert a perfection
as the Rule of our lives, It juſtifies no man, but it orders and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
every juſtified man.</p>
                  <p>5. It is further ſaid,<note place="margin">5. Exception.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſame I may ſay of the Rule of puniſhment.</hi>
To which I give the ſame anſwer: It is not our work, but Gods,
either to reward or puniſh. And here he ſpeaks of a part of the
penalty of the new Law, And I know no penalty properly diſtinct
from the penalty of the old. He is wont to compare it to an Act
of Oblivion, and Acts of Oblivion are not wont to inflict penalties,
but ſerve to remove them when another Law impoſes them. That
of the Parable is inſtanced, <hi>None of them that were bidden ſhall taſte
of the Supper;</hi> when the ſin for which they there ſuffer is a breach
of a Moral command.</p>
                  <p>6. It is ſaid,<note place="margin">6. Exception.</note> 
                     <hi>The principal thing intended is, that the Moral Law
is not the only Rule, what ſhall be the condition of Life or Death, and
therefore not the only Rule according to which we muſt now be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
and hereafter ſentenced, Juſt or Vnjuſt.</hi> To this I have already
given a ſufficient anſwer, and if I had not, our Authour anſwers
fully for me, where he ſays, <hi>The precepts of the Covenant, as meer
precepts, muſt be diſtinguiſhed from the ſame precepts conſidered as
conditions, upon performance of which we must live, or die for non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance?</hi>
And I ſpeak of them as meer precepts, and ſo they are
our Rule of righteouſneſs, &amp; not as they are conditions either of the
covenant of works or grace. And a man may be denominated righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
by the Laws Rule, when he cannot ſtand before the ſentence
of it as a covenant, of which we have heard ſufficient. After a
long diſcourſe againſt all poſſibility of juſtification by the Law of
works, as though I were therein an adverſary; or that the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian</hi>
fancy were above all anſwer; that a man cannot make the
Law his Rule, but he makes it withal his Juſtification, he goes about
to prevent an objection, and ſays, <hi>If you ſhould ſay, this is the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and not the Law,</hi> he will reply. 1. <hi>Then the Law is not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Rule.</hi> To which I ſay, When my work is to make it good,
that the Law is our only Rule, I marvel that he will ſo much as
imagine, that I will ſay that which makes it not the only Rule.
But perhaps, he thinks I do not ſee, how it cannot follow, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I do not, neither can I ſee any colour for it. 2. He replies, <hi>It
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55700:54"/>
is the ſame thing in ſeveral reſpects, that we call a Law and a
Covenant (except you mean it of our covenant-act to God, of which
we ſpeak not) who knows not that</hi> praemiare, <hi>and</hi> punire <hi>are Acts of
a Law? And that an Act of Oblivion or general pardon on certaine
termes is a Law, and that the promiſe is the principal part of the Law
of Grace.</hi> To which <hi>I</hi> ſay, that <hi>praemiare</hi> and <hi>punire</hi> are eſſential
in a Law. Some have power of command, ſo that their words in
juſt things is to be a Law, where moſt deny any power of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
as an Husband over the Wife. Some parents have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to command children, (children remaining under the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the fifth commandment as long as the relation of a childe
continueth) when they have neither power to reward or puniſh.
<hi>Jacob</hi> took himſelf to be in power, to command <hi>Joſeph</hi> (among the
reſt of his Sons, as appears in the charge concerning his burial,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 29, 30. and <hi>chap.</hi> 49. 29. So compared) and yet he was not
in power either to reward or puniſh him. And though they be acts
of a law where he that gives the Law is in power; Yet they are no
parts of a Rule, nor any directory of life to him to whom they
are propoſed. <hi>I</hi> know that an Act of Oblivion or general par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
may be called a Law, as many other things are, <hi>catachreſticè</hi>
and <hi>abuſivè;</hi> but that it ſhould be a Law properly ſo called, <hi>I</hi>
know not. The <hi>Romanes</hi> defined a Law, whileſt that a <hi>Democratie</hi>
was in force among them, to be <hi>Generale juſſum populi, aut plebis
rogante magistratu.</hi> Afterwards when the State was changed, and
the Legiſlative power was in other hands, they defined it to be,
<hi>Juſſum Regis aut Imperatoris.</hi> And <hi>Tully's</hi> definition of a Law
is, that it is, <hi>Ratio ſumma inſita in natura, quae recta ſuadet, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibetque
contraria.</hi> Here <hi>juſſio, ſuaſio,</hi> and <hi>prohibitio</hi> are expreſs'd,
which are not found in Acts of Oblivion. That every man, who
is within the verge of ſuch an Act, may be ſaid to be acquit by
Law, <hi>I</hi> willingly grant; ſeeing that act takes off the force of the
Law condemning him: But that it is a Law, ſtrictly ſo taken, <hi>I</hi>
know not.</p>

hand of Moſes.</head>
                  <p>A Third branch of the general Propoſition before delivered
follows, which is, <hi>that the Moral Law, as delivered by the
hand of</hi> Moſes, <hi>is obligatory to Chriſtians;</hi> This I confeſſe is more
diſputable, then either of the former before ſpoken to; In thoſe,
we had to deale with <hi>Antinomians,</hi> on the one hand; <hi>Papiſts,
Arminians, Socinians,</hi> on the other hand, with ſome few others
that are pleaſed in thoſe points alone to ſtrike in, with <hi>Arminians</hi>
and <hi>Socinians,</hi> and in other things to oppoſe them: But
in this <hi>Papiſts</hi> agree not among themſelves, but one is againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
neither is there that agreement amongſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers
that might be deſired, which muſt not be concealed; ſome are
for the affirmative, and ſome for the negative, and ſome
ſeem to ſtand in a neutral indifferency. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> among the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> is for the affirmative, <hi>lib. 4. de justificatione, cap.</hi> 6. and
takes up <hi>Soto</hi> for the contrary tenent, who affirmes (as he quotes
him) that <hi>Chriſtians are not only delivered from the Ceremonial Law,
and the guilt and terror, of the moral Law, but from the whole Law, as
written in the books of</hi> Moſes, with this caution (as he reports him)
<hi>that we are to keep the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>as it is natural, and as it is in the
Goſpel, and in the Epiſtles of the Apostles, but not as it was written by</hi>
Moſes; <hi>for</hi> Moſes (ſaith he) <hi>could not binde us, but it is Christ that
bindes us, for we are Chriſtians and not Jews. Soto</hi> hath <hi>Suarez,</hi>
and <hi>Medina</hi> (as Maſter <hi>Burges</hi> obſerves) with him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Proteſtants, <hi>Zanchius de redemptione lib. 1. cap.</hi> 12. and
<hi>Muſculus</hi> in his common places go the ſame way, affirming, <hi>that
the Moral Lawes which go under the name of the decalogue, as
they were delivered by</hi> Moſes <hi>to the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>do not concerne Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
but as they are agreeable to the Law of nature, and confirmed
by Chriſt. Paraeus</hi> (as is obſerved by <hi>Rivet</hi> in his Explication,
of the Decalogue, page 11.) giving in his judgement of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
opinions of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Soto, affirms</hi> that the opinion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55700:55"/>
of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is moſt ſafe to be followed. <hi>Rivet</hi> himſelf, in the
place quoted, takes it to be a ſtrife of words, and the difference
to be inconſiderable; and in caſe the authority be granted, there
ſeemes indeed leſſe danger, though the Miniſter be waved. The
Antinomian (as others have obſerved) is by both parties op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
Some may think, that the Law, thus gaines in its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
in as much, as Chriſt is, of much more excellency then <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
when the Maſter of the Vineyard, ſaw his ſervant neglected;
he ſaid, <hi>They will reverence my Sonne,</hi> Mat. 21. 37. But if the
ſervant be once deſpiſed, and ſet ſo light by, as we read from ſome
hands, <hi>Away with ſtammering Moſes,</hi> it may be feared, that the
Sonne will not long remaine in honour, when ſervants fared ſo
ill, we finde that the Sonne had little better entertainment; And,
in my thoughts, there is ſcarce a readier way then this, to ſtrip
us of the whole of the Law of God. Keeping up to their own
principles, they can look on no more, of the Law, as binding
Chriſtians, then that which is held out to us, in New Teſtament-Scriptures.
If this be granted, we muſt have a New Teſtament
Text, for every Moral duty; yet to gratifie adverſaries in this
particular, we may ſafely yeeld, that the Law concernes not
Chriſtians, as it was delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> only to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
and ſo <hi>Zanchy's</hi> Poſition, keeping ſtrictly to the termes may
happily be defended. <hi>The Moral Laws as delivered by</hi> Moſes <hi>to the</hi>
Iſraelites <hi>do not appertain to Chriſtians;</hi> ſo, neither doth <hi>Lukes</hi>
Goſpel, or the hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> as from him to <hi>Theophilus,</hi>
nor yet, any of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, as from him, to any particular
Church, or to <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> or <hi>Philemon.</hi> But looking on
<hi>Moſes</hi> as employed of God, with his Church, with which he was
in the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38. and upon his writings as a <hi>depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
left with the Church, they are of equal concernment, to us,
as they were to the Jews, if we be as the Church of the Jewes
was, a Church of God. This to me is plaine, not only by thoſe
Texts of <hi>Moſes</hi> quoted in New Teſtament-Scriptures, as we heard
before, but quoted alſo as from <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Apoſtle pleading for
Miniſters maintenance, ſaith, <hi>For it is written in the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9. How were this argument of force, if <hi>Moſes</hi> his
writings were not of uſe? That of <hi>Peter</hi> is convincing, 1 Pet. 1.
15, 16. <hi>But as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in
all manner of converſation; becauſe it is written, be ye holy for I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55700:55"/>
am holy;</hi> This was written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Lev. 11. 44. Lev. 19. 2.
Lev. 20. 7. and why ſhould we be engaged to holineſſe, <hi>eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> writ it, and gave it in charge, in caſe <hi>Moſes</hi>
his writings do not binde Chriſtians? This alſo to me is plaine,
in reaſon, Chriſt was King then, as now, his Church is the ſame,
now, as then, we, and they make up one Kingdome, <hi>Matth.</hi>
8. 11. The Lawes of Chriſt therefore (unleſſe they appear to be
repealed) are now, in force as in former times. There is not a
temporal Obligation (ſaith Maſter <hi>Burges Vindiciae Legis,</hi> page
162.) laid upon a perpetual duty. The duties are confeſſed,
to be perpetual, why ſhould <hi>Moſes</hi> then deliver them to be only
of temporal permanency? Neither is there any thing brought by
<hi>Soto,</hi> or any other hand to evince the contrary. In the cloſe of
the words already quoted, he ſayes, <hi>Moſe-could not binde us, but
Chriſt, for we are not Jews, but Christians,</hi> To this we ſay, He
could not binde us, authoritatively, but miniſterially, and becauſe
<hi>Chriſt</hi> bindes, therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> bindes; ſeeing, <hi>Moſes</hi> was a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
in that houſe, where Chriſt was a Sonne, Chriſt was King
of his Church, in <hi>Moſes</hi> his dayes, <hi>Iſrael</hi> tempted Chriſt in diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
<hi>Moſes, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 9. He commanded for Chriſt, when he
gave command to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and theſe commands are of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
unto Chriſtians, who are their fellow ſubjects. The
Arguments produced by <hi>Soto</hi> are ſatisfyingly anſwered by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine.
Soto</hi> ſaith, that the Preface of the law leads to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
onely, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, and out of the houſe of bondage.</hi> But it was the Jews, and
not Chriſtians, that were in <hi>Egypt.</hi> This is falſe, as one of theſe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
truly anſwers the other, we were in <hi>Egypt</hi> as well as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jews; They were our fathers, and we their children,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1. It was once indeed otherwiſe with us, being branches
of the wilde Olive; But the natural branches, being cut off, we
are grafted into their ſtead, that mercy of deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi>
being a Church-mercy, is our mercy. He further objects that of
<hi>Luke 16. 16. The Law and the Prophets were until</hi> John, and is
anſwered, that, that is underſtood of the Law, prophecying by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
and not inſtructing in manners, which is further explained,
<hi>Matth. 11. 13. For all the Prophets and the Law prophecyed until
John,</hi> that is, all the propheſies of the Meſſiah to come, whether
delivered in words by the Prophets, or by ſignes and Law-cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55700:56"/>
did not reach beyond <hi>John,</hi> who was the laſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
who did bear witneſſe of Chriſt. Some ſay, that in caſe the
Law bind, as it was delivered by <hi>Moſes;</hi> then all that <hi>Moſes</hi> did
deliver, is obligatory to Chriſtians, <hi>Quâtale,</hi> is, <hi>omne,</hi> and ſo the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, bindes, as doth the Moral, and we ſhall bring our
necks under that yoke. To this anſwer, all that <hi>Moſes</hi> did deliver
doth binde, unleſſe we have a releaſe, or diſcharge from the ſame
authority, by which he ſpake, and hence an argument is drawn,
for proof of that which we have in hand, If the ceremonial Law
had bound Chriſtians to this day, had it not been revoked, and
aboliſhed, then the moral Law, which is no where revoked, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed
(as hath been ſhewn) doth ſtill bind Chriſtians. This is
plaine, there is no reaſon, that the ceremonial Law ſhould be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
above the Moral; But the ceremonial Law had bound
Chriſtians to this day, had it not been revoked and aboliſhed;
This is as plain, when the great queſtion was, in the primitive times,
whether the ceremonial Law did binde Chriſtians, whether they
were to circumciſe their children, after the manner of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and
conſequently to obſerve other Rites. This is decided, in making it
appear, that theſe were aboliſhed, as being ſhadows of good
things to come, and an end put to their obligation. It may be
further objected, that if all be of force, that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote, as from
him, then that of divorce of the wife, on any cauſe is of force like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
That was commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 7.
tell the Lord Chriſt from <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 1. To this <hi>Chemnitius</hi> hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered this, <hi>Tanquam legiſlator,</hi> as one,
that gave orders to that people, as, to their political eſtate; not,
<hi>Tanquam Theologus,</hi> as a Prophet, raiſed up to deliver the minde
and will of God unto them. <hi>Moſes</hi> his writings therefore are
in force, not onely <hi>ratione materiae,</hi> as <hi>containing ſuch precepts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Chriſt in the New Teſtament hath put a divine ſanction;</hi>
but by vertue of a ſanction from heaven put upon them, as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by him, and the obligation ſtill remaining. If <hi>Moſes</hi> once
be neglected, I ſhall fear, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> will not long be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
<hi>Moſes</hi> being a ſervant in the ſame houſe, with them, and
the reſt of the Apoſtles, and pen-men of New Teſtament-Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

                  <head type="sub">God entring a Covenant of Grace with his people, keeps
up his Sovereignty in exerciſe of diſcipline,
in the correction and chastiſement of his
people for ſinne.</head>
                  <p>AS God holds up his Sovereignty, under the covenant of
grace; in keeping on foot his commandments; ſo, alſo in
his exerciſe of diſcipline, upon thoſe, with whom he is in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
He neither ſuffers them to be without Law, nor to go on
in tranſgreſſion of his Law, with impunity and freedome. As
they have his precept, to keep from ſinne, ſo they are in danger,
of his hand, in caſe of ſinne; Thoſe that are againſt us in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
are our adverſaries in this likewiſe. As they plead a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numiſſion,
of Chriſtians from the mandatory power of the Law,
ſo, they will alſo have them exempted from all chaſtiſement or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
Againſt theſe we maintaine that the people of God in
covenant, even thoſe, whoſe hearts are ſtedfaſt, in covenant; do
ſuffer under the covenant of grace, in caſe of ſinne, and that for
ſinne; For proofe of this, I ſhall bring Scripture of three
ſorts.</p>
                  <p>1. Giving inſtances, of the Church and people of God; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſore and great afflictions for ſinne, and theſe places are even
without number, <hi>Eſay 42. 24. Lam. 1. 8. 3. 39. 5. 16. Micah</hi> 1. 5.
Yea, they lie under ſufferings, till they acknowledge ſin, till their
ſtomacks are brought down, and they humble themſelves for ſin,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 41. Againſt this, is objected, that among theſe afflicted
ones, there were reprobates, as well as elected ones; and Elect
ones in the ſtate of unconverſion, and they might ſuffer for ſinne,
which the childe of God does not, nor can not; To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
1. There were true converts among theſe, or elſe the
whole world had no converts in it. 2. Theſe, in their confeſſions,
and humiliations, involved themſelves among the reſt; and make
themſelves, of the number of thoſe, that by ſinne draw down
ſufferings; as we have <hi>Ezra, Daniel,</hi> and others for examples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:55700:57"/>
2. Inſtances of the moſt precious Saints ſinning and ſuffering
for ſinne; 1. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Numb. 20. 12. <hi>The Lord ſpake unto
Moſes and Aaron, becauſe, ye beleeved me not, to ſanctifie me in the
eyes of the children of Iſrael, therefore ye ſhall not bring this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
into the land which I have given them;</hi> Both their ſinne
and their ſufferings, are noted there, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems never to
have done with, <hi>Deut. 1. 37. Deut. 3 26. Deut. 4. 21. Deut. 34. 4.
2. David,</hi> his ſinne we finde, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. at large related, his
ſufferings, in the next chapter, he ſuffers in all his relations, 1. As,
a father, his childe dies. 2. As, an husband, his bed is defiled.
3. As, a Prince, the ſword is brought upon his land. 3. <hi>Solomon,</hi>
1 Kings 11. 11. <hi>For as much, as this is done of thee, and thou hast
not kept my Covenant and my ſtatutes, which I have commanded
thee, I will ſurely rend the Kingdom from thee, and I will give it to
thy ſervant. 4. Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 32. 25. 26. <hi>But</hi> Hezekiah
<hi>rendred not again according to the benefit done unto him, for his
heart was lifted up, therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon
Judah and Jeruſalem. Notwithſtanding, Hezekiah humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
for the pride of his heart, both, he, and the inhabitants of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
ſo that the wrath of the Lord, came not upon them, in the
dayes of Hezekiah.</hi> In which words we ſee, his ſinne, his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for ſinne, and his humiliation upon account of his ſinne. Here
alſo exception is taken; Theſe here mentioned ſay ſome, lived
under Old Teſtament diſpentations; To this I anſwer. 1. We
may take up <hi>Pauls</hi> words in behalf of theſe, 2. <hi>Cor. 10. 7. If any
man truſt to himſelf, that he is Christs, let him of himſelf, think
this again, that, as he is Chriſts, ſo they were Chriſts. Moſes,</hi> that
ſuffered (as we have heard) upon the account of ſinne, <hi>eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the reproach of Chriſt greater riches, then the treaſures of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
Heb. 11. 26. And <hi>David</hi> that ſuffered in like ſort, in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
called him Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 43. 2. That we may not loſe
Old Teſtament-Scriptures, for if we loſe them here, we ſhall
hold them no where, let us look upon <hi>Prov. 3. 11, 12. My ſonne,
deſpiſe not the chaſtening of the Lord; neither be weary of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
for, whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth, even as the father
the ſonne, in whom he delighteth.</hi> In which words we ſee, 1. The
ſufferings of the people of God thrice repeated. 2. The impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
cauſe, implyed in the word [chaſtiſement] which ever is
for ſome fault, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 39. 11. 3. The hand that inflicts
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55700:57"/>
[the Lord] 4. His way of dealing as a [Father] in love and
not in vengeance. Now turne to <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5, 6, 7. and there we
ſhall ſee the Apoſtle. 1. Quoting this Scripture. 2. Checking
them for not heeding it. 3. Commenting upon it; <hi>Ye have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
the exhortation, which ſpeaketh unto you, as unto children,
My ſonne deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when
thou art rebuked of him; For whom the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth,
and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth; If ye endure chaſtening,
God dealeth with you, as with ſonnes, for what ſonne is he whom
the Father chasteneth not?</hi> Theſe words of the Apoſtle, confirm
all the Old Teſtament proofs before mentioned, give a ſhrewd
check, to all thoſe that would caſt them off, and are a full New
Teſtament-proof of the point in hand, our averſaries tell us, that
the children of God, in New Teſtament-times, have that great
and happy priviledge, to be free from all chaſtiſements for ſinne,
The Apoſtle, on the other hand ſayes, that, it is their happineſſe
to be chaſtiſed, and would be their ſorrow, if they were without
chaſtiſement. <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>many are weak,
and ſickly among you, and many ſleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 30. There, we ſee,
judgements inflicted, the perſons ſuffering, and the cauſe of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
aſſigned. The judgements are ſet out. 1. By the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or kinde, ſuch as were viſible on the outward man; as, their
ſinne was open, ſo was their ſuffering. 2. By their ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
in which they ſuffered; ſome weak, languiſhing, under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities;
ſome ſick, taken with diſeaſes; ſome fallen aſleep, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
with death. The perſons ſuffering are ſet out. 1. By
their multitude [<hi>many</hi>]. 2. By the application of the ſtroke,
<hi>Corinthians</hi> had ſinned, and <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſuffered. The cauſe is
implyed in the illative particle [For] and expreſt in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words, their unworthy addreſſes unto the Lords Table, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
eating and drinking, they eat and drink their own judgement,
and though it cannot be ſaid, that all were in grace, that thus
ſuffered, yet there were ſome at leaſt in grace among them, in that
the Lord chaſtened them in the world, that they might not be
condemned with the world. The Lord Chriſt ſpeaks fully to this
in his letter from heaven to <hi>Laodicea</hi> the Church of, Rev. 3. 19.
<hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As Scripture, expreſly holds out this truth, ſo, it is alſo clear
in reaſon, if God ſhould not hold up his Sovereignty, in this way
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55700:58"/>
of exerciſe of diſcipline; upon his children, his love could not
be continued to them, but would be withdrawn from them, as
we ſee in Chriſts words but now mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 19. as, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in thoſe words of <hi>Solomon</hi> and the Apoſtle, <hi>Pro. 3. 11. Heb.</hi> 12.
5, 6, 7. The love of God is ſuch to his children, and ſuch a
league of friendſhip is paſt between them (ſay our adverſaries)
that it will not ſuffer him to ſtrike them. We ſay, his love is
ſuch, that he cannot forbear to ſtrike, and will not ſuffer that
they ſhould ſinne, and carry it with impunity. There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſome ſuch parents, that are ſo indulgent, that, children muſt
neither have, check, nor ſtroke from them, what courſe ſoever
they take, they ſcarce hear words, much leſſe do they ſuffer ſtripes.
Theſe, call this love, but a wiſer then they, calls it by the name
of hatred, <hi>Prov. 13. 24. He that ſpareth the rod, hateth his ſonne,
but he that loveth him, chaſteneth him betimes.</hi> Pity, will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, to make children ſmart; But it is greater pity, that the
want of ſmart, ſhould bring them to the condemnation of hell,
<hi>Prov. 23. 13, 14. With-hold not correction from the childe, for, if
thou beateſt him with the rod, he ſhall not die; Thou ſhalt beat
him with the rod, and ſhalt deliver his ſoul from hell.</hi> A childe
in ſinne, muſt either be beaten, or ſpared; Beating will not be
his death, but ſparing tends to his condemnation. The ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is not ours, but the Holy Ghoſts. One of the moſt terrible
texts in all the Bible may be found (as one ſayes) <hi>Hoſes 4. 14.
I will not puniſh your daughters, when they commit whoredome,
nor your ſpouſes when they commit adultery,</hi> He ſpares not ſome,
that he may for ever ſpare them, chaſtening them in the world,
that he may not condemn them with the world; He ſpares ſome,
and everlaſtingly deſtroys them.</p>
                  <p>2. Otherwiſe, God would be reconciled to the ſinne of his
people, and in league, not only with their perſons, but with their
wickedneſſe, which is moſt abhorrent to his holineſſe. We read
of Gods reconciliation to the world, but never to the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the world; God may be at peace with thoſe that have
ſinned, not imputing their treſpaſſes, but he will never be at peace
with ſin.</p>
                  <p>3. It will not ſtand with his honour to ſuffer his to go on in
impunity in theſe ways. Their wickedneſſe will be ſaid to be by his
allowance. Men in ſin, are ready to ſay (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve)
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55700:58"/>
that <hi>God is ſuch a one as themſelves;</hi> Pſalme 50. 21. and
that becauſe they ſinne, and he keeps ſilence. And men of the
world will ſay the ſame, if his people go on in ſinne, and proſper.
This, the Lord ſees and takes care, this way to prevent, <hi>Ezek.
39. 23. And the heathen ſhall know that the houſe of Iſrael went
into captivity for their iniquity, becauſe they treſpaſſed againſt me,
therefore hid I my face from them.</hi> He will make it appear, that he
is no patron to them in that which is evil.</p>
                  <p>4. God hath given in charge, to Magiſtrates, his vice-gerents
for to puniſh. They are <hi>revengers to execute wrath upon them
that do evil,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. they are <hi>ſent of God for the puniſhment of
evil doers,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 14. They have no commiſſion to ſpare, upon
ſuppoſal of any intereſt, in God or grace, when they are found
in any acts that are wicked. What they do, God does,
they acting by his command, and by vertue of his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>For further clearing of this point, and, if it may be, to
work a right underſtanding, I ſhall lay down ſeverall Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>1. God conſidered in his abſolute Sovereignty, may inflict ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
without injuſtice on his innocent creatures, there is no
abſolute neceſſity, that ſinne ſhould go before all manner of
trouble; Puniſhment cannot be without a fault; that, alwayes
implies guilt, where juſtice is followed. Yet, ſuch is Gods Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,
that he may lay affliction where there is no tranſgreſſion.
We do it upon our fellow-creatures, we tread upon wormes that
never did offend us; God may much more do it upon his creatures,
yea, God does it. How much do bruit creatures ſuffer in the
world, and unwillingly ſuffer? as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20.
and that from Gods hand, that hath made them ſubject to theſe
ſuffering; that, which God doth unto one creature, he may do
unto any creature; that which he doth to the meaneſt, he may
do to the moſt noble creature. As a potter may make veſſels,
ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour; ſo God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
more tranſcendent Sovereignty, may make ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
ever bleſſed; and others during pleaſure, to remaine in
miſery.</p>
                  <p>2. It ſtands not yet with Gods ordinate juſtice, to ſtrike his
people, where there is no fault. The termes of the covenant
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55700:59"/>
being pre-ſuppoſed; none can ſuffer that have not offended.
every one, upon engagement from God, muſt be happy, that is
innocent. This is plainly implyed in thoſe words, <hi>In the day that
thou eateſt, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> ſinne not, and ſuffer not, and
more explicitely held out in thoſe words, <hi>do this, and live,</hi> under
death is comprized all evil, from which man upon covenant is
free, that doth not ſinne: Under life is compriſed, all bliſſe,
which, upon covenant, all are to enjoy that yeeld full obedience;
So; that the inlet of ſuffering, is from ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
(as I may ſay) tyed himſelf, not out of Sovereignty, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
when man hath not offended.</p>
                  <p>3. When way is made by ſinne, to divine juſtice, to bring evil
upon man, yet the reaſon why, this, or that evil, is inflicted, on
this or that man; is not alwayes mans provocation by ſinne; All
afflictions are not puniſhments; nor yet corrections, or chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
There are often other ends and motives. Sometimes,
God looks ſolely at himſelfe, alone at his own glory, in his
ſtrokes; of this we have many inſtances, <hi>John 9. 1, 2. John</hi> 11. 4.
The ſame we may ſay of the viper upon <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.
4, 5. Sometimes he looks at his people in the ſufferings that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts.</p>
                  <p>1. The patients themſelves, laying afflictions upon them, not
as corrections reſpecting by-paſt faults, but tryals for diſcovery
of their graces. That which God laid upon <hi>Job,</hi> was not for his
ſinne, but to make it appeare, that Satan had formed a falſe
charge againſt him, that his whole ſervice of God, was upon by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends,
and baſe accounts, and that ſufferings (God appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him in contrary providences) would preſently draw him
into all wickedneſſes. It was a ſore affliction to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to
leave his countrey, and his fathers houſe, to offer up his ſonne
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> yet theſe were no corrections, or chaſtiſements, that we
know, but temptations.</p>
                  <p>2. He looks upon others, that are no ſufferers, to bring about
mercy to one, by the ſufferings of another; ſo it was in <hi>Joſephs</hi>
ſufferings, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20.</p>
                  <p>4. The corrections that God lays upon the godly, are far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from thoſe that he layes upon the wicked. His hand upon
his own children, differs much from his hand upon his enemies.
God deales otherwiſe with a Nation, that is a ſtranger to him,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55700:59"/>
then he deals with a people that are his own, <hi>Jerem. 30. 11.
Though I make a full end of all Nations whither I have ſcattered
thee; yet will I not make a full end of thee, but I will correct
thee in meaſure, and will not leave thee altogether unpuniſhed.</hi>
Though both ſuffer, yet they do not equally, and alike ſuffer. So, it
is with the Elect, and reprobate, both ſuffer from the hand of
God; but there is great difference in their ſufferings. 1. They
differ in the cauſe from whence their ſufferings reſpectively do
ariſe: The ſufferings of the wicked, are out of pure wrath,
wicked men, being under a ſtate of wrath. The ſufferings of
the people of God, are out of preſent diſpleaſure, but yet out of
love, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 11. Heb. 12. 6, 7. 2. They differ in the end of
their ſufferings. A piece of ſilver is trode upon, with the feet to
ſcoure and brighten it, but a worme or ſpider, to cruſh or ſpoile
it. 3. They differ in the reſpective improvement, that either
make of them, the godly are are bettered by their afflictions, their
ſufferings are their purges, and purifications, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 119. 67.
Their eares are thereby opened for diſcipline, <hi>Job</hi> 36. 10. the
wicked are more and more hardened by them, and grow more
and more wicked under them, <hi>Eſay 1. 5. 2 Chron.</hi> 28. 22.
The Sunne hardens the earth, but ſoftens the butter and the
wax.</p>
                  <p>The ſufferings of the people of God many times proceed
from as high diſpleaſure in God, as can ſtand with love, and the
more high the ſinne is, the greater and ſorer is his diſpleaſure:
They work in God as great a diſlike as can ſtand with his purpoſe,
not utterly to leave and caſt them off. When <hi>David</hi> had ſinned,
in that high manner as he did, the Text ſaith, <hi>The thing that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
did displeaſed the Lord,</hi> 2 Sam. 11. <hi>ult.</hi> Few men have had
more of Gods heart then he, yet we ſee, his heart riſes in ſore
diſpleaſure, againſt his wickedneſſe. We may ſee how he takes
him up for it, we can ſcarce ſee, in all the Scriptures, a man ſo
chidden. The Prophet reckons up the courteſies and high favours
that he had received from God, <hi>I anointed thee King over Iſrael,
and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul, and I gave thee thy
Maſters houſe, and thy Maſters wives into thy boſome, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve
thee the houſe of Iſrael, and of Judah, and if that had been too
little, I would more-over have given thee ſuch and ſuch things.</hi>
And as he had before aggravated his wickedneſſe, in a parable;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55700:60"/>
ſo in expreſſe termes, he further layes it open. <hi>Wherefore haſt
thou deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord; in doing evil in his
ſight, thou haſt killed Vriah the Hittite with the ſword, and haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his wife to be thy wife.</hi> Then he falls to threatnings, three
great evils (as we may there ſee) follow upon this evil; yet, all
this while that the Lord thus chides him, that he thus threatens
and beats him, he doth not ceaſe to love him, as appears in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi>
words, <hi>verſe 13. The Lord hath put away thy ſinne;</hi> ſome
will have love and anger to be inconſiſtent, hatred and wrath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable;
God is angry, as they ſay, with none, but thoſe that
he hates, and when anger appears, love is no more; But all know
that this is falſe among men, a father is many times angry with
his child, that he would be loath to hate; It is as falſe with God,
he was wrath with <hi>Moſes,</hi> but he never hated <hi>Moſes,</hi> he owns
his with much love, when he manifeſts much diſlike and diſtaſte
of their preſent actions.</p>
                  <p>6. Theſe ſufferings of the godly muſt by no means be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſatisfactions of divine juſtice, as coming from vindicative wrath,
nor any part of the curſe, that is due from vindicative juſtice for
ſin. Having a tendency not to harme, but to reforme; not to
deſtroy, but amend; they are only fatherly corrections, and
chaſtiſements, not properly (at leaſt as ſome rigidly underſtand
the word) puniſhments; ſatisfaction was the work of Chriſt,
and the whole of the curſe was divolved upon him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.
Papiſts do diſtinguiſh between the friendſhip that is loſt by ſinne;
and the juſtice that is deſerved. The friendſhip that is loſt, is
made up again, as they confeſſe, of free grace; but the juſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
muſt by the offender be ſatisfied, which how impoſſible
it is, for man to do, and how injurious to the ſufferings of Chriſt,
to attempt the doing of it, let us gueſſe by the definition that
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> gives of it, <hi>Lib. quart. de peniten. cap. 1. Actio, quâ
is, qui alierum laeſit, tantum facit, quantum ſatis eſt, ad injuriam
compenſandam, ſive, is qui laeſus eſt, juſtè exigit.</hi> All that we can
ſuffer, can never ſatisfie, the wrong that our ſinnes have done
to the divine Majeſty, God may juſtly exact more, then either on
earth, or in their imaginary purgatory; any man can diſcharge.
As the ſufferings of this life, are not worthy of the glory that
ſhall be revealed; ſo, neither do they match the evil that juſtly
might be inflicted. They are all juſt, but not from Gods reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55700:60"/>
juſtice. In themſelves they have the nature of curſes, but
they are no part of the curſe, which upon the breach of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works, and upon the tranſgreſſion of the Law, is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced.
As a skilful Phyſician, makes poiſon up into a medicine, ſo
doth God turne curſes into bleſſings; they ſerve not to kill, but to
cure his people.</p>
                  <p>7. Theſe ſufferings, are not yet barely as ſome uſe to ſpeak
from ſinne, but chaſtiſements for ſinne, not only to prevent ſin,
that it may not be committed; but becauſe men have allready
ſinned. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were chaſtened, not alone, leaſt they
ſhould prophane the Lords Supper; but becauſe they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned
it. God afflicted <hi>David,</hi> not onely leſt he ſhould commit
adultery, but becauſe he had committed adultery: He threatens
<hi>Eli,</hi> and puniſheth him, not only, leſt he ſhould be too indulgent
to his ſons; but becauſe he had been too indulgent to them. It
cannot be conceived, how afflictions ſhould prevent ſin to come,
if they do not correct ſin already paſt, why are men afraid to ſinne
upon account of ſufferings, but becauſe upon ſin they have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Smart for ſinne, makes a childe of God watchful againſt ſin.
The childe, that hath ſeen his fathers frowne is afraid leſt
he ſhould frowne againe; that hath beene ſcourged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
knows what a father thinks of a fault, and is afraid of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                  <p>It is here objected, that it ſtands not with juſtice, in this way,
to afflict beleevers, ſeeing Chriſt in their ſtead hath made ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and to puniſh one ſinne twice, is injurious. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.
Theſe know, that <hi>Socinians</hi> deny, that Chriſt hath made any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and if theſe two cannot ſtand together, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
and beleevers correction, they will ſoone aſſume that
beleevers do ſuffer, (for which the Scripture is very full) and
therefore Chriſt hath not ſatisfied, and ſo their dangerous errour
will be ſupported. 2. One truth muſt not be produced to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
of another, Chriſt ſatisfaction, takes us out of the hand
of condemnation, and delivers from revengeful wrath, but not out
of the hand of diſcipline; when God becomes a Saviour, he doth
not ceaſe to be a Sovereign; a father, that is a Judge, may laſh his
childe, that he never intends to ſentence. If any will ſee further
Objections raiſed and anſwered, let him conſult Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> of
juſtification. <hi>Part. 1. Lecture 5. pag.</hi> 33.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Agreement between the Covenant of works and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace.</head>
                  <p>HAving aſſerted a covenant of grace, and premiſed ſuch
things that may contribute ſome light, towards a right
underſtanding of it, I muſt proceed to enquire into the reſpective
agreement, and differences between theſe covenants. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is an eaſie work, there being no controverſie or diſpute raiſed
about it, and therefore I ſhall briefly paſſe it over. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
1. In the general nature of a covenant, both are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
ſtrictly ſo called, as hath already been demonſtrated. 2. They
have one and the ſame authour, that is God. He propoſed the
termes of the covenant, to <hi>Adam,</hi> for himſelf, and all of his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and he enters covenant with the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> in their
fallen condition. 3. The parties in covenant, are in both of
them, God and man, God propounding, man accepting, though
there be (as we have heard) that would have it otherwiſe. 4. In
either of both, there is a tendency to mans happineſſe, Life is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in promiſe in both, as we ſee <hi>Rom. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 5, 6, &amp;c. where both
covenants are diſtinctly conſidered, what difference or agreement
there may be in the life promiſed, will after be ſpoke unto. 5. In
both of them there is a reſtipulation from man as there is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
from God; as, God engageth himſelf for reward, ſo
man is engaged to duty; the former was never doubted, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath been largely proved. 6. In either of both, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is called for from thoſe that enter covenant. For the firſt
it is not queſtioned, in that it is a covenant of Works. Failing in
doing was death. Intereſt in perfect righteouſneſſe is required
in the latter, which is called, the righteouſneſſe of faith, and is
the righteouſneſſe of the Law, performed, not by our ſelves, but by
another, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to every one
that beleeveth,</hi> Rom. 10. 4. Sincerity, in inherent righteouſneſſe
is required likewiſe, both of theſe will be morefully demonſtrated.
7. Either of both are indiſpenſable, the conditions being not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55700:61"/>
performed, the penalty of the covenant in both is inflicted, <hi>Adams</hi>
poſterity had experience of the one, and all unbeleevers, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
ones, will bear the other; not believing, not repenting
brings death, as ſometimes not perfectly obeying. That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
of the covenant of grace, calling for one thing, and
accepting of another, afterwards will be conſidered. 8. Neither
of both covenants are perſonal, as entered with any ſingle perſon,
or perſons, and determined in him or them, but both of them,
include poſterity. In the covenant of works, it is not ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
delivered, but not to be doubted. That covenant was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
with <hi>Adam,</hi> for all his, the latter is more expreſſe, to the
covenanters and their ſeed, both in Old and New Teſtament-Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which by a party is queſtioned, but remaines largely to
be confirmed.</p>

of Grace.</head>
                  <p>HAving ſpoken to the agreement between theſe two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
I muſt now more largely enquire into the differences,
which will prove a work of greater difficulty, there being ſo much
oppoſition. The firſt and leading difference is, that being both
of them between God and man,<note place="margin">The Covenant of Works was entred into in mans ſtate of integrity.</note> they were entred into in a different
eſtate and condition of man. The firſt was entered <hi>in ſtatu inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuto,</hi>
in mans integrity, when man had not at all, by ſinne incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the diſpleaſure of God, or weakened his abilities for obedience;
Man then ſtood as he came out of Gods hand, bearing in himſelfe
a lively reſemblance of God.<note place="margin">The Covenant of Grace was entered into in mans fallen condition.</note> The ſecond was <hi>in ſtatu destituto,</hi>
in mans fallen eſtate, now in ſinne, under wrath, dead in ſinne, and
wholly diſabled from yeelding obedience, of this there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
and therefore I need not make more words about it.
And from hence all other differences which I ſhall obſerve; or
which (as I ſuppoſe) are obſervable, have their riſe, which are theſe
following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:55700:62"/>
The covenant of Works,<note place="margin">The Covenant of Works was to mans preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> or (as learned <hi>Camero</hi> calls it) the
covenant of Nature, was for preſervation of man in life, that is,
in preſent bliſſe and happineſſe, to hold him in the condition in
which it found him, which is implyed in the penalty threatned, as
was before noted; man muſt not die till ſinne enter, and expreſt in
that promiſe of God, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> His life muſt be continued
as long as his obedience laſted, his happineſſe muſt have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated,
(though not neceſſarily in the ſame degree, God might
have tranſlated him from a life on earth to a life in heaven) had he
kept to the terms of the covenant. The covenant of grace is for
mans reſtitution,<note place="margin">The Covenant of Grace was to mans reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</note> reconciliation and recovery; He was before in
bliſſe, and if he had ſo abode, he might with good reaſon have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up <hi>Peters</hi> words, <hi>It is good for us to be here.</hi> Now he is in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and muſt be reſtored, if ever he be bleſſed, and ſo a farther differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doth ariſe.</p>
                  <p>The covenant of works had its precedency,<note place="margin">The Covenant of Works was firſt in time. The Covenant of Grace in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time followed after.</note> was firſt in time;
The covenant of grace in order of time follows after; This
muſt needs follow, Mans eſtate in integrity being before his fall,
the covenant made in his integrity, muſt needs precede the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
entred into in his fallen condition, unleſſe we will place the
third of <hi>Geneſis</hi> before the firſt, the fall of man before his creation;
And therefore that is utterly a miſtake in one, who in the very
entrance upon his Treatiſe of the two covenants, gives the
covenant of grace the precedency in time, giving this as his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why he places the covenant of Grace before the covenant of
Works, <hi>becauſe the covenant of Grace was in being before the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works,</hi> quoting for proof, <hi>Gal. 3. 17. The covenant
which was made before of God in Chriſt, the Law which was four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirty years after cannot diſanul.</hi> But this can by no means
ſerve his purpoſe, unleſſe we ſhould conclude that the covenant of
Works had its beginning in Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> at the giving of the Law
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the covenant of Grace, of only four hundred and
thirty yeares more ancient ſtanding. And that, will as little ſerve
his purpoſe which he after brings in, that there was an <hi>agreement
and covenant between God the Father, and his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt
about the ſalvation of man before</hi> Adam <hi>ſinned, yea, before the
world began;</hi> Seeing that covenant between the firſt and ſecond
perſon of the Trinity, was not the covenant, which he hath in
hand to treat upon, namely the <hi>covenant which God entred with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55700:62"/>
man,</hi> as he himſelf confeſſes; No covenant can be made with man
before man be in being, <hi>A no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ens</hi> can be no party in a covenant.
And whereas we are told that <hi>the ſame covenant which was made
with Jeſus Chriſt before time, was afterwards made with man.</hi>
I deſire that all would obſerve what is laid down in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
concerning that covenant. <hi>Chriſt for his part was by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to become a Mediatour, Surety, and Saviour; for all thoſe
that his Father ſhould give him.</hi> And muſt we become ſuch
Mediatours Sureties and Saviours alſo? God the Father did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to Chriſt, as is further ſaid, <hi>all the things that did belong to
his Mediatourſhip, and things to gratifie and ſatisfie him for his
Mediatourſhip.</hi> May we by covenant expect ſuch things from
the Father likewiſe? If we are neither tied to the ſame work,
to which Chriſt by covenant was tied, nor are to receive the like
gifts, as he by covenant was to expect, we are not in the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
that paſt between the Father and Chriſt. And though
theſe two were one, which muſt not be yeelded, (the covenants
<hi>ad intra,</hi> which the perſons of the Trinity make with themſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es,
and thoſe <hi>ad extra</hi> with the creature may not be confounded)
yet that would evince no ſuch precedence in time, ſeeing there
was alike agreement in the whole Trinity for the creation of
man, and Gods covenant with him in his integrity, as is fully
aſſented to in the ſame Treatiſe, to the utter overthrow of all
that which upon the former ſuppoſition he had built. To
that queſtion, <hi>To what end ſhould the covenant of Grace be
made before man ſtood in need of Grace?</hi> he anſwers, <hi>Known
unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world;</hi>
And he had all things then as preſent and real before the
eyes of his glory, as now he hath, <hi>viz.</hi> Mans Creation,
Fall, Recovery, and in this ſenſe there was no precedency of time
in regard of any of Gods Counſels or ſecret actions. And then
there can be no precedency of one of his covenants before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
we muſt finde then a ſenſe according to which there is
a precedency, which is not found in any covenants of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
among themſelves (which in exact propriety of ſpeech
are purpoſes rather then covenants, and were before all time)
but in the actual entrance and aſſent by the creature given,
which is in time, and admits precedency; In which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the covenant of works hath its precedency before that of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55700:63"/>
Grace, as the ſtate of integrity was before the fall.</p>
                  <p>Whence farther yet follows that the covenant of works,<note place="margin">The Covenant of Works was a ſmall time in force.</note>

But this ſecond, is, of everlaſting continuance, when the firſt
Covenant was violated by our firſt parents, and ſo made uſeleſſe,
that of grace ſucceeded, which is our only planck after ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,

ſalvation by the covenant of Works (which he entred in the firſt

that is not ſaved by the ſecond, muſt everlaſtingly periſh, and ſo
I underſtand that text, <hi>Heb. 10. 26. If we ſinne wilfully after we
have received the knowledge of the truth, then there remaineth no
more ſacrifice for ſinnes, but a fearful looking for of judgement
and fiery indignation;</hi> where, by ſinning wilfully, I underſtand an
utter rejection of Gods tender of this ſacrifice of Chriſts blood,
which I gather from the Apoſtle in the words that follow, the
proof that he brings of that ſad aſſertion, <hi>He that deſpiſed</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<hi>Law, died without mercy under two or three witneſſes, of how
much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he be thought worthy that hath
trodden under foot the blood of the Sonne of God, and counted
the blood of the covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy
thing?</hi> This is that wilful ſinne of which there is no expiation.
When man had caſt off the yoke, a ſacrifice was found, Chriſt
made his ſoul an offering for ſinne; but when Chriſt is rejected,
there is no other ſacrifice to be looked for. In the covenant of
grace God hath made known his whole minde concerning mans
ſalvation, by what means, and upon what termes man ſhall be
ſaved.</p>

Man was not preſerved, and therefore it appears, that he had no
ſuch Mediatour appointed for his preſervation. And it ſeems (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                  <p>Fourthly, to crown thoſe with glory; whom by grace be brings
up to the terms of the covenant.</p>
                  <p>1. He is to bring man into a capacity of covenanting,<note place="margin">Chriſt brings man into a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with God.</note> of which
ſinne had made mankinde uncapable, for though it ſhould be
granted, that God in abſolute juſtice, is not bound to puniſh ſinne
whereſoever he findes it; and that it is not againſt his Eſſence (as
ſome would have it) to pardon ſin without ſatisfaction, yet his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
juſtice is thus bound, That law of his, being preſuppoſed,
<hi>The day that thou eatest, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> he cannot recede
from it; the penalty of this Law muſt be born; in order to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
and juſtice ſatisfied for mans tranſgreſſion, which muſt
be done by ſuch a one, that can anſwer the claime of divine juſtice.
The beaſts of the Forreſts, and cattel of a thouſand hills (which
were yet often given to God in ſacrifice) could not do it. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
tells us, that <hi>it is impoſſible that the blood of Bulls and Goats
ſhould take away ſinne,</hi> Heb. 10. 4. They were never guilty, and
they are no valuable conſideration, nor yet the Angels who are
above mankinde, as the bruit creatures are below. Man had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and a ſacrifice from among man-kinde, is to be found, Neither
can man in ſin, and under the taint of it be accepted, all that he can
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55700:65"/>
ſuffer is due for himſelf, and therefore can be no other mans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.
In the payment of my own debt, I ſet free no other debtor;
Neither can any, that is meer man go thorow with it, here is pure
juſtice without relaxation, as to the value, confeſt by thoſe who yet
contend whether <hi>idem</hi> or <hi>tantundem</hi> be paid by Chriſt, the ſame
in kinde, as was owing by man, or the like in value and eſtimate;
He that is brought under a divine attachment, muſt not come out
till he have paid the uttermoſt farthing, which man in torments is
ever in diſcharging, and never can diſcharge; It is as eaſie to make
a world, as by way of ranſome to deliver a ſoul. Chriſt <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that knew no ſin, is made ſinne, that is, an offering for ſinne. God
manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> he that was God and man, hath undertaken
the work, man to ſuffer, and God to ſatisfie in ſuffering, and ſo
<hi>God is in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf, 2 Corinth.</hi> 5. 19.
The immediate effect or reſult of this price of mans redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(I ſuppoſe) is the putting of man into a capacity of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, yet when this is done, till more be done, by Chriſt
in the way of his Mediatourſhip for man, men are not yet in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
not the Elect among men. This is evident in thoſe Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,
<hi>that were raiſed up together, and made ſit together in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 6. There was no time in which
Chriſt had not paid the price of their ranſome, yet there was a
time, and then but lately over, that they were <hi>without Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from
the covenant of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the
world,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 12. Elect Infidels are not till their call, in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
they ſtand not actually reconciled, and one with God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Faith, for then there needed no Miniſtery of reconciliation
to follow. If this were granted, then Chriſt did the whole for
mans ſalvation on the croſſe by himſelf, and doth nothing now
in heaven, by way of interceſſion, nor any thing by his agents
in a miniſterial way upon earth, neither could man before faith, be
underwrath, in which he is yet concluded by our Saviour himſelf,
<hi>John</hi> 3. 36. A ſtate of wrath, and an actual reconciled eſtate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand together. There is a price paid, and (as I may ſay) in the
Fathers hand, but to be applyed according to the good pleaſure
of the Father and the Sonne; A man may purchaſe a priſoners
liberty; ſo that he hath it in his juſt and legal power to ſet him
free; and yet take what time he pleaſeth in diſcretion to impart it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55700:65"/>
to him, and actually deliver him. In this work there are three
parties; God the Father, as Creditor, Chriſt Jeſus, the Surety Man,
the Debtor. The Father might have refuſed this diſcharge from
the hand of Chriſt, and exacted it of the principal; Chriſt
might have refuſed to have made ſuch payment, he was not in
the Obligation; There was a relaxation of the perſon, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on all parties; Man muſt come in and manifeſt his accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
Till he is content to leave his old maſter, ſin and Satan;
This new Lord gives him no entertainment, he muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to come out of bondage, or elſe he can enjoy no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>2. The next work of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Chriſt brings man within the verge of the Covenant. 1. By his tender of it.</note> is to bring man within the bond
of the covenant profeſſedly to accept it, for which there is yet a
double work. Firſt, to make tender of it, this hath been Chriſts
work as the Prophet of his Church in all ages. In what latitude
in was carried in the dayes of the fathers before the flood, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
obſcurely pointed at; then plainly ſhewed; yet there was
then a diſtinction, between the poſterity of <hi>Seth,</hi> and that of
<hi>Cain,</hi> and ſo contiued till the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> when <hi>the ſonnes of
God ſaw the daughters of men;</hi> children of the covenant, ſaw
thoſe out of the covenant; Men within the viſible Church, ſaw
women without the Pale, and joyned themſelves in marriage with
them. From <hi>Abrahams</hi> dayes it was confined to his poſterity,
and held within his line, and thoſe few that as proſelytes joyned
themſelves unto them. In Goſpel times it is enlarged, the tender
is made not to Jewes only, but alſo to every Nation under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the Commiſſion being to preach the Goſpel to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
none by Nation ſo contemptible, that is to be excluded. <hi>In

<hi>Acts</hi>) is no other then embracing the Doctrine of Faith, they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55700:66"/>
were made Diſciples; many of which after fell off, even from their
profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>A third work is to enable thoſe whom he brings to glory (thoſe
among them in covenant that are called according to his purpoſe)
to performe the duties of the covenant,<note place="margin">Chriſt brings up to the terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> to be ſtedfaſt and upright
in it, and this is by <hi>Circumciſing their heart giving them a new heart,
writing his Law in their hearts, putting it into their inward parts,
keeping them by his mighty power through faith unto ſalvation;</hi> of
which more hereafter.<note place="margin">Chriſt crowns thoſe that come up to the terms of the covenant</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The laſt work is to crown with glory thoſe that by grace he
raiſes up, to the termes of the covenant, thus qualifying them,
he crowns them,</hi> I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my
courſe, henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſſe,
which the Lord, the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day,

                  <p>Here ſome difficulties offer themſelves, If the covenant of
works (paſt between God and man in his integrity) were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,<note place="margin">Difficulties removed.</note>
and the tranſactions of it without reference to Chriſt, then
if follows that faith in Chriſt is not commanded in that Law,<label type="milestone">

                     </label>
which was given to man for a rule, There being no poſſibility of
it, there could be no command for it, and there was no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>Adams</hi> beleeving it,<note place="margin">Faith is a duty of the moral Law.</note> ſeeing Chriſt was not revealed, and
was not as Mediatour of any uſe. This opinion is ſtrongly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by Arminians. <hi>Armin. in resp. ad artic. decimum nonum.
Corvinus Contr. Molin. cap.</hi> 11. And to this end, that they may
make it good, that God cannot in juſtice require faith in Chriſt,
from man in his fallen condition, unleſſe he withal confer upon
him abilities to believe, ſeeing he never had that power from him
in his integrity, and ſtate of purity, and upon this ſuppoſition
the argument ſeems of force. We vindicate Gods juſtice in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
works; though to us now impoſſible, ſeeing once we
had power to reach the higheſt of his precepts, and his command,
is no rule of our empaired ſtrength, but of our duty. But if men
never had that power, and the Law never required it, it is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
(according to all parties) to exact it.<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> Let thoſe that fall
to the Arminians in this tenent, (that they may make the Law
an imperfect rule, and an inſufficient direction) ſee how they can
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55700:66"/>
avoid it, how they can vindicate Gods juſtice thus impeached.
But the Orthodox party have ſtill maintained that <hi>Adam</hi> had, in
his integrity that faith that doth juſtifie, though then it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
not that office of juſtification, as he had that faculty
whereby we ſee dead bodies; though then there was no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of ſuch ſight, there being no dead bodies to be ſeen. And
that faith in Chriſt is commanded in the firſt precept of the Law
is manifeſt. There we are commanded to have God for our
God, no Interpreter will deny, that the affirmative is contained
in that negative: <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other gods but me.</hi> Now
God is the God of beleevers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. No man can have any
communion with God, but by faith in Chriſt. And ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
this faith is there required; what Expoſitor of the Law
doth not put truſt and affiance in God, within the affirmative part
of the firſt commandment, as well as fear, love, and obedience?
And without Chriſt there can be no affiance or truſt. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the moral Law, to reach no farther then the duties expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there named, or the evils forbidden, we ſhall make it very
ſcant and narrow, we ſhall ſee ſmall reaſon, of that of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
<hi>Thy Commandment is exceeding broad,</hi> Pſalme 119. 96.
But in caſe we take in all that by neceſſary conſequence may be
inferred, according to the approved rules of interpretation, then
ſcarce any duty is more clearly laid down then this of faith in
Chriſt. And whereas one faith, <hi>A man cannot preach Faith in
Chriſt out of the Moral Law,</hi> I ſay, a man out of the Moral
Law, may evince the neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt; unto every
one that lives in Goſpel-light, to whom Chriſt is tendred; The
Law requires the duty, and the Goſpel diſcovers the object, no man
out of the Law could have evinced <hi>Abraham</hi> that he muſt offer
his ſonne, nor that he muſt have left his countrey, but when
Gods minde was made known to him, the Moral Law did binde
him to obedience, and he had ſinned againſt the Moral Law, in
caſe he had refuſed. There is no command given of God to any
man, at any time, of an nature whatſoever, but the Moral Law
ties him to the obſervation of it, not immediately, explicitely,
but upon ſuppoſition of ſuch a command intervening. <hi>Therefore

fruit of his Prophetick office, yet, theſe Ordinances are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate
with reconciliation, nor of equal latitude with ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
So neither is the covenant, but either of both in order
towards it. As Ordinances therefore are Chriſts gift from heaven,
as the fruit of his death and reſurrection, when yet all that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of theſe Ordinances do not yet die or riſe with Chriſt; So, is
the covenant, when yet all in covenant are not ſtedfaſt in it, nor
obtaine the graces of it. Therefore I know not how to admit that
which a Divine ſingularly eminent hath laid down; <hi>That all the
effects of Chriſts death are ſpiritual, diſtinguiſhing and ſaving;</hi>
Seeing gifts of Chriſt; from his Fathers right hand are fruits of
his death, yet not ſpiritual, diſtinguiſhing and ſaving. That they
are in ſome ſort ſpiritual, I dare grant that is, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
(if I may ſo ſpeak) they have a tendency to a ſpiritual work.
That they are diſtinguiſhing from the world, (as it is taken in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the Church viſible) I yeeld, for I do not enlarge the
fruit of Chriſts death to all man-kinde, aſſenting to Maſter <hi>Owen</hi>
and Maſter <hi>Stalham</hi> in the grounds that they lay, of Gods reſpite
of the execution of the whole penalty on man, with the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55700:67"/>
of outward favours not to be upon the account of Chriſt, but
for other reaſons; yet I know not how to affirme, that Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which yet are fruits of his death, are all ſaving, ſpiritual and
diſtinguiſhing, ſeeing they neither conferre ſalvation nor ſaving
grace on all that partake of them, So that Chriſt, is a Mediatour
of this covenant; and yet thoſe enter into it that have not
reconciliation by Chriſt Jeſus; The Epheſians that <hi>were afar off,
are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 13. that is,
brought into a viſible Church-ſtate in the fruition of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
made free of that city whoſe name is, <hi>The Lord is here,</hi>

                  <p>A Farther difference of importance, between theſe covenants,
is, in the conditions annext unto either of them, and here
the difference is brought to the height. This alone ſo diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
them; that they are not barely, in circumſtance and way of
adminiſtration; but in ſubſtance two diſtinct covenants; The
leaſt difference in conditions, diverſifies bargains and agreements
on what part ſoever the difference is.<note place="margin">Conditions in the Covenant of works and the covenant of grace of Gods part ſeem to be the ſame.</note> Conditions of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
between God and man are of two ſorts, either ſuch in which
God engages himſelfe, or in which man is engaged; either the
ſtipulation on Gods part, or elſe the reſtipulation on the part of
man. The former unto which God is engaged, are, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in caſe of covenant-keeping, or, puniſhments in caſe of
covenant-breaking; The one the Lord promiſes, The other he
threatens. I finde no material difference in the conditions on
Gods part in theſe covenants. Life is promiſed in both, in caſe of
covenant-keeping; and death is threatned in both, in caſe of
covenant-breaking. Some indeed have endeavoured to finde
a great difference in the life promiſed in the covenant of
works, and the life that is promiſed in the covenant of grace;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55700:68"/>
as alſo in the death that is threatned in the one, and the other,
and thereupon move many, and indeed inextricable difficulties,
<hi>What life man ſhould have enjoyed, in caſe</hi> Adam <hi>had not fallen?
And what death man ſhould have died, in caſe Chriſt had not
been promiſed?</hi> From which two, endleſſely more, by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectary
may be drawn; by thoſe that want neither wit, nor lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to debate them. In which the beſt way of ſatisfaction and
avoidance of ſuch puzling mazes; is to enquire what Scripture
means by <hi>Life,</hi> which is the good in the covenant promiſed; and
what by <hi>Death,</hi> which is the evil threatned? Now for the firſt,
<hi>Life</hi> containes all whatſoever, that conduces to true happineſſe, to
make man bleſſed in ſoul and body. All good that Chriſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes,
and heaven enjoys, is compriſed under it, in Goſpel-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.
<hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they
may have it more abundantly,</hi> John 10. 10. <hi>He that hath the Son,
hath life, and he that hath not the Sonne, hath not life,</hi> 1 John 5.
12. On the contrary, under <hi>Death</hi> is compriſed, all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to man or mankinde, that tends to his miſery in ſoul and
body. The damnation of Hell being called death, the uttermoſt
of evils being the ſeparation of ſoul and body from God, <hi>John
8. 51. 1 John</hi> 3. 14. Sinne which leads to it, and is the cauſe of
it, is called death in like manner; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. And the ſeparation
of ſoul from the body, being called death, ſickneſſes, plagues, are
ſo called in like manner,<note place="margin">Life promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is one and the ſame.</note>

                        </gap>d.</hi> 10. 17. Now happineſſe being
promiſed to man in covenant, only indefinitely under that noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of life, without limit to this or that way of happineſſe, in
this or that place, God is ſtill at liberty, ſo that he make man
happy, where, or how he pleaſeth to continue happineſſe to him,
and is not tied up in his engagement either for earth or heaven.
And therefore though learned <hi>Camero</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>de triplici foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi>
Theſ. 9. with others, makes this difference between the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works and the covenant of grace. <hi>In the covenant of Works,</hi>
(which he calls nature) <hi>life was promiſed, and a moſt bleſſed life, but
an animal life in Paradiſe, in the covenant of Grace a life in
Heaven and ſpiritual.</hi> And Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Aphoriſ.</hi> of
Juſtification, <hi>page</hi> 5. ſaith, <hi>that this life premiſed was only the
continuance of that ſtate that</hi> Adam <hi>was then in, Paradiſe, is the
opinion of moſt Divines.</hi> Yet with ſubmiſſion to better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I ſee not grounds for it; ſeeing Scripture no way deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55700:68"/>
the way and kinde of this happineſſe promiſed, and in
caſe that we take liberty to ſay, that when long life is promiſed
upon earth (in many texts of Scripture) that the promiſe is made
good though it faile on earth, in caſe it be ſupplied in heaven,
life being the marrow of the promiſe, much more then is it
made good, when it is indefinitely promiſed, without limit to a
man whil'ſt on earth, in caſe it be made good by his tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into heaven. And indeed there are ſtrong probabilities, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
being ſet out by the name of Paradiſe in Chriſts ſpeech to the
thief on the croſſe; and in <hi>Pauls</hi> viſion in that rapture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. if we may make ſuch a ſuppoſition of mans ſtanding, now
he is fallen, that he ſhould not have continued a life of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
on earth, but have been tranſlated into heaven. He had
that bleſſing from God as other living creatures, <hi>to be fruitfull
and multiply,</hi> Gen. 1. 28. and how the world could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
all thoſe individuals at once; which to eternity man
ſhould propagate, cannot be imagined. And to conceive, that
an end in time ſhould be put to propagation; when an animal
life in the uſe of the creature ſhould be continued, is ſcarce conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with reaſon. But a thouſand of theſe God can expedite
when we are at a ſtand; He promiſed life, and he could have
made it good,<note place="margin">Death threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venent of Works and in the Covenant of Grace is one and the ſame.</note> and we ſee he limited not himſelf, where, or how
to conferre it. And what I have ſaid of life promiſed, the ſame
I ſay of death threatned, in caſe man upon ſinne be brought into
a ſtate of miſery, Juſtice is done, and the threat takes hold, where,
and howſoever this miſery be ſuffered, whether it had been in
ſorrows, and horrours on earth, in ſeparation of the ſoul firſt, for
torments and the body to follow, or in a ſpeedy diſpatch of ſoul
and body to hell. Gods way of execution after the ſinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
(on thoſe that are not by Chriſt ranſomed) does not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
that the penalty in the covenant neceſſitated him to it,
might not he at once have poured out the whole of his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on veſſels of wrath, when yet we know, that he takes time
for the execution of it? A Learned Writer enquiring into this
death that was here threatned, ſaith, that <hi>the ſame damnation
that followed the breach of the ſecond covenant, it could not be;</hi> When
I ſuppoſe it rather ſhould be ſaid, that in ſubſtance and kind, it can
be no other; Infidels that were never under any other covenant
then that of works; and covenant-breaking Chriſtians are in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55700:69"/>
ſame condemnation, there is not two hells but one and the ſame,
<hi>for thoſe that know not God, and thoſe that obey not the Goſpel
of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 8. Neither is there any <hi>Limbus,</hi> or diſtinct
place for infants in original ſinne, and out of the covenant of
grace. Neither can I aſſent to that ſpeech, <hi>To ſay that</hi> Adam
<hi>ſhould have gone quick to hell, if Chriſt had not been promiſed,
or ſinne pardoned, is to contradict the Scriptures, that makes death
temporal the wages of ſinne.</hi> It were I confeſſe to preſume above
Scripture, but I cannot ſee it a contradiction of Scripture; A
burning Feaver, a Conſumption, Leproſie, Peſtilence, &amp;c. are in
Scripture made the wages of ſinne, yet many go to hell and miſſe
thoſe diſeaſes. And if it be ſaid Scripture ſo makes death the wages
of ſin, that all muſt ſuffer it, I anſwer, Thoſe Scriptures are all of
them <hi>leges poſt latae,</hi> appointed of God, as his way upon mans
fall, neither abſolute juſtice, nor yet the penalty threatned ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating
him to that way of proceeding. He takes the ſame
way where his juſtice hath already ſatisfaction, Thoſe that are
priviledged from death as the wages of ſinne, thus die; God tied
not up his own hands, as States do their Judges, and miniſterial
officers, to one way of execution; and this his way with the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
is voluntary, and not neceſſitated, Upon theſe grounds
it is, that I finde no reaſon to widen the differences between theſe
promiſes and priviledges in either covenants.</p>
                  <p>The identity of conditions, in the covenant of Works and
Grace, on Gods part we have ſeen; The great diverſity
in the conditions called for from man comes to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in the firſt place this difference offers it ſelf.</hi> The conditions
of the covenant of Works were in mans power,<note place="margin">The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of works were in mans power.</note> being left to the freedom
of his will; he had abilities in himſelf without ſeeking out for further
aſſiſtance then a meer general concurrence to perform them. <hi>This abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in man to anſwer whatſoever was called for at his hands from
God, appears</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the integrity of his nature; Being made like God, his
principles muſt needs carry him to a conformity with God, and
theſe principles were connatural to man, in his firſt being and
beginning. Man being made of God to contemplate his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and to enjoy communion with himſelf, he made him not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in any of thoſe noble qualifications that ſerve for it, or
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55700:69"/>
have a tendency to it. Papiſts indeed will have this to be a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
gift of grace,<note place="margin">Qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> veluti au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reo quodam frae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no pars inferior parti ſuperiori, &amp; pars ſuperior Deo facile ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecta continere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Bellar.</hi> De. Grat. primi ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> and above the glory of mans firſt creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> compares it to a <hi>bridle given to curb that luſt
which riſeth againſt reaſon in us.</hi> That rebellion of luſts in man,
they conceit, would have been, if man had not fallen; which, as
it layes a high charge upon God; in ſuch an aſperſion of his pure
work drawn after ſuch a patterne; ſo, it makes way for other
opinions, that the firſt motions without conſent are no ſins, and
that luſt in the regenerate, is not ſin. But as the bottom is rotten,
ſo, alſo the building that is raiſed upon it is ruinous. There was
an happy agreement in man, as well with himſelf, as with his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour:
The fall brought in a neceſſity of ſupport and ſupply of
Grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this appears from the equity which muſt be granted to
be in the command of God; which requires that the work given in
charge be not above his abilities, that is charged with it. The
<hi>Arminian</hi> argument from a command, to abilities to keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
from a threat to conclude a power to keep off from the
thing threatned, is of force, as long as the perſon under command
keeps himſelf in the ſame ſtation, and ſtrength, as when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
was given. But applying this to man in his fallen eſtate
(who had ſinned away his abilities,) the ſtrength of it is wholly
loſt. The command of God retains its perfection; when we are
under the power of corruption. The Law is nothing abated, though
we be weakened.</p>
                  <p>3. It appears in the work it ſelf which was charged upon man
upon performance of which he was to expect happineſſe. There
is no more explicitely mentioned, then that negative precert: <hi>Of
the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou ſhalt not eat; the day that
thou eateſt, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> This, all may yeeld might eaſily
have been kept if the command had been heeded, or the menace
obſerved. The Jews at their worſt could obſerve the commands of
<hi>non-licet</hi> meats, and this was a command of like nature, yet this
was not all unto which man was tied, Being made in the image of
God; he had clear light to diſcern good from evil, and as all
yet retaine, darkly and obſeurely; ſo he had the Law written in
his heart, clearly; Adultery, Murder (though no otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
then by that light which he had by creation) in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
had been ſin. The former poſitive Law was evil becauſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55700:70"/>
forbidden, take away the prohibition, and there had been no ſin
in eating. Theſe are forbidden, becauſe evil: The Law imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by creation, being preſuppoſed, there needed no further Law
to make them ſinful. They that never had the written Law, are
condemned for theſe practices, by that Law which by nature is
written in their hearts. But againſt theſe, there was in nature an
Antipathy; Mans pure nature had them in abhorrency. As
now there needs no Law more then nature doth ſuggeſt, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the eating of poyſon, feeding on duſt, or carrion: So
then there needed no more Law to condemne theſe practices; ſo
that obedience in that ſtate was in mans power muſt neceſſarily be
yeelded.</p>
                  <p>The conditions of the covenant of Grace are not performed,<note place="margin">The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace are not performed without ſpecial aſſiſtance.</note>
but by ſpecial grace; a power from God muſt concurre for their
work in man; Man hath no abilities in himſelf to anſwer what
God requires, and if he riſe not up to the terms of this covenant,
till he raiſe himſelfe, he will for ever fall ſhort of it. As the
covenant was vouchſafed of grace, ſo grace muſt make us meet
to partake of the benefits of it.</p>
                  <p>This appears.<note place="margin">Reaſons.</note> 1. In the ſtate and condition in which God
findes man, when he firſt enters covenant with him; yea, after
covenant entred, till a change be wrought, and abilities confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to anſwer that which God in covenant requires. This ſtate
of man the Apoſtle expreſſes, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 1. Dead in treſpaſſes and
ſins,</hi> alive, and in power for nothing at all, but ſinne. This was
the condition of Heathens, never in covenant; and ſo of the
Jews who were a people in actual covenant, and owned of God
as his inheritance, as God willing ſhall be ſhewn. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
was the ſame as the Apoſtle there confeſſeth; <hi>Among
whom we alſo had our converſation in times paſt, in the luſts of the
fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and of the minde, and were by
nature the children of wrath as well as others.</hi> This in abundant
other expreſſions in Scripture is diſcovered, holding forth the
ſame thing, <hi>Rom. 5. 6. For when we were yet without strength, in
due time Chriſt died for the ungodly.</hi> That infant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4, 5.
had no more poſſibilities of life, then is to be found even in the
ſtate of death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. It appears in that power which is exerciſed by God, in
the change of thoſe in covenant with him, whom he fits for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55700:70"/>
for Eternity. This power in Scripture is ſet out, in ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.
Firſt, <hi>Creation,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 10. <hi>We are his workmanſhip, created
in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works.</hi> All ability to good is from the
frame into which grace puts us; As there is a power out of man,
which gives him Being, So alſo there is an anſwerable power,
for his new Being; <hi>He that is begotten of God, keepeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and the evil one toucheth him not,</hi> 1 John 5. 18.
Secondly, <hi>Quickning.</hi> The dead have not power to raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
without a further power for their Reſurrection; Neither
is it in the power of man, <hi>Who is dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes,</hi> Eph.
2. 1. Thirdly, <hi>Taking away the heart of ſtone, and giving an heart of
fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. To change the nature of things, which is here
done, is the work of an Omnipotence, which was Satans argument
not denied by Chriſt, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, command theſe stones
to be made bread,</hi> Mat. 4. 3. Fourthly, <hi>Cauſing to walk in Gods ſtatutes,</hi>
Ezek. 36. 27. A work as of authority, ſo of power. Fifthly, <hi>Plucking
out of the power of Satan,</hi> an act of the free grace and power of God,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. Sixthly, <hi>Drawing,</hi> A work of power in him that draws,
weakneſſe in him that is drawn. <hi>Joh. 6. 44. No man can come unto me,
except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> And therefore the
Spouſe prayeth, <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1. 4.
There muſt be more power in God for converſion, than in Satan
for the ſouls ruine. Grace muſt have advantage of temptation,
but Satan can allure, perſwade; Our firſt parents had woful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of his faculty this way, He hath his moral perſwaſions, If
God make uſe of nothing more, they are even; yea, Satan hath
the advantage, by ſo much as we are more apt for ſinne than obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
And, as theſe metaphorical expreſſions hold it forth; So in
plain termes it is expreſt in Scripture. The Apoſtle prayes for the
<hi>Epheſians,</hi> that the <hi>eyes of their understanding being enlightened, they
may know what is the exceeding greatneſſe of Gods power, to thoſe that
beleeve, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought
in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 19. And by
way of <hi>ſimile</hi> makes Application, <hi>ch. 2. verſe 1. &amp;c. Even when
we were dead in ſins, hath he quickned us together with Chriſt, and
hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places
in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 5. Leſt any ſhould ſay the former Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors
are ſtretched above their line; when they are brought in
to hold forth that for which they have been produced; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55700:71"/>
here makes application, and ſhews that the like mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which was exerciſed of God, in raiſing Chriſt, dead in the
grave, and ſetting him up above all principalities and powers,
is exerciſed in raiſing thoſe who are dead in ſin, to ſit in heavenly
places with Chriſt. The Apoſtle entring a ſimilitude, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 19.
makes not an end of it till, <hi>chap. 2. v.</hi> 8. Only having named the
exaltation of Chriſt upon his Reſurrection, does not leave till he
have ſhewed how high he is exalted; and having named mans
low ebbe in ſin; does not leave till he hath ſet out how low; which
drawes out the ſimilitude to ſuch length, in which this truth is
ſet forth unto us, which compariſon with the application, leaves
the neceſſity of an Omnipotent concurrence in this work without
exception.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. This further appears in that inability which is in man,
to accept that which God of grace doth tender, unleſſe God cure
the faculties by his power. He is wanting, 1. In power to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
or to diſcerne the glory of that grace which is offered:
<hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
are fooliſhneſſe unto him; neither can be know them, becauſe they are
ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. This native blindneſſe in man;
with the neceſſity of an Omnipotency for cure, is plain, not only
in the Heathens, who (wanting the light of Revelation,) are, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, darkneſſe; But alſo in thoſe to whom light is
brought, and the word preacht; that ſtand in actual covenant
with God, as appears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Deut. 29. 1. &amp;</hi> 4. Compared, <hi>The Lord
hath not given you a heart to perceive,</hi> (ſpeaking to men in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant)
<hi>and eyes to ſee, and ears to hear, unto this day.</hi> 2. In will
to deſire, and heart to embrace any ſuch tender; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
there is a readineſſe ſtill to oppoſe, which is plain, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the ſtirres that are raiſed whereſoever the word is preach't,
as we ſee through the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> So that it is grown
into a Proverb, <hi>Evangelicum ciet bellum,</hi> But alſo by the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to withſtand any motion or conviction which the Word
works; what <hi>Stephen</hi> tells the Jews that they did, that each man by
nature is apt to do, <hi>to reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt. Acts</hi> 7. 51. There is
much reſiſtance in the heart, which grace by power does not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
take away, but overcome and ſubdue.</p>
                  <p>4ly This appears in Gods indication, and full declaration of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
what his work is, &amp; what is to be expected from his hand in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55700:71"/>
covenant-conditions which he requires of us, which we finde from
his mouth in ſeveral Texts of Scripture. <hi>The Lord thy God will cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe
thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed to love the Lord thy God.</hi>
Deut. 30. 6. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit I will
put within you; I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and
I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes,</hi>
Ezek. 36. 25, 26, 27. But eſpecially in that Text, <hi>Jer. 31. 31, 32,
33, 34. The dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new
covenant with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and with the houſe of</hi> Judah:
<hi>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the
day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of</hi>
Egypt (<hi>which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband
to them, ſaith the Lord:) But this ſhall be the Covenant that I
will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>after thoſe days (ſaith the Lord) I
will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;
and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people, and they ſhall teach
no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying;
Know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them to the
greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and
remember their ſin no more.</hi> In which Texts, a neceſſity of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
grace,<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 33. cleared.</note> for the ends mentioned, is abundantly ſet out unto
us: Had man power left in nature for this work, or nature ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
in all, that abilities were univerſally conferred, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
needed not. No reaſon can be given of theſe engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by thoſe that deny any neceſſity of an Omnipotent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence.
Theſe are uſually called Promiſes, and they runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
in the nature of Promiſes; ſo that they deſerve not blame,
that ſo conceive of them. Generally taken alſo to be abſolute
Promiſes, ſaith Mr <hi>Baxter, Aph. of Juſt. page</hi> 9. and being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
they muſt indeed be abſolute ones, we bring not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of faith to accept of them; Here is nothing prerequired, as
in Promiſes that are conditional; Being Promiſes, (if Promiſes)
of Grace, as ſome have diſtinguiſhed, and not Promiſes to
Grace; they are ſpoken to thoſe that are in their unbelief and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
condition; Yet that which is neceſſarily required to
make up a full Promiſe here is wanting; In Promiſes (properly ſo
called) ſome may claim their intereſt, and know themſelves to
be within their verge, and conclude the thing in Promiſe (upon
termes at leaſt) to be theirs, which here none can do. This indeed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55700:72"/>
concernes the Elect; but being in unregeneration, they know not
their Election, it is not as yet made ſure by them. So that as to us it
is without any determinate object; None can ſay, my intereſt is in
this Promiſe. Theſe were delivered to the whole body of <hi>Iſrael;</hi>
when not one in many, did reap the benefit of them. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
therefore makes them Prophecies, <hi>De eventu, Prophecies of what
ſhall happen.</hi> I ſuppoſe they may be fitly called, the declaration
or indication of Gods work, in the conditions to which he engages,
and of the neceſſary concurrence, of the power of his grace,
in that which he requires: As <hi>Auſtin</hi> and others have interpreted,
that which is affirmed of our Saviour, <hi>That he is the true light,
which enlightneth every man that comes into the world,</hi> John 1. 9. not
to be ſo underſtood, that all in the world are enlightned by him, for
many are in darkneſſe; but that all that are enlightned, have light
by his light, explaining it with this ſimilitude: Such a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter
teacheth all the children in a Town; that is, all that are
taught, he teacheth. Some go to no School at all, ſo, theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<hi>I will circumciſe your heart, and the heart of your ſeed;</hi> All of
their ſeed that are circumciſed in heart, he circumciſes, and ſo in all
the other, none of all theſe are done without his ſpecial work.
This was little heeded by the generality of the people of the Jews;
if they minded duty, it was well, they little thought of aſſiſtance
through grace; Tugging it out by their own ſtrength, and looking
for no more from heaven, than that which they had in hand;
Therefore entring Covenant; and walking in their own ſtrength;
they brake Covenant, and were never able to riſe to the duties of
it, as is hinted in that of <hi>Jeremy.</hi> Therefore God promiſes a
new covenant, in which there ſhall be a full diſcovery, and right
underſtanding, of the meaning of the Covenant; <hi>I will write my
Law in their hearts, I will put it into their inward parts.</hi> So that
as the commandment of love was a new commandment; ſo this
covenant was a new covenant, both given of old, both a new clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for a right underſtanding. <hi>There was nothing wrong</hi> (ſaith
Mr. <hi>Dixon) in the former Covenant, but it was imperfect, and all
things in it were not expreſſed clearly.</hi> Annot. on <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7. That
which was chiefly defective (as it ſeems) was this here mentioned,
and therefore Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayes well, that this place doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
but part of the covenant, not the whole, though he be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up by another for it in theſe words, <hi>God ſaying expreſſely, this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55700:72"/>
is my Covenant; to ſay it is not, is not to interpret the Word, but to
deny it;</hi> God ſayes to the People of <hi>Iſrael, Is not this the faſt that
I have choſen, to looſe the bands of wickedneſſe, to undo every burden?</hi>
If any one ſhould interpret that Text, would he ſay the whole
of a Religious Faſt, is there expreſt, and a full definition of a Faſt
laid down? or would he inſtead of interpreting, deny that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
So alſo that of <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 1. 26. <hi>Pure religion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled
before God the Father, is this; To viſit the fatherleſſe and
the widow, and to keep a man unſpotted of the world.</hi> Will any ſay,
that the whole of Religion is ſet out in that Scripture, or will he be
put to it, to deny the Scripture? I ſuppoſe he would rather ſay, that
that which thoſe Jews (to whom <hi>Iſay</hi> ſpeaks) did in &amp; uſe to do Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Faſts with ſupply of that which <hi>Iſay</hi> calls for (in which they
were defective) makes up a Religious Faſt compleat. That which
the ſcattered Tribes did in Religion; with what <hi>James</hi> further calls
for, would render a man entirely Religious: So alſo that of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy
22. 15, 16. Shalt thou reigne, becauſe thou cloſeſt thy ſelf
in Cedar? Did not thy father, eat and drink and do justice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and then it was well with him? He judged the cauſe of the
poor and needy, and then it was well with him; was not this to know
me, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Will any ſay, that that was all the knowledge
that <hi>Joſiah</hi> had of God? or will he ſay rather, that this was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
proof of the ſincerity of it; ſo I ſay, that which the Jews already
underſtood to be in the covenant, together with that which
thoſe places of <hi>Jeremy</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> further hold forth, ſet
out the entire nature of a covenant; and ſo in all of them, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is interpreted, not denied. And whereas one affirmes, that
there is no condition on mans part, in thoſe texts in queſtion, an
adverſary of all conditions on mans part in the covenant replyes.
<hi>If you mean ſuch conditions that God requireth of us; yet worketh in
us; it is there punctually expreſt.</hi> As Gods work, it is there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
expreſt; but not as our duty, which lame underſtanding of
the covenant, hath wrought as much miſchief in our age; (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up free grace, without any eye upon his ſovereignty, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at Gods work, and not at all on mans duty) as their looking
at duty in that age without eye had to the power of grace, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for it. Hence are thoſe deſperate counſels; <hi>Sit ſtill, do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
doing undoes you:</hi> and that not toward <hi>Dilemma. Art thou
out of Chriſt, thou mayſt break thy heart in working, and profit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55700:73"/>
Art thou in Chriſt, then all is wrought to thy hands.</hi> And
ſo doing ſtill is vain; and Mr. <hi>Baxters Queſtioniſts</hi> like demands.
<hi>How can you make it appear that according to the new Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we
muſt act for life, and not only from life; or that a man may make his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of life, the end of his work, and not rather obey it out of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and love?</hi> To which I ſuppoſe he hath received a ſatisfying, and
(if throughly weighed,) a ſadning anſwer, <hi>Appendix, p. 78. 79, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This appears in that differencing work, which is ſeen
among men here in the fleſh. There is a great difference between
thoſe that are of God, and thoſe that are in the world, that lies
in wickedneſſe. This is from the power of grace, enabling to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to that unto which God in covenant calls, and not from the
different improvement of any power of man, or the exerciſe of
that freedome of will, which together with the whole ſpecies of
mankind he hath received. The Apoſtle puts the queſtion, <hi>Who
hath made thee to differ?</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 7. In which he intends to ſtop
all mouths from boaſting, as appears in the next words; If any
therefore ſhall anſwer in <hi>Grevenchovius</hi> his words (as I have ſeen
them quoted, or in any words that hold out or inferre the ſame
thing,) <hi>I make my ſelf to differ:</hi> The Apoſtle will not ſit down
by it, He expreſſely tells us; <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him
that runneth; but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> Rom 9. 16. If grace
makes the difference and not man; then grace enables man to
go higher than his own power, and to go higher than any power
that can be in any other. Seclude this differencing grace, and
the praiſe will be wholly mans. That any have power and poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for good, (according to theſe Divines) may be of God; but that
any is better than another it is from ſelf that makes to differ.</p>

fighting ſtoutly ſhould be puffed up and grow proud: How may this
pride, ſaith he, be beaten down, and humility planted? If any one
ſhould ſay to him, Let not any ſouldier glory in the ſight of his father;
for what he is in armes, he is from him: So that he that glorieth,
let him glory in his father; for what haſt thou that thou haſt not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
He might very well and rationally anſwer (<hi>ſaith our learned
Authour,</hi>) why ſhould not I glory of my atcheivments in armes? I
have received natural abilities indeed from my father, for none doth
beget himſelf; I have received a oommiſſion from him, for none may
put himſelf into any ſuch power; I have received alſo armes from him,
for neither I, nor any other ſouldier was born armed; neither am I any
armourer. But the right uſe of all theſe which is above all, I had from
none but my ſelf, and not in any other; and ſo every ſouldier of Jeſus
Chriſt. <hi>Brad. De cauſa Dei. lib. 2, cap. 23. ad finem. That
is, he may vapour againſt God, upon ſuch ſuppoſal as this ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
vapours againſt his father. If acts of grace make to
differ and ſtop the mouth of all boaſting; then it is grace that
enables unto theſe covenant-duties and engagements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, This appears by the abſurdities that will follow upon
denial of this doctrine of the concurrence of grace in the work of
mans ſalvation. 1. Man being left to the power of his own will,<note place="margin">Neceſſity of the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of grace.</note>
to anſwer to the termes of the covenant (ſo that all ſhall be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
according to mans improvement to will or nill, to be
active or idle, willing or diſobedient,) when the event in all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the Elect muſt reſt doubtful; when Chriſt hath done all in
the work of mans ſalvation, it might (notwithſtanding all ſuch
work of his) ſo fall out, that he had effected nothing. He might
have been a Saviour, and not one man in the world have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
He might have been a Head, without any one member; a
Shepherd, and not a ſheep in his flock; a Lord, and never a one
to have done him any ſervice. It might have ſo fallen out, that
he might never have been able to have ſaid to the Father; <hi>I, and
the children that thou haſt given, &amp;c.</hi> This is evident; As ſome
have withſtood, ſo might others; As the moſt withſtand, ſo
might all. Yea, it would have been no otherwiſe, If Gods
Miniſters ſhould go forth, and the hand of the Lord not with
them to work men to beleeve, <hi>Acts.</hi> 11. 21. But this is full a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Gods covenant with Chriſt, which muſt ſtand firme and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
remain. <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his dayes;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55700:74"/>
the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand,</hi> Iſa. 53. 10, 11
<hi>Therefore it is of grace, that it may be ſure;</hi> not of man, that it
ſhould be doubtful. 2. Then it will alſo follow, the work of
mans ſalvation begins in an act; not in an habit; in ſomewhat
that a man does reſpective to God, and not in any thing that
God does in and upon man. The firſt beginning work will be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to him that wills and runs, not to him that ſhews mercy.
But this is contrary to all Goſpel-Revelations, concerning the
way of our change: <hi>I will circumciſe thy heart, that thou ſhalt love
the Lord with all thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 30. 6. <hi>I will write my
Law in their hearts, and put it into their inward parts, as</hi> Jer 31. 33.
<hi>No man can come to me, except the Father draw him,</hi> Joh. 6. 44. <hi>I will
take away their hearts of ſtone, and give them hearts of fleſh,</hi> Ezek 36.
26. If man were alone in the work, or had the priorety before
any power infuſed, there had been none of theſe undertakings. 3.
This will make vain and void the prayers of the people of
God, which in the Scripture is put into their mouths; <hi>Draw me,
and we will runne,</hi> Cant. 1. 4. <hi>Turn thou us, O Lord, and ſo ſhall
we be turned,</hi> Lament. 5. 21. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, and renue a
right ſpirit;</hi> acknowledging their own weakneſſe to do, and a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of grace to effect, what in order to their ſalvation is called for.</p>
                  <p>7ly. If the Apoſtle may be heard, his authority will put it out of
queſtion, Exhorting <hi>to work out our own ſalvation with fear and
trembling,</hi> which is done no other way than in coming up to
that which God calls for in covenant, he gives in his reaſon for
encouragement; <hi>It is God that works in us the will and the deed.</hi>
The ſpecial hand and power of God concurring in this works, is
our encouragement from the Apoſtle to ſet upon it. How can
he encourage to this work upon this account that God works in
us, to will and to do, if there were not a work of God upon us
before there be any ſuch work done by us? We work, but he ſets
us on working; We will, but he ſets us on willing; Let all the gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that have ever been put upon theſe words to promote the will
and work of man; and enervate the free grace of God, in the
great concernments of ſalvation, be examined, and they will all
fall of themſelves before this Text of the Apoſtle. See Dr. <hi>Ward</hi>
in his Sermon called <hi>Gratia diſcriminans.</hi>

Works. If we can no more riſe up to the termes of the Covenant

difference?</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer; <label type="milestone">

to work can be ſaved by the Covenant of Works, will eaſily
be granted. <hi>By grace we are ſaved,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8. <hi>not of our ſelves.</hi>
It is ſtill equally impoſſible in both to be ſelf-ſavours. Here is
the difference. Grace raiſes us, unto that to which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
calls us, in a ſelf-denying way through faith; but works
us not to that ſelf perfection in thoſe degrees of inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
as to be ſaved by works.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This doctrine layes man as low as a ſtock or a ſtone; a dead
carcaſſe, nothing is done by him but what is done in him, and ſo muſt

dead till grace quicken and raiſe him. His heart is of ſtone till grace,
take it from him, and in enmity againſt God, till grace
circumciſe and work that change, to love the Lord with all the
heart, &amp;c. Secondly, This is not an abſolute death, in which man is,
through ſin, and therefore the ſimilitude holds not, that equals a
ſtock, ſtone, or dead carcaſſe with him; It is only a death reſpective,
as to ſpiritual obedience he is dead, There is in him a life natural,
able for all actions and motions of the life of man as man, There is
in him alſo a moral life, able to improve naturals to a civilized con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
That to which feare or hope can work a man, thither he
may raiſe himſelf by the freedome of will, this puts no new life
into him, nor works any chang of nature in him. He is alſo able for
thoſe works which God ſanctifies as his inſtrument, for the work of
a ſpiritual life, He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55700:75"/>
ſlands in a capacity of a life of grace, of ſpiritual actions
and motions: having an underſtanding, will, affections, wanting
not any faculties in their ſubſtance. The new man attaines not a
new ſoul, but only renewed qualifications, which yet are of more
glory, than the faculties themſelves, carrying ſuch a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of God. Better know nothing than not know God, to
deſire nothing, than not to deſire good. The want of this, turned
Angels into Devils, and ſo man ſtands in a vaſt difference from

                  <p>Thirdly, ſome ſay, <hi>This will render preaching vaine, all mans-paines
for Converſion of ſoules will then prove uſeleſſe, and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
we may let men alone till God work; and when he hath begun
his work, they will ſet on working.</hi> This indeed ſpeaks hard to a
ſort of men in our times; that deny any previous working in the
ſoul for regeneration, or any preparatory work to converſion,
So that all uncoverted, ſtand equally diſtant from the grace of
it, in ſo much that it can be ſaid of no one rather than another,
which Chriſt ſaid to the Scribe, <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdome
of God,</hi> Mar. 12. 34. I ſee not how theſe can make the preaching of
the word of any uſe; Our Brethren that went into <hi>America,</hi>
and offer the Goſpel to ſavage Indians there, may as well finde
Chriſt there, as bring him thither. The dark places of the earth
may be equally happy, with thoſe, where light is in moſt glory, if
light contribute nothing to the work of change, and the happy
frame of Chriſt in us. But thoſe that have learnt, that infuſed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
are wrought in the ſoul in the ſame manner,<note place="margin">Habitus infuſi infunduntur ad m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

acquired, may eaſily return a ſatisfying anſwer. That opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the ſoul is by an immediate creation infuſed, how generally
ſoever it is received, yet never was thought of force to render the
way of marriage uſeleſſe for procreation; God infuſes not a ſoul
by creation into any, but an organized body, an Embryo fitted
to receive it. Neither can this opinion of the power of grace in the
work of Converſion, render in vain the labours of thoſe that are
ſpiritual Parents. Conviction is in order before Converſion, and
men muſt ſee themſelves neceſſitated to do what they do, before
ever they enter upon it. The ſoule knoweth what it doth, when
it firſt beleeves, and ſees a neceſſity to accept Chriſt before it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55700:75"/>
him, which is the work of the Word in the ſoules, of thoſe
that are brought to Chriſt Jeſus. It is not in vaine for God to
ſend his Miniſters to ſhew the myſteries of the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to thoſe that are blinde, when this is the way of God to
open their eyes and give them ſight. It is not in vain that he
ſends them to thoſe that are without ſtrength, when this is his
way to enable them with power. It is not in vain that <hi>Paul</hi>
plants, and <hi>Apollos</hi> waters, when yet it is God that gives the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
when God will uſe <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> for the increaſe that
he gives. Miniſters ſhould perſwade, and people improve en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
as though they were <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and no help of grace affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
They ſhould pray and beleeve, and reſt on grace as though
they were <hi>Antinomians,</hi> nothing of endeavour to be looked
after; So the injury that the <hi>Pelagian</hi> doth to grace,
and the <hi>Antinomian</hi> to our endeavours, will be on both hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>

                  <p>2ly. THe conditions, on mans part in the Covenant of Works,
kept man within him ſelf for righteouſneſſe.<note place="margin">The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works kept man within himſelf for righteouſneſſe.</note> That righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
in which he was to ſtand in Gods ſight, was inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
wrought by himſelf; co-natural to him, flowing from the
principles of his creation, in conformity to God. And therefore
properly his own; as now a mans reaſon, will and affections are
properly his, He needed no other, nor no more righteouſneſſe than
that in which he ſtood. Though he had that faith which now
ſerves to juſtifie; yet it needed not, nor could be improved to
take in any other righteouſneſſe without himſelf for juſtification.
Man ſtood then on his own bottome. His dependance was on
God for being, but that being, which God pleaſed to communicate,
was in that integrity and purity, that he needed not any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But the conditions of the Covenant of Grace, carry man out

or elſe he will never be able to ſtand in judgment. <hi>Paul</hi> was as
high, as he that was higheſt, in that righteouſneſſe, which he could
lay claime to, as his own, wrought by himſelf, as well before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
as after. Before converſion he was as high, as a Phariſee,
or a Jew according to the letter could reach, either in priviledges,
or duties; as we may ſee in that gradation of his, <hi>Phil. 3. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,</hi>
and therefore of the body of the people of God, and
no alien from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael; Circumciſed the
eighth day,</hi> and therefore born of Parents in the ſame Church-communion;
<hi>Of the ſtock of Iſrael,</hi> and ſo the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and not deſcended of anceſtors that had been Proſelytes;
<hi>Of the Tribe of Benjamin,</hi> of that part of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that held the
truth of worſhip; of whom was ſalvation, and not of the
Apoſtated tribes; <hi>An Hebrew of the Hebrews,</hi> and therefore
had not forgotten the language of <hi>Canaan; As touching the Law,
a Phariſee,</hi> a man of no vulgar account, but of the moſt exquiſite
Sect; <hi>Concerning zeal, perſecuting the Church,</hi> therefore not
luke-warme or cold in the faith; <hi>As touching the righteouſneſſe that
is of the Law blameleſſe,</hi> therefore of a converſation exact, walk
up to his principles. After converſion, <hi>he knew nothing by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
1 Cor. 4. 4. His heart condemned him not, <hi>He exerciſed
himſelf continually to have a conſcience void of offence, both to God
and man,</hi> Acts 24. 16. Yet he durſt reſt, in none of theſe, <hi>I am not</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>hereby juſtified,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 4. <hi>What things were gain to
me, thoſe I counted loſſe for Chriſt; yea, doubtleſſe, and I count all
things but loſſe for the excellency of the knowledg of Chriſt Jeſus
my Lord; for whom I have ſuffered the loſſe of all things, and do
count them but dung that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not
having my own righteouſneſſe, which is of the Law; but that which is
through faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith,</hi>
Philip. 3. 7, 8, 9. The ignorance of this, was the bane of the
body of the Jewiſh Nation. <hi>The Gentiles which followed not after
righteouſneſſe, have attained to righteouſneſſe, even the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which is of faith. But</hi> Iſrael <hi>which followed after the Law of
righteouſneſſe, hath not attained to the Law of righteouſneſſe;
wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the
works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9. 30, 31, 32. <hi>For they being ignorant of
Gods righteouſneſſe, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55700:76"/>
have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the righteouſneſſe of God,</hi>
Rom. 10. 3. And ſtill, it is the undoing of a great part of the
world; Man being naturally inclined, to look after a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his own, and extreamely oppoſite to this righteouſneſſe,
which in the covenant of grace is tendered, and by which in a
Goſpel-way he muſt be ſaved. The righteouſneſſe of the former
covenant, was wrote in the heart by nature; and ſuch remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
left, that the man that minds any righteouſneſſe, alone looks
after it. But this, is onely of Revelation, He muſt have light
without him to lead to this righteouſneſſe, which is not his own,
nor inherent in him: What naturally he did not know, he is
naturally ready to oppoſe and refuſe. Men know not how,
till they be taught of God, to ſee a reaſon of it; or to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that it is of any uſe. A man may be wiſe with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
mans wit, ſtrong with another mans ſtrength, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by another mans knowledge, as well as righteous (as they
conceive) by another mans righteouſneſſe: Hence are the
ſcornes that are put upon it, and the Treatiſes that are wrote
againſt it; <hi>Vain man would faine be ſomewhat, as wiſe,</hi>
Job 11. 12. <hi>ſo alſo righteous.</hi> This takes all from man, ſtrips
him of all in, which he may glory, as <hi>Romans</hi> 3. 27. This
which man ſo oppoſeth, the covenant of grace eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
And that which he ſo advanceth, the covenant of grace
diſclaimes.<note place="margin">The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works were for mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in preſent happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note>

                  <p>3. <hi>The conditions on mans part in the covenant of works were
for mans preſervation in</hi> ſtatu quo; <hi>in that condition in which
he was created,</hi> To hold him in communion with God,
which was his happineſſe; he expected not to be bettered by his
obedience, either reſpective to happineſſe (no more is promiſed
than in preſent he had,) nor yet in his qualifications reſpective

                  <head type="sub">Faith is a condition of the Covenant of Grace.</head>
                  <p>HAVING aſſerted conditions, in the covenant of grace,
and held forth ſeveral differences between the conditions,
in the covenant of works, and in the covenant of grace, we are
now further to enquire, what theſe conditions are, that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for in this covenant, on which we treat: Thoſe Divines, that
with concurrent judgments, acknowledge this covenant to be
conditional, are not yet, ſo unanimous, in their aſſignation of
them. For a full diſcovery, ſome things are to be premiſed, as
truths taken for granted, rather than diſputed 1. That God
covenants with man, and engages himſelf to him, not onely for
juſtification, but alſo for ſalvation. Not onely for pardon of
ſinne, but everlaſting life and glory. Not onely to be reconciled
to him; but to conferre eternal happineſſe upon him. 2. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
God requires of man, in order, either to his juſtification,
or ſalvation, without which he is not juſtified, or ſaved, and
man engages unto, in order to his juſtification, or ſalvation, this
is a covenant condition. This I take to be clear, in caſe there be
any ſuch thing, as a condition in any covenant, and it is alſo
granted by a profeſſed adverſary of all conditions in the covenant
of grace, <hi>faith and repentance are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>means, of our enjoying
the comforts of the covenant, but not conditions going out of the nature
of a covenant; for every means, is not a condition, though every
condition be a means; but, when a means is by ſtipulation, and
contract appointed; for the acquiring of any thing, then it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
Whatſoever then we can finde, thus required of God, in
this way of contract, and ſtipulation; is a condition by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of our adverſaries. 3. Whatſoever is required of man,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55700:77"/>
in order to his juſtification, is a condition of his juſtification, and
all that is required, in order to his eternal ſalvation, is, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of ſalvation, God making tender of both, and man enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
himſelf to ſeek both, whatſoever is required in order to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
reſpective to that, is a condition. 4. That, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of juſtification, is alſo a condition of ſalvation, in that, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
preſuppoſes a juſtified eſtate, but, it holds not on the
contrary, that, which is, a condition of ſalvation, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a condition of juſtification. More is required, to hold us up,
in conſtant communion with God, then to bring us into a ſtate
of actual reconcilement to God. This being premiſed, the work
will be more eaſie, to aſſigne conditions in this covenant. The
condition, immediately ſerviceable, for mans return to a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſtate with God; and conſequently of his juſtification, is faith,
which almoſt all acknowledge to be a condition, and <hi>Camero,</hi> with
ſeveral others, makes it to be, the ſole condition of the covenant.
A condition it is, as, is above contradiction, <hi>John. 3. 15, 16. God
ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi>
Mark 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved;
but, he that beleeveth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> Acts 10. 43. <hi>To him,
give all the Prophets witneſſe, that thorough his name; whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> Acts 13. 38, 39.
<hi>Be it known unto you therefore men, and brethren; that through this
man, is preached unto you forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. And by him, all
that beleeve, are juſtified from all things from which, ye could, not
be juſtified, by the Law of Moſes,</hi> Acts 16. 31. <hi>Believe on the
Lord Jeſus Christ and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy whole houſe,</hi> Rom.
3. 25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth, to be a propitiation through faith in
his blood,</hi> Rom. 10. 4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs,
to every one that believeth.</hi> In all theſe texts, and ſeveral others,
faith is required of men, in covenant, and if men did not engage to
beleeve, they could not be ſo much as profeſſed covenanters. This is
in reaſon further evident.</p>
                  <p>1. That which gives us intereſt in the Mediator of the covenant,
without which we have no title to him,<note place="margin">Reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Faith to be a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of grace.</note> or portion in him; is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the covenant: This is plain of it ſelf, without intereſt in
the Mediator of the covenant, we are as though no covenant were
entred, and the former diſtance held up. But it is faith that gives us
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55700:78"/>
intereſt in Chriſt the Mediatour, He dwells in us by faith, <hi>Epheſ.
3. 17. He is ſet forth a propitiation through Faith in his blood;</hi>
They that believe receive him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. Others hold a
diſtance from him; <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave
power to be the ſonnes of God, even to thoſe that beleeve in his
Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That which receives all that grace gives, muſt needs be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the covenant of grace; This is as plain, to be under a
covenant of grace, and void of the gifts of grace is a vain entrance
upon it, and the reception of the gift is a condition neceſſarily
requiſite. But Faith receives all that grace gives; It is of
Fath that it might be of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. God gives nothing,
at leaſt tending to eternity, but he puts it into the hands of
Chriſt; He is the Fathers treaſury and ſtore-houſe, <hi>Col. 1. 19.
It pleaſed the Father that in him all fulneſſe ſhould dwell. And that of
his fulneſſe we ſhould all receive, Joh.</hi> 1. 16. And faith receives al from
him, <hi>He that believeth, out of his belly flowes rivers of living water.</hi>
Joh. 7. 38.</p>
                  <p>3. That which intereſt us in, and gives title to all priviledges, of
a people in covenant with God through Chriſt, is a condition of
the covenant: This is plaine, the end of the covenant being to
conferre thoſe priviledges upon us; But Faith intereſts us in,
and gives title to all theſe priviledges, <hi>Paul</hi> is ſent to the Gentiles,
to turne them <hi>from Satan to God, to bring them out of Satans
kingdome,</hi> and to bring them in a covenant-way into Chriſts
Kingdome, <hi>That they may receive forgiveneſſe of ſins, and an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
among them that are ſanctified</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>by faith that
is in me.</hi> Chriſt is the object of a Chriſtians faith, on whom it is
terminated; Faith which is in Chriſt, receives that leading priviledg,
forgiveneſſe of ſins; without this priviledge we are ſtrangers to
all other priviledges; Being under ſinne, we are heires of wrath,
and in no capacity of mercy. Faith intereſts us in this. <hi>Acts 10.
43. To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, that through his Name,
whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Acts 13.
39. <hi>And by him, all that beleeve are juſtified, from all things from
which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> Rom. 3. 25.
<hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,
to declare his righteouſneſſe for the remiſſion of ſinnes that are paſt,
through the forbearance of God.</hi> Faith intereſts us in the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55700:78"/>
priviledge, an inheritance among them that are ſanctified.
<hi>He that believeth hath everlaſting life, John</hi> 6. 40. Faith intereſts
us in all intermediate priviledges, which a man in covenant can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
in the way to this inheritance. Adoption of ſonnes is this way
obtained, <hi>John 1. 12. Gal.</hi> 3. 26. Pacification of Spirit, Serenity
and tranquility of minde, <hi>Iſa. 26. 3. Rom.</hi> 5. 1. Boldneſſe at the
throne of grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 12. There is no priviledge bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
on Chriſt, that hath foundation in him, but
Faith receives, Faith then muſt be a condition of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>4. That which puts into a capacity to receive the mercies of the
covenant; held forth in Promiſe, is a condition of the covenant,
and the want of it ſtrips off all hope and expectation of it; But
Faith puts into a capacity to receive all the graces of the covenant
given in promiſe; <hi>Said I not unto thee, if thou wilt beleeve, thou
ſhalt ſee the glory of God?</hi> John 11. 40. God exerts and glorifies
his power in great things for good unto thoſe that exerciſe the
grace of Faith. <hi>Paul ſaw the Creeple had faith to be healed,</hi> Acts
14. 9. Sure if there be ſuch a thing as a condition in any cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
in the world any ſuch thing as a conditional covenant, then
ſure faith is a condition of the covenant of grace; Some conceive
an abſolute covenant made of God for grace, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33.
This with me is very diſputable, and I have given my reaſons.
But the covenant made to grace, muſt needs ſuppoſe grace. There
is no covenant for happineſſe made with any creature, but upon
termes and conditions.</p>
                  <p>For further clearing of this point,<note place="margin">In what ſenſe faith is here taken.</note> we muſt know that faith
is conſidered under a double notion. Firſt, as an inſtrument,
or (if that word will not be allowed) as the way of our
intereſt in Chriſt, and priviledges by Chriſt. Secondly, as
an inherent grace or Chriſtian duty to which both the Law and
the Goſpel call. The radical grace from which others flow,
though not in their being, yet in their farther growth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.
I ſpeak of Faith now in the firſt acception. Neither as a
part, or any way a working cauſe, of the farther progreſſe in inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
righteouſneſſe, ſo it will come in the ſecond place, but as
intereſting us in another righteouſneſſe, and ſo I ſay it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the covenant of grace, immediately ſerviceable for our
returne to God, and reconciliation in Chriſt. For clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55700:79"/>
of which,<note place="margin">Propoſitions tending to clear the point in hand.</note> I ſhall clear it in ſome propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God will by no means justifie a wicked perſon, no man in
ſin ſhall stand and live in his ſight.</hi> He that hath made a Law to
forbid it, ordained hell for the puniſhment of it, will not juſtifie
the perſon that is convinced and found guilty of it. Some ſay
it is againſt his eſſence. The juſtice of God (which is God) ties
him to take vengeance, ſure I am it is againſt his declaration of
himſelf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 7. when he ſets out his name in ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
this is one, <hi>by no means clearing the guilty.</hi> Some indeed
have ſaid (conceiting with themſelves thereby to promote
free grace,) that God juſtifies ſinners as ſinners, which,
as it muſt needs, if true, bring in the ſalvation of all, <hi>à


quatenus ad omne valet argumentum,</hi> then a man need no
more but ſinne, to conclude his ſalvation, and the more ſinne, the
ſtronger evidence; ſo, it is utterly deſtructive to the Goſpel,
and overthrows the whole work of Chriſts merit, as the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>If righteouſneſſe be by the Law, then, Christ is dead in
vaine.</hi> Galatians 2. 21. So we may ſafely ſay, If a man
be juſtified as a ſinner without a righteouſneſſe. So that the
truth is, God juſtifies as righteous, what he eſteems as an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in man, that he doth not himſelf; but this in man is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination
to him; <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and condemneth
the juſt, even they both are an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Proverbs
17. 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Man hath no righteouſneſſe of his owne, to bring in
plea for his juſtification, in which he can appeare before God in
judgment.</hi> This will be plaine if we conſider the wayes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital
where proceedings are juſt and legal. This muſt be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as innocent, when a man can plead not guilty to that which
is given in charge; So did <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Cuſh,</hi> the Benjamite did
traduce him, <hi>Pſalm. 7. 3. If I have done this, if there be iniquity
in my hands.</hi> And ſo did <hi>Paul</hi> to the charge of <hi>Tertullus,</hi> Acts
24. 13. Upon this account <hi>Pilate</hi> was willing to have acquitted
Chriſt, <hi>I finde no fault in this man,</hi> Luke 23. 4. Or elſe by way
of ſatisfaction or diſcharge of the penalty which the Law impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
ſo in all penal Lawes, when the penalty is borne, the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
is diſcharged. Man cannot be acquitted as innocent, his
guilt is too palpable. <hi>There is no men that ſinneth n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>)
1 Kings 8. 4, 6. The Scripture hath concluded all under ſinne,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55700:79"/>
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. The Law ſpeaks that language, <hi>that every mouth may
be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3.
19. Man is under that guilt that he is wholly ſilenced; which
renders the way of ſalvation by works impoſſible. Neither can he
be acquitted by way of ſatisfaction; where the way of pure juſtice
is held, the debtor under charge can never come out till he hath
paid the uttermoſt farthing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 26. Which here amounts to
ſuch an heighth, that man may be ever paying, but never able to
ſatisfie: Our guilt is according to the majeſty of him, whoſe Law
is tranſgreſſed, and wrath incurred. This is ſeen in Devils and
damned ſouls, who bear in their own perſons the reward due to
their ſinnes. That man, that muſt ſuffer it in his own perſon, may
well ſay with <hi>Cain, My puniſhment is greater then I can bear,</hi>
Gen. 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Man in this ſad and perplexed eſtate, hath yet a
righteouſneſſe of grace tendered him, a righteouſneſſe without the
Law, but witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Rom. 3. 21. And
this is by way of diſcharge of his guilt by anothers ſuffering; Our
name was in the Obligation in caſe of ſinne to ſuffer death, Chriſt
was pleaſed (by conſent and covenant with the Father) to put
in his; and as he was thus obliged, ſo he <hi>ſuffered, the just for the
unjuſt, that he might bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18. We brake
the Law, and he bore the penalty, whether <hi>idem</hi> or <hi>tantundem,</hi> the
ſame in ſpecie, or the ſame in value, is ſcarce worth diſpute, So
that it be yeelded that juſtice was anſwered, and the Father ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and that we come out not on our own, but our ſureties
account. And this (as I yet conceive) is by Chriſts paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
His ſuffering in the fleſh is our freedom, his death is our
ranſome. There needs no more than innocency not to die, and when
guilt is taken away, we ſtand as innocent, no crime then can be
charged upon us. But to reign in life (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit

that Chriſts active obedience, ſerved onely for a qualification to
fit him for the work of ſuffering; none but innocent man free
from ſin, could be a ſacrifice for ſinne, ſeeing Chriſt had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
though he had never come under the Law, to have yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Gal.</hi> 4. 4. Somewhat might be ſaid for the ſubjection of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

but the perſon of Chriſt God-man, ſeemes to be above ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
Much may be ſaid for the ſubjection of the Sonne of

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, whether paſſive or active,
or both paſſive and active, is made ours by faith.</hi> This is our way
of intereſt and appropriation of it to our ſelves, Faith and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grace, this grace and no other Goſpel-work, gives us title;
and therefore, as it is called <hi>the righteousneſſe of God,</hi> ſo, alſo <hi>the
righteouſneſſe of faith;</hi> Theſe two, are promiſcuouſly uſed and taken,
for one another, <hi>Rom. 10. 3, 4. Phil</hi> 3. 8. Called the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God, being the free gift of God, wrought by Chriſt who
is God, denied to be our own righteouſneſſe, being neither
wrought by us, or inherent in us, called the righteouſneſſe of
faith, not of works, not of love, not of patience, or meekneſs.
It is alone faith, and none of theſe graces that puts out it ſelfe to
receive it; love in a graciouſly diſpoſed ſoul, cleaves to Chriſt
for communion, but receives him not for juſtification. Theſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55700:80"/>
two ſtand as relatives, there is no ſoul entituled to this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but by faith; and faith is it that entitles to it, &amp; the beleeving
ſoul hath intereſt in it, Therefore juſtification in Scripture is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to faith, and denied to works, when neither faith, nor works
can beare us out of themſelves before the tribunal of God; but
faith takes hold, and the ſoul by faith reſts on this righteouſneſſe
of grace, which the Goſpel tenders. It is true, that faith receives
the Spirit as well as it receives the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 7. 39.
Gal.</hi> 3. 14. But this is for another uſe, for the work of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
inherent,<note place="margin">The acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt as a Lord, doth not juſtifie.</note> not juſtification by righteouſneſſe imputed. And
it is alſo true, that faith accepts Chriſt as a Lord, as well as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour:
But it is the acceptation of him as a Saviour, not as a Lord
that juſtifies; Chriſt rules his people as a King, teacheth them as
a Prophet, but makes atonement for them onely as a Prieſt, by
giving himſelf in ſacrifice; his blood for remiſſion of ſins; Theſe
muſt be diſtinguiſhed, but not divided, Faith hath an eye at all,
the blood of Chriſt, the command of Chriſt, the Doctrine of
Chriſt, but as it eyes and faſtens on his blood, ſo it juſtifies. <hi>He
is ſet out a propitiation through faith in his blood,</hi> Romans 3. 24.
not through faith in his command, <hi>It is the blood of Chriſt that
cleanſeth all ſin, and not the Sovereignty of Chriſt.</hi> Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions
of the diſtinct parts of Chriſts Mediatourſhip; and the
ſeveral offices of faith may not be ſuffered. Scripture aſſignes
each its particular place and work. Sovereignty doth not cleanſe
us, nor doth blood command us; faith in his blood, not faith
yeelding to his Sovereignty doth juſtifie us. There are ſeveral acts
or fruits of juſtifying faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. But all are not juſtifying; It is
not <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſelf-denial, <hi>Gideon</hi> or <hi>Sampſons</hi>
valour that was their juſtification, but his blood (in which faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
gives intereſt) who did enable them in theſe duties, by his Spirit.
<hi>Paul</hi> went in theſe duties as high as they, living in more clear light,
and under more abundant grace, I doubt not but he out-topt them,
and yet he was not thereby juſtified, as 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. James</hi> indeed
ſaith, that <hi>Abraham was juſtified by works, when he had offered</hi> Iſaac
<hi>his ſon on the Altar,</hi> James 2. 21. But either there we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<hi>a working faith</hi> with <hi>Piſcator, Paraeus, Pemble,</hi> and others,
and confeſſe that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> handle two diſtinct queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
The one, whether faith alone juſtifies without works; which
he concludes in the affirmative. The other, what faith juſtifies,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55700:81"/>
whether a working faith onely, and not a faith that is dead and
idle; or elſe I know not how to make ſenſe of the Apoſtle, who
ſtreight inferres from <hi>Abrahams</hi> juſtification by the offer of his
ſonne. <hi>And the Scripture was fulfilled, that ſaith,</hi> Abraham <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
God, and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> How
otherwiſe do theſe accord? He was juſtified by works, and the
Scripture was fulfilled, that ſaith, he was juſtified by faith; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I reconcile what he ſaith, if this be denied, with the
whole current of the Goſpel. The Rhemiſts indeed underſtand
thoſe texts of the Apoſtle, where he excludes works from juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
to be meant of mans moral works, done before faith and
converſion; The works of the Law done without Chriſt, <hi>Annot.
in Rom.</hi> 3. 20, 28. As though the Law did not command thoſe
duties, unto which Chriſt through faith ſtrengthens a Chriſtian
converted by grace; And when the Apoſtle concludes the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
of being juſtified by the works of the Law, his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhould be unleſſe grace aſſiſt the Law, that it may juſtifie: This
could not be, the Apoſtle calls it a righteouſneſſe of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Law, not a righteouſneſſe of the Law, with addition of
ſtrength from the Goſpel; All works before or after converſion
inherent in us, or wrought by us, are excluded from juſtification.
See <hi>Ravanellus in verbum, Juſtificatio. Num. 3. page</hi> 867. This ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
wrought freely by grace through faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. is
no way conſiſtent with juſtification by works. And what the
Apoſtle ſpeaks of election, we may well apply to juſtification,
the ſame <hi>medium</hi> equally proves the truth of both, <hi>If by grace,
then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace. But
if it be of works, then it is no more of grace, otherwiſe works were
no more works,</hi> Rom 11. 6. And theſe things conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am
truly ſorry that faith ſhould now be denied to have the office or
place of an inſtrument in our juſtification;<note place="margin">Faith juſtifies as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> nay, ſcarce allowed to
be called the inſtrument of receiving Chriſt, that juſtifies us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the act of faith (which is that which juſtifies us) is, our
actual receiving Chriſt, and therefore cannot be the inſtrument
of receiving. This is too ſubtile a notion: we uſe to ſpeak other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of Faith; Faith is the eye of the ſoul whereby we ſee Chriſt,
and the eye is not ſight. Faith is the hand of the ſoul whereby
it receives Chriſt, and the hand is not receiving, And Scripture
ſpeaks otherwiſe, <hi>We receive remiſſion of ſinnes by Faith, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55700:81"/>
among them that are ſanctified is received by Faith,</hi> Acts
18. 26. Why elſe is this righteouſneſſe ſometimes called the
righteouſneſſe of Faith, and ſometimes the righteouſneſſe of God
which is by Faith, but that it is a righteouſneſſe which Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives;
<hi>Chriſt dwells in us by Faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 17. By Faith we
take him in and give him entertaintment <hi>We receive the promiſe of
the Spirit through Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 14. Theſe Scriptures ſpeak of
Faith as the ſouls inſtrument, to receive Chriſt Jeſus, to receive
the Spirit from Chriſt Jeſus. The inſtrumentality of it in the work
of juſtification is denied, becauſe the nature of an inſtrument (as
conſidered in Phyſical operations) doth not exactly belong to it,
which if it muſt be alwayes rigidly followed, will often put us
to a ſtand in the aſſignation of cauſes of any kind in Moral acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
The material and formal cauſes in juſtification are ſcarce
agreed upon, and no marvel then, in caſe men mind to contend
about it, that ſome queſtion is raiſed about the inſtrument. But
in caſe we ſhall conſider the nature and kinde of this work, about
which Faith is implied, and examine the reaſon and ground upon
which Faith is diſabled from the office of an inſtrument in our
juſtification, and withall look into that which is brought in as an
inſtrument in this work in the ſtead of it; I do not doubt but it
will eaſily appear that thoſe Divines, that with a concurrent
judgment (without almoſt a diſſenting voice have made Faith an
inſtrument in this work) ſpeak moſt aptly and moſt agreeably to
the nature of an inſtrument. The work about which Faith is
implied, is not an abſolute, but a relative work, a work of
God towards man, not without the actual concurrence of man,
ſuch, in which neither God nor man are ſole efficients, nor any
act of God or man can be ſole inſtruments, but there muſt be a
mutual concurrence of both; This muſt needs be granted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
we will bring in Doctor <hi>Criſpes</hi> paſſive recipiency of Chriſt,
Chriſts abode in man without man, in ſpight of man, and ſuppoſe
him to be juſtified in unbelief; And hereupon faith is diſabled from
this office in juſtification by this argument. <hi>If Faith be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is the inſtrument of God, or man. 1. Not of man, for man is not
the principal efficient, he doth not justifie himſelf. 2. Not of
God. For (1) It is not God that beleeveth, though it is true,
God is the firſt cauſe of all actions. (2.) Man is the</hi> cauſa ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,
<hi>between God and the action, and ſo ſtill man ſhould be ſaid
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55700:82"/>
to juſtifie himſelf. (3.) For (as</hi> Aquinas) <hi>the action of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
cauſe, and of the inſtrument is one action; and who dare ſay, that
faith is ſo Gods inſtrument? (4.) The inſtrument muſt have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
to the producing of the effect of the principal cauſe, by a proper
cauſality; &amp; who dare ſay that faith hath ſuch an influx into our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It is the inſtrument of man; and though man do not
juſtifie himſelf, yet he concurres as a willing, ready agent with
God in it; <hi>God is a juſtifier of thoſe that beleeve in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3.
26. <hi>God hath ſet Chriſt forth a propitiation through faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 25.
<hi>It is one God which ſhall juſtifie the circumciſion by faith, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion
through faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 30. And becauſe it is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of man in a work of this nature, it is alſo an inſtrument of
God. As ſome have obſerved a communication of Titles between
Chriſt and his Church: (the Church being called by his Name,) ſo
there is a communication of actions in theſe relative works; <hi>Chriſt
dwells in our hearts by faith,</hi> Eph. 3. 17. We believe, and not Chriſt,
and yet faith there is Chriſts inſtrument, whereby he takes up his
abode; <hi>God purifies the hearts of the Gentiles by faith,</hi> Acts 15. 17.
They beleeved, and not God, yet faith is Gods inſtrument in the
work of their purification; ſo on the other ſide, the Spirit is Gods
work, yet <hi>we by the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8. 13.
Man neither juſtifies nor ſanctifies himſelf, yet by faith he is raiſed
to cloſe with God in both;<note place="margin">Fides percipit juſtificationem, efficit ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem.</note> and ſo Faith as an inſtrument receives
righteouſneſs to juſtification, and therefore is called the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of faith which is our juſtification, and works ſanctification; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
you underſtand not the firſt work, which is properly rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
and precedent to faith, but the farther progreſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of it; <hi>The Spirit working faith,</hi> faith takes in a larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Spirit, <hi>John 7. 37. He that beleeveth on me, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſaith, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water; but this
he ſpake of the Spirit, which they that beleeve on him, ſhould receive.</hi>
The Spirit will do nothing without our faith, and our faith can
do nothing without the Spirit; Man cannot juſtifie himſelfe by
beleeving without God, and God will not juſtifie an unbeleeving
man. Faith then is the act of man; man beleeves, yet the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, that juſtifies onely beleevers; ſo that what is here
ſpoken by way of exception againſt faith as an inſtrument, holds
of efficients, and inſtruments ſole and abſolute in their work,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55700:82"/>
and cauſality. But where there is a concurrence of agents, and
one makes uſe of the act of another to produce the effect; that in
ſuch cauſality is wrought, it will not hold.</p>
                  <p>The promiſe or grant of the new Covenant in the Goſpel, is (inſted
of faith) made the inſtrument in the work of juſtification. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Gods, and not mans. It is the covenant of God, the Promiſe of
God, the Goſpel of God; but of it ſelfunable to raiſe man up to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
It is often tendred, and juſtification not always wrought; &amp;
ſo diſabled from the office of an inſtrument by <hi>Ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

A ſword is not an inſtrument of ſlaughter, where it ſlays not;
nor an axe an inſtrument to hew, where it cuts not: neither is the
Goſpel an inſtrument of juſtification, where it juſtifies not, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our faith, it never juſtifies. Where the Miniſter is a Miniſter of
condemnation, the ſavour of death to death, there the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
an inſtrument of condemnation and of death. The efficacy
that is in the Goſpel for juſtification, it receives by their faith to
whom it is tendred. <hi>Heb. 4. 2. Vnto us was the Goſpel preached as well
as unto them, but the Word preached did not profit them, not being mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with faith in them that heard it.</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 2, 13. <hi>You received not
the Word of God (which you heard of us) as the word of men, but (as it is
in truth) the Word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi>
So that the Goſpel in it ſelf conſidered, is wanting in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
aſſigned to an inſtrument, to have influx to the producing of
the effect of the principal cauſe by a proper cauſality; If none dare
ſay, faith hath ſuch an influx, they may much leſſe ſay, that the
Word hath ſuch an influx. The Goſpel is an outward inſtrument,
ſaith <hi>Ravanellus,</hi> Faith an inward; They both making up one inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
full and compleat, yet Faith is more aptly and fitly called an
inſtrument, Seeing that faith gives efficacy as an inſtrument to the
Word, the Word may be without Faith, and ſo no inſtrument at all;
but Faith always preſuppoſeth the Word of Promiſe, &amp; is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
its object. Therefore to wind up this whole diſpute, in which I
have ſtudied to be brief, though I fear ſome will think I have been
too tedious, Seeing that thoſe that make Faith the inſtrument in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
make the Goſpel an inſtrument likewiſe, and dare not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55700:83"/>
go about to ſtrip it of its honour. I hope that they that make the
Goſpel an inſtrument, will acknowledge Faith to be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in like manner; being in their efficacy as inſtruments ſo inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
joyned, and ſo all the controverſie may be fairely ended

You will ſay, (<hi>ſaith my Authour</hi>) what is paſſive receiving of
Chriſt? I anſwer, (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) A paſſive receiving of Chriſt, is juſt
ſuch a receiving of him, as when a froward Patient takes a purge, or

forceth his mouth open, and poures it downe his throat, and ſo it works
againſt his will, by the ever-ruling power of one over him, that knows
it is good for him: Thus I ſay, there is a paſſive recipiency
or receiving of Chriſt, which is the firſt receiving of him; when
Chriſt comes by the gift of the Father, to a perſon whileſt he is in the

eternal ſalvation, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 5 9. but only the publiſher, He was a
meſſenger from God, in the dayes of his fleſh, but no Saviour of
man; He did not redeeme us with a price, but only made known
that we were ſo farre in the love of God from eternity that no
redemption needs. Secondly, I ſay, Gods purpoſe of a thing
doth no put it in being; He takes his own way, to bring about
in time, that which he purpoſed before all time; All that is done,
even every work under the Sunne, was alike from eternity in the
purpoſe of God, <hi>Known unto God are all his works from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

day, was borne from eternity; We may as well ſay that the Elect
were glorified from eternity, ſo that they need to look after no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the works of God were in his purpoſe from ever, who ſees all

that juſtification of a ſinner is a tranſient, and no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent

Chriſt for our redemption, which Chriſt in the fulneſſe of time

for this Faith, for acceptation of this righteouſneſſe. By beleeving

Chriſt, they muſt draw from ſinne, and how ſhall any be drawn
from what he does not know; nor ever underſtood either to
be evil, or dangerous? It is with me no leſſe a Paradox,
that a man may be drawn from ſin, without the diſcovery of the
Law, as to be drawn to Chriſt without the light of the Goſpel,
And to ſay the Goſpel diſcovers ſin, as well as the Law; taking the

taken) is the greateſt abſurdity. <hi>Exem. gr.</hi> If it be queſtioned

<hi>That Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave ſinners. That the blood
of Chriſt takes away all ſin. That in him all that beleeve are juſtified.</hi>
A thouſand of theſe will contribute nothing to the expediting of
theſe or like queſtions; or the conviction of any under guilt;
The work muſt be brought to the rule, the action to the line for
diſcovery; Upon the Laws convictions there may follow Goſpel-aggravations;
But conviction is the work of the Law, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of the Spirit. This conviction unto change is hardly
without compunction, remorſe, and terrours in the ſoul. It was
not the ſingle caſe of the Corinthians, but common with other
Chriſtians, as the natural work of godly ſorrow, <hi>that it worketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance

I queſtion not Gods prerogative, I am upon enquiry after his

Jew, were not called by grace, before this call to an Apoſtleſhip?
and if not in grace, whether it neceſſarily followed in that inſtant?
The like is objected of <hi>Lydia, The Lord opened her heart, that

                  <p>1. An equal degree of ſorrow, and preparative work, is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

                  <p>2. An high degree is not neceſſarily required of any; God can
come ſooner in, with Goſpel-cordials, after Law-convictions, unto
one than another.</p>
                  <p>3. No man hath reaſon to quarrel his converſion; becauſe his
ſorrow hath not been like ſome others; each man hath not like
paine in cure of a like malady.</p>
                  <p>4. None ſhould beg of God overwhelming and amazing ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings;
and humiliations of Spirit, God better knows their frame
than they underſtand themſelves.</p>
                  <p>5. None can judge of the truth of their repentance by the
greatneſſe of their trouble; It may poſſibly end in horrour and
work nothing better than it ſelf; It may only have its preſent work
to caſt hell in the face, and then the perſon returne to his old
byaſſe, to his ſinful pleaſures, his worldly advantages, as <hi>Saul</hi>
to his Muſick, <hi>Cain</hi> to his building of Cities; yet when God thus
plowes, it is a hopeful ſigne he intends ſowing, and men in this
caſe muſt not reaſon themſelves to be ſuch ſoyle, on whom no
good can be done, as though they were paſt all husbandry of the
Lord, He can take away a heart of ſtone, and turne a rock into
a fruitful field. This is Gods method, do not diſpute, but believe.</p>
                  <p>6. Then it is in a degree ſufficient, when it effects the work for
which it ſerves; when it brings the ſoul out of love with ſin, takes
it out of the paths of ſinne, when it ſo works to an apprehenſion
of dangers, that it works the ſoul to caſt it ſelf on Chriſt Jeſus.
When horrours work deſires; not of eaſe, but of grace, of Chriſt
and of whole Chriſt, of pardon of ſin, and power againſt ſin, there
is a true work.</p>

For the eſſential parts of this grace, which I make a Goſpel-engagement
and condition of the covenant, they are privative,
or poſitive. Privative, is the deſtruction of what hath been. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
is the introduction of what is not. Every change hath two
termes. The one is <hi>terminus ad quem;</hi> which is endeavoured.
The other is <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> which is left; and ſo in this change
which grace works,<note place="margin">The eſſentials in repentance are, 1. Privative Ceſſation from ſinne.</note> and to which the covenant of grace doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.
The privative part which we are to leave, is, ſin, the work
of Satan. The poſitive part which we are to endeavour, is that
which ſtands in full oppoſition; Forſaking of ſin, we muſt follow
after righteouſneſſe, and turning from Satan, we muſt turne to
God; and therefore the Miniſtery which findes men out of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and works them into it, is to bring them from darkneſſe
to light, from the power of Satan to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. The
privative part is frequently enjoyned, as that which bindes at all
times, and to all times. A man in covenant with God, is to have
no more to do with ſin; <hi>Ceaſe to do evil, put away the evil of your
doings from before mine eyes,</hi> Iſa. 1. 16. <hi>Be ye ſeparate, touch no
unclean thing,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 17. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which
are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanneſſe, inordinate affection,
evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſſe, which is idolatry; for which
things ſake, the wrath of God cometh on the children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
In the which ye alſo walked ſometimes when ye lived in
them, But now you alſo put off all theſe, anger, wrath, malice, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
filthy communication out of your mouth; lie not one to another,
ſeeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds,</hi> Col. 3. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Old things with Chriſtians are to be done away; This is the
duty of all thoſe that pretend to Chriſt; <hi>Let every one that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the Name of Chriſt depart from iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. All that
is in Chriſt, is wholly againſt it; His Prophetick office leads us
from it, and gives us light to avoid it; In his Kingly office, his Law
is againſt it; and his Prieſtly office is to redeem from it. They
that are in Chriſt, and learn him as the truth is in Chriſt Jeſus,
attaine to it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 22. That ye put off <hi>concerning the former
converſation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
luſts.</hi> It is the character of a man in Chriſt, <hi>Gal. 5. 24.
They that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and luſts.</hi> And this upon peril of bearing their ſinne, <hi>Ezek.
18. 30, 31. Repent and turne your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55700:88"/>
ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine: Caſt away from you all your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
whereby you have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart
and a new ſpirit; for why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> No man
in ſinne is for glory, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9. Know ye not that the unrighteous
ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God? The works of the fleſh are manifeſt,
which are theſe, adultery, fornication, uncleanneſſe, laſciviouſneſſe, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
witchcraft, hatred, varience, emulation, wrath, ſtrife, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
hereſies, envyings, murders, drunkenneſſe, revellings and
ſuch like, of the which I tell you before, as I have alſo told you in time
paſt, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of
God,</hi> Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. Upon theſe termes it is that they obtaine
pardon of ſinne, <hi>Iſa. 55. 7. Let the wicked forſake his way, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him returne unto the Lord,
and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pardon.</hi> Grace is no where more freely tendred than there:
<hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath
no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without
money, and without price. Wherefore do ye ſpend money for that
which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not;
hearken diligently unto me, and eat you that which is good, and let
your ſoul delight it ſelf in faſtneſſe. Incline your ear, and come unto
me; hear and your ſoul ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with you, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David, <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2, 3. And
yet we ſee upon what termes it is tendered. That which keeps
from us the mercies, and brings upon us the curſes of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
is upon covenant-condition, to be ſhunned; This is true
of all covenants made where any good is hoped, and evil feared.
That ſinne againſt God keeps us from the mercies, and brings upon
us the curſes of the covenant, is clear in what hath been ſpoke:
<hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my ſtatutes, or that thou ſhould'ſt take
my covenant in thy mouth, ſeeing thou hast instruction, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
my words behinde thee?</hi> Pſal. 50. 16, 17. A people that keep
to their termes of covenant, are in communion with God; but
ſinne ſeparates between a people and God; that is the ground
of quarrel, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 1. between earth, and heaven. Men entring
and keeping covenant with God, are of God, and not of the
Devil; They are turned from the Devil to God, from fellowſhip
with <hi>Belial,</hi> to fellowſhip with God; <hi>But he that committeth ſin,
is of the Devil,</hi> 1 John 3. 8. Chriſt that carries on the covenant
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55700:89"/>
(as you have heard) will never caſt off thoſe that walk up to the
termes of the covenant; but he caſts off, with a dreadful ſentence
all thoſe that work iniquity; <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 23. As for thoſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian
ſpirits, and ranting wretches, that do contend that ſinne
is no barre to their communion with God; <hi>That God is as well
pleaſed with man in the greatest heighth of ſinne, as the most holy
duties; That this doctrine charges a change upon God, to be now
pleaſed, and preſently in wrath and diſpleaſure;</hi> they do but deceive
themſelves, and make it their work to deceive others. They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know ſin, nor the direful guilt of it, nor yet God, nor his
direful diſpleaſure againſt it. The Apoſtle makes it his buſineſſe
to undeceive them, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 6. having reckoned up a catalogue
of ſins, he thus ſpeaks; <hi>Be not deceived with vaine words, for becauſe
of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
Neither is there any change (according to this doctrine) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in God. The change is in them that covenant againſt it, and
walk in it. Did they know the terrour of it, they would tremble
at the thought of running upon it, and by heaping up ſin <hi>to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
up wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous
judgements of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. They will finde this an aggregate of
all miſeries, and let them take beed that they call not to the rocks
and mountains to hide them from it.</p>
                  <p>The Poſitive part is to be followed,<note place="margin">2. Poſitive. A returne to God, and an holy walking with him.</note> as the Privative part to
be ſhunned. As <hi>Timothy</hi> muſt <hi>flee covetouſneſſe,</hi> ſo he muſt <hi>follow
after righteouſneſſe, godlineſſe, faith, love, patience, meekneſſe,</hi>
1 Tim. 6. 11. Faith in the former place as an inſtrument ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for our acceſſe to God, makes up (as we heard) a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it ſelf, As a work or inherent grace, it is here compriſed in
this covenant-condition, together with others, to hold up our
communion with God. <hi>As we must ceaſe to do evil, ſo we must
learne to do well; As we must put off the old man with his deeds, ſo we
muſt put on the new man.</hi> It is not enough, not to bring evil fruit,
wilde grapes; but we muſt be <hi>fruitful in every good work.</hi> God
hath a quarrel with his people upon a charge of negatives, as well
as affirmatives, omiſſions, as well as commiſſions. <hi>She obeyed
not the voice, ſhe received not correction, ſhe truſted not in the Lord,
ſhe drew not neer to her God,</hi> Zeph. 3. 2. We muſt not alone, be
free, from that charge of Chriſt upon the Jews, <hi>of doing the work
of the Devil,</hi> John 8. 44. but we <hi>muſt abound in the work of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55700:89"/>
Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 58. And this upon the penalty mentioned in
the former branch; <hi>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit,
ſhall be hewen down and caſt into the fire,</hi> Matth. 3. 10. Upon theſe
termes it is, that we avoid the curſe of the covenant. Thoſe
on whom no condemnation is charged, <hi>walk not after the fleſh,
but after the Spirit; and the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
long-ſuffering, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, faith, meekneſſe, temperance,</hi>
Gal. 5. 21, 22. Upon thoſe termes, ſalvation, the mercy of the
covenant is obtained, <hi>Chriſt is the Authour of everlaſting ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. When the Apoſtle makes light
of outward priviledges, he puts the whole ſtreſſe upon mans faith
and obedience, Gal. 5. 6. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth
any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which worketh by
love. Circumciſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the
keeping of the Commandments of God,</hi> 1. Cor. 7. 19. That which is ſo
mightily available with God in covenant, is the walking up to the
terms and obſervance of the conditions of the covenant; But faith
and the keeping of the Commandments of God, are as we ſee) thus
available and prevalent. Theſe two are diſtinguiſhed, but never
ſevered. That faith which looks at Chriſts blood as a Saviour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
him as a Sovereign, and the latter about which there is moſt
diſpute, is an evidence to conclude the former; <hi>Hereby we know
that we know him, if we keep his Commandments,</hi> where knowledge
is put for faith, as appears in the context, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 3. Theſe are
heard of God in prayer, <hi>Joh. 9. 32. If any man be a worſhipper of God,
and doth his will, him he heareth. Whatſoever we aske, we receive of
him, becauſe we keep his Commandment, and do thoſe things that are
pleaſing in his ſight,</hi> 1 John 3. 22. Theſe are ſealed of God by his
Spirit, 1 <hi>John 3. 24. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth
in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the
Spirit which he hath given us.</hi> Theſe great mercies are for men in
covenant, that keep covenant: <hi>But the mercy of the Lord is from
everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him, and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
unto childrens children. To ſuch as keep his Covenant, and to thoſe
that remember his commandments to do them,</hi> Pſ. 103. 17, 18.</p>

So Mr.</hi> Baxters queſtioniſt, How do you make faith
and repentance, to be conditions of the Covenant on our part, ſeeing the
beſtowing of them, is part of the condition on Gods part; can they be our
conditions and Gods too?</p>
                  <p>In caſe theſe two cannot ſtand together,<note place="margin">The Objection retorted.</note> that they ſhould be

                     </label>
and I am ſure we have the better end of the ſtaffe, that
they are our conditions; They are conditions on our part, and
therefore they cannot be Gods: That they are ours, is made known
of God, as by the beame of the Sun in his Word. And I ſhall not
ſtand to diſtinguiſh of an abſolute and conditional covenant, that
ſo making the whole in the abſolute covenant to be Gods, and in
the conditional covenant, this part to be ours, which I know not
whether exactly underſtood,<note place="margin">Faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not Gods.</note> the Scripture will beare, but in plaine
terms deny that they are Gods conditions, and affirm them to be
ours. I know what God ſpeaks in his Word concerning theſe works;
<hi>That he will write his Law in our hearts, and put it into our inward
parts; That he will take away the heart of ſtone, and give an heart of
fleſh;</hi> which implies this work of which we ſpeak. I know likewiſe
what in particular is affirmed of Chriſt, that <hi>he is the authour and
finiſher of our faith,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. <hi>that he gives repentance,</hi> Acts 5. 31.
<hi>that God grants to the Gentiles repentance to life,</hi> Acts 11. 18. And
I have not forgot what I have ſaid before of the concurrence of
grace in the performance of every Goſpel-work; Yet all this riſes
not up hither to make them formally Gods act, &amp; not ours. Whoſe
acts they be, his conditions they are; this is evident: But they are
our acts. We beleeve, We repent, It is not God that believes; It is
not God that repents: That is an abſurdity which <hi>Arminians</hi> have
laboured to charge upon us, to render that which we hold of the
neceſſity of the concurrence of grace in theſe works odious; But it is
that which the Orthodox party have ſtill diſclaimed. The Apoſtle
calls upon the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Phil. 2. 12. <hi>To work out their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:55700:90"/>
the work is their own, as the ſalvation. They are a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
own act, and not barely a ſpontaneous act, (on which he
is carried, as a Bird in preparing a neſt for her young, and Bees
in preparing honey for their ſubſiſtence, in which Phyloſophy
tells us, that they aime at no end) but they are voluntary actions
of choice, done out of choice, aiming at ſalvation as his end. The
mercy in the Covenant being on theſe termes tendred, <hi>With the
heart man beleeveth unto righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 10. 10. <hi>The juſt
lives by his faith,</hi> Hab. 2. 4. <hi>They to turne to the Lord with all

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> not Gods. But the Apoſtle, ſome
may ſay, in the next words tells us, <hi>that it is God that works the
will and the deed,</hi> verſ. 13. There he ſeems to take them from us,
and aſcribe the formality of them to God.<note place="margin">Sol.</note> In this co-operation
of God, whether they be formally our works, or Gods, let <hi>Eſay</hi>
determine, <hi>Iſa. 26. 12. Thou haſt wrought all our works in us;</hi>
When God hath wrought it, the work is ours, we have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of it, and we ſhall beare our ſinne in caſe it be neglected,
and let the Apoſtle explaine himſelfe, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 10. We are his
workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God
hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
good works as a Chriſtians way and walk.<note place="margin">Via ad regnum non cauſa reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandi.</note> They are
charged upon man as is plain in the context, in order to ſalvation;
They are the way that we hold in our paſſage on to that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which God of grace vouchſafes; and we are Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
created in Chriſt Jeſus for theſe ends. Our dexterity in
holy duties,is from the frame into which grace put us; So ſtill
the work is ours, though power for action is vouchſafed of God,
And the conditions are ours, for diſcharge of which we have yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
aſſiſtance:<note place="margin">Arguments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing that Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are our conditions, and not Gods, in the proper conditional covenant.</note> That faith and repentance are our conditions, and
not Gods, take theſe arguments.</p>
                  <p>1. Thoſe conditions that are not mentioned in the proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
covenant, as from God, but required of God, from us,
are not Gods conditions, but ours, in that Covenant. This is
cleare; Being there expreſly required of us, and not ſo much as
mentioned, as from God; they cannot be his engagement, but
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55700:91"/>
ours to performe. But Faith and Repentance are not mentioned
as from God, in the proper conditional covenant, but required of
God from us. Therefore Faith, and Repentance are not
Gods conditions in the proper conditionall Covenant, but
ours.</p>
                  <p>2. The conditions of a covenant are his that performeth, and
not his that impoſeth. This propoſition is cleare in reaſon, and
confeſſed by the adverſary. But we perform, and God impoſeth
Faith and Repentance. They are therefore our conditions, and
not Gods, in this covenant.</p>
                  <p>3. Covenant-conditions are theirs, that are charg'd with
falſhood in caſe of failing in them, and non-performance of them.
This is plaine in all covenants: To make conditions, and to
faile in them, is to be falſe to them. But in caſe of failing in
Faith and Repentance, man is charged, and not God. God fails
not, but man deals falſly. Therefore, they are mans conditions,
and not Gods.</p>
                  <p>4. Covenant-conditions are theirs, who upon failing in them,
and not performance of them, ſuffer as covenant-breakers. This
is clear, <hi>Iſrael</hi> covenanted to diſmiſſe their Hebrew ſervants, and
diſmiſſed them not, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuffered for it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. But upon
failing in Faith and Repentance, God ſuffers not, ſo much as in
his Name, as a covenant-breaker. He is not charged with mens
unbelief and impenitence: Men themſelves ſuffer. Therefore Faith
and Repentance are mans conditions, not Gods.</p>
                  <p>2. There are objections peculiarly againſt repentance, as it
compriſes the whole frame of obedience,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> as before held forth to

                  </p>
                  <p>By this means the covenant of Grace will be (<hi>ſay ſome</hi>) a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works; Repentance in this latitude (to which we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
containes the whole of obedience, and being made a condition of the
Covenant of Grace, Works are introduced, and a Covenant of Works
re-eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>As there was grace in the firſt covenant,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> as you have heard,
which we call a covenant of Works; So works are not wholly
excluded from this covenant, which we call a covenant of
Grace. God ſtill keeps up his Sovereignty, as you have heard,
and how this can be done when he leaves man, at that wilde free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
not ſo much as to call for homage from him, cannot be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55700:91"/>
conceived, his rule even in this covenant, is to reward men <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their works. Behold I come quickly, and my reward it
with me; to give every man according as his work ſhall be,</hi> Rev. 22.
12. Works then are not excluded from this covenant; yea, Chriſt
the Mediatour of the covenant aforehand tells us, <hi>Except our
righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees,
ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> Matth. 5. 20.
They had their righteouſneſſe, and (as was ſuppoſed) they made
a great progreſſe in the way of righteouſneſſe; yet we muſt
have an exceeding righteouſneſſe, above that which they
taught, and practiſed, or elſe there is no ſalvation in this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Theſe two covenants notwithſtanding remaine diſtinct,
and not confounded together. There is a legal righteouſneſſe;
ſuch as the Law in the higheſt extremity of it requires, without the
leaſt indulgence in caſe of failing; This the covenant of Works
calls for, and in this we fall ſhort; but Chriſt anſwers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
He <hi>is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. <hi>and by
this,</hi> we are ſaved. There is a righteouſneſſe of the Goſpel which
God in covenant calls for, to which it is his Spirit enables, <hi>and in this</hi>
we are ſaved.</p>
                  <p>2. Goſpel-obedience is called for in the Covenant,<note place="margin">Repentance neceſſarily flowing from Faith, is not thereby diſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from being a condition in the Covenant of Grace.</note> but not as any
condition of the Covenant; Faith is the alone condition, obedience ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily flows from it, and follows upon it when once we believe; it need
not to be conditioned, or indented for; ſeeing when we are in Chriſt by
faith, we can then do no other than obey.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. This poſition here laid down, <hi>that obedience neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
follows, and flows from Faith,</hi> is a poſition indeed main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the reformed Churches againſt <hi>Papiſts, Arminians,
Socinians,</hi> and other oppoſites of it, from which poſition of
ours, they inferre as by neceſſary conſequence that all commands,
requiring obedience, are then needleſſe, and all exhortations,
reproofs, motives and promiſes to no purpoſe. None either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
or perſwades the Heavens to move, the Sunne to give
light, the Fire to give heat, or the water to give moiſture; That
which neceſſarily works is let alone to work, and to take its courſe
in working. And this Objection (taking away this Goſpel-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
on this ground) is of the ſame ſtamp; Obedience neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
flowing from Faith, includes Goſpel-commands, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
reproofs, as well as Goſpel-conditions. If God need
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55700:92"/>
not, to condition, and engage for obedience, from Beleevers,
becauſe they thus neceſſarily obey, then he needs not give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
or preſſe obedience for the ſame reaſon, when yet the
Goſpel is full of exhortations, commands, menaces, promiſes, with
application to Beleevers, to men profeſſing Faith, to men in Chriſt
by Faith.</p>
                  <p>For ſatisfaction then of this Popiſh-Arminian objection, we
muſt diſtinguiſh of conſequents which neceſſarily flow from
their principles. Some are natural, which of themſelves have
their effects, as thoſe in the objection mentioned; Here is
neither command impoſed, condition required, nor promiſe held
forth: They are not in any capacity of acting or working o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
than they do. Others are moral, who work not by
way of Phyſical neceſſity, but are kept in their way by the power
of grace upholding; which does not exclude, but neceſſarily takes
in mans endeavour in the uſe of meanes, to yeeld obedience, and to
hold on, in all patience and perſeverance. This argument follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
home will be of equal force, againſt Faith (as a condition) as,
againſt ſincerity; ſeeing Gods Elect ſhall beleeve, as they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
ſhall yeeld obedience. There is a like neceſſity of faith, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from election, as there is of obedience, to flow from Faith,
as Faith therefore, ſo obedience, either of both in their places are
covenant-conditions.</p>

not ſlothfully, and againſt heart, but diligently,
and cheerfully, grieving from the heart if any

So that ſome might think, all controverſie in this point, may
ceaſe; and that the difference between us, were no more than a
ſtrife of words, ſeeing we do not only confeſſe that this ought
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55700:93"/>
to be done, but alſo urge a neceſſity of doing of it, and they ſay
the Law is fulfilled when it is done,<note place="margin">The Law a rule of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not of our ſtrength.</note> But here, 1. Much wrong is
done to the Law (as though it were a rule of our ſtrength, not of
our duty, that it anſwered, and might be applied to each mans
impaired ſtrength, and weakened abilities, or that the Goſpel-grace
of godly ſorrow for ſin againſt the Law, were the keeping
of the Law, making repentance a ſatisfactory diſcharge, for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience;
When theſe men cannot bring up mans nature to the
ſtreight line of the Law, they bring down the Law to the crooked
nature of man. 2. It is injurious to man, puffing him up with
conceit of anſwering the Law, ſetting him up as high as he ſhould
be laid low, ready to ſay with the young man in the Goſpel, <hi>All
theſe have I kept from my youth,</hi> when holding out the Law in its
juſt latitude, (as it was happily brought home to the Apoſtles
conſcience) ſin would revive, and he would ſee himſelfe in a loſt
condition.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond opinion is,<note place="margin">The Covenant of Grace doth not cal for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſincerity.</note> that the covenant of grace requires per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the exacteſt way, without help of theſe mens diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in an equal degree with the covenant of works, but with
this difference; In the covenant of works there is no indulgence
or diſpenſation in caſe of failing, but the penalty takes hold the
curſe follows upon it; But the covenant of grace, though it call
for perfection, ſuch is the exactneſſe of it, yet it accepts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, ſuch is the qualification of it through grace, or the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in it. If I ſhould take up any opinion in the world for the
Authours ſake, or thoſe that have appeared as Patrons of it, then
I ſhould embrace this; The reverence deſervedly due to him that
(I ſuppoſe) firſt maniſted himſelf in it, hath cauſed it to finde
great entertainment, but upon more than twenty yeares
thoughts about it; I finde it labouring under manifold incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences.</p>
                  <p>1. It eſtabliſhes the former opinion oppoſed by Proteſtants, and
but now refuted, as to the obedience and the degree, called for
in covenant; And if I ſhould be indulgent to my affections, to
cauſe my judgement to ſtoop, Diſlike of the one, would make me
as averſe from it; as an opinion of the other would make me prone
to receive it. Judgement therefore muſt lead, and affections
be waved.</p>
                  <p>2. If this opinion ſtand, then God accepts of Covenant-breakers,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55700:94"/>
of thoſe that deale falſely in it, whereas Scripture
charges it only upon the wicked, upon thoſe of whom God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines,
as rebellious, <hi>Deut. 29. 25. Joſh. 7. 15. Jeremy 11. 10.
Jeremy</hi> 22. 8, 9. Yea, it may be charged on the beſt, the
moſt holy in the world lying under the guilt of it, according to
this tenent.</p>
                  <p>3. Then it will follow, that, as none can ſay, that they have
ſo anſwered the commands of the Law, that they have never
failed, they have not (if put to anſwer in the greateſt rigour)
once tranſgreſſed, ſo, neither can they with the Church make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to God, <hi>That they have not dealt falſely in the Covenant,
nor wickedly departed from their God,</hi> Pſal. 44. 17. Every ſinne (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this opinion) being a breach of it, and a dealing falſely
in it.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Then that great promiſe of</hi> mercy from everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
upon them that fear him, and his righteouſneſſe, unto chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
children to ſuch as keep his Covenant, and to thoſe that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his Commandments to do them, <hi>Pſalme 103. 17, 18. only apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
to thoſe that ſo keep the Law, that they ſinne not at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Then our Baptiſm-vow is never to ſin againſt God, and as
often as we renew our covenant, we do not only humble our
ſelves that we have ſinned, but we afreſh binde our ſelves, never
more to admit the leaſt infirmity, and ſo live and die in the breach
of it.</p>
                  <p>6. Then the diſtinction between thoſe that entered covenant
and broke it, as <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31, 32, 33. and thoſe that have the Law
written in their hearts, and put into their inward parts to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it, falls, all ſtanding equally guilty of the breach of it, no
help of grace being of power to enable to keep Covenant. Each
of theſe five laſt arguments are replyed to, by a diſtinction of the
precept, and conditions of the Covenant. Men that are ſincere,
break the precept, (as is ſaid) but not the conditions. But I
know no precepts in covenants, which are not conditions. Faith
and Repentance are Precepts, and I think, the alone Precepts,
and I know not, neither do I heare of, any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
                  <p>7. Then it follows that, Sincerity is never called for as a duty,
or required as a grace; but only diſpenſed with as a failing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55700:94"/>
as a want. It is not ſo much a Chriſtians honour or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
as his blemiſh or failing, rather his defect than praiſe. But
we finde the contrary in <hi>Noah, Job, Aſa, Hezekiah, Zachary</hi>
and <hi>Elizabeth, Nathaniel,</hi> an Iſraelite indeed that entered cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and kept covenant. Sincerity is a degree towards perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in obedience, and if the command looks no lower than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in degree, the imperfect degree is not commanded, though
it be indulged. And therefore I conclude, that, as in the
Law, there was pure juſtice as well in the command given, as
the penalty threatened, without any condeſcenſion or indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
So, in the covenant there is mercy, and condeſcenſion,
as well in the condition required, as in the acceptance
through grace. The Covenant requires no more than it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
                  <p>The alone Argument,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> ſo farre as ever I could learn, that hath
brought ſome of reverend eſteeme heretofore into this opinion, is
That if the covenant requires not exact perfection, in the ſame
height as the Law calls for it, then a Chriſtian may fall ſhort of
the Law in his obedience, and not ſin, perfection being not call'd
for from him, nor any more called for from him, than through
grace he doth performe, he riſes as high as his rule, and ſo ſins not
through any imperfection, therefore to make it out that a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
imperfections are his ſins, it muſt needs be, that the covenant
requires perfection, as to make good that he may be ſaved in his
imperfections; it muſt be maintained that it accepts ſincerity.
But this argument is not of weight, Chriſt entering a Goſpel-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with man,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> findes him under the command of the Law,
which command, the Law ſtill holds, the Goſpel being a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
not a deſtruction of it. All imperfection then is a ſinne
upon that account, that it is a tranſgreſſion of the Law, though
(being done againſt heart, and laboured againſt) it is no breach
of covenant; We are under the Law as men, we are taken into
covenant as Chriſtians, Retaining the humane nature, the Law
ſtill commands us, though the covenant in Chriſt, through the
abundant grace of it, (upon the termes that it requires and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts)
frees us from the ſentence of it.</p>
                  <p>Here is objected, <hi>What ſhall we think of thoſe Texts in the New
Teſtament, which require us to be perfect,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 11. James 1. 4.
<hi>Yea, perfect as God is perfect,</hi> Matth. 5. 48. <hi>reproving weakneſſe and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55700:95"/>
infirmity, and commanding a going on to perfection. Anſw.</hi> We
are to think of them as Proteſtant D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vines, ordinarily do in their
commenting upon them; <hi>We deny,</hi> ſaith <hi>Rivet, that the perfection
of which Scripture ſpeaks, either when it commands us to be perfect,
or gives teſtimony of perfection, or integrity to ſome, conſists in a
freedome from ſinne,</hi> Exercit. 52. in <hi>Geneſ.</hi> pag. 267. The Text
quoted out of <hi>James,</hi> ſerves well to explaine the reſt, <hi>Let patience
have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting
nothing,</hi> whence we may argue, 1. That perfection which
Chriſtians may attaine, is the perfection that the Apoſtle calls
unto, This is plaine in the text, He calls for perfection, that we
may be perfect: But Chriſtians can reach no further a degree in
perfection than ſincerity; Therefore the Apoſtle calls onely to
ſincerity. 2. That is the Apoſtles meaning, where he ſpeaks of
perfection, that himſelf gives in as his meaning; This is cleare, he
is the beſt interpreter of himſelf; But he expreſſes himſelfe by
<hi>perfect</hi> there to mean <hi>entire,</hi> or <hi>lacking nothing.</hi> A perfection of
entireneſſe, or integrality then he meanes, a perfection of parts,
and not of degrees. For that text of <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 13. 11. Finally
brethren, farewell, be perfect, &amp;c.</hi> let us compare with it, that
which he teſtifies of ſome in <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 6. <hi>Howbeit we
ſpeak wiſdome among them that are perfect,</hi> that is, thoſe that have
a right, and more full underſtanding of Goſpel myſteries, put
in oppoſition to the weakneſſe of novices, which perfection is,
(according to the Apoſtle) the way to unity of judgement. As
for the Text, <hi>Mat. 5. 48. Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father
which is in Heaven is perfect,</hi> If it be ſtreined to the higheſt,
it calls for a divine increated perfection, our adverſaries then
muſt yeeld, that there is a <hi>ſicut ſimilitudinis, non aequalitatis,</hi> in
that place. And if the context be conſulted, we ſhall finde, that
it is oppoſed to that half hypocritical-righteouſneſſe, which was
found in Scribes and Phariſees; which all muſt exceed that enter
into the Kingdome of heaven. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. a novice-like
imperfection in knowledge, is reproved; and a further growth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
perfection is called for; It is further objected, <hi>If perfection
were not the duty of a Chriſtian, and unperfectneſſe, and infirmity
his ſinne, why doth the Apoſtle groane, and grieve under the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his natural infirmities, and preſſe on to perfection,</hi> Rom.
7. 14. to the 24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 14? The concluſion here is granted;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55700:95"/>
The one is a duty, the other is a ſinne, and becauſe of failing in the
one, and the burden of the other, the Apoſtle groanes. Foreſeeing
that this would be yeelded him, there is added by way of objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Or is ſuch unperfectneſſe a ſinne, onely in reference to the rule of
the Law, and not the rule of the Goſpel, or that the Law doth, but
the Goſpel doth not call for perfection? Anſw.</hi> There is not one rule
of the Law, as I have demonſtrated at large, and another of the
Goſpel, ſeeing the Goſpel eſtabliſhes the Law; Onely the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-covenant,
calls for thoſe ſincere deſires, which grace works, to
conform us in our meaſure of the rule of the Law.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a third opinion, which I may well doubt whether
I underſtand; but ſo farre as I do underſtand, I am as farre from
aſſent to it, as, either of the former, and that is of thoſe who do
not only aſſert a perſonal inherent righteouſneſſe, as well as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
againſt the Antinomians; But alſo affirm that this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
is compleat and perfect, which if it were meant onely
of the perfection of the ſubject;<note place="margin">Our Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> as oppoſed to hypocriſie, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation,
or doubleneſſe, implying that they do not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for God; but are really for him, that they do not turne to
him feignedly (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſometimes charged, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 3. 10.)
but with an upright heart, or of the perfection, or entireneſſe of
the object, reſpecting not one, or only ſome, but all command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which is called a perfection of parts, we might readily
aſſent to it. The covenant calls for ſuch perfection, <hi>Gen. 17. 1.
Walk before me, and be thou perfect,</hi> and many have their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in Scripture, that they have attained to it, as <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 7. 9.
<hi>Job,</hi> Job 1. 1. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Eſay 38. 3. But a perfection above theſe
is maintained, a perfection compleat and full, <hi>Righteouſneſſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies</hi>
(as is ſaid) <hi>a conformity to the Rule; and a conformity with
a</hi> quatenus, <hi>or an imperfect rectitude, is not a true conformity or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude
at all: imperfect righteouſneſſe is not righteouſneſſe, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe.
It is a contradiction in adjecto,</hi> though holineſſe
be acknowledged to be imperfect <hi>in all reſpects, where perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is expected, in reference to the degree that it ſhould obtaine,
or the degree which it ſhall obtaine, or in reference to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
object, about which it is exerciſed, or in reference to the old
covenant, or the directive, and in ſome ſenſe the preceptive part of

materially conſidered is holineſſe, and therefore thus imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55700:96"/>
but formally conſidered, it is perfect righteouſneſſe, or none,
this not in relation to the old rule, but the new Covenant;</hi> Upon
this account, they are charged to diſcover groſſe ignorance, that
uſe and underſtand the word righteous, and righteouſneſſe, as
they relate to the old rule, as if the godly were called righteous
(beſides their imputed righteouſneſſe) only becauſe their ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and good works have ſome imperfect agreement with
the Law of Works; This, and much more to aſſert, a perſonal
perfect inherent righteouſneſſe, as is ſaid; all which as it is here
held out to me, is new, and I muſt confeſſe my ſelf in ignorance
all over; I never took imperfect righteouſneſſe to imply any ſuch
contradiction, no more than imperfect holineſſe. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> I am
ſure, ſaith, <hi>All our righteouſneſſe are as filthy rags,</hi> Eſay 64. 6. No
greater charge of imperfection can lie againſt the moſt imperfect
holineſſe, than the Prophet lays upon our righteouſneſſe. Neither
do I underſtand, how holineſſe ſhould be imperfect, taken mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially,
and righteouſneſſe perfect, taken formally in reference to a
rule. We may (for ought I know) as well make holineſſe formal,
and refer it to a rule, and righteouſneſſe material, in an abſolute
conſideration, without reference to any rule at all. And in ſuch
conſideration I do not know how there can be perfection or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
either in holineſſe or righteouſneſſe; it is as they come
up to, or fall ſhort of the rule that they have, the denomination
of perfection or imperfection. <hi>Pauls</hi> Goſpel-frame, whether
you will call it righteouſneſſe, or holineſſe, is ſet out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.
full of imperfection, yet all this, as in reference to the rule, as
it anſwered or fell ſhort in conformity to it, <hi>verſe 22. I delight in
the Law of God after the inward man.</hi> And whereas a charge of
ignorance, is laid even upon learned Teachers; that commonly
underſtand the word righteouſneſſe, and righteous as it referres
to the old rule, I profeſſe my ſelf to have little of their learning,
but I am wholly theirs in this ignorance. I know no other rule
but the old rule; the rule of the Moral Law that is with me, a
rule, a perfect rule, and the only rule. The perfection of this
holineſs and righteouſneſs in mans integrity, ſtood in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
conformity to this Law, and the reparation of this in our
regenerate eſtate (in which the Apoſtle places the image of God)
muſt have reference as to God for a patterne, ſo to his Law as a
rule. As an image carrying an imperfect reſemblance of its
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55700:96"/>
ſamplar, is an image, So conformity imperfectly anſwering
the rule is conformity likewiſe. A perfection of ſufficiency to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the end I willingly grant, God condeſcending through
rich grace to crown weak obedience, in this ſenſe our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
hath its perfectneſſe; otherwiſe I muſt ſay that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
righteouſneſſe is an imperfect righteouſneſſe, in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
conformity to the rule of righteouſneſſe, and without
thir reference to the rule there is neither perfection nor imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in any action. See Doctor <hi>Davenant</hi> diſputing againſt

                     <hi>In the laſt place I ſhall conclude that</hi> ſincerity, <hi>in the way and
work of God, (which Scripture alſo calls by the name of</hi> truth,

of God,<note place="margin">The Covenant of grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and acc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts ſincerity.</note> whole and unfeigned) <hi>is that which the covenant of
grace doth require, and that which it accepteth; This God in
covenant gives in charge, and this he rewards and crownes.
The Law ſtands as a rule, and the charge in it, is, the higheſt top
of perfection, without the leaſt indulgence in any caſe of failing,
ſuitable to the abilities that once were put into our hands, God
in Goſpel-condeſcenſions, will have this rule eyed; with a ſingle
and upright heart univerſally eyed, and obſerved, both in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
from ſin, and in our application to God in new obedience.</hi>

God in covenant, and through grace accepted. And as faith
(which as we have heard is the other new covenant-condition)
brings us into communion with God; So this of a ſincere heart and
walk, holds in communion, Faith gives acceſſe to God in grace,
and through ſincerity we walk with God in grace, to glory; Both
of them are called for of God, both accepted with God, and both
of them crowned with glory. That in this degree obedience is
both required, and accepted, in the Goſpel is evident. This
where oever it is, God obſerves and eyes.</hi> 2 Chron. 16. 9. For the

but by the grace of God we have had our converſation in the world.
<hi>Yea, this is a mark of him who is entirely the Lords, profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

not ſeek him.</hi> Math. 15. 8. This people draweth nigh unto me

lied unto him with their tongues, for their hearts were not right with

ſuppoſe it is evident that God in covenant calls for obedience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires

Rom. 15. 20. A people thus brought into covenant, do not
alwayes come up to the termes of the covenant; All covenanters
keep not covenant, their hearts are not ſteady in it; Therefore
there is no leſſe neceſſity of a Miniſtery, in eſtabliſhed Churches,
to keep up a people in Covenant with God, through the termes
of the covenant to bring them to the happineſſe promiſed, Theirs
is the work of watering, of building on anothers foundation, of
preaching Chriſt, where Chriſt before, at leaſt was known by
name, and in ſome ſort profeſſed. That there was ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
in the Church of the Jews, to teach <hi>Jacob his Laws, and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael

Their firſt work in laying the firſt foundation, is given in charge
in theſe words, <hi>Diſciple all Nations,</hi> which was not the work of

of yeeres, is not yet done; Thoſe that are learned in Geography
ſay, that there is not above the nineteenth part of the inhabited
world, that beares the name of Chriſtian, and a great part of thoſe
ſo over-runne with Barbariſme, that they have little more than a

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Saeculi</hi> being taken in ſo various an acception in the
holy Scriptures; yet the ſubject matter whereon it is ſpoken, is
a work of more laſting (as hath been obſerved) than one age, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the phraſe annext; <hi>The conſummation or finiſhing,</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſignifies that this promiſe is for perpetuity till Chriſts coming
at the end of ages<note n="*" place="margin">There was an end of ages at Chriſts firſt coming, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. There ſhall be an end of ages at his ſecond coming. See <hi>Gomarus Tom. 2. p.</hi> 530.</note>. That which puts a period to the Lords Supper,
muſt alone put a period to this work; And for any to make a
promiſe to a dying man, ready to yeeld up the ghoſt, for help
for many years, who is but to live few yeares, were a ſtrange
promiſe; And to ſettle a function of the Miniſtery with a promiſe
of aſſiſtance through all ages, when it muſt be extinct in that age,
were as ſtrange a promiſe. A promiſe to a Non-entity, or meere
<hi>Chimara.</hi> Miniſters then are in the Church as Starres, not as
Meteors; they grow as Plants, not as Muſhromes, their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is not for a yeare, for an age, but through all
ages.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this appeares by the Apoſtles care for a ſucceſſion,
Being not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of death, they took care
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55700:100"/>
for others to fill up their places; in the Churches which they had
planted. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> (called, not by man, but by a viſion and
voice from heaven) gives order for a Miniſterial call by Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Giving charge to <hi>Titus,</hi> Tit. 1. 5. <hi>to ordaine Elders in every
City,</hi> and this by <hi>laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,</hi> 1 Tim.
4. 14. to whom the care of Church-inſpection was by him
committed, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 17. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 28. And <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas</hi> in their journal, <hi>Acts 14. 23. Ordained Elders in every
Church, and recommended them to God with prayer and faſting,</hi> of
which more afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this appears in the ſetled Paſtors, which were found
in conſtituted, eſtabliſhed Churches. <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> in <hi>Philippi,</hi>
Philip. 2. 25. <hi>Archippus</hi> in <hi>Coleſſes,</hi> Col. 4. 17. Thoſe of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
which gave the Apoſtles meeting at <hi>Miletum,</hi> Acts 20. 17.
<hi>John</hi> who lived longeſt of the Apoſtles, and wrote his Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards the ending of his dayes in the Iſſle of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> Rev. 1.
9. in his baniſhment there for the teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi>
writes ſeveral Epiſtles to the Angels, of the ſeveral reſpective
Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> which Angels were to be his ſurvivors, and are
not denied by any, to be Miniſters of thoſe ſeveral City-churches
there mentioned, Whether theſe Churches were ſuch as have
been called Dioceſan, Presbyterial, or Congregational, is not here
to be queſtioned, but that they were Miniſters appointed over their
ſeveral charges, is out of queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly, This appeares by the charge given for reſpect and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
to be given to thoſe who thus ſtood up in ſucceſſion in ſuch
eſtabliſhed Churches,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 12, 13. We beſeech you, brethren,
to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord,
and admoniſh you, and to eſteeme them very highly in love for their
works ſake. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2 29. Receive him therefore in the Lord with all
gladneſſe, and hold ſuch in reputation. Obey them that have the rule
over you, and ſubmit your ſelves; for they watch for your ſouls, as they
that muſt give an account, that they may do it with joy, and not
with grief, for that is unprofitable for you, <hi>Heb. 13. 17. Theſe
were not to be reviled, railed upon; but reverenced, honoured
and obeyed; and an Order not in being, is not to be thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, it appeares by the Ordinance of the Lord Jeſus for
their liveli-hood and ſubſiſtence, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 13, 14. Do ye not know
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55700:100"/>
that they which Miniſter about holy things, live of the things of
the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers
with the Altar? Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which
preach the Goſpel; ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> Here we finde three
things implied. 1. That there was a particular order of men in the
time of the Law, ſeparated by God for the Miniſterial work, and
deſigned by his eſpecial appointment for that buſineſſe. 2. That
there is a proportionable Ordinance of Chriſt in Goſpel-times of
ſelect men for that buſineſſe. 3. That maintenance by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
was deſigned, as for one, ſo for both in their reſpective
times and ſucceſſion.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, It is farther cleared, by that hand of Providence,
that hath anſwerably provided in all ages, men for this work, in a
conſtant ſucceſſion. No age ſince the Apoſtles, have wanted them,
I ſay not that there was a Miniſtery in every age, in equal purity
and luſtre, yet all ages held up that order, and Papacy, when the
Minſtery was laid moſt low, found out thoſe that were faithful
to Chriſt Ieſus. Some ſet Providence ſo high, that they make it
a rule of life, as well, as, Scriptures; Me thinks it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that it gives ſome light to doubtful Scriptures, The analogy
of faith being held firme, ſomewhat may be gathered from it.
To give inſtance in thoſe Scriptures which ſeeme to beare witneſſe
of a glorious call of the Iewes, which moſt receive, and ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
God ſo ordering by providence, that in the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſo many ages, they ſtill continue a diſtinct people, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from others not joyning in their worſhip, but retaining
ſtill their own; and keeping up the Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when no ſuch thing can be ſaid of any captivated diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
people, it ſeemes to ſpeak that they wait for, and as it were,
expect when <hi>the vaile may be taken off; that they may returne to
the Lord.</hi> But here, providence ſeconding ſuch clear Texts of
Scripture, ſuch that leave not a doubt behinde them unleſſe men
ſhut their eyes againſt the Sunne, may ſure be acknowledged to be
an additional demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>For reaſons of the neceſſity of ſuch an eſtabliſhed Miniſtery to
be continued in conſtituted Churches.<note place="margin">Reaſons evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a neceſſity of ſuch an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The Church of God is to continue, and have its abode
through all ages of the world; as long as a world is to continue,
ſo long a Church is to continue, in which God may have glory
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55700:101"/>
by Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 21. and therefore compared to a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
as for eminence, ſo for continuance, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 125. 1. to an
houſe built by Chriſt himſelf on a rock, againſt which the gates
of hell ſhall not prevaile. Now a Miniſtery and a Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſeparated; It is of the integrality, if not of the eſſence
of it. A Church ſetled by a Miniſtery, may continue being for ſome
time, though in much imperfection, without a Miniſtery, but will
ſoon be without being. This is confeſt of all that would hold up
a Church in being; whether Epiſcopal, Independent, or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.
They that would level a Miniſtery (which is the work
of many) would level all Churches upon earth alſo. They
would drive God from off the earth, and lay his glory in
the duſt.</p>
                  <p>2. There muſt be intercourſe between God and his people,
between earth and heaven in all ages. It ſhall at no time be
truly ſaid with thoſe Apoſtates, <hi>Ezek. 8. 12. The Lord hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
the earth.</hi> Now there muſt be men deſigned, Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
appointed to carry on this work. As the Prieſts in the Law
were ordained for men in things appertaining to God, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1.
So the Miniſters of the Goſpel have a parallel inſtitution in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. God in no age carries it on in an immediate
way and manner.</p>
                  <p>3. Take away this Ordinance of a Miniſterial function, and all
ſpiritual miſeries to an utter confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> will preſently and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
follow. Firſt, <hi>Ignorance,</hi> all ſpiritual darkneſſe and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
As the ſetting of the Sunne brings darkneſſe upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
ſo the abſence of a Miniſtery brings darkneſſe upon the
Church. <hi>They are the light of the world,</hi> Matth. 5. 14. John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
<hi>was a burning light,</hi> John 5. 35. Paul <hi>was ſent to bring a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from darkneſſe to light,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. Their Miniſtery
is called a <hi>Viſion,</hi> without them men are without light. It is the
higheſt of contradictions to cry up light, and cry down a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
function. Secondly, <hi>Wickedneſſe;</hi> this follows from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
<hi>If a man walk in the night he ſtumbleth,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour)
<hi>becauſe there is no light in him,</hi> John 11. 10. An ignorant man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be above a wicked man, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 18. Alienated from the life
of God by reaſon of their ignorance that is in them:</hi> As that Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
(which the wiſe man brings in complaining, <hi>that he had not obeyed
the voice of his Teachers) was almoſt in all the evil in the midſt of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55700:101"/>
Aſſembly,</hi> Prov 5. 12. So, they may ſay that want Teachers;
<hi>Blinde places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty,</hi> Pſal.
74. 20. Thirdly, <hi>Errour, Hereſie, Blaſphemy.</hi> This is evident.
1. In Reaſon. Men that want a guide muſt needs go aſtray,
Sheep without a Shepherd, cannot long hold their walk. The
Apoſtle knew, <hi>that after his departure, ravening wolves would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe,
not ſparing the flock,</hi> Acts 20 29. What a Wolf is to the flock,
that a ſeducer is to the Church. Theſe waited the opportunity of
the Apoſtles abſence; Smite the Shepherd, and the ſheep will be
ſcattered; when there is no ſhepherd in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> every man does that
which is right in his own eyes, as when there is no King in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
2. By Experience, What groſſe opinions in worſhip did the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
entertaine in <hi>Moſes</hi> his fourty days abſence from them?
Let us go no further than our ſelves, Since a Miniſtery in <hi>England</hi>
was blaſted, and men made it their honour to revile and reproach
it; how fruitful have we been in thoſe monſters, from the loweſt
ſtep of Semiſeparation, to the higheſt pitch of Rantiſme? which
hath occaſioned all thoſe atteſtations to the truth of Chriſt Jeſus
againſt Errours, Hereſies, and Blaſphemies of this time, from
the Miniſters of Chriſt, in moſt parts of this Nation. Jeſus Chriſt
leaving not himſelf without witneſſe, In which we may ſee liſts of
them unto trembling amazement. But if we cannot ſee it at
home, let us heare of it from abroad, from the penne of a
Proteſtant Divine, making obſervation of the ſtate of the Church
in <hi>England,</hi> gives this ſad, and too true report unto the world:

Hath Chriſt any thing that he may enjoy unqueſtioned among
us? As he may not have an Embaſſadour, ſo he muſt not enjoy
a Day, or an Ordinance, not ſo much as his Deity among us.
3. If neither Reaſon nor experience, will ſerve to convince us,

is eſtabliſhment of Saints againſt Errours. And it is not the

that errour may be introduced, and Hereſies planted, we muſt
not look to be ſecure from Seducers, longer than a Miniſtery
ballaſts us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is objected that in New Teſtament-times,</hi>

there unfolds them; and as the event to thoſe that live in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
in the Church, cleares them. The rigid adhering to the
letter of myſtical prophecies, hath brought many into dangerous
ſnares. This holds the Jews in blindneſſe, Looking after a
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi> with a temporal rule and power, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no other. This cauſed many in Chriſts time, to expect <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>
in perſon, and not to regard <hi>John,</hi> who came in the power and
Spirit of <hi>Elijah.</hi> This holds thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that
they ſee not that Antichriſt, who oppoſeth Chriſt in a myſtery,
but expect one that oppoſeth Chriſt openly. And let others take
heed, that it do not deceive them, while they look after a perſonal

by <hi>Joel</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 16. There is a ſingular analogy
between Scripture-ſignes, and the thing ſignified; whether
ordinary in Sacraments, or extraordinary in Viſions. This ſhews
in what manner, and way, the Spirit is communicated, in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,

will not ſerve for both; It will ſet up an unconditional covenant,
but it will not deſtroy New Teſtament-Ordinances; Others will
have it ſerve both, when the truth is aright underſtood, it ſerves for

                  <p>The two firſt branches of the former anſwer will give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

overthrow of mutual conferences, Chriſtian communion for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
edification, than the Miniſterial power. The Text is, not
that ye ſhall have no more Teachers in publick; <hi>But they ſhall
teach no more every man his brother, and every man his neighbour; for
every one ſhall know him, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtles charge, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16.
flies full in the face of this Interpretation, <hi>Let the Word of Chriſt
dwell in you plenteouſly in all wiſdome, ſpeaking to one another,</hi> This
Prophecie is ſo ſtreined, that there is no need of ſuch admonition,
nor any uſe of brotherly exhortations. Certainly neither of theſe
inferences from this Prophecie, were in the Apoſtles thoughts,
when he exhorted the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 11. <hi>Comfort
your ſelves together, and edifie one another, even as alſo ye do,</hi>
adding in the next verſes: <hi>And we beſeech you brethren to know them
which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh
you, and to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake, &amp;c.</hi>
The councel had been more ſutable, to have bid them to have
ceaſed this mutual conſolation, and edification; And, as for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are high, in ſetting up, all for Teachers, and will have liberty of
prophecie promiſcuous, can with face urge this Text, The letter
of it being againſt, <hi>brother and brother, neighbour and neighbour,
teaching one another,</hi> and not againſt a Miniſterial way for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>3. For the full interpretation of the words, that of King <hi>James</hi>
muſt be acknowledged; In myſtical prophecies, it is farre more
eaſie to confute an abſurd interpretation; than finde out a true
one. One that joynes in the former part, to eſtabliſh an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional

ſome phantaſtick ſpirits,</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from hence to aboliſh all outward preaching
of the Word, as though in the Kingdom of Christ
it were ſuperfluous, their madneſſe may eaſily be
anſwered. This is their objection:</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>After the coming of Chriſt a man ought not to
teach his neighbour; let an outward Miniſtery
then be gone, and give way to an inward in pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But they paſſe that by</hi> (ſaith our Author)
<hi>that in the Prophet which is chiefly worthy of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;
The Prophet doth not deny that one
ſhould teach another, but theſe are his words;
They ſhall not teach one another, ſaying, Know
the Lord; as though he ſhould ſay, ſuch ignorance
ſhould not poſſeſſe the minds of men as heretofore,
that they ſhould not know who the Lord is, for
we know there is a twofold uſe of teaching. Firſt,
That thoſe that were altogether ignorant, may
begin with the firſt elements; and afterwards
that they that are thus entered, may make a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55700:104"/>
progreſſe. Therefore when Christians as long as they live ought
to learn, there is none ſo wiſe, but need to be taught, ſo that a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
diſpoſition is not the least part of wiſdome, and what our
way to profit is, if we will be Chriſts Diſciples,</hi> Paul <hi>ſheweth
in his Epiſtle to the</hi> Epheſians, chap. 4. 11. <hi>He gave gifts unto
men; ſome Paſtours, ſome Teachers, &amp;c. Whence it appears that
nothing elſe came into the Prophets thoughts, than to ſpoile the Church
of ſo great a benefit.</hi> Thus far judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> on <hi>Heb. 8. verſe</hi>
8, 9, 10, 11. In caſe theſe words <hi>[not only]</hi> might be ſupplied as
ſome would have it, <hi>men ſhall not only teach one another, Know the
Lord, but all ſhall know me;</hi> giving inſtances of the like, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to be ſupplyed in other Scriptures, then the whole ſcope of
the place were cleared: For the Jews as they did make uſe of the
teaching of men, ſo, for the generality they reſted in it; Here they
are taught that which they never minded, the neceſſity of the
concurrence, of Gods teaching with mans, that when man diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the object, God ſhould put in frame the Organ. Certain it
is, that when other prophecies foretell in New Teſtament-times,
mens zeal, to ſtirre up one another in the knowledge of God, (as
<hi>Iſa. 2. 3. Zech.</hi> 8. 21, 22, 23. yea, the very Chapter whence this
prophecie is taken, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and the Apoſtles in the New Teſtament
call upon men for the mutual help of each other for edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)

they muſt not ſet upon it, till they were enpoured for it. We have

but by ſtudy. A way for the advancement of ſtudy is therefore
neceſſary, and though neither Law nor Goſpel, do in the letter
expreſſely appoint them; no more than they did Synagogues for
the Jewes, and the like places of Aſſembly for Chriſtians, yet by
way of neceſſary conſequence, both Law, and Goſpel call for
them, ſeeing they expreſſely call for that, which without theſe

The Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking to men of the light of Reaſon; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring

29, 30, 31. One intereſt (<hi>among others by him named</hi>) of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
is to perſwade the people, that the Scriptures, though we have
them in our tongue, are not yet to be underſtood by us, without their help,
and interpretation, ſo that in effect we are in the ſame condition with
thoſe we have ſo long pitied, that are forbid to have the Scriptures in
their own tongue; for it is alone, not to have them in our own tongue, and
to be made beleeve that we cannot underſtand them, though we have
them in our own. Is the cabinet open to us? and do we yet want a key?
has ſo much labour been ſpent? ſo many tranſlations extant, and are
we yet to ſeek? Let us argue a little with them; either the Scriptures
are not rightly tranſlated, or elſe they are; if they are not, why have
we not been told ſo all this while? why have we been cheated into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours?
if they are rightly tranſlated, why ſhould not Engliſh men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them? The idiomes and proprieties of the Hebrew and Greek
languages, which ſome ſay, cannot word for word be expreſt in Engliſh,
might all this while have been tranſlated into as many Engliſh words,
as will carry the ſenſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>For the dilemma concerning the Scriptures rightly tranſlated,
or not rightly; I may apply that of <hi>Job, chap. 6. verſe 15. How
forcible are right words, but what doth your arguing reprove?</hi> and
anſwer in a word, that they are rightly tranſlated according to
the reach of a humane work, and more rightly than the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
followed ſo much by the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
all will yeeld that ours is more exact after the Original, than
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55700:107"/>
was that of the Seventy; And yet there was no cheat in thoſe
tranſlations; if there had, thoſe witneſſes of Chriſt had not been
ſilent; and yet not ſuch a perfection that will bear no amendment.
There is ſtill uſe of examination of them, of aſſerting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
them; But be it granted that the tranſlation is every way
exact and full, does it follow that there needs no help or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation?
The people of the Jewes had the Original it ſelf, and
ſpake the language in which Scripture was written; yet <hi>the
Prieſts lips were then to preſerve knowledge, and the people were to ſeek
the law at his mouth,</hi> Mal. 2 6. The cabinet was open to them, as
it is to us; yet there needed a key for farther opening. Thoſe
two Diſciples, with whom Chriſt had to deale with, upon the
way, had the Scriptures, either in the tranſlation, or Original,
as is evident from Chriſts own words, reproving them for <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
all that the Prophets had written,</hi> and yet a key of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was needful, and uſeful; <hi>Chriſt opened unto them the
Scriptures,</hi> Luke 24. 32. If this <hi>Compaſſionate Samaritane</hi> were
queſtioned (as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was by <hi>Philip) underſtandeſt thou what
thou readeſt?</hi> he would not have given his anſwer, <hi>How ſhall I
underſtand without an Interpreter?</hi> But would ſtreight have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
Yes, as well as any linguiſt in the world; I have no need
of your help for interpretation. The cabinet is open, ſpare your
key. This was one of the Arts, that ſome Prelates made uſe of,
to keep up a reading Miniſtery, to perſwade, that Scripture were
ſo plaine diſtinctly read in our own tongue, that they might be
underſtood without any interpretation. But the plainneſſe and
eaſineſſe of a rule, and the uſe of means for underſtanding of it
ſtand together; We maintaine a plainneſſe in Scripture for the
ſimple to underſtand, but not ſitting idle, and lazy; but ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures, and making uſe of thoſe gifts of Chriſt, which he
ſhed forth from the right hand of the Father, <hi>for the edifying of
his body, till we come into the unity of the faith and knowledge of
the Sonne of God, unto a perfect man. That we might not henceforth
be as children, toſſed to and fro with every winde of doctrine, by the
ſleight of men and cunning craftineſſe of thoſe that lie in waite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
Epheſ. 4. 12, 13. We may ſoone ſee their artifice
that labour to beare them down, Thus they know their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſleight may be carried in the dark, and their impoſtures
lie undiſcovered. Our compaſſionate man, pretending to avoid a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55700:108"/>
cheat; acts the part of the moſt notable cheater. The Prophet
ſtood for that office of the Prieſts, that their lips ſhould preſerve
knowledge, even when they had corrupted the covenant of <hi>Levi,</hi>
Whatſoever their way was, yet this was their duty, ſo muſt we for
the Stewards of the myſteries of God, It is their work to diſpenſe
them, and the people are to ſeek at their mouthes for them.
But enough I hope hath been ſpoke for a Miniſtery, for a

or for ſome particular Church, and that either congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

for the Church univerſal viſible. <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the

1 Cor. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 28. No one particular Church, congregational or claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical,
enjoys all the particular kindes there enumerated, yet ſo as
the exerciſe of this function, is to be with limit to one particular
only. They are Miniſters of the Church univerſal; yet ſo as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
to exerciſe their function, only there, where God by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ſhall deſigne them. There are ſome functions (as I may
ſay) <hi>Catholick,</hi> what ſuch a one doth any where in his function,
is good every where, as a publick Notary, or Maſter of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
that which they do any where, is every where valid, within
the limit of that power under which they act; It is of force through
the whole Nation. Some functions are <hi>topical</hi> or <hi>local,</hi> as Juſtices
of Peace, a chief officer in a Corporation, Sheriff, or Conſtable,
who are without power out of their own limits. A Miniſter or
Presbyter is a Catholick or Univerſal Officer, he hath <hi>jus in re,</hi> in
the whole Church viſible, for all Miniſterial actions, whether of
Word or Sacraments, he hath <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> in the place aſſigned

and appointed him, where alone he is regularly to officiate, and
ſo, hath the title of an Aggel, or Elder of ſuch a particular Church
to which he is called, <hi>Rev. 2. 1, 7, &amp;c. Acts</hi> 20. 17. He hath a
firſt right every where, a ſecond right only where he is order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
placed.</p>
                  <p>This is to be done by examination or tryal,<note place="margin">Ordination is to be paſt on examination or trial.</note> if no word of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
did mention it, yet the thing it ſelf evinces the neceſſity of
it; Scripture layes down the requiſites or qualifications in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
Firſt, for years, <hi>not a novice, 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 6. Some are old young,
which may anſwer ſome want of years, more fit at twenty foure,
then others at thirty. Secondly, for converſation; <hi>Blameleſſe,
as the Steward of God; not ſelf-willed, not ſoon angry, not given to
wine, no ſtriker, not given to filthy lucre; but a lover of hoſpitality,
a lover of good men, ſober, juſt, holy, temperate,</hi> Titus 1. 7, 8. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for parts and gifts; 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 15. A workman that needeth
not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of Truth,</hi> Tit. 1. 9. <hi>Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faſt the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be
able by ſound doctrine, both to exhort and convince gain-ſayers.</hi>
Fourthly, for graces of the Spirit, they ſhould be as <hi>Barnabas,
full of the Holy Ghoſt and of Faith,</hi> Acts 11. 24. From which
gifts of nature muſt not be excluded, as ſtrength of body in its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that the body may in ſome ſort keep pace with the ſoule.
The gift of utterance, that not only his head, but <hi>his lips may
preſerve knowledge,</hi> that he may be able to ſpeak, <hi>to edification,
exhortation, and doctrine;</hi> of theſe ſuch that act in Ordination,
ſhould have knoweldge, of each of them ſo far, as they may come
to cognizance, of ſome of theſe by letters of commendation <hi>from
faithful perſons, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 1. of others by proof and examination,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 10. The Apoſtle having laid down the qualifications of
Biſhops, and proceeding to that of Deacons; hath theſe words,
<hi>Let theſe alſo be proved, and then let them uſe the office of a Deacon;</hi>
both Biſhops and Deacon muſt undergo examination. Timothy
<hi>muſt lay hands ſuddenly on none,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 22. He muſt then lay
on his hands no otherwiſe, but upon proof and trial, which
the context (ſpeaking of ſins, ſome open going before to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
others following after) ſeems to evince, ſuch cautiouſneſs
cannot ſtand; without all poſſible wayes and means of proof and
trial</p>
                  <p>All this is to be ſolemnized by faſting and prayer; in which we
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55700:111"/>
have Scripture-precedents,<note place="margin">To be ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized with faſting and praye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>When they had ordained them Elders in every Church, and had prayed
with faſting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they beleeved.</hi>
This I take not, to be of the eſſence of Ordination; not neceſſary
to the very being; but the better being of it in imploring Gods
aſſiſtance and bleſſing. It is a great work, a work of glorius
concernment; it is a work above our ſtrength to manage, more
weighty than our ſhoulders can bear, there is more than parts,
gifts and endowments, (whether natural or acquired) required
in it. All ſupplies being (as before we heard) to be expected
from heaven, heaven muſt be implored, God muſt be earneſtly
ſought in it. Faſting ſhould add wings to our prayers, <hi>that our
voice may be heard on high.</hi> A ſhadow of this ſtill remained in the
Church, as appers, by thoſe <hi>Jejunia quatuor temporum</hi> at the
times of Ordination; which indeed, was almoſt brought to a meer
ſhadow.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing mentioned in the Definition,<note place="margin">Impoſition of hands to be uſed in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> is impoſition of
hands; A rite or uſage in practice before the Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 14.
held in the time of the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 4. and continued in the
dayes of the Goſpel, as conſiſting with the ſimplicity of it. It
was uſed in <hi>bleſſing,</hi> Gen. 48. 14. Iſrael <hi>ſtretched out his right
hand, and laid it upon</hi> Ephraims <hi>head in his bleſſing of them.</hi> Matth.
19 13. <hi>They brought children to Chriſt, that he ſhould put his hands
on them and pray;</hi> which accordingly he did, <hi>Mark 10. 16. He
put his hands upon them, and bleſſed them.</hi> It was uſed in <hi>Offerings,</hi>
Levit. 1. 4. <hi>If any man bring an Offering unto the Lord, he ſhall
put his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering, and it ſhall be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for him, to make atonement for him.</hi> It was uſed in <hi>bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
as <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. 14. Where the Lord gives charge concerning
the blaſphemer; <hi>Bring forth him that hath curſed, without the
Camp, and let all that have heard him, lay their hands upon his head.</hi>
It was uſed in conferring <hi>extraordinary gifts,</hi> Acts 8. 17. <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>John</hi> laid their hands, on thoſe that <hi>beleeved in Samaria, and
they received the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> It was uſed in <hi>miraculous cures,</hi>
Mark 6. 5. <hi>Chriſt could do there no mighty works, ſave that he
laid his hands upon a few ſick folke, and healed them,</hi> Acts 28. 8.
It was uſed in <hi>deſigning men for office, and that either civil,</hi> for the
work of the Magiſtracy. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 9. Joſhua <hi>the ſon of</hi> Nun <hi>was
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55700:111"/>
full of the Spirit of wiſdome; for</hi> Moſes <hi>had laid his hands upon him,
and the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>hearkened unto him, and did as Lord
commanded</hi> Moſes. Or Eccleſiaſtical, and that for the work of
the Lord in the time of the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 10. and alſo in the
dayes of the Goſpel, <hi>Acts.</hi> 13. 3. And from this rite of impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of hands, (in uſe in this work of Ordination) the whole work
hath ſometimes its denomination, 1 <hi>Tim. 5 22. Lay hands ſuddenly
on no man;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An Objection anſwered.</note> where impoſition of hands is put for the whole work.
Some I know would take all this off, as to Ordination by laying on
of hands, by the objection of extraordinary gifts, which were this
way conferred, as was before confeſſed, of which they will have that
Text underſtood, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 6. Wherefore I put thee in remembrance,
that thou ſtir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my
hands.</hi> But this is too weak to avoid, it for though we have already
ſaid; that when the Holy Ghoſt was given in thoſe extraordinary
endowments, hands were impoſed, yet whole Presbyteries cannot
ordinarily be conceived, to be veſted with that power, yet they
joyntly in this work laid on their hands, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. And that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 22. plainly contradicts it, <hi>lay hands
ſuddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other mens ſins.</hi> In caſe <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
had had that power to have conferred with the calling, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
for the calling, he had no need to have been in that way
adviſed, to uſe ſuch circumſpection. Why ſhould he be ſo careful
to ſee them firſt fit, in caſe his laying on of hands would fit them?
There need not ſuch trial whether they were gifted in caſe a touch
of the hand would be the gifting of them. And for <hi>Timothies</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in the place quoted, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. it followes not from our
grant; that extraordinary gifts are there ſpecified, that authority
for the Miniſterial work is denied. It is plain that <hi>Moſes</hi> authorized
<hi>Joſhua,</hi> for ſucceſſion in his place; by laying on of hands, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.
9. The people upon that took him for his ſucceſſor, yet it is
as plain in the Text, that the Spirit of wiſdom was then conferred
upon him: Authority and power are ſometimes given at once, yet
all that are in power to authorize, cannot impower for this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
he that will ſee more, may read Dr. <hi>Seamans Treatiſe</hi> on this

                  <head type="sub">Miniſters of Chriſt muſt bring their people up to the
termes of the Covenant, preſſing the necceſſity
of Faith and Repentance.</head>
                  <p>THen it farther yet follows; that the Miniſters of Chriſt
are to call their people unto theſe duties, before mentioned
as conditions. They muſt urge and preſſe the neceſſity of
Faith and Repentance. Theſe are the termes of the covenant,
and ſtipulation, to which God in covenant doth engage, in which
the Apoſtles of Chriſt ſpent their paines, <hi>Testifying both to Jews
and Gentiles, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 20. 21. And this muſt be the buſineſſe of thoſe
that make it their buſineſſe to preach the Goſpel in all ages. Men
muſt be taught to obſerve what Chriſt commands and teaches,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. Theſe Chriſt teaches, and gives in charge; Thus
he begun his Miniſtery, <hi>Mark 1. 15. Repent ye, and beleeve the
Goſpel.</hi> They muſt ſo preach that men may not periſh; that they
may not be the ſavour of death, But they only that beleeve, ſhall
not periſh, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. They that repent not, muſt periſh, <hi>Luke</hi>
13. 1. They muſt ſo preach Chriſt, that men may have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in Chriſt, that they may not be caſt off by Chriſt, But
Faith gives this intereſt: <hi>He dwells in our hearts by Faith,</hi> Epheſ.
3. 17. Workers of iniquity muſt be caſt off, <hi>Mat. 7. 23. Depart
from me all ye that work iniquity.</hi> It is no plain dealing in any of
the Miniſters of Chriſt to make tender of promiſes, to hold forth
priviledges, and conceale the termes, upon which they may be
obtained; to ſpeak of ſalvation to men in ſinne, without ſo much
as the name of ſanctification, or application to God in a way of
Repentance; to tell men in the Prodigals courſe, of the Fathers
bowels, and readineſſe to meet them with kiſſes; without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Prodigals humiliation or coming in, to tell them of
the <hi>many ſinnes</hi> forgiven to the woman in the Goſpel, <hi>Luk</hi> 7. 47.
without once mention of thoſe many tears, that were ſhed in
evidence of her repentance.<note place="margin">An Objection anſwered.</note> They ſay, that theſe are the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
motives to work men from ſin. This I gladly yeeld when the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55700:112"/>
promiſe is tendered, and with it repentance urged. I know it was
the way of the Prophet,<note place="margin">The danger of ſevering the promiſe from the duty.</note> 
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 7. and therefore a prevalent
way; <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts, and let him returne unto the Lord, and he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> The way
alſo of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 17. Be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord,
and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.</hi> But the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of the promiſe from the duty, ſo that Chriſt is heard on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a promiſe, not at all in a precept, when they heare that Chriſt
will ſave; but are never told that they muſt repent. Theſe are
but deluſions; Promiſe-Preachers, and no duty-Preachers; grace-Preachers,
and not repentance-Preachers, do but (as the Apoſtle
hath long ſince given warning) deceive with <hi>vain words,</hi> Epheſ.
5. 6. This will never work men from ſinne, but ſtrengthen men in
ſin, <hi>Ezek. 13. 22. Becauſe with lies ye have made the heart of the
righteous ſad, whom I have not made ſad, and ſtrenthened the hands of
the wicked, that he ſhould not returne from his wicked way, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
life.</hi> Theſe promiſes of life thus tendered, we ſee are lies,
for men in ſinne, are men for death, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
ſtrengthen the hands of men in ſinne, that they return not
from it. It is the obſervation of many, that the falſe Prophets
ſo branded in the Old Teſtament, vented no errours in Faith, but
only miſapplications of truths. They promiſed peace, where the
Lord had promiſed no peace; and therefore a <hi>falſe Prophet</hi>
among the Jews is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>a falſe Teacher</hi> among
Chriſtians, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. Theſe latter <hi>bring in damnable hereſies,</hi>
and ſo did not the former; But as ours outſtrip them, in that
they bring in errours in faith, ſo they joyne with them in miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
of truths. <hi>If thou be a whoremonger, a blaſphemer, a
drunkard, a mad man in iniquity</hi> (ſaith one, or words to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
<hi>and there be no manner of change wrought in thee, yet come
and take Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Does any Goſpel-Text, ſpeak of ſuch a mans
taking of Chriſt, without any manner of change wrought? Are
not thoſe the enemies of Chriſt, that riſe in hoſtile rebellion?
<hi>Pſal</hi> 68. 21. And while they deſpiſe him, can they receive him?
We would not have ſuch a ſinner (if we can poſſibly imagine a
great ſinner) kept from Chriſt Jeſus; but he muſt come in at
the Goſpel-door, He muſt come in the way of his call, He muſt
come to receive whole Chriſt in each function of his, He muſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55700:113"/>
come for every gift,<note place="margin">Whole Chriſt muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and all of his gifts embraced.</note> which Chriſt poures out, He muſt come for
repentance from Chriſt, as a Prince, as well as remiſſion of ſins as
a Saviour, <hi>Acts 5. 31. God hath exalted him with his right hand
to be a Prince, and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and
forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> He muſt come by the way of Faith for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe,
This both Prophets and Apoſtles, Old Teſtament
and New Teſtament-Goſpel calls for, <hi>Acts 10. 43. To him give
all the Prophets witneſſe, that through his Name, whoſoever beleeveth
in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> They muſt come by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and converſion in order to forgiveneſſe, <hi>Acts 3. 19. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
ye therefore and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out,
when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> I
do not ſay that there is no promiſe in Scripture made to a wicked
man, that is the greateſt Goſpel-paradox; But I ſay, they are not
made good, to wicked perſons. They are made to the wicked,
made good,<note place="margin">Promiſes are made to the wicked, made good only to the beleeving and penitent.</note> that is, performed, to the beleeving and penitent. To
finde a promiſe made, and made good, that is, tendered and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to a man unbeleeving, impenitent is indeed a labour. One
replying to this queſtion, <hi>What, if I have not thoſe conditions in me, as
to feel my ſelf hungry, thirſty and heavy-laden?</hi> anſwers, <hi>If you

                     <hi>then you are not to apply your
ſelf to thoſe promiſes, that are made to ſuch as have thoſe conditions in
them; But you are to ſeek out for other (and more ſuitable) promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which are abſolute and without condition.</hi> It is worth asking
where thoſe ſuitable promiſes are to a man void of faith? For
that before by the Authour was mentioned, or to a man impenient,
and not ſo much as hungring after them, ſuch a one I meane,
that upon good grounds, is able to charge the want of theſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his ſoul, I am ſure they are under heavy Scripture-woes, even
Goſpel-menaces, and can they at the ſame time be fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the mercy of a promiſe? Where are his promiſes that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and thirſts not, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Wo to you that are full,
for you ſhall hunger?</hi> Where is his promiſe that mourns not, but
goes on frolick in his way, When Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Woe unto you
that laugh now, for ye ſhall weep and lament,</hi> Luke 6. 25. Where is
the unbeleevers promiſe, when the Lord ſayes, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
not, is condemned, already; becauſe he hath not beleeved in the
name of the only begotten Son of God,</hi> John 3. 18. Where is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
mans promiſe, when the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>The wicked
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55700:113"/>
ſhall be turned into hell,</hi> Pſalme 9. 17. and the Apoſtle, <hi>That no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
perſon ſhall enter into the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9.
But inſtance is given, <hi>Iſa. 43. 25. I am he that blotteth out thy
tranſgreſſions for mine own name ſake.</hi> But this is not the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
the impenitent mans tranſgreſſions, they ſtill ſtand on
record, and the bond uncancelled. This excludes motives from
us, not graces wrought in us, when God juſtifies a beleever, it's
for his own name ſake, or elſe he is a loſer in his glory, when <hi>he
juſtifies thoſe that beleeve in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3. 26. and Faith gives not
glory to God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. but takes glory from him. As
<hi>Peter</hi> ſaid of the creeple that was cured; <hi>His name, through faith
in his name, hath made this man ſtrong,</hi> Acts 3. 16. So we may ſay
of every ſinner, juſtified and pardoned, <hi>His Name, through faith
in his Name,</hi> hath acquit and freed him. When God pardons a
penitent man, it is not for the merit of his returne that he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
him; if this were ſo, <hi>Peter</hi> who is ſo zealous, to advance his
name in the place quoted; had not preſently urged; <hi>Repent and
be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing
ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> Acts 3. 19. It is not
for his honour to pardon any other. This is with him a rule which
he will for ever follow, <hi>Thoſe that honour me, I will honour, and
they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 30. The
ſame Author ſaith, <hi>Conditions and qualifications are mentioned in
ſome promiſes;</hi> and therefore we may ſafely inferre, are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in all promiſes of life and ſalvation, unleſſe God deny
himſelf, He hath threatned death and condemnation againſt an
unqualified man; namely the unbeleeving and impenitent; and
therefore hath not promiſed them life and ſalvation. Beleeving
penitent ones, have the promiſes of life to be made good to them,
excluſively to all others. To lead the ſinner to Chriſt for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the qualifications of grace in the way of his Ordinances,
is to lead him right; He is the Author of our faith, and he is a
Prince to give repentance. But to perſwade a ſinner to look for
life, in the want of all theſe, or to tell him of Aſſurance of
life without ſenſe of theſe, is to deceive him. That happy Doctrine
of free grace, ſo timely abuſed, even as ſoon as clearly preached,
is now no leſſe abuſed; Then, inferences were made from it, for
encouragement to abound in ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. Now inferences are
drawn to cry down duty, Righteouſneſſe imputed muſt overthrow
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55700:114"/>
righteouſneſſe inherent. The Apoſtle would not ſuffer the former;
the Miniſters of Chriſt muſt not bear the latter.</p>

is the overthrow of all bonds of humane ſociety, of all converſe
and commerce, whether in more publick, or private negotiations.
Truth is the upholding, and perfidiouſneſſe is the bane and utter
deſtruction of it. When Papiſts have maintained that <hi>Faith,</hi> or
<hi>covenant</hi> is not to be kept with Hereticks; reformed Churches
have concluded upon it, that there is no ſafety of any, league or
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55700:114"/>
intercourſe of dealing with them. The example of <hi>John Huſſe</hi> is
a ſufficient warning. Thoſe that hold no ſuch principles, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch in their practices; are equally dangerous. We look
upon theſe, as given up to a very Spirit of Atheiſm, if not wholly
in their judgements to deny a Deity, and to utter with their
mouths that which the Pſalmiſts foole ſayes in his heart, yet
utterly ſlighting his Sovereignty, and diſregarding his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
They have arrived at that dedolency that the Apoſtle
mentions, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 19. and therefore rankt by him with the
worſt of Heathens, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 31. and put into that black bill of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
perſons, that will be found in the laſt and moſt perillous
times,<note place="margin">Breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er evil.</note> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 3. How much more then will God and man have
in deteſtation thoſe; that have entred covenant in an immediate
way with God, for faith and obedience and to ſtand out in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to ſinne, and Satan, yet (making defection from God by
ſinne and unbeliefe) ſtand up in rebellion againſt him. Is the
dreadful Majeſty of the great God of no more regard, than to
pretend to him, engage with him, and then ſtand up in hoſtility
againſt him? Is there any thing ſo lovely, or honourable in ſin,
to allure men to run upon the wrath of God, that they may welter
in it? or any thing ſo unpleaſing in the wayes of God, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the dread of his name, nor the bliſſe, held forth in promiſe,
can perſwade to embrace them? A viler thing cannot be named,
than a Chriſtian in ſinne, a Chriſtian in wayes of unbeliefe and
wickedneſſe. Were the name of a Chriſtian off, and no cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
bonds engaging to the Lord; then there were no more than
a creature in rebellion, and that were bad enough, the work of
Gods hand to ſtrive with its Maker. But ſtanding veſted in this
covenant-relation, honoured with this glorious Name, here is
an addition of Hypocriſie, Apoſtaſie and defection. We hate
none more than thoſe that are falſe to us; and we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that God hates none more than thoſe that are falſe to him,
and therefore challenges his people, whether they have found
any iniquity in him, <hi>Jerem. 2 5. What iniquity have your fathers
found in me, that they are gone farre from me, and have walked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vanity, and are become vain?</hi> A ſervant doth not uſe to quit one
Maſter, and betake himſelf to another, but he gives ſome reaſon
of his change. One that hath been engaged for the ways of God
(as all are that are called by the Name of God, and dignified
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55700:115"/>
with the title of a Chriſtian) would be hard put to it, to give a
reaſon of his revolt from God. When God and vanity are ſet
in competition, that God ſhould be refuſed, and vanity
choſen, when the fountaine of living waters, that never can
be drawn dry, is left, and ciſternes, broken ciſternes choſen,
that are alwayes running dry. How does the holy Ghoſt, ſet out
theſe, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 22. The dog is turned to his own vomit again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, and the
ſow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> Can the ſow find no
other place than filth? nor the dogge no other food than his
vomit? A returne to ſinne is more loathſome than theſe, and
ſuch are all the wayes of all men in ſinne, of all of a Chriſtian
profeſſion, that are ſeen in ungodly ways; Nothing ſo glorious as
a Chriſtian that holds to his principles, that anſwers in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
to his profeſſion, Nothing ſo inglorious as a Chriſtian in ſin.
A Jew outwardly, and a Heathen inwardly, a face for God, and
a heart for iniquity. When ſuch as theſe came out of the holy
land for <hi>Babylon,</hi> they, there ſaid in way of reproach of their
God, <hi>Theſe are the people of the Lord, and are gone forth out of
his land,</hi> Ezek. 36. 20. Rom. 2. 24. Inſomuch that God is put to it
for his vindication, not to ſuffer them to carry their ſin with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<hi>Ezek. 39. 23, 24. And the heathen ſhall know, that the houſe of</hi>
Iſrael <hi>went into captivity for their iniquity, becauſe they treſpaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me; therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the
hand of their enemies; ſo fell they all by the ſword according to their
uncleanneſſe, and according to their tranſgreſſions have I done unto
them, and hid my face from them.</hi> This falſehood in covenant
draws preſent ſufferings, National plagues: <hi>I will bring a ſword
upon you, that ſhall avenge the quarrel of my covenant,</hi> Levit. 26. 25.
Every Chriſtian Nation under ſufferings;<note place="margin">It brings Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional plagues.</note> may ſadly reflect upon
all that they groan under, and ſay their iniquities have procured
theſe things unto them.</p>
                  <p>But this breach of covenant with God hath greater evils, even
unto eternity following upon it;<note place="margin">It brings evil to eternity.</note> Men of ſinne and unbeliefe, that
lie in diſtruſt and diſobedience, can claime no intereſt in the grace
and mercy of the covenant. God in covenant engages to Faith
and Repentance, theſe as we have ſeen are his termes, when men
come not up to them, they diſ-intereſt themſelves, and diſengage
God from any tye of conferring bliſſe and ſavation upon them.
Their own folly and madneſſe, puts a barre to their own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55700:115"/>
and glory. They cannot be ſelf-ſaviours, yet they will
not go out of themſelves for ſalvation by another, when they
have received the ſentence of death in themſelves, they will not
come to Chriſt, that they may have life. He may worthily bear
his own debt, that in pride of ſpirit, refuſes anothers bounty;
Chriſt offers himſelf as a Surety in our ſtead, to make payment for
us in his own perſon. The unbeleever will ſtand on his owu
bottome, and make pay out of his own ſtore, or periſh; Having
heaven and hell ſet before them; the tender of the one, and the
terrour of the other, quitting heaven and all the glory of it, and
happineſſe in it; they make choice of that fire, that is prepared
for the Devil and his Angels,<note place="margin">No Aſſurance of happineſſe, but in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the termes of the Covenant.</note> covenant-breaking having the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
doome of deſtruction faſtened upon it. Aſſurance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
cannot be gained, but in a way of covenant-keeping; yea,
the conditions of the covenant are the baſis, and never failing
bottome of our Evidence and Aſſurance. It is gathered thus: <hi>He
that believes and repents, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> This is evidently laid down
in Scriptures; A man void of ſaving faith, and impenitent, may
give his aſſent to it. Then the ſould is to aſſume to it ſelfe, <hi>but
I beleeve and repent, therefore I ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Theſe two (as at
large hath been ſhewn) are the conditions of the covenant; theſe
we muſt finde wrought in our ſouls, or elſe all Evidence is wanting,
and when theſe are concluded, an undeceiving intereſt in ſalvation
follows.</p>
                  <p>There is a twofold work to be done on the ſoul that is in ſin in
order to bring it to ſalvation; There is a third to be done for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>The firſt work is to ſet the ſoul free from Hell, to deliver it from
the ſentence of Death; to which by the rule of juſtice, man ſtands
condemned. A man muſt be fetched out of priſon, before he
can be for any preferment, or place of honour. This is done by
the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 7. In whom we have redemption
through his blood, the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, according to the riches of
his grace.</hi> This is the price of our ranſom, <hi>Being redeemed, not
with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood
of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to make a man meet for heaven, A man ſo vile as
ſinne makes, is a man fit for nothing but hell, and muſt have a
change wrought before he be meet for heaven. Upon this ground
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55700:116"/>
the Apoſtle is ſo large, in returning praiſe for the <hi>Coloſſians: Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of
the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1. 12. As alone, the blood
of Chriſt ſets free from hell; ſo alone, the Spirit of Chriſt makes
fit for heaven. This is done by a double work. 1. Of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or firſt implantation of grace, which is called the birth of the
Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 3. 5, 6. 2. By acting, improving, carrying on this
work of grace; which is properly ſanctification, ſo that when
the Spirit is gone thus farre, here is a certainty of the object. It is
ſure, nothing more ſure than this; that a regenerate ſanctified man
ſhall be ſaved. But here is more required for a certainty of the
ſubject. Here is <hi>certitudo de re;</hi> but more is required to attaine
<hi>certitudinem de ſe.</hi> If <hi>Peter</hi> do beleeve and repent, he ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
is out of controverſie; But that <hi>Peter</hi> doth beleeve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
is not alwayes ſo ſoone diſcovered, And this is the Spirits
work as the former It is not my buſineſſe now to hold out what
is the Spirits whole office in concluding our Aſſurance, but to ſhew
that the conditions of the covenant are the bottom ground, not
of ſalvation, but of our evidence of intereſt in ſalvation. We muſt
know that we do beleeve and repent, before we have aſſurance,
and we muſt firſt beleeve and repent, before we know that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
and repent. If before faith and repentance there can be no
ſalvation; then before we know we beleeve and repent, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be aſſured of ſalvation: But without faith and repentance
there is no ſalvation, <hi>Mark 16. 16. He that beleeveth and is
baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that beleeveth not, ſhall be damned.</hi>
Luke 13. 3. 5. <hi>I tell you, may, but except ye repent, ye ſhall all
likewiſe periſh;</hi> Therefore before we beleeve and repent, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be aſſured of ſalvation. And how aſſurance can be gained
without a practical ſyllogiſme, and how a ſyllogiſme can be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with any other <hi>medium,</hi> than the conditions of the covenant,
is above my underſtanding Man is ſo far from abilities to conclude
ſalvation, without faith and repentance, that be muſt conclude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be in faith, and that he doth repent, before he can conclude
any intereſt in it. The covenant of God is the ground of our
ſalvation; if that be waved, all is loſt, and we muſt make good
our part in the Covenant, Grace muſt aſſiſt to anſwer what
the covenant requires, or no ſalvation. How is it a covenant,
if nothing be required? and why is it required, if it muſt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55700:116"/>
not be performed? To gather up aſſurance from the conditions
of the covenant is a buſineſſe of greater conſequence, even the
higheſt pitch of Chriſtianity. It is a great work to beleeve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
a greater work to know that we ſavingly beleeve and repent.
The work it ſelfe is difficult, no buſineſſe of a lazy ſoul, but
to know, that the work is aright done, is a greater difficulty; but
that it muſt be gathered from the conditions, is eaſie to reſolve.
I know ſome finding the ſeal of the Spirit,<note place="margin">The office of the Spirit in the work of Aſſurance.</note> and the witneſſe of
the Spirit mentioned in Scripture in order to aſſurance, will
have the whole of the work of Aſſurance to be carryed on
alone by the Spirit, and that all is done in us without us.
They expect a ſecret whiſper from God, that we are Gods,
and no more. This witneſſe, they ſay, muſt be heeded,
and our faith and repentance in the work not at all regarded,
But I would know of thoſe if the Spirit be a ſeale; whether
the ſoul doth not bear the impreſſe? and what this impreſſe
is, but the graces of the Spirit? The Seale ſealing, and
the impreſſe made, fully anſwer one the other, Sometimes it
may dimmely anſwer, where the wax or clay, (or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is ſealed) takes not a full impreſſion; but if it anſwer
not, it is no Seale. The graces that the Spirit works, are its
impreſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and theſe are the conditions of the covenant, and ſo
inſtead of an objection, we have a proofe. For the witneſſe of
the Spirit, I deſire to know whether it be a ſingle witneſſe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
teſtimony to us without us, or a witneſſe concurring with
our ſpirits? The Text is cleare, <hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it ſelf
beareth witneſſe with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God.</hi>
Our ſpirits bearing witneſſe, are our conſciences, <hi>Rom. 2. 5.
Their conſciences alſo bearing them witneſſe;</hi> and therefore Maſter
<hi>Baxter</hi> rightly affirmes, <hi>That the teſtimony of the Spirit, and the
teſtimony of our conſciences are two concurrent teſtimonies, or cauſes,
to produce one and the ſame effect.</hi> But every conſcience cannot
witneſſe thus with the Spirit, or joyne in a concurrent teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
It <hi>is the witneſſe of a good conſcience,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. <hi>Baptiſm
ſaves</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>by the reſurrection of Chriſt;</hi> Explaining
himſelf, <hi>not the putting away the filth of the fleſh,</hi> not the bare
outward act of adminiſtration (which is worthily ſet out by
the moſt undervaluing termes, when it is put in oppoſition to the
inward work) <hi>but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God.</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55700:117"/>
is a ſeal of the covenant, and it engages to what the
covenant requires, which (as we have been ſtill catechized) <hi>is to
beleeve in God, and to forſake our ſins,</hi> and when conſcience anſwers
that this is done, Baptiſme is a ſeale that Chriſt ſaves. The ſeale
of the Spirit is an impreſſe of thoſe graces; and the witneſſe
of the Spirit is a clearingup of theſe graces, and giving in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
to the truth of them, opening our eyes to read the
characters, which it ſelfe hath made, 1 <hi>Corinth. 2. 12. We
have not received the ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit which
is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to
us of God.</hi> So that in vaine do men talk of the Spirit; that
have not on their own hearts the impreſſe of it, or of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Spirit, when a renewed conſcience cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre,<note place="margin">The immediate teſte of the Spirits exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note>
in teſtimony that theſe engagements are anſwered in
faith and repentance; let that Text of the Apoſtle be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
1 <hi>John 3. 24. He that keepeth his commandments, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in him, and he in him; and hereby we know that he abideth
in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</hi> I know there are
ſome that admit of all this, and freely yeeld, that this is a ſafe
way to conclude Aſſurance from Sanctification, Confeſſing
that the Spirit never witneſſeth with an unſanctified
heart, yet they contend for a farther and immediate teſte of
the Spirit, without any conſideration had, of inherent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
wrought, or any reflection made, by the the ſoule upon
it ſelfe, in review of any gracious qualifications. Yet here they
confeſſe danger; and limit this doctrine of theirs with diverſe
cautions, as I have met with ſome, from an eminent hand, in a
manuſcript. 1. <hi>This is extraordinary</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>very ſeldome
ſeene or known, it is no common way of the Spirits wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
2. It is for the moſt part in, or upon performance of
ſome duties, or conſcientious employment of a mans ſelfe in the
way of his calling. 3. After ſome great abaſement of a mans
ſpirit, and more than ordinary ſoul-humiliations and ſelf-denials.
4. After ſome great adventures made for God, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Name. 5. After ſome great combate, and conflict
with temptation, in which God gives in his Spirit, as an</hi> honorarium,
<hi>or glorious reward upon victory obtained.</hi> Firſt, by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
it is not to be denied, that God in a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
meaſure, doth many times manifeſt the gift of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55700:117"/>
for this work of Aſſurance, and that upon theſe occaſions
here laid down, the ſoule hath many cheering conſolations
nigh unto raptures. The Spouſe hath not like converſe with
the Bridegroome at all times; Sometimes ſhe <hi>walks with him
in the Galleries;</hi> Sometimes ſhe <hi>is with him in the wine-ſellers;</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſhe can ſay in a way of exultation, <hi>My beloved is mine, and
I am his.</hi> But theſe limits in the inſtances before laid down, ſeem
to me to be a full denial, inſtead of proof, that it is thus imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
without all reflex upon our graces. Theſe being means ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
of God, to ſtir up the habit of grace by his Spirit wrought
within us, and to bring them forth into action, which God
then farther honours with a greater meaſure of light, to diſcerne
his own work wrought in us. Our ſpirits being got into ſuch a
poſture, are in an aptitude to witneſſe with us; and God is
then pleaſed, to come in by his Spirit, to joyn in Evidence; So that
ſtill the conditional promiſes, are not only a ſafe, but the alone
way, in which through the help of the Spirit we get Aſſurance
that we ſhall be ſaved. They that go about to aſſert an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
teſte, will never ſecure the ſoule from deluſion, Satan
will ſoon finde an artifice, to counterfeit this teſtimony, and bear
witneſſe, in the Spirits ſtead, and when we think we have the Spirit
of truth to aſſure, we ſhall have the father of lies to deceive. A
gappe will be opened to all licentious preſumption, <hi>Children of
diſobedience</hi> will ſoone heed <hi>vain words,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>that the wrath of God ſhall
not come upon them;</hi> Neither will it be to purpoſe to demand, how
the Prophets were aſſured that it was the word of the Lord that
came to them, and no deluſion, and to affirme that the ſame way
we have aſſurance of the truth of the Spirits witneſſe, ſeeing
Gods extraordinary way of diſcovery of himſelf in viſions, dreams,
or what other way himſelf pleaſed to chuſe, is not the ſame with
his ordinary way of diſcovery unto us, we no more underſtand that
way of diſcovery than we do the way in which by power received,
they wrought miracles. As for Doctrines, which men are apt to
obtrude upon the Spirit; ſo, for teſtimonies, in order to our adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſalvation, we muſt go <hi>to the Law, and to the Teſtimony.</hi>
The Law and Teſtimony lead us, for Aſſurance to our own hearts,
excuſing or condemning in the particulars mentioned; <hi>And if
our hearts condemne us not, then have we confidence towards God;
and whatſoever we ask, we receive of him, becauſe we keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55700:118"/>
and do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight. And
this is his Commandment, that we ſhould beleeve on the Name of his
Son Jeſus-Chriſt, and love one another as he gave us commandment,
1 John</hi> 3. 21, 22, 23. And if the ſtreſſe of all had not lien here,
Chriſt had never compared the Profeſſor, that hears and does not,
to the fooliſh builder that raiſes his hopes of ſalvation on a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
foundation, upon a bare title of an empty profeſſion, without
any well grounded intereſt, and the Profeſſor that heares and
does, to the man that builds on a rock, and ſo layes his hopes
of ſalvation on a foundation, that never will deceive: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would the Pſalmiſt have concluded that, <hi>he ſhall not be
aſhamed,</hi> (his hope would not make him aſhamed) <hi>when
he had reſpect unto all Gods Commandments,</hi> Pſalme 119. 6. And
howſoever our doing does nothing by way of merit; yet our
doing through grace (in which beleeving is comprized,
which is the command of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23.) does all; taking
in the Spirits help to cleare the integrity of theſe works, by
way of Aſſurance. And though it be no foundation of our
ſubſiſtence in grace; and therefore the Apoſtle durſt not reſt
on that bottome, nor will be found in his own righteouſneſſe;
yet it is the foundation of our evidence. The Apoſtle gives
it in command to <hi>Timothy, Charge them that are rich in this
world, that they be not high minded, nor truſt in uncertaine
riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
willing to communicate,</hi> giving this in as the end of all,
<hi>Laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time
to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17, 18,
19. God hath <hi>ordained theſe, that we ſhould walk in them,</hi>
Epheſ. 2. 10. and walking in them; we are pronounced bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<hi>Pſalme</hi> 11 9. 1, 2. The efficient cauſe of our happineſſe
is grace, the free favour and good will of God towards man,
<hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
cauſe, is, the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ours, when we fall ſhort of the righteouſneſſe of the
Law; <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 10.
3. Therefore the Apoſtle obſerves, that <hi>David deſcribes the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe
of the man to whom the Lord imputeth righteouſneſſe without
works,</hi> (that is, wherein his bleſſedneſſe doth conſiſt,) <hi>ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:55700:118"/>
Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſinnes are
covered; Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin,</hi> Rom.
4. 6, 7, 8. The inſtrument or hand applying, is Faith: <hi>Being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt,
whom God hath ſet forth for propitiation through faith in his blood,
Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. But the ſubject on whom this bleſſedneſſe reſts,
is the godly righteous man: <hi>The Lord hath ſet apart him that is
godly for himſelf,</hi> Pſalme 4. 3. <hi>The man that hath clean hands, and
a pure heart, who hath not lift up his ſoul unto vanity, nor ſworne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully;
he ſhall receive the bleſſing from the Lord, and righteouſneſs
from the God of his ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 24. 4, 5. There is a concurrence
of ſundry cauſes in mans happineſſe, but all falls upon the head
of him that is ſtedfaſt with God in covenant, that comes up to
the termes and conditions of it. He is pronounced, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
for ever bleſſed, <hi>and without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee the
Lord.</hi> It is queſtioned by ſome, whether it be the truth, or the
degree of theſe graces, which are conditions of the Goſpel cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
upon performance of which we may conclude our Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of happineſſe; but the determination of that (being thus
put) is eaſie, No man in true grace ſhall go to hell, or miſſe of
heaven, God doth not adorne man with that glory to reject him.
The Apoſtle exhorts <hi>to love, not in word, nor in tongue, but in deed
and in truth;</hi> and for a motive adds; <hi>Hereby we know that we are
of the truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 18, 19.
But the <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> when it is that grace may be accounted
true, is not ſo eaſie, to determine. It is not every faintiſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that is the work on which all this glory reſts. It muſt be a
work of farther power and efficacy on the ſoul, for ſatisfaction
of which I ſhall referre the Reader to the learned labours of my
much honoured neighbour, Maſter <hi>Anthony Burgeſſe</hi> in his
ſpiritual refining.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The diſtribution of the Covenant of Grace into the Old and
New Covenant with the harmony and agreement that
is found between them.</head>
                  <p>BY Gods aſſiſtance we have been thus farre carried on in the
work in hand, to finde out the nature of a covenant, and
Gods way of entring covenant with man. And for the more
clear diſcovery of both, we have held forth the agreement which
is found, between the covenant of Works; which God entred with
man in his ſtate of integrity; and the covenant of Grace entred
of God with man, in his fallen condition, as alſo their reſpective
differences, So that all that is eſſential in this covenant, (and
neceſſarily required to the attainment of the priviledges and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
promiſed in it) hath been made known, and a compleat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
given, with ſuch corolaries and inferences that have been
judged neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Now this covenant thus entred with man in his lapſed eſtate,
and hitherto cleared,<note place="margin">The Old and New Covenant</note> admits of diſtinction; and is diſtinguiſhed in
Scripture by the names of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8. 13.
<hi>The firſt and ſecond covenant,</hi> Heb. 8. 7. The firſt ſome call, and not
unfitly, a covenant of Promiſe; under that covenant Chriſt was
known in promiſes only, and not manifeſted in the fleſh; Others call
it a ſubſervient covenant, being to lead in the ſecond, in its full
luſtre and glory, which alone they call a covenant of Grace, and
make it a third covenant But I ſhall content my ſelf with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-termes,
calling the firſt, <hi>Old,</hi> not becauſe it was firſt in being;
but becauſe it is to be aboliſhed, and another to ſucceed, the later
<hi>New,</hi> becauſe it is never to be antiquated, as the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.
13. explains himſelf. Now, it muſt needs contribute much to the
clear underſtanding of the covenant; as well of the termes of it, as
the mercies in it and be a great advantage for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of ſundry, both Old and New Teſtament-Scripture; in caſe
the agreement between this Old and New covenant, together
with their true differences be rightly aſſigned, and thoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
differences aſſigned by ſome (erroneous on either hand
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55700:119"/>
to the great prejudice of either of the covenants) be throughly
examined.<note place="margin">The method followed in the enſuing part of the Treatiſe.</note> A work of difficulty, but (were it well followed) of
ſingular profit. On this by the help of Gods grace I ſhall adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in the firſt place lay down their agreement, afterwards
their reſpective true and real differences, and then proceed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of ſuch differences which ſome have aſſigned, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to the laſt place, ſeeing in the two firſt I ſhall be brief. The
laſt will be found a buſineſſe full of tedious difficulty, and trouble.
In ſeveral things there is a full agreement between theſe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.<note place="margin">Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Old and New co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in ſix particulars.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>In the Authour propounding,</hi> God is the Authour of them both;
God is <hi>the God, not of the Jews only,</hi> (who were in the firſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant)
<hi>but of the Gentiles alſo,</hi> taken through grace into the ſecond
covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 29.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>In the party accepting,</hi> as ſpecifically conſidered, they are both
entred with man; Neither Angels, nor any other creature articles,
or is articled with in it; and hitherto there is an agreement of both
with the covenant of works.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>In the motive or impulſive cauſe;</hi> Both of theſe are of ſingular
grace, entred with fallen man in his loſt condition; there was
no hint of this grace before the fall, nor any need, or uſe of it, being
not for mans preſervation, but his reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>In the Mediatour Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who was one and the ſame
in both: For though <hi>Moſes</hi> have the name of Mediatour, <hi>Gal.
3 19. Receiving the lively oracles, and giving them to the people,</hi>
Acts 17. 38. as the Judges in <hi>Iſrael</hi> had the name of <hi>Saviours,
Nehem.</hi> 9. 27. and thereupon <hi>Camero</hi> makes this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Old and the New covenant, <hi>That Moſes was Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
in one, Chriſt in the other,</hi> Theſ. 68. yet he confeſſes,
that <hi>that mediation, by the benefit whereof men are truly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
united to God, belongs only unto Chriſt. De trip. foedere. Theſ.
Moſes</hi> work was only to deliver the way of the worſhip of God
in thoſe times, and that not in his own name, but <hi>as a ſervant,
Heb.</hi> 3. 5. He that <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſerve, of whom he wrote, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 46.
that Prophet like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom God promiſed to raiſe, <hi>Deut.</hi>
18. 15. in all ages was Mediatour.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>They agree</hi> in the conditions annext. <hi>Both theſe covenants
have one, and the ſame conditions, on Gods part, Remiſſion of ſins,
and everlaſting happineſſe, as after ſhall be ſhewed more fully;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55700:120"/>
They are the ſame on mans part, Faith and Repentance.</hi> The juſt
<hi>then</hi> did live by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4. And without faith it was then impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb. 11. 6. Acts</hi> 10. 43. To him give all the
Prophets witneſſe, that through his name, whoſoever beleeveth in him
ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins. <hi>God then called for returne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſincerity in our returnes, accepting thoſe that were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi>
Ezek. 18. 31. The eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the
whole earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of thoſe whoſe hearts
are perfect before him, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 26. 9.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>They agree in the unity of Church-felloſhip, conſtituting one
and the ſame Church of Chriſt.</hi> The Church in thoſe dayes in which
the Fathers lived, is one and the ſame Church with this in Goſpel-times.
In Goſpel-times men come from the Eaſt, and Weſt, and
ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob in the Kingdome of heaven,</hi>
Matth. 8. 11. One and the ſame Kingdome receives both. Their
Faith was terminated upon Chriſt as well as ours; <hi>Abraham ſaw
his day and rejoyced,</hi> John 8. 56. <hi>Moſes</hi> bore his reproach, <hi>and
esteemed it greater then the treaſures in Egypt,</hi> Heb. 11. 26. <hi>They
did eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and did drink the ſame ſpiritual drink;
they drank of the Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Chriſt,</hi>
1 Cor. 10. 3. The ſame, not among themſelves, but the ſame with
us. They are ſaved by the ſame free grace and mercy as we;
<hi>Jews by nature,</hi> are juſtified by the ſame faith in Jeſus, <hi>as ſinners
of the Gentiles,</hi> Gal. 2. 15, 16. All theſe identities evidence one
and the ſame Church, ours and theirs; <hi>Therefore ſay I unto you,
the Kingdome of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a Nation
bringing forth the fruits thereof,</hi> Matth. 21. 43. The ſame Kingdom
was taken from them and given to us, was taken from the Jewes,
and given to the Gentiles; where <hi>Sem</hi> left, there <hi>Japhet</hi> took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
<hi>Gen. 9. 27. Sems</hi> Tents are <hi>Japhets.</hi> Theſe ſpeak the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,<note place="margin">The Old and New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one.</note>
into which we have ſucceſſively entred, to be one and
the ſame in ſubſtance. A covenant entred by the ſame parties,
upon the ſame termes and propoſitions on either hand, is the ſame
covenant; Such is the Old covenant entred with the Jewes, and
the New covenant entred with Chriſtians, they are therefore one
and the ſame in ſubſtance.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Differences aſſigned between the Old and New covenant.</head>
                  <p>THeſe covenants, are not in that manner, fully and entirely one,
but there is difference in the way of adminiſtration. They
are one in ſubſtance, conſtituting one Church, one Kingdome; but
different in circumſtances. Upon which account, they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
by the names of the <hi>Old and New, the first and ſecond
Covenant.</hi> Some have made it their ambition to riſe as high as
may be, in the number of differences, and have aſſigned ſeveral,
where there is a full accord and perfect agreement: I ſhall lay
down ſuch where the difference is clear; and afterward take view,
of thoſe imaginary differences upon which any controverſie of
moment hangs.</p>
                  <p>1. They differ <hi>in the agents employed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Differences between the Old and New Covenant.</note> 
                     <hi>in adminiſtration of theſe
reſpective covenants entred of God, and upheld and continued with
his people.</hi> The Old covenant was adminiſtred and held forth by
Servants only, Prophets, Prieſts, and ſuch as God pleaſed to
appoint, whether by ordinary call, as thoſe of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,
who were appointed among men in things appertaining to God.</hi> Or, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
to whom he ſpake in viſions and dreams; <hi>God in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
wayes and manners</hi> (as the Apoſtle to the Hebrews obſerves)
<hi>then ſpeaking to his people,</hi> Heb. 1. 1. The New covenant is held
forth by the Son, as in the ſame place the Apoſtle witneſſeth. He
was the Angel or Meſſenger of the covenant, Upon that errand
he came from the Father, clothed with our fleſh. This is <hi>that
great ſalvation, which firſt began to be ſpoken to us by the Lord,</hi> Heb.
2. 3. And this he carries on, by his delegates and deputies,
whom from the right hand of the Father he gifts and
qualifies.</p>
                  <p>2. They differ <hi>in their extent and latitude, as to the Nations ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into covenant.</hi> The Old covenant received only the Jews; To
them appertained <hi>the Adoption, the Glory, and the Covenants,</hi> Rom.
9. 4. Circumciſion, the Seale of the covenant, was proper to
them, with ſome few of other Nations, that forgetting their own
people, and their fathers houſe, joyned themſeves to them,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55700:121"/>
whileſt other Nations were known by the name of uncircumciſion
being without title to that Seale; and were <hi>without Chriſt, aliens
to the common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenant of
Promiſe,</hi> Eph. 2. 12. Therefore the Apoſtles, before the vaile was
taken away, had that reſtraint upon them, <hi>Matth. 10. 5. Go not
into the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the Samaritans
enter ye not.</hi> The loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (being in covenant)
onely were in their commiſſion. That was a <hi>valley of viſion,</hi>
All other people were in darkneſſe. They <hi>were a people of God,</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were <hi>no people.</hi> The New covenant takes in all Nations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
to the covenant, no Nation hath any barre put to it,
<hi>but in every Nation he that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſſe,
is accepted with him,</hi> Act. 10. 35. Chriſt having taken away the
partition wall; the Apoſtles have a commiſſion for the diſcipling
of all Nations, ſo that in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, There is neither Jew nor Greek,
Scythian nor Barbarian,</hi> Col. 3. 11.</p>
                  <p>3. They differ <hi>in their duration or continuance.</hi> The Old co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
had but its date of time, which being expired, it muſt
give way for the New to ſucceed. Thus the Apoſtle reaſons from
the Prophets prediction, of a New covenant, <hi>Heb. 8. 13. In that
he ſaith, A New covenant, he hath made void the Old; now that
which decayeth and waxeth old, is ready to vaniſh away.</hi> This was
to ſtand <hi>till times of reformation,</hi> Heb. 9 10. This ſecond cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant muſt remaine till the end of time. Theſe are called the
laſt dayes, in that, after theſe there muſt be no change of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
The Miniſtery now eſtabliſhed, is to remaine to the end
of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. and the Sacraments, until Chriſts
ſecond coming unto judgement.</p>
                  <p>4. They differ <hi>in the way of dedication or conſecration.</hi> The Old
covenant was dedicated, and purified with the blood of Bulls and
Goats, and other Sacrifices, which according to the Law were
ſlaine and offered, as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> obſerves from
<hi>Exod. 24. 7, 8. Heb. 9. 19, 20, 21. When</hi> Moſes <hi>had ſpoken every
precept to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of calves
and goats, with water and Scarlet-wool and hyſope, and ſprinkled
both the book and all the people; ſaying, This is the blood of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which God hath enjoyned you. Moreover, he ſprinkled with
blood both the Tabernacle and all the veſſels of the Miniſtery</hi> But
in the New Teſtament, the dedication is in the blood of Chriſt.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55700:121"/>
                     <hi>This is my blood in the New Teſtament ſhed for you, and for many
for the remiſſion of ſins:</hi> Where we ſee, 1. An agreement, Either of
both are Teſtaments and covenants, Either of both have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
Either of both are dedicated in blood; 2. An anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
difference and oppoſition. The firſt was the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be antiquated. The ſecond the New, to ſucceed in place
of the Old. The firſt was dedicated in the blood of Bulls and
Calves. The ſecond in the blood of the Mediatour; <hi>in my blood,</hi>
ſaith Chriſt. The firſt had no poſſible power to take away ſinne,
as the Apoſtle preſently ſhews, <hi>chap. 10. 4. But this is ſhed for
many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The Apoſtle in the words immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before theſe quoted, gives the covenant the name of a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though a covenant, and a mans laſt Will and Teſtament
really differ, ſeeing herein they agree, that the covenant had its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidility,
as a Teſtament, by the death of him that made the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>5. They differ <hi>in the way of exhibition of Chriſt, the glory and
grace of the covenant,</hi> And upon a threefold account here, there
is a difference. 1. In the Old covenant we have Chriſt only in a
Promiſe; to be incarnate, to ſuffer, and to riſe again, and to be
received unto glory. Under that covenant, light was by way of
prophecie; In the New covenant he is evidently ſet forth as come
in the fleſh; Having been dead and now alive, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. Having
ſuffered in the fleſh, riſen again and entred into glory. To us, it
is not a prophecie, but a Goſpel. 2. In the Old covenant, all was
held out to the people under types, figures, ſhadows; All
about the Tabernacle and Temple, Perſons, U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enſils, Sacrifices,
did lead to Chriſt; all of theſe, darkly holding him forth. <hi>They
had a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the image of the things
themſelves,</hi> Heb. 10. 1. a little of reality in a great bulk of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
In the New Teſtament, the truth of it, is clearly, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
(without figure or type) held forth unto us. 3. In
the Old Teſtament, knowledge was dim and obſcure.<note place="margin">The Jews were in a ſtate of light compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</note> It could
be no other, when it was wrapt up in prophecies and types.
A prophecie is a riddle till it be unfolden, and little is known
of a man by his ſhadow, comparative to that which is ſeen in
the man himſelfe.<note place="margin">In a ſtate of darkne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ns.</note> Therefore though the ſtate of the Jewes in
Old Teſtament times was a ſtate of light, comparative to the
darkneſſe that was with other people, and their land was called
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55700:122"/>
                     <hi>a valley of viſions,</hi> Isa. 22. 1. yet it was little more than dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
comparative to that light which in Goſpel times is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Chriſt was a Miniſter of circumciſion, and when he began
his Miniſtery in the land of <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthali;</hi> the Text
ſays, <hi>The people that ſate in darkneſſe ſaw a great light,</hi> Mat. 4. 16.
Circumciſion therfore, in different reſpects, was both a Priviledge,
and a Bondage, A Priviledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1. It was a great mercy to
have light let in at any crevice, promiſes any way ſealed and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to us. A Bondage, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. To live in ſo dim a light, and
to be laden in ſo burdenſome a way, was a heavy yoke; So that, as
the Apoſtle putting the queſtion, <hi>What advantage the Jew had,
and what priviledge there was of circumciſion,</hi> above and before the
Gentile? <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1. anſwers, <hi>Much every way,</hi> and gives in his
reaſon of the preheminence; So, in caſe the queſtion ſhould be put
<hi>What advantage hath the Christian, and what priviledge there is of
Baptiſme,</hi> above and before the Jew? Anſwer may be made Much
every way, and the reaſon given of the preheminence in Goſpel-times,
in the particulars above mentioned; So that, the New co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<hi>is a better covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes,</hi> Heb.
8. 6. Promiſes are more full and clear. Though it muſt be confeſt,
that a Chriſtians preheminence above the Iewes, doth not equal
a Iewes preheminence above the Gentile. The Iew was in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, and was heire of the Promiſe. <hi>The Gentiles
were aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, ſtrangers from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Promiſe; having no hope, and without God in the world,</hi>
Epheſ. 2. 12. The Iew was in the ſame covenant in his time, as
Chriſtians are in Goſpel-times. There is not a promiſe in the New
covenant, whether it be for priviledges, conferred upon us, or
graces wrought in us, but by the help of that light, we may finde
in the Old covenant, the ſame held out, as after will be more
clearly manifeſted. The betterneſſe is, in the greater eaſe being
freed from that bondage, of the ceremonial yoke, and in their
more diſtinct clearneſſe. The glory of all, that the covenant doth
tender, being in ſo clear, and full a way held out in Goſpel-times,
<hi>that he that is leaſt in the Kingdom of God,</hi> under the glory of the
New Teſtament-revelation, <hi>is greater</hi> in the way of Goſpel-My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
<hi>then John Baptiſt,</hi> who was the greateſt of Prophets,
greater than a Prophet. Thoſe Prophets that did foreſee, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew
the Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion of Chriſt,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55700:122"/>
the triumphant conqueſt of his enemies, his glory at the right hand
of his Father, the ſpreading of the Goſpel, the call of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
did not themſelves ſee it; as now the meaneſt that are in
Chriſt do underſtand it, no more than they who now preach
through Chriſt the Reſurrection of the dead, the everlaſting bliſſe
of glorified Saints, in their eternal fruition of Gods preſence, are
able to underſtand it in that meaſure, as the meaneſt that then ſhall
have the happineſſe to enjoy it.</p>
                  <p>6. They differ <hi>in the Seales annext for either of their ratification
and confirmation;</hi> for howſoever they are of the ſame uſe, leading
to one, and the ſame thing ſignified, the Jewes had Chriſt in
their Sacraments, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 4 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 7. and we have no more
in ours; yet they differ in the outward ſtamp or <hi>effigies,</hi> as I may
ſo ſpeak, as well that, of initiation, as that of corroboration:
The initiating Sacrament of the Jewes (which gave them the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
of the people of God) was that painful circumciſion
in the fleſh, <hi>ſignum vile, &amp; incivile,</hi> yet, thoſe that would be the
Lords, did, and muſt ſubmit unto it. All of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed with
him, received that ſigne; And all of thoſe, that with him would
joyne unto the Lord. This was to be the leading Sacrament; He
that was not circumciſed in the fleſh, might not eat of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<hi>Exod 12. 48. And when a ſtranger ſhall ſojourne with thee,
and will keep the Paſſeover unto the Lord, let all his males be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
and then let him come neer and keep it; and he ſhall be as one
that is borne in the land, for no uncircumciſed perſon ſhall eat thereof.</hi>
A full Text againſt all that plead for unbaptized perſons admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the Lords Table, God will not ſuffer that diſorder,
that the leading Sacrament ſhould come after. The initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Sacrament with Chriſtians is that of Baptiſme, no ſooner
was a man brought into covenant, but he was ſtreight baptized;
aſſoon as he made profeſſion, he had this ſealing engaging ſigne,
the application of water, which is of an abſterſive cleanſing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
implying our ſtaine and guilt, and leading us thither, where
purification and freedome is found, the Spirit and blood of Jeſus
Chriſt. The following Sacrament in the Old covenant, was that
of the Paſſeover; a Lamp without blemiſh to be eaten in the
place and way that God preſcribed. That in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is the Supper of the Lord, in ordinary, common, uſeful, and
neceſſary elements, Bread and Wine, which are of a ſtrengthning &amp;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55700:123"/>
cheering nature, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 104. 15. Implying our fainting, feeble eſtate,
our diſconſolate and ſad condition, and leading us, where we may
find both ſtrength and conſolation.</p>

that I may ſpare my paines; yet in brief, That covenant which
teacheth Chriſt, in which men attaine ſalvation, that accepts
men upon repentance, in which there is pardon of ſinne, and
in which the heart is circumciſed of God; that is a covenant of
grace. One of theſe ſingle will evince it, much more in their
joynt ſtrength will they conclude it; But the covenant deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was ſuch a covenant. In that covenant Chriſt
was taught, <hi>John 5. 46, 47. Had ye beleved</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye would
have beleeved me; but if ye beleeve not</hi> Moſes, <hi>how will ye beleeve
my words?</hi> Whence the collection is plaine, Beleevers of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> are Beleevers of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and Rejecters of <hi>Moſes,</hi> are
Rejecters of <hi>Christ:</hi> See <hi>Luke 24. 25, 26. with 44, 45, 46.
John 1. 45. Acts 26. 22, 23. Rom.</hi> 3. 21, 22. The Prophecies,
Promiſes, Types, Genealogies, Sacraments under that covenant
(whether ordinary or extraordinary) all held forth Chriſt as might
be eaſily ſhewn in their ſeveral particulars. In that covenant
the people of the Jews attained ſalvation, and were not only fed
with temporal Promiſes, and a covenant meerly carnal; not
looking above or beyond the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewen:
In this covenant men are accepted, and received into mercy and
favour upon repentance; <hi>When thou art in tribulation, and all
theſe things are come upon thee in the later dayes, if thou turn to the
Lord thy God, and ſhalt be obedient to his voice, (for the Lord thy
God is a merciful God) he will not forſake thee, neither deſtroy thee,
nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he ſware unto them,</hi>
Deut. 4. 30, 31. In this covenant there is pardon of ſinne, (the
great priviledge of the New covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12.) The Lord
proclaimes himſelf to <hi>Moſes; The Lord, the Lord God, merciful,
and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſſe and truth,
keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin,</hi>
Exod. 34. 6, 7. See Exod. 32. 31, 32. 2 Chron. 7. 14. Pſal. 25. 11. Pſal.
51. 12. 7. 9. 14. In this covenant the heart is circumciſed (another
great priviledge of the New covenant, <hi>Heb. 8.) And the Lord thy
God will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the
Lord thy God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments delivered by <hi>Moſes.</hi> were of this Covenant of Grace.</note> All of theſe, any of theſe hold out a covenant of
Grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the ten commandments, which are called the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of God, <hi>Deut. 4. 13. 2 Chron.</hi> 6. 11. (all that <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55700:124"/>
of Grace, and not of Works. This appears in the Preface, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating,
Gods grace and goodneſſe to that people, <hi>bringing
them out of the land of Egypt, and the houſe of Bondage.</hi> Which
deliverance had more in it than a bare temporal mercy; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
their paſſage through the red Sea could have been no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
as the Apoſtle calls it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1. Neither had it been
any act of juſtifying faith in <hi>Moſes</hi> to obſerve the Paſſeover, which
yet the Apoſtle obſerves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 28. Then their Rock and Manna
had been a <hi>viaticum</hi> in the way, but no Sacrament. There God
avoucheth himſelf to be the God of that people; <hi>I am the Lord
thy God,</hi> and he was a God in covenant to none of man-kinde
fallen, but by an act of grace. It appears in the firſt commandment,
where God requires them to accept him, and cleave unto him,
which cannot be done but through Chriſt. It appears in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
commandment; in the preceptive part of it, which contains
the whole ceremonial Law, in which, pardon of ſinne was found
through Chriſt. Thither Interpreters reduce all the Sacrifices,
Types, Sacraments of the Jewes. It appeares in the reaſons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next
to that precept, which, as it threatens judgement on tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours
of the Law; ſo, mercy to thoſe that obſerve it. Mercy
is an act of Grace, and not vouchſafed but in Chriſt. It appears
in the fifth commandment, in the promiſe there annext, and
faſtened to it; So that this covenant (or this ſumme or epitome
of the covenant between God and his people) which was put
into the Arke, and the Mercy-ſeat or propitiatory ſet upon
it, in the moſt holy place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 34. was a covenant of
Grace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Being a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, it could by no means be a Covenant of Works.</note> this covenant (delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> and epitomized
in the Decalogue) being a covenant of Grace, it could by no
meanes be, in the whole and entire nature of it, a covenant of
Works. This is plaine, God doth not at once, with the ſame
people enter covenant upon ſo oppoſite termes. Theſe are
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, either of them deſtructive to the other, We may argue
concerning the covenant, as the Apoſtle doth concerning E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
<hi>If by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is
no more grace; but if it be of works, then it is no more grace, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
work is no more work.</hi> This I ſpeak as for their ſakes, that
make it a mixt covenant, ſuch a one as <hi>Pauls</hi> adverſaries preacht
in the Churches of <hi>Galatia;</hi> ſo alſo for their ſakes, that aſſert it to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55700:124"/>
be a covenant of Works, never undertaking any anſwer to
thoſe arguments, which ſo clearly conclude it to be a covenant of
Grace.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">What this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is to any, it is to all.</note> 
                     <hi>What this covenant is to any, that it is to all, whether it
be of works or of grace; what it is in it ſelfe in the tender and termes
of it, that is the denomination of it.</hi> This is plaine, Mens faith or
unbelief, Mens obedience or tranſgreſſion, cannot diverſifie the
nature of that which God doth tender; And what God ſpake
to the people, he ſpake to all the people, the ſame to all, that he
ſpake to any, <hi>Exodus 19. 25. Exodus</hi> 20. 18. compared, and
therefore that is a miſtake in ſome that ſay, <hi>That the Law is,
doubtleſſe a pure covenant of Works to ſome men, but not to all.
It is a covenant of works, occaſionally and accidentally, and not only to
thoſe which are not related to, comprehended in, or made partakers of
the covenant of Grace.</hi> He ſhould rather have ſaid, that the ten
commandments had been a covenant of Grace, but ſometimes by
an accident or eſpecial occaſion had become a covenant of Works,
which yet could not have held. The covenant of Grace and the
covenant of Works are two diſtinct and oppoſite <hi>Species,</hi> They
have one and the ſame univocal <hi>Genus,</hi> of whoſe nature they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
partake. Therefore as an Oxe can by no occaſion or
accident, be a Horſe, or a Horſe a Sheep, or a Sheep a Lion, or
a Lion a man; ſo a covenant of Grace, can by no occaſion or
accident be a covenant of Works; one and the ſame thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for one end, may occaſionally and accidentally have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
event; as the Miniſtery intending ſalvation, may prove
an aggravat on of condemnation; but no occaſion or accident
can change the nature of any thing, into that which is of a kind
oppoſite to it, and different from it. And, in ſuch caſes where the
event is hindred, and another happens; the denomination is,
and muſt be, from the primary intention. The Apoſtle calls the
Goſpel <hi>the power of God to ſalvation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Under <hi>Moſes</hi> his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were frequent and full, ſpiritual promiſes were rare and more obſcure.</note> Rom. 1. 16. The word is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the word of Life,</hi> though to ſome through their obſtinacy, it
turns to condemnation, and to death. If our author in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
take liberty to differ from all (as himſelf profeſſeth) I hope
he will not be diſpleaſed, if all differ from him, <hi>Hanc veniam peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſque,

                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>In</hi> Moſes <hi>time, and under his adminiſtration, commands
were frequent and full, as well ceremonial, as moral, as alſo menaces.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55700:125"/>
The directive, and maledictive part of the Law; were clear and open,
for diſcovery of ſinne, to work to a ſenſe of danger, to put them in a
poſture to look for and long after the Meſſiah; But the promiſes more
obſcure, (I mean the promiſes of eternity) ſcarce known, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then as they were ſhadowed out in temporal things.</hi> This (as the
Apoſtle ſhews) was figured by that vaile, which was before
<hi>Moſes</hi> his face, when he ſpake with the people upon the renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Tables, <hi>Moſes</hi> his face upon his converſe with God in
the <hi>Mount,</hi> ſhone with that glory, that <hi>Aaron</hi> and all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were afraid to come nigh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 30. Afterwards
he ſpeaks to the people, and talks with them; <hi>And till he had
done ſpeaking with them, he put a vaile before his face,</hi> verſe 33.
Whereupon the Apoſtle having entred compariſon between the
Miniſters of the Law, and the Miniſters of the Goſpel, alludes to
this vaile before <hi>Moſes</hi> his face, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14. in theſe words,
<hi>Seeing then we have ſuch hope,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we uſe great plainneſſe of
ſpeech, and not as</hi> Moſes <hi>which put a vaile over his face, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of</hi> Iſrael <hi>could not ſtedfaſtly look to the end of that which is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
but their mindes were blinded;</hi> Upon which <hi>Diodati</hi> ſaith; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Miniſtry kept the people under the ſhadows of ceremonies, without
contemplating the myſteries which were figured by them to the bottom,
which was reſerved for the time of the Goſpel,</hi> Heb. 10. 4. <hi>Whereof
was a figure that vaile on</hi> Moſes <hi>his face; Not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that, that
was the end of that act of</hi> Moſes, <hi>but of that which the Apoſtle ſaith,
may be allegorically underſtood thereby, namely of the obſcure diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law;</hi> Which obſcure diſpenſation meeting with that
blindneſſe that was in the judgements of that people, held them
in ſuch ignorance, that they ſaw little of Grace in that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
but rather through their blinde miſtake, looked upon
it (the generality of them) as a covenant of Works. And this
the Apoſtle ſignifies in the place before quoted, as alſo, <hi>Rom. 10.
3. They being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſſe, and going about to
eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the
righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> This cauſed them ſo tenaciouſly to hold
to the precepts of the Law (eſpecially to the ceremonial part,
which though more burdenſome, yet was eaſilier fitted to their
corruption) that they refuſed Chriſt the end of the Law for
righteouſneſſe ſake, to every one that beleeveth, <hi>Rom.</hi>
10. 3.</p>

Seventhly,<note place="margin">There was ſo much of Grace and Chriſt held out in the Old Covenant to leave them without excuſe.</note> 
                     <hi>There was yet ſo much of grace, and Chriſt held out
in this covenant, that they were not only left without excuſe, that
were under it; but convinced of ſin, if they ſaw not Chriſt and the
grace of the covenant in it.</hi> Chriſt in his conteſt with the Jewes
(who would not receive him, but ſtood in oppoſition, and raiſed
perſecution againſt him,) appeales to the Scriptures, Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Scriptures;
<hi>Search the Scriptures, for they teſtifie of me, and in
them you think to have eternal life,</hi> Iohn 5. 39. Where we ſee a
double <hi>encomium</hi> of the Scriptures. 1. From the Iewes own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,
In them eternal life may be found. 2. From the
teſtimony they give of Chriſt, In them, upon ſearch, Chriſt may
be found; There are ſuch diſcoveries there, that hold him out,
and eternal life in him, to thoſe that ſearch them. And they
ſuſpecting, by that intimacy of communion that he profeſt to have
with the Father, and the heavy charge that he laid upon them,
that he was about to accuſe them to the Father; Chriſt puts it off
from himſelf, and puts it upon one that they had leaſt in ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even <hi>Moſes, Moſes</hi> in whom they truſted, in whom they
pretended to repoſe confidence; It is he that is ready to accuſe
them, not of breach of the Law, or tranſgreſſion of any command
of his, (which they could eaſilier have beleeved) but of unbeliefe
of <hi>Moſes; You have one that accuſeth you, even</hi> Moſes, <hi>in whom you
truſt; for had ye beleeved</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye would have beleeved me, for he
wrote of me.</hi> Unbelief in Chriſt, ſet forth in <hi>Moſes,</hi> is a ſinne,
which <hi>Moſes</hi> his writings ſhall charge upon them. So alſo in that
ſpeech of Chriſt to the two diſciples in the way to <hi>Emmaus, O ye
fools and ſlow of heart, to beleeve all that the Prophets have ſpoken;
ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered thoſe things, &amp; to enter into his glory?</hi>
where we ſee them charged with ſin, in that they underſtood not
Chriſt in the Prophets,<note place="margin">Many phraſes in uſe under the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly holding out a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, according to Scripture uſe hold out a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</note> Chriſt in <hi>Moſes,</hi> as follows there in the

                  <p>Eightly, <hi>There are thoſe phraſes in</hi> Moſes, <hi>which are ordinarily

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55700:126"/>
to Scripture-uſe of the phraſe, they hold out a covenant of
Grace, and the termes and conditions of it;</hi> To inſtance in ſome few,
<hi>Deut. 4. 1. Now therefore hearken, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>unto the ſtatutes, and
unto the judgements which I teach you to do them, that ye may live,
and go in and poſſeſſe the land which the Lord God of your fathers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
you,</hi> Deut. 5. 33. <hi>You ſhall walk in all the wayes which the Lord
your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be
well with you; and that ye may prolong your dayes in the land which
ye ſhall poſſeſſe,</hi> Deut. 30. 16. <hi>In that I command this day to
love the Lord thy God, to walk in his wayes and to keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and his ſtatutes, and his judgements, that thou mayeſt live
and multiply, and the Lord thy God ſhall bleſſe thee in the land whither
thou goest to poſſeſſe it.</hi> Deut. 6. 24, 25. <hi>And the Lord commanded
us to do all theſe ſtatutes, to fear the Lord our God for our good always,
that he might preſerve us alive as it is this day. And it ſhall be our
righteouſneſſe if we obſerve to do all theſe commandments before the
Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.</hi> We may ſo interpret
thoſe Scriptures (and the Jewes, as it appears for a great part, did
ſo interpret them) that they hold out a covenant of Works, when
Grace was not at all acknowledged to aſſiſt in doing, nor Chriſt
known at all to ſatisfie for failing, and to expiate for tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Theſe ſeeing nothing but a reward upon labour, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in caſe of tranſgreſſion. They may yet be ſo interpreted as
taking Grace, in the Work for change of the heart, and putting it
into a poſture for obedience, according to that even in <hi>Moſes,</hi>

love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, that

of truth and ſincerity of obedience. In this ſenſe (which they
may well bear, and I take to be their native ſenſe) here is no more
than what we finde in the Goſpel, from Chriſt and the Apoſtles.

5. 28. <hi>To them that by patient continuing in well-doing, ſeek for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

places)
we may ſee, that according to the New covenant, a man
may make the attaining of life, the end of his work, and the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

the perfect Law of Liberty, and continueth therein, not being a forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hearer, but a doer of the word, that man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed,
James</hi> 1. 25. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>We are kept by the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1 5. Our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not in our own keeping, It is not our own care, that frees
us from deſtruction; yet <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that is begotten of God
ſinneth not, and keepeth himſelf, that the wicked one toucheth him not,</hi>
1 John 5. 18. Here are the ſame words affirmed, and denied, and
both from one and the ſame mouth of truth; a different ſenſe
therefore is to be enquired after. A righteouſneſſe, which is the
condition of the covenant of Works; out of our own inherent
ſtrength and abilities, in an exact perfection, is denied, a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
not of us, but through grace wrought in us, in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which the covenant of Grace calls for, is aſſerted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">Though <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> delivered a Covenant of Grace to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet the Law is ſometime ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſenſe as to hold forth a Covenant of Works.</note> Though the whole Law that <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered from God
on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to the people (and is among the ſacred Oracles of
God for poſterity) do containe a covenant of Grace, yet the Law
is taken ſometime in that ſtrict ſenſe, as containing a covenant of
Works, and holding forth life upon condition of perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
So the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6. puts an oppoſition between
the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and the righteouſneſs of Faith; So
alſo <hi>Gal. 3. 18. If righteouſneſſe be by the Law, it is no more of
Promiſe,</hi> So that, there is a neceſſity of diſtinguiſhing, between <hi>the
Law, abſtracted from the Promiſe,</hi> the Promiſe of Chriſt, I meane
the Evangelical Promiſe, and the Law, <hi>including this Promiſe,</hi> and
writing of Chriſt Jeſus, ſo that the works of the Law, conſidered
in the bare mandatory part of it, can ſave none; <hi>If righteouſneſſe
come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vaine;</hi> yet the righteouſneſs
<hi>witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteouſneſſe of God
which is by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 3. 21, 22. is, our juſtification,
and brings ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, 22. And no marvel, that <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and the Law delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhould be taken in Scripture in ſo
different an acception; when circumciſion, that leading ceremony
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55700:127"/>
of the Law, is ſometimes looked upon as a Priviledge, as hath
been ſhewed, and a ſaving Ordinance, <hi>Rom. 3. 1. Rom.</hi> 4. 11. And
ſometimes as a yoke, <hi>A yoke that neither our fathers nor we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bear; Acts</hi> 15. 10. yea, as a deadly ceremony, dividing and
cutting off from Chriſt. <hi>I</hi> Paul <hi>ſay unto you, if you be circumciſed,
Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing,</hi> Gal. 5. 2. So that the Law abſtracted
from Chriſt, as the greater part of the Jews took it) was a Miniſtry
of condemnation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. It could never reach ſo high as ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but including Chriſt, it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. The Apoſtles thinks he can never ſufficiently vilifie the
ceremonial Fabrick, looked upon, as abſolute of it ſelf, without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
relation; We ſee what titles he gives thoſe Ordinances, <hi>Weak
and beggarly elements,</hi> Gal. 4. 9. <hi>Rudiments of this world,</hi> Col. 2. 8.
But being taken in their relative conſideration, as a School-maſter
to Chriſt, they are <hi>an attonement, a ſweet ſavour,</hi> they are ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

out of Covenant with God, being no Church-Members, having
no title to Church-Memberſhip, are in a periſhing condition, is a
Scripture-Poſition above all exceptions. In caſe they will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,

declare that they ſeek a Countrey.</hi> A ſtranger, or pilgrim, is a man
not at his home, but ſeeks a countrey. Now this countrey muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

follows, as he inferres, that <hi>they ſought a better countrey, that is,
an Heavenly,</hi> Heb. 11. 16. Men of this opinion have not only the
Apoſtles authority againſt them, but (putting himſelf on in a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
diſpute with them) his reaſons likewiſe, yea, thoſe that
were moſt carnal, and earthly-minded among them, were taught
to judge better of the Promiſes, that they lived under; Chriſt
gives that teſtimony of the Jewes, with whom he had conteſt,
that in the Scriptures they thought to have everlaſting life,
<hi>John</hi> 5. 39. They had no Scriptures but Old Covenant-Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and of them, they had this opinion, which was no errour
of theirs corrected by Chriſt, but were by him confirmed in it,
Chriſt juſtifies them in their opinion, that in Scripture they
thought to have everlaſting life, and rectifies them in the way of
finding everlaſting life in it. A great part of the diſpute is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

injurious are they to the Covenant of God with his people, that
put ſuch unworthy limits upon it: Other people that were

protected, and provided for by him; <hi>Leave thy fatherleſſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

people of God in Covenant did enjoy; But if this gloſſe of the
Covenant may ſtand, the dogs crumbs, are beyond all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens

4. In caſe all were granted, yet they know not how to bring
any thing home, of all that they ſay, to ſerve their own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts.
Their expreſſions, I ſay, are untoward, in denying purity
of Goſpel in the firſt Covenant, and affirming a mixture. That
which is not pure, but mixt, is a compound of pure and impure;
ſuch that hath ſome ingredients, ſuch as they ought, and others
ſuch that make all adulterate: <hi>As ſilver mingled with dreſſe, or
wine with water,</hi> Iſa. 1. 22. The falſe teachers (Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
adverſaries) preach ſuch a mixt Goſpel, when they urged with
ſuch vehemency a mixture of works, which cauſed the Apoſtle
to ſtand in ſuch feare of the <hi>Corinthians, leſt they ſhould be drawn
away from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 2. They do
not beleeve that the Goſpel which <hi>Paul</hi> tells us was preached
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3. 8. was any ſuch impure Goſpel, this ſure is
not their meaning, they dare not ſay that <hi>Abraham</hi> was under
any ſuch deluſion; What then can be the meaning, but that he
had promiſes, not only of bliſſe, and in reference to eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
but alſo promiſes of earthly concernment, as that of
the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and his plantation there? <hi>The Covenant takes
its denomination from the Promiſes,</hi> (ſaith one of them) <hi>but the
Promiſes are mixt; ſome Evangelical, belonging to thoſe to whom
the Goſpel belongeth; ſome are domeſtick or civil Promiſes, ſpecially
reſpecting the houſe of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the policie of</hi> Iſrael. To
this I readily agree, and then the diſtinction falls to nothing;
Seeing in Goſpel times, in New Teſtament-dayes, this will deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
a not pure, but mixt Goſpel as well as in thoſe times, we
our ſelves are under ſuch a Goſpel as well as the Jewes. I know

give the denomination, and not ſuch that are annext as Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants

                  <p>3. As the proof is weak, to make the Covenant not a pure
Goſpel-covenant, but mixt; ſo, they are not conſtant to

and being not conſidered, as a leading Sacrament of the whole

                     <hi>There are very many like teſtimonies, by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that Chriſtians were heretofore perſwaded that there was no ſo
great difference between circumciſion and baptiſme; and why, ſaith
he, is it now changed? Truly in favour of the Papiſts, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the pleaſure of the Ieſuites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, if circumciſion have reſpect to thoſe Promiſes that
were no Goſpel mercies, but civil, domeſtical, reſtrained to Jews,
and not appertaining to Chriſtians; How could it be a diſtinction
between Jew and Gentile reſpective to Religion? it might have
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55700:132"/>
made a civil diſtinction, and the want of it have been an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
againſt other Nations, that they had been none of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, and that their
intereſt had not been in <hi>Canaan.</hi> But how it could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
them to have been <hi>without Chriſt, ſtrangers from the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world,</hi> as
the Apoſtle determines upon their uncircumciſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 11, 12.
cannot be imagined.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How is it that we hear ſo much in Scripture of <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of the heare</hi> Jer. 4. 4. Rom. 2. 28. Deut. 10. 16. Deut. 30. 6.
Ezek. 44. 9. and the circumciſed to have this character, that
<hi>they worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth;</hi> if circumciſion have not
relation to Promiſes that are ſpiritual? When complaint is
made of uncircumciſion in heart, is it not (as it is ordinarily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood)
that their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ndes were carnal, and not taken up with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things or is it that they were not fixt on their civil and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
intereſts? when they are ſaid to be uncircumciſed, as <hi>Ier.</hi>
6. 10. is it not upon that account that <hi>Ieremy</hi> there gives, that
<hi>they could not hear the Word of the Lord, that they had no delight in
it, that it was a reproach to them;</hi> or is it becauſe they could not
ſuck in Promiſes of meer civil, home, and ſelf-intereſts? So it
muſt need be if circumciſion be ſuch a Seale, when they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
it for the uſe to which it was inſtituted, they kept
the right uſe of it, and were not worthy of reproof concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, what Sacraments had the Jewes of any Goſpel-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if this reſpected alone their civil intereſts? There might
be more ſpoken to that of the Paſſeover, to carry it to peculiar
National mercies, than to this of circumciſion. See</hi> Exod. 13.
14, 15. And it ſhall be when thy ſinne asketh thee in time to come,
ſaying, What is this? that thou ſhalt ſay unto him, By ſtrength of

And it came to paſſe when Pharao<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> would hardly let us go, that the

of man, and the firſt-borne of beaſts; therefore I ſacrifice unto the
Lord all that openeth the Matrix, being males; but all the firſt-born
of my children, I redeem. <hi>I am ſure far leſſe can be ſaid to
carry it to that which is ſpiritual, and of common concernment
both to Jews and Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:55700:132"/>
Fifthly, how is it that the Apoſtle giving a definition of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
refers it to nothing national, civil, or domeſtick; but
only to that which is purely ſpiritual, Speaking of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
he ſaith; <hi>He received the ſigne of Circumciſion, a ſeale of the
righteouſneſſe of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumciſed?</hi>
The righteouſneſſe of faith, is a Promiſe purely Evangelical,
<hi>Romanes 3. 22. Romanes 3. 30. Romanes 10. 3. Philippians</hi>
3. 8. and this Circumciſion ſealed, the ſelf-ſame thing that
our Sacraments ſeale; So that as their extraordinary Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are expreſſely affirmed to be the ſame with ours, by
the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 3 They eat all the ſame ſpiritual
meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink,</hi> ſo are their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
eſtabliſhed Sacraments, Circumciſion, and the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.
Will they with <hi>Bellarmine, lib. 1. cap. 17. de Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis
in genere,</hi> deny, that <hi>Circumciſion was an univerſal ſeale
of faith, and affirme that it was only an individual ſeale of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
faith of</hi> Abraham, that ſo all may fall to the ground
which is ſpoken from that Text of the uſe of Circumciſion to
the Jewes, all that is there ſpoken, having reference only to
<hi>Abraham</hi> in perſon; I anſwer, 1. This Popiſh ſhift is flat
againſt the Apoſtle; He brings it as an argument for proof
of the way, of our Juſtification to be by faith alone, which
were a meer inconſequence, if proper to him, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to others. 2. It is flat againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> who referres
this of circumciſion to the covenant there mentioned, <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
17. 7. But the covenant is not with <hi>Abraham</hi> alone, but
his ſeed alſo together with him, as is there plaine. 3. It
carries ſeveral abſurdities with it. (1.) By this meanes
Gods covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> in perſon, and his covenant
with Chriſtians in Goſpel-times is indeed the ſame; but his
covenant with all beleevers in the Old Teſtament and with
beleevers in the New Teſtament are eſſentially differing. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and New-Teſtament beleevers, are under one cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
Old Teſtament-beleevers are under a covenant eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
differing. (2.) Then <hi>Zachary, Luke</hi> 1. 72. inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
the covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> of ſalvation by
Chriſt ſhould have limited it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not extended it
to the Fathers; But we ſee all are there, under one and the
ſame mercy; our father <hi>Abraham;</hi> and all that followed
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55700:133"/>
him, even all that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were for <hi>Canaan,</hi>
are called Fathers, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. 1. All our Fathers were
under the cloud, and all paſſed through the ſea, and all
theſe had the ſame mercy in promiſe with <hi>Abraham. To
performe the mercy</hi> (ſaith <hi>Zachary) promiſed to our Fathers,
and to remember his holy covenant, the Oath which he ſware to our
father</hi> Abraham. (3.) Then <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf in perſon, and
Chriſtians in the dayes of the Goſpel are intereſſed in Chriſt,
and all other beleevers in the Law were without Chriſt; but
the contrary is plain. <hi>Moſes</hi> eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt
greater than the treaſures of <hi>Egypt, Heb.</hi> 11. 26. (4.) Then
<hi>Abraham</hi> and Chriſtians have from God the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and ſalvation; but the reſt of the Jewes have nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> They have no more than the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
reaches unto, and the ſeale of the covenant did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm;
But the covenant reaches only temporal Promiſes, as
the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in their opinion. Theſe evaſions <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
is put to, and Anabaptiſts are glad to follow, both of them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſay any thing rather than confeſſe a truth.</p>
                  <p>But they ſay,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> This was a ſeale to <hi>Abraham, of the righteouſneſſe

The whole of the Nation then is in covenant. <hi>Then will I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
my covenant with</hi> Jacob, <hi>and my covenant with</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and alſo
my covenant with</hi> Abraham <hi>will I remember, and will remember
the land,</hi> Levit. 26. 42. The Apoſtles authority puts it out
of queſtion, Reckoning up the priviledges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> according
to the fleſh, nine in number, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. This is one, <hi>The
covenants, Iſrael</hi> then after the fleſh was in covenant; All
<hi>Iſrael</hi> were the covenant-people of God. There were many not
Elect, not Regenerate; but there was not a man not in covenant,
not owned of God as viſibly his; <hi>Thou haſt avouched the Lord this
day to be thy God.—And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be
his people,</hi> Deut. 26. 17, 18. This was the ſtate of the Church of old.
But now, as is affirmed, it is far otherwiſe. God is not ſo large in
his priviledges, nor ſo ample in his munificence, none have honour
to be in covenant in Goſpel-times, but real beleevers, men truly

are many expreſſions, ordinarily found in many Orthodox Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and like paſſages frequently heard in Sermons from godly
Miniſters, ſeemingly implying, if not aſſerting it, and reſtraining
the covenant onely to the elect and regenerate. As when they give
Marks and ſignes of mens being in covenant with God, this muſt
needs imply that ſome profeſſing Chriſtians are in covenant with
God, and ſome without, which is yet farther evidenced, when
they conclude, that in caſe a man be in covenant with God, then
happineſſe and ſalvation follows; But when theſe men fully explain
themſelves, they yeeld up again to us, that which ſeemingly they
had taken from us, and ordinarily do diſtinguiſh of an outward,
and inward covenant, acknowledging the outward covenant to
be made with every member of the Church and the Parents, with
that hear and profeſſedly accept the promiſes, and their children,
But the inward covenant as they ſay, belongs to them onely, that
receive the benefits of it, and are upright in it. An eminent
Divine putting the Queſtion, and returning anſwer, How a man
may know himſelf to be in covenant with God; preſently foreſees
an Objection againſt any ſuch Quaere. As <hi>Saul</hi> and all the people
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in covenant with God, ſo all profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
are covenanters likewiſe; and hereby all diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
notes of Profeſſors, ſome in covenant, and ſome without
muſt needs fall to the ground, one member then of the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
having no being for ſolution of the doubt, he layes down
a diſtinction.<note place="margin">Diſtinctions holding forth the meaning of theſe Divines in theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> 
                     <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a twofold covenant. 1. A ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Covenant which God makes with his children when they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
which is this; if ye will believe, repent, and walk in my ways,
ye ſhall be ſaved, now if they break this condition, God is freed.
2. A double covenant to performe both parts, which is this, if you will
repent and beleeve, ye ſhall be ſaved, and I will give you an heart,
and you ſhall repent, believe, and be ſaved:</hi> So <hi>Preſton</hi> on Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
<hi>part 2. page</hi> 85. 86. Theſe diſtinctions, plainly yeeld
that there is a covenant between God and man, in this lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
of which we ſpeak, and which here is expreſt, and that
all profeſſed Chriſtians ſo called, are in an outward and ſingle
covenant, which puts them into a capacity of Sacraments, and
their children, which is a covenant properly ſo called, and
which Scripture holds out for the covenant of God with his
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55700:135"/>
people. Theſe Divines yeelding ſo much, and their meaning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo Orthodox, there is no reaſon of contraverſie with them,
or contention about words; Yet I ſhould chooſe rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

which Antipaedobaptiſts, and Independents have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from Jeſuites, and we have them all in this, as in many
other things our Adverſaries, <hi>To be in covenant,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is taken
two ways, either according to tiole to the covenant, or to the benefits of
the covenant. He is ſaid to be in covenant, that either obtaines the
benefits of the covenant, which are remiſſion of ſinnes, adoption, &amp;c.
Or elſe that hath onely the title, and outward badge of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
ſo that he is repute to have intereſt in it, and is not an alien from
it.</hi> The right of covenant belongs to all that externally make
profeſſion. Theſe engage themſelves upon Gods termes. The
benefit of the covenant, remiſſion of ſinnes, juſtification, adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp;c. belongs only to the Elect regenerate. Or farther we
may diſtinguiſh of the covenant of grace, and the grace fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the covenant, The covenant of grace is in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
before mentioned, the grace following the covenant in
that reſtriction that ſome contend for, or elſe we may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of entring covenant, and ſtedfaſtneſſe and faithfulneſſe in
the covenant; All enter that are viſible profeſſors, onely the elect
and faithful are ſteady in it. This diſtinction is evidently ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on <hi>Pſal. 78. 34. They remembred that God was their rock, the
high God their Redeemer, nevertheleſs their heart was not right in
them, neither were they stedfaſt in his covenant.</hi> All covenant-enterers,
are not covenant-keepers. To take off this reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and for overthrow of this imaginary difference, it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to require of theſe Aſſerters of this covenant-reſtriction,
and limit, where God hath put any ſuch reſtraint, for <hi>affirmanti
incumbit probatio,</hi> and to require ſome reaſon, why men in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in Old Teſtament-times, ſhould be honoured with that neare
relation to God, as to be of the Common-wealth of this people,
enjoying not barely civil and domeſtick Priviledges, but ſaving
Ordinances, and under the Goſpel, muſt ſtand ſhut out of all
ſuch viſible relations, why unregenerate men in order to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
may not come under the diſcipline of God under the
Goſpel, as well as under Old Teſtament-diſpenſations? Why

poore ſinners that confeſſe with their mouth with the Eunuch,
that Jeſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. may not be
indulged thoſe proviledges (now Chriſt is come in the fleſh to
ſave ſinners) whereby they may be brought to be beleeve with the
heart that they may be ſaved? To thoſe that would make ſuch
a diſtance between the covenants, as to throw out of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God, and viſible communion, all that are unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
we may ſpeak in Chriſts words, <hi>From the beginning it was

and make it appear, that the Goſpel doth not only not quit
us of it, but eſtabliſhes it; doth not only not aboliſh it (as it
doth the Types of the Law) but holds it forth, and gives teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

claime to ſalvation by him;<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19</note> this ground being laid, in which I
think I have not an adverſary, I draw from hence a twofold Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that covenant between God and man, which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Miniſtry of man to work, to judge of being wrought,
and to put to a Seale for confirmation of it, is a covenant one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
viſibly entred, and doth not require any inward real change,
or work upon the ſoule to the being of it. This Propoſition is
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:55700:136"/>
clear, man can judge no farther than of that which is outward and
viſible, <hi>Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on the heart.</hi> If none but a regenerate elect perſon be in
covenant, then none but God knowes who are in covenant.
Then we may apply that of the Apoſtle ſpoken of the Seal of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
<hi>The Lord knoweth them that are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. unto
every one that as a Church-member, is to be received into viſible
fellowſhip; A Church-member, and an elect perſon, according
to this tenent are <hi>termini convertibiles;</hi> and the ſeale of the Spirit,
and the ſeale of the Sacrament are in equal latitude; To baptize an
unregenerate perſon is to put a ſeal to a blank, as high an abuſe of
that ſacred Ordinance, as the circumciſion of the <hi>Sichemites, Gen.</hi>
34. 24. That this covenant is ſuch, appears in that Text, It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to man to work, and to judge of it being wrought, to put
a ſeal for ratification and confirmation of it. The Apoſtles were
to make Diſciples, to bring men into covenant with God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcipled, to baptiſe them, ſealing them, as Gods in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
So <hi>John 4. 1, 2. When the Lord know that the Phariſees had
heard that Jeſus made and baptized more diſciples then</hi> John, <hi>though
Jeſus baptized not, but his Diſciples.</hi> Here <hi>John</hi> made Diſciples,
and baptized them being made; The Diſciples of Ieſus
made Diſciples, and baptized them being made; An outward
work then to make profeſſion of the faith, is ſufficient to
make one a Diſciple, and to bring him within the verge of the
covenant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That which a whole Nation, in Gods ordinary
way of adminiſtration is in a capacity to attaine, and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
is a covenant onely profeſſed, viſibly entred upon, and doth
not require any inward change, or work upon the ſoule to the
being of it; this is plaine, It cannot be expected in Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way, that a Nation ſhould be brought forth at once, all
really holy and ſanctified, Such a field hath not been ſeen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tares, Such a floore without chaffe, Such a draw-net without
any fiſh that is bad; Such a Feaſt and no one without a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
garment; But whole Nations are in a capacity, in Gods
ordinary way of working, to enter into this covenant, as is plaine
in the Text; The whole of the Nation, is, in their commiſſion,
where they come, and in many Nations it hath had happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
Whole Nations without exceptions (unleſſe ſtrangers
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55700:136"/>
ſo journing) have been brought within covenant. One would
faine faſten another interpretation on thoſe words,<note place="margin">The literal grammatical ſenſe of the words vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</note> and make the
commiſſion to ſound, not according to the letter of the words,
nor yet according to the ſucceſſe by grace attained, but to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and therefore is put to it to change the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,

<hi>diſciple all Nations,</hi> it will be, <hi>make diſciples in all Nations.</hi> This
he thinks is very tolerable, becauſe <hi>to diſciple,</hi> and <hi>to make diſciples</hi>
is all one. But though they may be one in themſelves, yet it
makes a maine difference in the phraſe, and with the addition of
his prepoſition, inverts the whole meaning of the words, as to
the thing in controverſie, which is ſuch a violence offered to the
Text, as is not to be endured in him, that is about to draw a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
argument
for his advantage againſt an adverſary. And as
it is againſt the letter of the Text, ſo it is plainly againſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours

unto all Nations in this place was in oppoſition to the reſtriction,</hi>

to which there they were limitted, the whole of the Nation was

and conſequently ſo it was to be in other Nations, by vertue
of this happy enlargement, or elſe the oppoſition is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken away, the meaning of the words clouded, and the
Apoſtles at a loſſe for the underſtanding of them; Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

how ſhall they underſtand the words, unleſſe the whole

accord the prophecies of Scripture, for the calling of the
Nations of the Gentiles, <hi>God ſhall enlarge Japhet, and he ſhall
dwell in the tents of</hi> Sem, <hi>Gen. 9. 27. Sem</hi> was wholly in covenant,

                  <p>A ſecond Text holding out the covenant in its ancient la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,<note place="margin">2. Mat. 22. 14.</note>
we have from our Saviour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 16</note> 
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 16. and 22.
14. <hi>Many are called, but few choſen.</hi> The cloſe of two ſeveral
Parables: The one of the labourers hired into the Vineyard,
where ſome claimed a more large pay upon merit: The other,
of the Parable of the Wedding-feaſt, where one intruded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Wedding garment; whence our Saviour inferres, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are called,</hi> are of the number of gueſts at the wedding feaſt, are
of the labourers in the Vineyard, but <hi>few are choſen;</hi> from whence
I thus argue; If there be a call from God in the times of the
New Teſtament in a farre greater latitude than the grace of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
that, of many called, few only are elected; then the
covenant in New Teſtament-times, is not to be reſtrained to the
elect and regenerate, but containes all that profeſſedly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the termes of the covenant, and viſibly appear a people of
God. This is evident, ſeeing the call is, into covenant, all at the
Feaſt were called ones, all the hired labourers were covenant-ſervants.
To conceive men to be called of God, and not to be
in covenant with God, is a full contradiction. The call hath its
<hi>terminus à quo,</hi> and its <hi>terminus ad quem;</hi> a ſtate which upon call
they leave; and a new ſtate on which they enter. They are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this call in a nearer relation to God, than the reſt of the
world, otherwiſe they were the ſame as ever, and not called at
all, they are not in ſo neare a relation, as men borne of the
Spirit, ſo they were elected. They have a call by the Word, and
miniſterial outward Ordinances, to which they yeeld a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſubjection. They have not attained the inward working of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55700:138"/>
the Spirit to a real Sanctification. Now for the Aſſumption,
that there is a call in New Teſtament-times in this latitude, in a
far greater latitude than the grace of Election, our Saviour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
ſhews in the Text quoted; There are thoſe at the feaſt
that are not accepted; There are thoſe that are taken into the
Vineyard, that at the evening of the day do diſpleaſe, there are
thoſe therefore that are called into covenant with God, and
yet are rejected of God, a full, and a clear Text for covenant-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
                  <p>This is farther evident in thoſe Parables of our Saviour Chriſt,

field (expreſſely compared to the Kingdome of Heaven, and the
great houſe) the Church is underſtood, which ſtands in covenant-relation
to God, and containes thoſe that are in covenant with
God. A man in the Kingdome of Heaven is a man in covenant
with God, unleſſe he ſtood in a covenant-relation, he could have
no ſtanding there; and the compariſon were very ſtrangely drawn,
if this Kingdome thus ſet out, had all that were good, none
bad in it. But of this more, when I ſhall ſpeake to ſome Corolaries
that follow from this Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>Another Scripture, in which the covenant, in the ancient la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
is held out, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. thoroughout a great part of the
chapter. There is (as all know) a large diſcourſe of the Apoſtaſie
of the Jews, and the call of the Gentiles, of the rejection and
breaking off of the one; and the taking in, and ingraffing of the
other, which I ſhall preſently have a further occaſion to open,
when I ſhall ſpeak to another pretended difference between the
covenant, as it ſtood then, and as it ſtands now. In the meane
time this is clear, into the ſame Church-ſtate, and covenant-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
from which the Jews fell, Gentiles were taken in, and do
ſtill continue. This cannot be denied, we being graffed in their
ſtead, come in upon like termes as they left. They fell from a
viſible Church ſtate, and that latitude of covenant which did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
regenerate and unregenerate, juſtified and unjuſtified. That
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55700:138"/>
covenant-latitude then ſtill remaines in the Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
in Goſpel-times. Nothing here that I can ſee can with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
be objected, unleſſe any will ſay, that the inviſible Church
is there ſpoken to, and not the viſible, that the Jews fell from the
inviſible body, and that the Gentiles in their call are generally
taken in, into the ſame fellowſhip. Which (as I think) few will
affirme; ſo I ſhall have preſently occaſion to examine. If any
ſhall further ſay, that they have this title, in <hi>Foro Eccleſiae,</hi> and
not in <hi>Foro Dei;</hi> as to men they have ſo far right, that Miniſters
may not refuſe them, or in their adminiſtrations deny them admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
but in the ſight of God, who knows their unregenerate &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified
condition, they have no title at all, I ſhall refer them to the
whole tenor of that chapter, where they ſhall ſee, this engraffing of
theirs aſcribed to the power of God, that it is done by the election
of God, and mentioned as his gift, and choice mercy to that people.
All of which ſpeak the mind of God in it, and his approbation of it.</p>
                  <p>This is farther clear in that Text of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 10 29.
Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4. Heb. 10. 29</note>

who hath troden under foot the Sonne of God, and hath counted
the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy
thing, and hath done deſpight unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi> Where we
ſee thoſe that are ſanctified with the blood of the covenant, do
tread under foot the Son of God, and count his blood an unholy
thing, have an eſteeme of it, as that which is common, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
devoted at all to God. Theſe muſt needs be granted to be
wicked, ye cannot be denied to be in covenant, being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the blood of the Covenant.<note place="margin">A threefold interpretation of the Text.</note> There is indeed
a threefold interpretation of this Text; One of the Arminians,
and thoſe of that party, enemies to perſeverance in Grace, and
they underſtand by ſanctification in this place, an internal change
and renovation of the ſoul, from whence by Apoſtaſie ſuch perſons
fall. They that will embrace this tenent, may indeed ſay, that in
the ſtate of ſanctification, they were in covenant, but falling
from ſanctification, they fall from covenant. But this is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by thoſe with whom I have to deale, and therefore I ſhall
not lanch out into this controverſie. Two other interpretations
are given by thoſe that are adverſaries to this way, and make it
their work to vindicate this text from theſe mens gloſſes; The
firſt refers ſanctification, not to thoſe delinquents, that tread under
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55700:139"/>
                     <hi>foot the Sonne of God, and do deſpite unto the Spirit of grace,
but unto Chriſt himſelf: Chriſt was ſanctified (they ſay) with this
blood. This indeed clearly takes this Text out of their hands,
that would from thence inferre the Apoſtaſie of ſanctified, that
is, regenerate perſons. And if this hold, it as little ſerves our
purpoſe, Here is Chriſt in covenant, but no reprobate or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
perſon in covenant. But this reference of the words and
the interpretation which is grounded on it, hath (I ſuppoſe) come
into the thoughts of few Interpreters, and it ſeemes to be very
much ſtrained, the ſcope of the place being for aggravation of
their ſinne, that ſet themſelves againſt the Sonne of God and the
holy Spirit. The common interpretation (which is obvious, and
clearly held out in the Text) fully vindicates it from any favour
ſhew'd to the doctrine of Apoſtaſie of the Saints, and fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
the point in hand. There is a ſanctification by ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for God, and dedication to him, as there is by inheſion
and infuſion. Maſter</hi> Dixon <hi>on the words having ſo fully
ſpoke my thoughts, I had rather expreſſe my ſelfe in his words,
than my own, putting the Queſtion, How the reprobate can be
ſaid to be ſanctified by the blood of the covenant? anſwers;</hi>
There is a ſanctification to the purifying of the fleſh, and a ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the purifying of the conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the
living God, <hi>Heb</hi> 9. 13, 14. The ſanctification external to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
of the fleſh conſiſteth in the mans ſeparation from the world,
and dedication unto Gods ſervice, by calling and Covenant,
common to all the members of the viſible Church, and it is
forcible thus farre, as to bring a man into credit and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a Saint before men, and unto the common priviledges of the
Church, whereupon, as men, ſo God alſo ſpeaketh unto him, and of him
as one of his people, and dealeth with him in his external diſpenſation
as with one of his own people. In this ſenſe all the Congregation of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and every one of them is called holy, yea <hi>Core</hi> alſo and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
<hi>Num.</hi> 16. 3. The ſanctification internall by renovation conſiſteth
in a mans ſeparation from the ſtate of nature, to the ſtate of grace, from
his old conditions to be a new creature indeed; by this latter ſort a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
cannot be called ſanctified, but by the former he may be called
ſanctified, and that by vertue of the blood of the covenant, albeit he
ſhould not get any farther good thereby; for as the blood of Chriſt hath
vertue to cleanſe the conſcience, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

cometh unto it, outwardly only as the types did under the Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
an hypocrite in the Chriſtian Church, muſt be accounted one of the
congregation of the Saints, as well as an hypocrite under the Law was
ſo called, becauſe Chriſts blood cannot be inferiour to the Types, which
were of this force to ſanctifie men to the purifying of the fleſh: Or
we may ſay more ſhortly, There is a ſanctification by conſecration,
when any thing is devoted or dedicated unto God, and a ſanctification
by inhabitation of the holy Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. 18. Of the former ſort
the Cenſeres of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> are called holy, and
the reaſon is given, Becauſe they offered them before the Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are hallowed, <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 38. And in this ſedſe all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the viſible Church, even ſuch as afterwards do prove Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
are ſanctified, becauſe they offered, and offer themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord. But the inhabitation of the holy Spirit, is proper onely to
the elect, and Gods children. <hi>To the ſame purpoſe</hi> Paraeus <hi>on the
words,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Erat ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio apoſtata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum non inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ſed externa profeſſione fidei et participatione Sacramentorum externa conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens.

but external, conſiſting in the profeſſion of Faith and participation
of the Sacraments. They were ſanctified, that is, ſeparate from
the Jews and Pagans in profeſſion, and accounted for true Chriſtians.
<hi>In the ſame ſenſe as men are ordinarily called Saints, as after
we ſhall hear, ſo, thoſe that are turned Apoſtates, were ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the blood of the covenant, and therefore were men in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither can all the noiſe that hath been made about that Text,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. adverſaries take it off, but that it ſpeaks fully to
hold up a covenant in this latitude,<note place="margin">5. 1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> and from thence I thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue:
If thoſe phraſes, <hi>a choſen generation, a royal Prieſthood, an
holy Nation, a peculiar people,</hi> be applied to Chriſtians; as to
Jewes, in an equal latitude, to one as to other, then it muſt needs
follow that there is a covenant in Goſpel-times in like latitude,
as in the time of the Law, including all that accept the termes
of the covenant, and viſibly appeare as the people of God,
and is not reſtrained onely to the Elect regenerate. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is evident, ſeeing the termes plainly imply a covenant.
Here is a covnant-people or no where. But theſe termes, <hi>a choſen
Generation, a royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People,</hi>
are applied to Chriſtians, as well as to Jewes, to one, in as great a
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55700:140"/>
latitude, as to the other. That which God ſpeaks to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the
wilderneſſe, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks to the Church to which he writes,
All <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi> dayes, all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> profeſſing in <hi>Peters</hi>
time, had thoſe titles, when only thoſe that kept covenant, were
at any time worthy of them, and had the comforts of them.
Here 'tis objected that this Text is meant of the Church, as it
is inviſible; and ſo it follows not, that it is ſpoken by the Apoſtle
in that latitude, as it was by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but in as
great a difference as the Church viſible, ſtands from the Church, as
it is inviſible; but I would wiſh that it might be taken into more
ſerious conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Arguments carrying this Text to the Church as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</note> whether the firſt <hi>Verſe</hi> of this ſecond <hi>Chapter,</hi> be meant
only of inviſible members? Whether the Apoſtle perſwades Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
men, and only Regenerate men, <hi>to lay aſide all malice,
and all guile, and hypocriſies, and evil speakings?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, whether the third <hi>verſe</hi> be to be thus limited, whether
the Apoſtle makes doubt in that manner, whether inviſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<hi>had taſted that the Lord is gracious?</hi> and yet the words in both
thoſe <hi>verſes</hi> muſt needs be underſtood of the ſame men, and under
the ſame notion as theſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. The Apoſtle brings his ſpeech
to no full period till <hi>ver.</hi> 11. Thoſe that muſt lay aſide all malice,
guile, &amp;c. and thoſe of whom he makes queſtion, whether they
<hi>had taſted that the Lord were gracious;</hi> are this choſen Generation,
this royal Prieſt-hood.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let us more ſeriouſly conſider the Apoſtles farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of this honour of theſe Chriſtians, <hi>Which in times paſt
were not a people of God;</hi> words borrowed from <hi>Hoſ. 1. 10. Hoſ</hi> 2. 23
and ſpoken of the call of the ten revolted Tribes, and in <hi>Deut.</hi>
32. 21. of the call of the Gentiles into a viſible Church-ſtate
and profeſſion, and ſo applied by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 24, 25, 26.
Whence I argue, The call of the ten revolted Tribes, and of the
Gentiles into a viſible Church-way, is not to be meant of the
Church, as it is inviſible onely. This one hath already taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
conſideration, and anſwered. <hi>Howſoever it be in the places in
which the alluſion is, yet it is certaine that here it is meant of ſuch a
calling as is from darkneſſe to marvellous light.</hi> Taking it, it ſeems,
for granted, that there is no marvelous light in viſible Churches,
that in the land of <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthali,</hi> where they ſaw a great
light, there were, only inviſible members, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:55700:140"/>
Fourthly, as honourable titles as theſe are frequently given in
Scripture, as ſhall be ſhewn to viſible profeſſours, why ſhould
then theſe be limitted to inviſible Members?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this Text by adverſaries is made to be parallel with
thoſe Texts, <hi>Gal. 6. 10. 1 Tim. 3. 15. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 20. And
thoſe Texts I have demonſtrated to be meant of viſible Churches.
To which nothing is replyed. Arguments to evince it,
to be meant of the Church, as it is inviſible, come to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                  <p>(1.) <hi>I argue</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>from the termes, choſen Generation,
royal Prieſthood,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Objections anſwered. </seg>

                     <hi>and holy Nation, a peculiar people.</hi> This is by Chriſts
death, which can be underſtood of no other than Elect and true
Beleevers <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Such a way of arguing would not paſſe with him
in his <hi>Adverſary.</hi> As [peculiar people] is taken in one place
of Scripture, ſo it muſt be taken in all places; but in one place it is
taken for the Elect regenerate. If this would hold, much labour
might be ſpared in finding out the various acception of words in
Scripture.</p>
                  <p>2. Theſe termes and others equipollent to theſe, are given to
the <hi>Iſraelites, Deut. 14. 1, 2. Deut. 9. 6. Deut.</hi> 32. 9. not as a
Church inviſible, but as viſible Members. Their qualifications are
often as low as their appellations by reaſon of their relation to
God, raiſe them high. And ſetting apart Chriſts death, I would
know how the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came to this honour.</p>
                  <p>3. The gift of Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtours and
Teachers were the gift of Chriſt, and the purchaſe of his death.
Theſe are for conſtitution of viſible Churches, and viſible members,
enjoy theſe priviledges in common with regenerate perſons, to
which more is already ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>(2.) <hi>An Objection is raiſed from that which is ſaid of them,</hi>
They are called of God by his power, and vertue into his marvelous
light; and <hi>verſe</hi> 10. Which now had obtained mercy, which they
had not before, which cannot be affirmed of any but true Beleevers
and Elect perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Men brought into a viſible Church-ſtate, are brought
into a marvelous light. The ſeven golden Candleſticks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.
20. had a marvelous light in their lamps, and yet in ſome of

                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:55700:141"/>
And this light is a mercy, the fruition of it is a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<hi>Pſalme</hi> 147. 19, 20. Yea, it is applied by the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.
23. whence the Apoſtle gathers it unto the mercy enjoyed in
a viſible Church-communion, which is not denied by the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
                  <p>(3.) <hi>It is ſaid, that</hi> thoſe perſons did beleeve contra-diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them that were diſobedient, and ſtumbled at the word; but ſuch
are onely the Elect. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> So did all they that <hi>made ſhipwrack of the faith,</hi> 1 Tim.
1. 19. So did <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8. 13. So did the hearers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the rocky ground, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. And whereas it is ſaid,
theſe Beleevers are contra-diſtinguiſhed to them that were diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
and ſtumbled at the Word, it fully makes againſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.
Thoſe diſobedient ones are, thoſe that diſallow Chriſt,
as we ſee <hi>verſe</hi> 7. that reject Chriſt upon tender, that perſiſt in
<hi>Judaiſme</hi> or <hi>Gentiliſme.</hi> All others, not profeſſed Jewes nor
Gentiles, are in that place Beleevers, and in all other Scriptures
reſpective to viſible prerogative, all which are viſible Church-members.</p>
                  <p>(4.) They are ſaid to be built, as living ſtones, &amp;c. which can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is left out, in the Quotation of this Text, which
would wholly ſpoile the argument, and carry it on the other
hand; namely thoſe words, <hi>To whom coming as unto a living
ſtone.</hi> The Apoſtle ſhews them the way, and points out the
condition called for, which being done, they are then built as
living ſtones. And this implies that it was ſo, with ſome, but not
with others. Here is that which was done by ſome and neglected
by others, and their happineſſe upon diſcharge of their duty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
I am told by one, that he hardly beleeves, that any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Writer joyns with me in this Interpretation; But though
I were alone in it, yet I might learne of him to adventure, not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the interpretation of one ſingle-Scripture-Text, but on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
in Theology, againſt all Proteſtant Writers, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I ſhould have the advantage, in that few comparatively (I
think) have ſtarted this queſtion, much leſſe have they ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

are given, when ſome of my oppoſites, dare affront the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55700:141"/>
of Proteſtant Writers, in that, in which <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> they have

to the Church inviſible, I doubt not, but that holineſſe, which is
intrinſecal, is here aimed at, yet all thoſe have theſe titles, that do

two other, and 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 9. for one. So <hi>Salmero,</hi> as I finde him
quoted to my hand, underſtands it of election, diſtinct from that
which is to eternal life; and calls it an election to <hi>faith,</hi> and all
know that they mean no more than their Catholick faith, which
(according to them) doth not neceſſarily entitle to eternal life,

                  <head type="sub">Arguments evincing the Covenant of Grace in Goſpel-times
in that latitude as before is aſſerted.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt Argument ſhall be borrowed from thoſe titles,
which undoubtedly and undiſputably imply a covenant,<note place="margin">1. Titles given to men in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and in Scripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men, prove it.</note> and
yet in Scripture, are ſtill attributed to all that profeſſedly
accept the termes of the covenant, and profeſſedly appear as the
people of God. Thoſe titles before mentioned by <hi>Peter</hi>
from <hi>Moſes,</hi> are confeſſed to be ſuch that argue a people in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and therefore adverſaries are ſo ſhie to confeſſe them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to viſible Profeſſours; But titles as high as theſe,
and as undeniably implying a covenant, are given to viſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours;
thoſe then (even according to them) are on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in covenant with God. And theſe are all of thoſe titles wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the people of God are honoured. In New Teſtament-Scriptures,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55700:142"/>
which are eſpecially foure, <hi>Beleevers, Saints, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
Chriſtians.</hi> He that is a <hi>Beleever,</hi> a <hi>Saint,</hi> a <hi>Diſciple,</hi> a
<hi>Chriſtian;</hi> he is a man in covenant with God. But all viſible
Profeſſors that accept the termes of the covenant are <hi>Beleevers,
Saints, Diſciples, Chriſtians;</hi> ſo they are ſtill ſtiled in New
Teſtament-Scriptures, <hi>Beleevers</hi> from the Faith that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
<hi>Saints</hi> from the Holineſſe to which they ſtand engaged,
or from the holy God to whoſe ſervice they are ſeparated,
<hi>Diſciples</hi> from the Doctrine which they profeſſe to learne, and
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> from him whoſe they are, whom they ſerve, and
from whom they expect ſalvation. I know ſome have inured
themſelves to that language, that thoſe that are thus dignified, are
neceſſarily concluded by them to be Elect, Regenerate perſons;
It is grown, I know the Dialect of the times, but not of the
Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>To begin with <hi>Beleevers.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Unregenerate perſons, as to the name and outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, are Beleevers.</note> He is in Scripture a Beleever, that is,
a viſible Profeſſour, that puts himſelf into the number of thoſe that
expect ſalvation by Chriſt Jeſus, So it is through the Hiſtory of
the <hi>Acts,</hi> where account is given of the Converts made by the
Apoſtles Miniſtry, <hi>Acts 4. 4. Many of them which heard the Word
believed, and the number of the men was about five thouſand.</hi> They
that are thus numbred by the poll, are viſible Profeſſours, that
outwardly embraced the Doctrine of Faith; This might be ſeene
and the names of ſuch taken. They are not all Elect, regenerate
Chriſtians, ſuch could not be viſibly known: The generality of
men and women in <hi>Samaria</hi> beleeved, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 12. But that they
were Elect &amp; Regenerate in that univerſality cannot be conceived;
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> is an example to the contrary, of whom the Text
ſayes, <hi>that he did beleeve,</hi> verſ. 13. and <hi>yet his heart not right in the
ſight of God,</hi> verſ. 21. He was with thoſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Pſalme 78.
34. in covenant; <hi>yet his heart was not ſtedfaſt in Covenant.</hi> A great
number of the <hi>Grecians</hi> beleeved, upon the preaching of thoſe that
were ſcattered, upon the perſecution raiſed about <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts
11. 21. yet <hi>Barnabas</hi> (whom the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſent to
them) well enough knew, that there was no certainty, little hopes
that all of theſe were Regenerate perſons; therefore he <hi>exhorts
them, that with purpoſe of heart they would cleave to the Lord.</hi> He
was afraid that the work might be overly and ſuperficial, of which
the Church in every age hath ſad experience; he deſires and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:55700:143"/>
that they may be rooted and eſtabliſhed. Only thoſe
hearers which are compared to the good ground, are Regenerate
perſons, But thoſe compared to bad ground, beleeve, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.
13. Regenerate men, who alone are inviſible Church-Members,
have their hearts more right with God, than to love the praiſe of
men, more than the praiſe of God; but many beleevers are thus
cenſured, as we ſee, <hi>John</hi> 12. 42, 43. Regenerate perſons make no
ſhipwrack of Faith; <hi>They are borne of incorruptible ſeed, the ſeed
of God abideth in them;</hi> Yet there are beleevers that thus ſuffer
ſhipwrack, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 19. Myriads of thouſand of Jews beleeve,</hi>
Acts 21. 20. yet not all Regenerate. The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies
a caſe of conſcience put to him by the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that if
any brother hath a wife that beleeveth not; if ſhe be pleaſed to
dwell with him, let him not put her away. If the beleeving bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
here be only a Regenerate man, then the unbeleeving wife
is an unregenerate woman; So the queſtion will be, whether a
Regenerate, ſanctified man, joyned in marriage to a Profeſſour of
the true faith, not of thoſe hopes for the truth of ſanctification
may dwell with her? A caſe that never yet was diſputed or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The unbeleever is a worſhipper of idols, one that ſacrifices
to devils, and not to God. The Beleever is a Profeſſor of the Faith,
one in name a Chriſtian and not a Heathen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saint</hi> is taken in the ſame latitude as <hi>Beleever,</hi> and is the moſt
common appellation in the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Unregenerate perſons, as to the name and outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges are Saints.</note> for all that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
for God, and dedicated to him. The diſtinguiſhing name
for profeſſing Chriſtians, as the title of <hi>People of God, Circumciſion,</hi>
was for the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſome do not hear of the word <hi>Saint,</hi>
but preſently they underſtand a Saint in glory, and will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
that any man ſhould be a Saint upon earth; Others will
have none Saints, but thoſe that are really ſuch, and ſhall be for
heaven. They will have no denomination of a Saint, from a holy
profeſſion: But if we look into the Scriptures, and may be
ſuffered to ſpeak in that language, we ſhall finde, <hi>Saint</hi> for the
moſt part, taken for men upon the earth. The pſalmiſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
names <hi>Saints upon earth,</hi> Pſal. 16. 3. And thoſe Saints not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
taken for other, than a Saint by profeſſion. He is a
Saint that makes a Chriſtian profeſſion. We read of <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
for the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 1. <hi>Adminiſtration to the Saints,</hi> Heb.
6. 10. which can reach no higher than viſible Profeſſours, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55700:143"/>
can by no means be limited to Elect, Regenerate ones. When <hi>Paul
ſhut up many of the Saints in priſon, and did much evil againſt them,</hi>
Acts 26. 10. he knew no other way of diſtiction; then an outward
profeſſion, and ſo he explaines himſelf, <hi>thoſe of that way,</hi> Act. 9. 2.
We read <hi>of Churches of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 33. and they were
taken in, to be Church-members aſſoon as they made profeſſion;
that is aſſoon as they ceaſed to be Jews or Pagans, and took them
to the way of Chriſtianity. As we ſee in thoſe three thouſand,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. The Samaritans, The Eunuch, <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon
as they were taken off from Heatheniſme, Judaiſme for
Chriſtianity, they had that name of Saints. The Epiſtles wrote to
particular viſible Churchs, are inſcribed <hi>to Saints,</hi> among which,
what ſome are, read both the Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> yea,
what almoſt all are in ſome Churches, read the Epiſtle to the
Church of <hi>Sardis. Ameſius</hi> judged by ſome to be of the oppoſite
party) hath theſe words; <hi>It is moſt probable, that there is no
particular Church, in which the profeſſion of the true faith flouriſheth,
but in the ſame we may finde ſome truly Beleevers,</hi> Medul. lib. 1.
cap. 32. ſect. 8. The Apoſtle tells us <hi>of the Faith once delivered to
the Saints.</hi> Jude 3. the Doctrine of Faith, as is agreed on all
hands is there underſtood; All that profeſſe that Doctrine are
Saints: no other Comment can be put upon it, than upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
words, <hi>Rom. 3. 1. To the Jews were committed the Oracles of
God;</hi> Saint then is a name of diſtinction, to ſet out thoſe that take
the way, not of Jews, or Heathens, but the way of Chriſtians and
Saints are men in covenant.</p>
                  <p>For the terme <hi>Diſciple,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Unregenerate perſons, as to the name and outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, are Diſciples.</note> enough hath been ſpoken before. This
argues an intereſt in the covenant, as well as the former of <hi>Saints,</hi>
and <hi>Beleevers,</hi> and whole Nations are in capacity to be Diſciples,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. that is, to be put into a way of ſalvation, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Nation of the Jews was, in the fruition of ſaving Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
And the Kingdomes of the earth, being made the Kingdoms of
the Lord and his Chriſts, by a viſible profeſſion are Diſcipled.
<hi>Judas</hi> is called a Diſciple, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 1, 4. as well as <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
is called a Beleever. <hi>Saul</hi> breathed out threatnings againſt
the Diſciples of the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 1. In caſe you will know who
the holy Ghoſt there means, ſee <hi>verſe</hi> 2. all that <hi>Saul</hi> could
finde of that way. He made it not his work to enquire after their
Regeneration, or inward work of Sanctification; we may well
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55700:144"/>
think he underſtood as little of that as <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> It was enough
to him that they made ſuch a profeſſion. Complaint is made, <hi>Acts</hi>
15. 10. that thoſe that urged the neceſſity of circumciſion, <hi>put
a yoke on the necks of the Diſciples, which neither they nor their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were able to bear;</hi> and they urged it upon all in viſible profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and not upon regenerate ones alone. Let that one Text ſpeak
for all, in what latitude the word Diſciple is taken, and in how
large comprehenſion it is uſed, <hi>John 6. 66. From that time many of
his Diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the laſt of theſe termes,<note place="margin">Unregenerate perſons, as to the name and outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges are Chriſtians.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> it ſtands in the ſame lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
as the other, where we firſt heare of it, we finde it the ſame
with <hi>Diſciples,</hi> Acts 11. 26. <hi>The Diſciples were firſt called Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in Antioch.</hi> And in what acception through all ages it hath paſt,
is alſo manifeſt. All of theſe imply an intereſt in the covenant,
and theſe are given to unregenerate perſons.</p>
                  <p>Here that of our Saviour is objected,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> 
                     <hi>Luke 14. 27, 33. If any
man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and
children, and brethren, and ſiſters; yea, and his own life alſo, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be my Diſciple. Theſe qualifications are ſignes of Regeneration,
and theſe only that are thus qualified,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sol.</note> 
                     <hi>are Diſciples of Chriſt; Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
men then onely have that honour of Diſciples.</hi> I anſwer, They
only do the duty of Diſciples, they onely are worthy of that title
as Chriſt explaines himſelf, <hi>Mat. 10. 37. He that loveth father or
mother more than me, is not worthy of me;</hi> Yet others have the name,
as we have heard, and the outward priviledges, in order to bring
them to the duty of true Diſciples. There are Diſciples as to the
fruition of viſible priviledges, and thoſe are they that make vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
profeſſions. There are Diſciples for glory and life, and thoſe
onely are Regenerate ones, <hi>John 3. 3. Except a man be borne again, he
cannot ſee the Kingdome of God.</hi> Ordinances are granted in a greater
latitude than Regeneration. All that enjoy the priviledges of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
are Diſciples, and therefore it is no honour proper to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
perſons.<note place="margin">The abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that follow upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of the Covenant to the Elect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate do evince it.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as theſe titles argue a covenant-intereſt, when the
parties are yet ſhort of Regeneration; ſo the manifold abſurdities
that will follow upon this reſtraint of the covenant, alone to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
plainly evince that it is to be taken in a larger extent, and
that it takes in unregenerate Profeſſours.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>This reſtriction of the covenant, to out ſhut all non-Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55700:144"/>
makes an utter confuſion between the covenant it ſelfe,
and the conditions of it; or (if that expreſſion do not pleaſe)
the covenant it ſelf; and the duties required in it, between our
entrance into covenant, and our obſervation of it, or walking
up in faithfulneſſe to it. All know that a bargaine for a ſumme of
money, and the payment of that ſumme, the covenant with a
ſervant for labour, and the labour according to this covenant,
are different things. Faithful men that make a bargaine, keep it,
enter covenant, and ſtand to it; But the making and keeping,
the entring and obſerving are not the ſame, many enter and
tranſgreſſe, covenant for much, and performe nothing; So it is
in the covenants of men, and ſo Scripture ſpeaks of thoſe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
which God enters with man. There are thoſe that enter
covenant, and keep covenant,</hi> Pſal. 44. 17, 18. All this is come
upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſely
in thy covenant; our heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps
declined from thy way. <hi>Theſe have mercy promiſed; All to which
God enegages himſelf, is theirs,</hi> Pſalme 103. 17, 18. The meecy of
the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting, upon them that fear him;
and his righteouſneſſe unto childrens children, to ſuch as keep his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and to thoſe that remember his commandments to do them.
<hi>There are thoſe that break covenant,</hi> Pſal. 78. 10, 37. They kept
not the covenant of God, and refuſed to walk in his Law. Their heart
was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his covenant.
<hi>And theſe are threatned with a curſe,</hi> Jer. 34. 18, 19, 20. And I
will give the men that have tranſgreſſed my covenant, which have
not performed the words of the covenant, which they had made before
me, when they cut the calfe in twaine, and paſſed between the parts
thereof. The Princes of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches
and the Prieſts, and all the people of the land, which paſſed
between the parts of the calf: I will even give them into the hand of
their enemies, and into the hand of them that ſeek their life;
and their dead bodies ſhall be for meat unto the fowles of the heaven,
and to the beaſts of the earth. <hi>The Lord brings a ſword</hi> that
avenges the quarrel of his covenant, <hi>Levit. 26. 25. When the
heavieſt of judgements is mentioned, and a large liſt enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as</hi> Eſay 24. Behold the Lord maketh the earth empty, and
maketh it waſte, and turneth it upſide down, and ſcattereth abroad
the inhabitants thereof. And it ſhall be as with the People, ſo with the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55700:145"/>
Prieſt; as with the Servant, ſo with his Maſter; as with the Maid,
ſo with her Miſtreſſe; as with the Buyer, ſo with the Seller; as with
the Lender, ſo with the Borrower; as with the taker of uſury, ſo with
the giver of uſury; to him the land ſhall be utterly empited, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ſpoiled, for the Lord hath ſpoken this word. The earth mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languiſh, the
earth alſo is defiled under the inhabitants thereof. Therefore hath
the curſe devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are deſolate;
therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burnt, and few men left;
the new wine mourneth, the vine languiſheth, all the merry-hearted
do ſigh. The myrth of Tabrets ceaſeth, the noiſe of them that rejoyce
endeth, the joy of the Harp ceaſeth; They ſhal not drink wine with a ſong,
ſtrong drink ſhall be bitter to them that drink it. The city of confuſion
is broken down, every houſe is ſhut up, that no man may come in. There
is a crying for wine in the ſtreets, all joy is darkned, the mirth of the
land is gone: In the City is left deſolation, and the Gate is ſmitten
with deſtruction. <hi>The reaſon of all this is given in the cloſe of</hi>
verſe 5. Becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the Laws, changed the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
broken the everlaſting Covenant. <hi>Now according to this
opinion, Regeneration is our entrance into covenant, and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
is our keeping of covenant; before regeneration we make
no covenant, after Regeneration we break no covenant, there is
no ſuch thing as covenant-breaking. All this makes an utter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
in the covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Then there is no ſuch thing as an hypocrite in the world, as
in reference towards God; no ſuch thing as an hypocrite in the
Church as in reference to Religion, and wayes of godlineſſe. An
hypocrite is one that perſonates the man that he is not, with <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi>
wife, feignes himſelf to be another perſon, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 6.
He that acts <hi>Tarquin</hi> or <hi>Lucretia</hi> in the Tragedy, is not <hi>Tarquin</hi> or
<hi>Lucretia,</hi> that acts a King is many times a peaſant. Now an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
reſpective to Religion, and in Scripture uſe of the phraſe, is
one that pretends for God, and is not Gods; pretends to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his, and is ſome others; of theſe God frequently complaines,
Theſe in the Scriptures are menaced with heavy judgements. Now
according to this opinion, that only Regenerate men are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
there is no ſuch thing as an hypocrite, No ſuch ſinne as
hypocriſie; Where the Goſpel is preached, God makes tender of
himſelf in covenant; and in caſe none but Regenerate enter Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55700:145"/>
then only they take upon them the perſons of people in
relation to him, onely they ſtrike hands with him, and theſe, as
they <hi>profeſſe,</hi> ſo in ſincerity and reality they <hi>are;</hi> as they cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with him, ſo in the uprightneſſe of their hearts they walk
before him, and ſo all of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are <hi>Iſrael.</hi> There cannot be found
a man in <hi>Iſrael</hi> that is not a <hi>Nathaniel;</hi> Men out of covenant, are
without, and aliens to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 12.
And if they be in covenant, then according to this opinion, they
are men ſincere, and upright-hearted in it. But you will ſay,
<hi>They pretend to the covenant, and are not in covenant, and ſo are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label>
To this I ſay. (1.) It is plain againſt the Scriptures, that
makes hypocrites falſe in the covenant, men whoſe hearts were
not ſtedfaſt in it, as <hi>Pſalme 78. 8, 10 a ſtubborne and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
generation, a generation that ſet not their heart aright, and
whoſe ſpirit was not ſtedfaſt with God. They kept not the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God, and refuſed to walk in his Law.</hi> More fully, <hi>verſe
36, 37. They did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto
him with their tongues, for their hearts were not right with him, neither
were they ſtedfaſt in his covenant.</hi> Therefore they pretend not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to a covenant, but the covenant which they enter, is their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for God, and their breach of covenant argues them guilty of
hypocriſie before the Lord. (2) According to theſe ſuch pretend
to the ſtage, but are never admitted on it. They pretend to act the
part of a Servant of God, but never act in it; ſo we may ſay, they
pretend to hypocriſie, but never are in the honour to be in any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of it.</p>
                  <p>3. If the covenant be with this limit, only to Regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
then no Miniſter in any Church, no Church-Officer, nor any
other Church-member, in caſe you will make it to be their work,
may baptize any perſon. That Diſciples are to be baptized, is
out of queſtion with all that acknowledge ſuch a ſtanding Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
as Baptiſme; It being in the Apoſtles commiſſion, <hi>to diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Nations, and baptize them.</hi> Theſe are brought into the bond of
the covenant, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 37. But thoſe only, paſſing for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
and men in covenant that are Regenerate, they can by
no eye of any Miniſter, Church-Officer, or member be diſcerned.
This is that work that <hi>cometh not with obſervation, or outward ſhew,
that men ſhould ſay, ſo here, or ſo there,</hi> Luke 17. 20, 21. Chriſt might
indeed have baptized in his own perſon at pleaſure, ſeeing <hi>he
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55700:146"/>
knew what was in man,</hi> John 2. 2. He could have diſtinguiſhed
a Beleever from an unbeleever, a Saint from an unſanctified
man, a Chriſtian from him that is no Chriſtian, a Diſciple from
one that is no Diſciple, taking theſe titles in the ſenſe of
theſe perſons. So can no other man. It is the Prerogative Royal
of God to ſearch the heart; If <hi>Paul</hi> could have diſcerned falſe
Brethren by a ſpirit of infallibility, he had never been in that
danger, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. But Chriſt baptized none, but left all to
his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 4. 2. And they being thus tied up, to baptize
none, till they be diſcipled; of which according to this Tenent
they could be no competent Judges, it muſt needs follow that
none at all muſt be baptized. If any ſay, thoſe are to be baptized,
that in the judgement of charity we judge to be Diſciples, on
whom we have grounds of hope that this work is wrought, as I
know it is ſaid by many, I ſhall give heed to them when they can
ſhew that Chriſt hath ſaid it, that he hath made known that
the inward work, is alone the true ground, on which this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is granted, and charity is our rule in judging of it; But I
finde Chriſt giving charge to Diſciple Nations, and to baptize
them; But I finde him not giving commiſſion, that when in the
judgement of charity, men have cauſe to conceive them to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
then to baptize them; We finde the Apoſtles and others
in the Primitive-times, making that haſte to baptize upon profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that they ſtayed not for obſervation of thoſe ſignes that
might in a well-grounded charity perſwade that they were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
perſons. And thoſe that fix it here, too ordinarily, make
intereſts the chief ground to carry their charity to a more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
conſtruction; charity (according to the Proverb) begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at home, they that are moſt like to make a party with them,
or drive on an intereſt their way, will be judged perſons meet
for Baptiſme; Of this in a ſhort time we have large experience.
As for thoſe that gather up Churches, and initiate them by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme,
the way of the Apoſtles, I confeſſe, in caſe that they would
make good that they have to deale with Heathens, and therefore
a way of more colour than theirs, that ſet up new Churches,
and retaine the old Baptiſme, we ſee what manner of Saints are
received among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch that civil perſons (reſpective to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
chaſtity, or upright dealing with men) cannot without
ſtaine of their reputation, make their companions. And congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55700:146"/>
of Saints have juſt cauſe to ſay, that they have loſt none
of their gold, but much of their filth and droſſe by ſuch Saint-ſeparation;
That I ſpeak the truth, and lie not, I need not to
appeal to my conſcience bearing witneſſe, (which alone is ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to my ſelf) but to thouſands of witneſſes which may give
ſatisfaction to others.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Objections againſt this latitude of the Covenant
anſwered.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IT is here objected, that</hi> in Old Teſtament-times, God ſpeaks to all
in viſible profeſſion, in that way of compellation as his people, as
appears in thoſe places that alreadie have been quoted; but in New
Teſtament-times, we finde not that title in ſuch generality, only the
Regenerate, thoſe that yield ready and loyal ſubjection to God, are
honoured with the name of the people of God, they therefore onlie are
in Covenant. <hi>The title is reſtrained peculiarly to them, and ſo
alſo the mercy. To this much may be ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, if this were granted, that this way of compellation, or
ſpeech of God to man, is not found in all the New Teſtament, in
this latitude, as to take in men of Chriſtian Profeſſion, not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
yet there is little gained, ſeeing as we have found,
there are termes equivalent. Beleevers are the people of God,
ſo are Saints, Diſciples, and Chriſtians. But thoſe that are yet
unregenerate have theſe titles, as we have heard at large, and
therefore it argues the Covenant to be as large, as when that
terme was ſo frequent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is not often, that that phraſe is found in New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament-Scriptures,
with ſuch reſtriction, only to regenerate
perſons, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. is the moſt pregnant place, where it is
ſaid, that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem
us from all iniquitie, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of good works.</hi> But if it be granted, that it is ſometimes taken
for a people ſeparate by grace out of the ſtate of nature, it will
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55700:147"/>
not follow that it is never taken for a people ſeparate for God by
Profeſſion; I know that Text, <hi>Revelation</hi> 21. 3. will be urged,
<hi>I heard a great voice out of Heaven, ſaying, Behold, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and
they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and
be their God.</hi> But this will hardly ſerve for their purpoſe, There is
no ſmall diſpute whether this be to be fulfilled on Earth, or in
Heaven; if in Heaven, as learned Interpreters contend, then
it is nothing to our purpoſe; if on Earth, then it ſets out a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
glory in the Church through Ordinances in purity; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that offends being ſuffered, yet ſuch a one in which yet
there is a mixture of cloſe hypocrites: As for thoſe that interpret
it of Chriſts perſonal reigne upon earth, when he in perſon ſhall
manage all, and work nothing by his Agents, I leave them to
enjoy their own opinion, how they ſhall be qualified on
earth that do attend him. But if we may make conjecture by
a conſiderable party of thoſe that publiſh it, and receive it,
we ſhall have ſtrong cauſe of doubt, that all will not be found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſay, the expreſſion mentioned of <hi>my people, or
people of God,</hi> is uſed more frequently in the New Teſtament
in the Old Teſtament-latitude, than with reſtriction to the
Elect Regenerate. That in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. with me is plain;
<hi>I will dwell with them, and walk in them, and I will be their God,
and they ſhall be my people,</hi> quoted out of an Old Teſtament-Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 16. and there it is a National Promiſe, and
here, to be underſtood of Gods viſible abode in Ordinances, as
may be made out from the context, being tendered to thoſe that
were over-buſie to meddle with idols, from which he diſſwades
with this Argument, that they were the Temple of the Lord, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
of God for his worſhip and ſervice, and the Promiſe
is no more than is made good to viſible Churches; <hi>Christ
walks in the midſt of the ſeven golden Candleſticks,</hi> Revel. 2. 1.
and ſome of them (witneſſe that of <hi>Sardis</hi>) had not all their
Members Regenerate perſons. That of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 9.
25. I will call them my people, which were not my people, and
her beloved, which was not beloved,</hi> is to be underſtood no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe;
That of the Prophet of the call of the ten Tribes,
from <hi>Hoſea 1. 10. Hoſ.</hi> 2. 23. is there applied to the call
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55700:147"/>
of the Gentiles into a Church-ſtate and condition. Neither
is that of force againſt it, that is objected from <hi>verſe</hi> 23.
where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That he might make known the riches of
his glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared
unto glory.</hi> God ſets up viſible Ordinances, and calls to a
Church-ſtate as is there prophecied, that he may there work
to himſelfe a people of inviſible relation, that thereby he may
make them veſſels of mercy, having afore prepared them
unto glory; So likewiſe, <hi>Rev. 18. 4. Come out of her my
people, that ye be not partakers of her ſinnes, and that ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not of her plagues.</hi> All Profeſſours of faith, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
of the true God, are there included in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
to quit <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo all Miniſters of Chriſt are
to urge and preſſe it; Men therefore of viſible Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have this title in compellation from GOD of my
people.</p>
                  <p>It is yet objected, <hi>Jeremiah 31. 31, 32, 33. Behold the
dayes come, ſaith the LORD, that I will make a new Covenant
with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day
that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land
of Egypt; which my Covenant they brake, although I was an
husband to them, ſaith the Lord. But this ſhall be my Covenant
that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael; after thoſe dayes ſaith
the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write
it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they ſhall be my
people.</hi> Here is a third purpoſe or intereſt for which this Text is
produced to ſerve. The firſt was to aſſert an unconditionate
Covenant in the dayes of the Goſpel, (which we examined
<hi>chapter</hi> 25.) when the Goſpel expreſſely holds out Covenant-conditions,
more expreſſely than the Covenant of Works, which
is confeſt to be conditional. The ſecond to overthrow a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Miniſtery, and all private mutual exhortation (which we
ſpake to <hi>chapter</hi> 26) when the New Teſtament doth eſtabliſh
both. And to ſet up this Prophecie in a third particular, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all New Teſtament-light; none muſt be of the called of
God into Covenant, for fruition of Church-priviledges, but
thoſe that are regenerate: Men in Old Teſtament-Covenant,
broke Covenant as is there expreſt; Men in the New Covenant
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55700:148"/>
ſhall keep covenant, and theſe are only the Elect and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
To this I might have many things to ſay.</p>
                  <p>No ſuch ſenſe muſt be put upon this one ſingle Text, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
the covenant only to thoſe that are ſtedfaſt in it, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obſerve it when other New-Teſtament-Scriptures clearly and
unanimouſly hold it out in that latitude to comprehend thoſe
that are tranſgreſſours of it, no more than it muſt be brought
(though there be like colour for both) to overthrow Goſpel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
private and publick exhortations, when in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
there is a clear and full eſtabliſhment of them.
There are thoſe that are in the faith, ſo farre as to enter
Covenant, <hi>that make ſhipwrack of the faith,</hi> 1 Tim 1. 19. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Chriſt, <hi>that go back and walk no more with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Joh. 6. Men
ſanctified by the blood of the Covenant, <hi>that tread under foot the
blood of the Son of God, and do deſpight to the Spirit of grace,</hi> Heb.
10. 29. There are that <hi>eſcape the pollution of the world, through
the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Christ, and are
again entangled and overcome. Thoſe that have known the way
of righteouſneſſe, that turne from the holy Commandment. To
whom it happens according to the true Proverb, The dogge is
turned to his own vomit again, and the ſow that was waſhed
to her wallowing in the mire,</hi> 2 Pet. 2 22. It is farre eaſier to
returne anſwer to this Scripture held out by way of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
what ſhall be, than to give anſwer to all theſe Scriptures,
and far more than theſe, ſetting out what is in New Teſtament-times.</p>
                  <p>2. That we may interpret, and not commit Scriptures, finde
out the ſenſe of all, and not create differences in any; we may
obſerve that though it be granted, that thoſe that have the
Law written in their hearts, and put into their inward parts,
do enter covenant, and not break it; yet it is not ſaid, none
ſhall enter covenant and tranſgreſſe it. There may ſtill be an
outward covenant, according to Interpreters, that may be
broken, as well as an inward covenant that ſhall be obſerved.
If it be ſaid, that theſe are two diſtinct covenants, one
ſucceeding the other; one aboliſhed when the other takes
place, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 8. 13. In that
he ſaith, a New Covenant, he hath made the firſt Old; now
that which decayeth and waxeth Old, is ready to vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:55700:148"/>
then it will follow (this being the characteriſtical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference)
that, as none in New Teſtament-times enter cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
but they keep covenant; ſo none in Old Teſtament-times
were in covenant, but they did tranſgreſſe it; at leaſt
that the covenant that then was, was wholly tranſgreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and the covenant that now is, is not in any poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to be tranſgreſt. But the contrary is evident, there were
thoſe that kept covenant in Old Teſtament-times, <hi>Pſal. 44. 17.
All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotton thee, neither
have we dealt falſely in the covenant,</hi> Pſal. 103. 17. And alſo
there are thoſe that break covenant in New Teſtament-times,
1 <hi>Tim. 5. 12. Having damnation, becauſe they have caſt off
their firſt faith.</hi> The Law was written in mens hearts, and put
into their inward parts in the dayes of the Old Teſtament,
and ſome were (as it is called) in an inward Covenant, <hi>Deut.
30. 6. The Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart
of thy ſeed; to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and
with all thy ſoule, that thou mayeſt live,</hi> Pſal. 37. 31. <hi>The Law
of his God is in his heart, none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide,</hi> Pſal. 119. 11.
<hi>Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſinne againſt
thee. Encline your eare, and come unto me, hear, and your ſoule
ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you,
even the ſure mercies of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>id,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. And ſo by conſequence
it fairly holds, notwithſtanding this Text that there is (as hath
been proved) an outward covenant in the dayes of the Goſpel.
The oldneſſe to be aboliſhed is only in circumſtances, wherewith
one and the ſame covenant that now is, was then clothed.</p>
                  <p>3. The covenant then ſpoken to by <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the place quoted,
is not a covenant properly ſo called, or at leaſt, as Maſter
<hi>Baxter</hi> obſerves, not the whole of the covenant. So there muſt
be two diſtinct covenants, one in being when the Prophet
wrote, and another to have its being in the time of which he
propheſied; one covenant made with the Jewes, and another
covenant diſtinct from it made with Chriſtians, and ſo of
neceſſity there muſt be two diſtinct Goſpels. If that ſpoken
of by <hi>Jeremy</hi> be a covenant properly ſo called, holding out
the whole nature of the Goſpel-covenant, and that New
diſtinct from the former, then the old covenant muſt needs in
the whole nature of it be a diſtinct covenant likewiſe. In what
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55700:149"/>
ſenſe <hi>Jeremy</hi> is to be underſtood according to the genuine mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Text, I have endeavoured to clear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in my anſwer,
<hi>page</hi> 105. 106, 107. So alſo <hi>chap.</hi> 26. of this Treatiſe, and
whether I have anſwered the objection, which ſome divine that
I cannot, without enervating the Argument, for effectual grace
and perſeverance in it, I muſt appeal to the impartial Reader. I
am ſure none can build effectual grace, and perſeverance on that
Text (making it a diſtinct Covenant from the firſt) without the
overthrow of effectual grace and perſeverance in Old Teſtament-times.</p>

a Covenant of Works.</head>
                  <p>IT neceſſarily follows,<note place="margin">Firſt Corollary</note> by way of Corollary, from that which
hath been delivered, that no profeſſed believer, that is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church viſible, is under a Covenant of Works, but <hi>eo
nomine,</hi> that he, profeſſedly, gives his name to Chriſt, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Covenant of grace. That a man cannnot be under two
Covenants, reſpective to the ſame thing, I ſuppoſe, is agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
on all hands. A man that holds by one title, if he accept a
ſecond, makes void the firſt; whether his former title were better,
or worſe; whether it tends to his prejudice, or benefit, thus to
make change of it; As it is with covenants among men, ſo it is in
the Covenant between God and man. If the New Covenant make
void the Old, where both Old and New are ſubſtantially the ſame;
and the difference only circumſtantial, as the Apoſtle ſheweth
that it does <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13. much more then, in thoſe covenants,
which are eſſentially differing, as are the Covenant of Works,
and the Covenant of grace. Some, that would limit the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
only to the regenerate, and men of juſtifying faith, as to
the juſt latitude of it, make uſe of this <hi>Maxime,</hi> that the ſame
man cannot be under two Covenants; which is, indeed, a right
way of arguing; from principles granted on both parts. Now
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55700:149"/>
they aſſume, that all unregenerate, and perſons not juſtified, are
under a Covenant of Works. This, they take for granted, when
it reſts to be proved; and ſo conclude that theſe are under no
Covenant of Grace, but a Covenant of Works. I aſſume, on
the other hand, that ſo many of them as are Chriſtians, though,
not <hi>Regenerati,</hi> but, <hi>Regenerandi,</hi> as <hi>Pareus</hi> ſpeaks, are under a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, and therefore, they are not under a Covenant
of Works. Here to avoid miſtakes ſome things are to be premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
1. That many of them have not any explicit knowledge of
either Covenant, either that, under which originally they were,
or that, under which, through grace, they are. They are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God (and therefore under a ſaving Covenant with God
though not emproved for ſalvation) that periſh for lack of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 6. all that bear the name of believers in primitive
times, were not got up in knowledge to the firſt principles. 2. As
to their preſent qualification and condition, they are in no better
an eſtate, than if the obligation of the Covenant of Works, were
ſtill upon them. A man, dealing falſely in the Covenant of
grace, is in as ſad a condition, as he that is under that hopeleſſe,
and deſtructive Covenant of Works, yea, his condition admits of
many ſad aggravations, in that treachery is above rebellion, and
perfidiouſneſſe exceeds bare diſobedience. They were a people
in Covenant, that God owned as his, to whom he ſaid, <hi>Ezek.
16. 48. As I live, ſaith the Lord God, Sodom thy ſiſter hath not
done, ſhe, nor her daughters as thou haſt done, thou, and thy daughters.</hi>
Bleſſedneſſe, is no where in Scripture ſaid to be on the head of all
thoſe that are in covenant, unleſſe it be meant comparatively, or
reſpectively only, but, <hi>on ſuch as keep his covenant, and remember
his commandments to do them,</hi> Pſal. 103. 18. And, if all that
were in covenant, did keep covenant, there would not be ſo much
complaint as there is in Scripture, of breach of covenant, nor could
men be under that charge, that their hearts are not ſtedfaſt in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
3. They are yet in a more deſirable eſtate, and in fairer
way towards happineſſe, than thoſe, that are as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,
ſtrangers from the covenant of promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. As the Jewes
were a people nigh to the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 14. So they are,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13. Salvation is of theſe, though they be not as yet, by a
thorough work of grace in a ſaving ſtate. There are of theſe
that ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 47. and ſo there is not, for ought
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55700:150"/>
that Scripture ſpeaks among thoſe that are without covenant,
ſuch are, in Scripture-language, <hi>without God, without hope, Eph.
2. 12. under the wrath and indignation of God,</hi> Jerem. 10. 25.
Pſal. 79. 6. When the Apoſtle therefore, had ſpoken much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Jew outwardly, and the circumciſion of the fleſh. (that
is, men circumciſed in fleſh and not in heart) <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. upon the
queſtion put, yet concludes, that theſe Jewes have; This circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
hath much profit, every way much advantage, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
is, as he expreſſes it, eſpecially, the Oracles of God,
which are the covenant-draughts, and if they were utterly out of
covenant, I would deſire any to ſhew, where the advantage lies.
That they are in covenant with God and in a covenant of grace
appears therefore.</p>
                  <p>1. In that they have the Oracles of God. To them, that is, to
the Jew outwardly, theſe Oracles were committed, as the Apoſtle
tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1. They were committed to them as their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 4. They were poſſeſt of them, in order to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
life, <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. And theſe Oracles, being Covenant-tables,
Covenant-draughts, the profeſſed believer, that by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from God, ſtands poſſeſt of them, is in Covenant with
God.</p>
                  <p>2. They have the ſeals of the covenant. Covenant, and right
to the ſeale, where ſeals are appointed, cannot be ſevered as
ſhall be ſhewen. They are in covenant, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and,
they have the ſeales of the covenant, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed
had, Thoſe were circumciſed, and theſe are baptiſed; and, that
it may appear, that they had not this honour barely from man,
without approbation from God (as ſome ſeem to hint, in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of <hi>Forum Dei,</hi> and <hi>Forum Eccleſiae,</hi> as though the
Church received them, when in the ſight of God they had no
right to be received) we finde, 1. That the Spirit of God, in the
Scripture, ſtill calls them, in way of honour, by the name of
circumciſion, and men may, but God will not thus give, an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal
or nick-name to them. As they were circumciſed in the
fleſh, ſo it was the minde of God, that they ſhould beare in their
fleſh, this ſigne and ſeale of the Covenant. 2. Upon it, they had
many and great priviledges, yea, all Church priviledges, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon this leading priviledge, though otherwiſe, ſtrangers to the
Common-weale of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> now they were look't upon as of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:55700:150"/>
3. Anſwering unto, and in ſincerity making good, that unto which
they do actually engage, the whole bleſſing of the Covenant is
theirs. They that undertake the termes, on which covenant-ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
according to the Goſpel is had, are actually veſted in a
a ſaving covenant; but they undertake the termes, on which
covenant-ſalvation according to the Goſpel is had, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in a ſaving covenant.</p>
                  <p>4. In caſe unbelief and impenitence in them, be not only Law-tranſgreſſions,
but alſo Goſpel-ſins, and breaches of a Goſpel-covenant,
then theſe profeſſed believers are under a Goſpel-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
This is evident; They ſin not againſt the Goſpel that are
not under the Goſpel, they break not covenant that were never in
covenant, but their unbelief and impenitence are above Law-tranſgreſſions,
they are Goſpel-ſins, and breaches of covenant, as
I think, need not to be proved, and therefore it is plain that they
are in covenant.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account, I confeſſe, I have often marvelled why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
eminent and godly Divines do earneſtly perſwade their people
to whom they ſpeak, to enter covenant with God, giving dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
what way they are to take to come into covenant with him;
telling them that it is of great concernment to them to know un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what covenant they are, whether under a covenant of Works,
or a covenant of grace; when the ſame men expreſſely ſay that
we all entred covenant in baptiſme; and that unbelief and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence
at leaſt, if not every ſin, is a breach of our baptiſm, vow
and covenant. Might not any think that theſe did perſwade to be
baptiſed? and that they tell their people that it is of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
to know what covenant it is that baptiſme ſeales, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it ſeales the covenant of Works, or the covenant of Grace.
If we enter in covenant in our baptiſme, as they truly ſay, that
we did, as to the <hi>Jus in re,</hi> then how comes it to paſſe that any
that are baptiſed are out of it, and being already actually in it, how
are they perſwaded to enter into it. Theſe perſwaſions therefore,
and motives to enter covenant, I think ſhould be to preſſe men on
to keep covenant, and ſo the directions which they lay down are
indeed of divine and excellent uſe. And when they ſay it ſo much
concernes men to know what covenant they are under, I conceive
it ſhould rather be to let them know of how great concernment
it is to them to ſee that they have their intereſt in the mercies of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:55700:151"/>
the covenant through grace anſwering to the termes of it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites
in it, and ſo the entring of covenant, which is done, as
theſe ſay, in baptiſme, and keeping of covenaut, or obtaining
the mercies of the covenant, would not be confounded but diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.
Their labours would likewiſe be of excellent uſe which
otherwiſe ſcarce ſuit either with their own words or the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
It may be objected, that in caſe they are from under the
covenant of Works, and under the covenant of Grace, then they
are exempted from the curſe, and acquitted from the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is annext to that covenant, which cannot be affirmed
of any meer Profeſſour of Chriſtianity in unbelief and impenitence,
and enough is ſpoken in this Treatiſe it ſelf againſt it. To this I
anſwer, 1. The curſe may follow upon the tranſgreſſion of the
Law, as a Law, without conſideration of any covenant at all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Works or Grace, and it is not intereſt in Covenant, but
intereſt in Chriſt, (which theſe, ſuppoſedly ſuch, have not) that
frees from condemnation. 2. What if it be yielded that they
beare no more than the penalty annext to the breach of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace. If the Goſpel be conſulted that is ſufficiently
ſad and heavy. If they be put to beare that, nothing more needs
to be added to the burden, and indeed with ſubmiſſion to better
judgments, not reſolvedly determining any thing, it is my thoughts,
that profeſſed Chriſtians in unbelief and impenitence, ſuffer not
upon account of the penalty annext to the breach of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works, but upon account of the penalty annext to the
breach of the covenant of Grace; and let not any here object
that the tranſgreſſion of the Law ſhall not then be laid to their
charge, for the Goſpel bindes us to the obedience of the Law,
though not in exact perfection, yet in ſincerity and truth. And
this, I ſuppoſe, receives ſtrength from that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
1, 7, 8. The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his
mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that
know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, which character therof [not knowing God] Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(ſaith Dr. <hi>Slater</hi> upon the words) generally take to be a deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the Gentiles, who though they know God by his Works,
yet they know him not by his Word, and to this he ſubſcribes.
The other character of [not obeying the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt]
is, as he ſaith, a circumſcription of Chriſtians, according to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55700:151"/>
Goſpel-diſobedience is then their guilt, and upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this they ſuffer. Had they believed and yielded ſincere
obedience which they profeſſed, and to which they engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they had not periſhed, and the want of this appears to be
their deſtruction.</p>

thoſe clauſes, that belong only to the Church inviſible: I ſhall
refer them to Doctor <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> in his ſecond <hi>Theſis,</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bottoming it on that Text, <hi>Mat. 22. 14. Many are called,
but few choſen,</hi> which yet, muſt be confeſt with judicious Maſter
<hi>Hudſon,</hi> that it is not a diviſion into two diſtinct Churches,
or ſpecies of Churches, but a diſtribution of the ſubject by the

page 4. One, and the ſame Church, hath members of a
viſible, and inviſible notion, a more full explanation may there
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55700:152"/>
be ſeen. This being premiſed, I affirm, that intereſt in Church-memberſhip,
in a viſible Church-ſtate, is theirs, and may be
claimed by all thoſe that have intereſt in the covenant before
named, an external intereſt, or, an intereſt in the external covenant,
as uſually it hath been called This is a ſure rule,<note place="margin">Ubi foedus, ibi eccleſia.</note> 
                     <hi>Where the Covenant
is, there the Church is;</hi> and in what latitude ſoever men are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into covenant, they are received into the Church. Lawes
tendred by a Prince, and received by a people (whether they be
tendred immediately by himſelf, or by his Heraulds or Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours)
make up the relation of King and people: A marriage-covenant
tendred by a man (as by <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant in the
name of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Rebecca, Gen.</hi> 24.) and accepted by a Virgin,
makes up the relation of husband and wife: covenant-draughts
between man and man for ſervice, (as an apprentice his inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
make up the relation of Maſter and ſervant, now the
Goſpel-covenant is all of theſe, between God and a people;
where God tenders it, and a people receive it, there God hath
his Spouſe, his Subjects, his Servants. Theſe are his people, and
all of theſe are Church-members. The Word preached and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
hath ever been aſſigned by Orthodox Divines, as the
characteriſtical note of a Church of God; a Church ſtands and
falls with it; where it is profeſſedly received, there is a Church-intereſt.
Let one man apart receive it, as was the caſe of the
Eunuch, he forthwith becomes a Church-member, and is to
have (as we ſee he had) his preſent matriculation, and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

whereſoever he comes, is a Saint, a Diſciple, a Chriſtian, a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever,
and ſo to be received and acknowledged; This is
abundantly confirmed in thoſe parables of our Saviour

and were to leave them to be propagated in future Ages, and
knowing a covenant to be eſſential to the conſtitution, as now
by ſome is aſſerted; would yet wholly be ſilent in it, eſpecially
when no ſuch thing was known in Old Teſtament-Scriptures, that

confident as confidence could make him, that it had no ground
in the holy Scriptures. But to leave heathens, haply called by
Goſpel Ordinances, to ſpeak a word or two to our own caſe,
who are a diſcipled Nation, a Kingdom ſubjugated to the yoke of
Chriſt Jeſus, enjoying ſaving Ordinances, and therefore have a
Church of Chriſt fixt among us. Here we might lay down divers
poſitions for the regulating of our judgements.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, where nothing is wanting to the being of a Church,
God having a people owning him in covenant, yet much more
may be required for the well ordering and regulating of it; where
a people accept of a King, and receive his Lawes, there he hath a
Kingdom, and is a Monarch, yet much more is required for
the ordering of ſuch a Monarchy, for the publick weale and
ſafety; ſo it is, where there is a Church of God, accepting
the Lawes of heaven, there the Lord Chriſt reigns as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
yet farther care muſt be uſed for the right regulating of
it according to his Will, and the Lawes tendred by him, and
received by them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">A people in a vicinity or neighbourhood ought to aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate according to their beſt convenience, for participation of Ordinances.</note> a people in a vicinity, or neighbourhood, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

thoſe of that neighbourhood, according to their beſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for the participation of Ordinances. As it is againſt all
dictates of reaſon, that a people ſcattered at a great diſtance
ſhould combine themſelves in a Church-way, for Ordinances, in
which God rules, ſo it is as clear againſt the Scriptures. You
read of a Church of God, at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> at
<hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> at <hi>Laodicea,</hi> But you reade not of any one Church
made up of members, reſiding at all thoſe places, or in any places at
like diſtance. That cohabitation or dwelling together, makes not
up a Church congregational, will be eaſily granted; Infidels, Turks,
Pagans may cohabit, they may make an idol-church, but not
a Church of God, but co-habitation or dwelling together, is
one ingredient; Saints cohabiting, that is, in New Teſtament-language,
men ſeparate for God, not Jewes, nor Infidels, but
Chriſtians, and joyning in Ordinances, as in duty they ought, are
a congregational Church. A Paſtour ought to watch over his
people, and a people ought to attend to their Paſtour, which how
it can be, when the Paſtour makes his reſidence at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55700:155"/>
people, ſome at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſome at <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſome at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and ſo
ſcattered, it cannot be imagined. We finde ſeven ſeveral Epiſtles,
written from heaven to ſeven ſeveral Churches, all which had
their abode at the place, whence the Church bore its name;
theſe are Scripture-Churches. Now, if any one Church be made
up of Chriſtians, ſome inhabiting at one of thoſe places, ſome
at another, a third at a third place, ſcarce three of one Town,
no more than of one minde; here is not Scripture-order, which
is of God, but an Apocryphal confuſion; Exceptions may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at the over-large extent and diſordered ſituation of divers
Parochial Congregations, which calls for Reformation, coming
too near the inconvenience before mentioned, but Parochial
Aſſemblies, not the name, but the thing; <hi>viz.</hi> a people inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at convenient diſtance, and joyning together under Officers,
according to Scripture, is the way that comes up, both to the
light of reaſon, and the Preſidents of primitive times. Our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Brethren will have the limit of a particular Church, to
be within that number of perſons, that may congregate in one
place for Ordinances, if this be yielded (as it muſt be for Churches
meerly Congregational,) then it will eaſily be proved, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-congregations,
that is, congregations of men dwelling in a
vicinity, are of divine inſtitution; Saints that made up a Church
were ſtill Saints in cohabitation, ſuch convenient numbers as
are fit to make up a Church, did not live divided in place, and
ſcattered, ſome here, ſome there, but were, as in faith, ſo in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
joyned together.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Profeſſing Chriſtians up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tender of themſelves ought to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the places where they inhabit.</note> all profeſſing Chriſtians in ſuch cohabitation (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the civil power authorizing) are to be eſteemed and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
members, and not to be refuſed, when they offer themſelves
as members; where there is a holineſſe of ſeparation for God,
and a profeſſed engagement to real holineſſe, there is no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-warrant
for repulſe; Thoſe that offer themſelves to learn,
are taken into the School, and not thoſe only that have made
a good progreſſe in knowledge, and fit for the uppermoſt forme.
Me thinks this ſhould be a Propoſition agreed upon between us,
and our diſſenting brethren, ſeeing reverend Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down certain Propoſitions conſented to on both ſides, in
his Treatiſe of the holineſſe of Church-members, <hi>page</hi> 1. ſaith,
<hi>That ſuch, as are borne of Chriſtian Parents, and baptized in their

Infancy into the fellowſhip of the Church, are initiated members of
the ſame Church, though deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>itute of ſpiritual grace, until they juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deprive themſelves of the priviledge of that fellowſhip. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of ſuch is the Kingdome of God,</hi> as <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 14. This was the
caſe as we conceive of thoſe that have gone from us into thoſe
parts of <hi>America,</hi> Here they were, in infancy baptized, here they
have joyned in Communion at the Lords Table. If they ſay,
they were not baptized here into ſuch Church-fellowſhip, then
they muſt ſay that here is no Church of God amongſt us (which
as we abhorre to ſpeak, or think of them, ſo we muſt not yield con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our ſelves) and farther conclude their baptiſm here a meer
nullity, and no more than an application of a little common water.
They whoſe baptiſme is valid, are baptized into one body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 13. and therefore in a baptized eſtate, cannot be out of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with that body. The late Confeſſion of Faith agreed upon by
the Aſſembly of Divines, not excepted againſt in that particular
by our brethren that I know, define baptiſme to be a <hi>Sacrament of
the New Teſtament, ordained by Jeſus Chriſt, not only for the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the party baptized into the viſible Church, but, &amp;c.</hi> Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
into Church-memberſhip they then lay down as a thing never
doubted, which reverend Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> ſeems to affirm likewiſe,
and I know no Orthodox Writer that queſtions, Aſſoon as any
were diſcipled through the Acts of the Apoſtles, according to
Chriſts commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. they were thus received. I have
often marvelled what men mean, when they ſpeak of admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of members into Churches, when the parties of whom they
ſpeak have already equal right with themſelves to memberſhip,
Have they any other, or better right than title to the covenant, and
admiſſion by the ſeal of baptiſm? if they have, let them produce it,
and then ſubmit it to Scripture-trial. I know none other that
will abide the teſte; If they confeſſe baptiſm to be an admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then their title is as good, that were thus before admitted,
as theirs that give them admiſſion. Their plea in both is one, <hi>viz.</hi>
birth of Chriſtian parents, and baptiſm. For thoſe that they paſſe
by, either forbearing to give them admittance deſiring, or that
through ſcruple cannot joyne themſelves, not ſeeing warrant for
ſuch a way, varying from the way of all the Churches of the Saints
heretofore, what do they judge of them? Do they look upon them
as men without, and unworthy of their Communion? Then
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55700:156"/>
they leave them without hope, without God in the world, <hi>Eph.</hi>
2. 12. yea, they put them into an incapacity, according to
Gods ordinary way of ſalvation. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 47. All were not
ſaved, that were added, nor ſaved in the judgement of charity; that
is a comment, as ſtrange as new, but all were added, and none
refuſed that would enter themſelves into ſalvation-way, which
they might do out of affection of novelty, at that time poſſeſt
with amazement by reaſon of the miracles, under great preſent
convictions, through <hi>Peters</hi> powerful Scripture-applications, and
upon twenty other accounts which might be but fits, flaſhings,
or preſent workings, yet all that were to be ſaved were added.
All the maids that were brought to <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> and offered for
purification, <hi>Esther</hi> 2. 3, 4. Were not made Queens, but none
was made Queen that was not thus offered and purified. If it be
ſaid, they are within, as many paſſages from ſeveral hands
would ſeem to imply, as well concerning ſuch that are refuſed, as
thoſe that do refuſe, the modeſty of many is ſuch, that they
are loth to unchurch all but themſelves, then they are heires of
the ſame promiſe with themſelves, and all the eſſentials of a
Church of God are with thoſe that in this way of Communion
are none of theirs, and conſequently their covenant or ſeparate

Chriſt, and Chriſtian Profeſſors brought to thoſe ſtraits, that there
is no abiding for ſuch as would keep their garments unſpotted, it
will be of uſe here, to deliver certain rules for our help and
guidance.</p>
                  <p>1. A Church in covenant with God,<note place="margin">A Church is pure where the pollutions and taints are not ſoule.</note> as before, and keeping
up communion in Ordinances, is to be accounted pure,
where the pollutions or taints are not great, nor many, it is
to be accounted a right beleeving Church, notwithſtanding
ſome few leſſer Errors. We account a corne-field clean
where ſome few tares and weeds are found, a body health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that is not without grudgings, Chriſt from heaven
gives commendations to thoſe Churches which yet he taxes,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 3. for failings. There is that light in which Errors
may be ſeen and ſhunned, and rules for diſcerning things that
differ. If cuſtom, education, conceit of Teachers, or the
like ſo dazle the judgement, that the errour is ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
howſoever that be a detriment, a blemiſh, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſhews of the wood, hay and ſtubble, built upon the
foundation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12. yet it prejudices not ſalvation.
There is power of truth remaining, to forme and frame
Chriſt in the heart, to direct the ſoul in a ſanctified way to
ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>2. Where the Word is received and profeſt,<note place="margin">Foully polluted and defaced, it is a Church, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

corn-field, though over-run with tares and weeds. The
Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> have the name of Churches, though
miſerably defiled; we deny not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

whom the Word is continued; No Church, ſome have

monſtrouſly polluted: I will not rake in her ſores,
it were eaſie to name many and loathſome ones. I will only
point at the cauſes. Where food is ſcarce, and that pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

diſtempered; but ſo it fares with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when
the Word ſhould dwell in us in all plenteouſneſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16.
they will have theirs dieted, the Word kept in an unknown
language, as under lock and key, that the children can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

But they have their unwritten word, to ſtand in equipage

all other Nations, ſo that no Nation is ſo great as

their greateſt honour, and the pollution the greateſt ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,

Theſe foundation-breaches in buildings may be either cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
threatning danger, but repairable, taken betimes may
be holpen, though a failing there is ſooneſt helpleſſe, or
elſe, it is a ruine or rottenneſſe that is irremediable, irrepair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Truths doubted, diſputed, queſtioned, I call a craze
in the foundation wonderfully dangerous, not alwayes
damnable; the caſe of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> of whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſtood in feare, and was jealous over them, through
a godly jealouſie, even of their revolt from Chriſtianity to
Judaiſm, from Chriſt to <hi>Moſes,</hi> from the Goſpel to the
Law: Theſe, he calls Churches, the members brethren,
though in a way to be no Churches, entertaining thoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
that cut off from Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. Here,
all thoſe that are builders in Chriſts work, that are pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
or any part of his houſe, muſt be zealous, as we ſee
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was, in this Epiſtle quoted; who will ſee the
foundation of the houſe where he lives ſo undermined, as
every day to threaten ruine? much leſſe may we ſuffer the
foundation in Chriſts houſe to be thus uſed. This faith
once delivered to the Saints is the common ſalvation, for
this we muſt earneſtly contend, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. for this we muſt
ſtrive together, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. Truths denied, abjured, and
reſolved againſt (as it was with <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> and
the Apoſtle ſaw the Churches in <hi>Galatia</hi> in danger) is a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
and rottenneſſe, that is irremediable, and irreparable.
Beſides breaches in fundamentals, there are breaches in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and theſe either more neer to the foundation, or
at a greater diſtance. The nearer the foundation, the more
danger; a breach is more ſufferable near the top, than at the
bottome of a tower, or caſtle. There are errours of more
affinity with thoſe that overthrow bottom-truths, and
there are thoſe that are not ſo nigh, and therefore not ſo
dangerous; Such crept into the Latine Church before Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
was raiſed to his height and ſtrength in his deluſions,
and Antichriſt ſtill holds them of all ſorts and ſizes; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of both of theſe, may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55700:158"/>
where it is miſ-laid; where edifying doctrines are
not preached, and where they are miſ-preacht, both tend
to the Churches danger; a houſe never compleat or built
up entire, but defective in ſeveral parts, little differs from
that which is ruinous: The Apoſtle, who is worthily ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

bear up, and carrie on the whole work, accordingly as they
daſh upon Chriſt, and obſcure his glory, whether more, or
leſſe, the eſtimate of the danger is to be taken. Theſe are
either ſuch that render Chriſt in an uncapacity to be our
Mediatour and Saviour, or ſuch that are inconſiſtent, in
whole or in part with his Mediatourſhip; of the former
kinde are thoſe that are againſt his perſon. 1. Thoſe that
impugne the Godhead of Chriſt, ſuch, that though they
give him the glory, to be above Angels, yet will make him
no more than a creature; a God in title and place, as are
Magiſtrates, not in nature or power; An opinion that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves
the Apoſtolick Church, and all Churches in ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in idolatry, giving the honour of God, the worſhip due
to God, unto him who by nature is no God; A doctrine
that will make Chriſt an impotent, and not an omnipotent
head, too weak for his work, to govern the world, and
bring under his enemies. 2. Thoſe that deny his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
as having not taken our fleſh, and ſo, no ſuitable
head, but a phantaſtick or ſeeming body. Thoſe that are
againſt his Mediatourſhip; are, either ſuch that obſcure,
or ſome way eclipſe it, as every errour doth that is any
way conſiderable, or ſuch that raze, if not utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
it, in ſome of the neceſſary parts of it, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Prieſthood, or Prophetical Office. Theſe are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
either directly, in termes of full oppoſition, or elſe
by conſequence, and this ſuch, that is either immediate and

elſe the conſequence more remote, and not ſo eaſily diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">Separation in ſome caſes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note>
Theſe things being premiſed, we muſt bring it home to

ſufficient edifying truths, nor yet antidotes to preſerve
from danger, when they <hi>would have healed Babylon, and ſhe
would not be healed, then it is time to forſake. If any man

Chriſt in thoſe Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and preached
down Circumciſion, and other points of Judaiſme, pleaſed
the Apoſtle better, then they that without ſuch endeavour
ſhould deſert it; ſo thoſe that had preached the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

upon the fourth of <hi>John</hi> (whom without honour I cannot

ſeparation? of which he ſtill appeares to be tender though
he ſeeme <hi>page</hi> 13. of his Treatiſe of holineſſe of Church-members
to be over indulgent to it, Speaking in excuſe of
thoſe that withdraw from communion in publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Chriſt, when Church-Officers receive in, for mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church, thoſe that are moſt ſcandalous and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and not ſuch Saints as <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to at <hi>Rome,
Corinth, Epheſus, Coloſſe,</hi> and defending them againſt Mr.
<hi>Rutherford,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>But if private members be perſwaded

right and intereſt as well in the admiſſion of members as in
excommunication of offenders or in election of officers, how ſhall
they keep themſelves from partaking in the ſinnes of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
if they ſuffer them to go on in ſuch a manifeſt breach
of rule without due proceeding againſt them for their refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</hi>
and after ſome caution given he concludes, <hi>It is
eſſential to Community to have power to admit unto commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and to withdraw from communion.</hi> To which I ſay. 1.
We have not a full account, of the Saints in thoſe Churches,
reſpective to ſcandals, it ſeems by divers paſſages, that
many in <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> were none of the ſoundeſt in faith, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Apoſtles reproof, <hi>chap.</hi> 2 20. I am ſure, that if any
Church, have ſuch as were to be found in <hi>Corinth,</hi> for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Idolatry, faction, oppreſſion, adultery, laſciviouſneſs,
prophanation of the Lords Table, they will be judged ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſcandalous. 2. If ſuch a perſwaſion in conſcience, would
warrant a ſeparation, it would be worth enquiry to know
what ſeparation is not warrantable? The error that Mr.
<hi>Brightman</hi> brands, as wicked and blaſphemous, is here abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
juſtified; Church-guides (at leaſt in ſome places) were
then, ſo far at leaſt, guilty in their admiſſions. 3. What war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty
is there, for any mans withdrawing himſelf, from
publick Communion in the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, when
he may with freedome enjoy that glorious priviledge, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55700:161"/>
that account that he cannot enjoy the whole of
thoſe priviledges, or actual exerciſe of them, in which
he takes himſelf to have any intereſt. Sure I am Miniſters
of Chriſt, in many reformed Churches in the world,
have judged themſelves to be overmuch coopt up, in
ſeveral particulars, when yet they judged the very thought
of ſeparation in this caſe, to be the greateſt <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aculum.</hi>
4 This right or intereſt in every particular member to
vote in this way for admiſſion or ejection, may well be
queſtioned; If there had been this freedome in primitive
times claimed, and exerciſe, there had not been ſo much,
in ſo ſhort a ſpace diſpatched, as was done in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
and <hi>Samaria, Acts 2. Acts</hi> 8. If all muſt vote, in buſineſſe
of ſo high concernment, as in proceeding againſt officers,
and to give definitive ſentence concerning their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
either many a meet member will be kept without,
or elſe many an incompetent judge, muſt be taken in, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a poor ſoul weak in the faith is fit for the Lords Table,
who is not yet fit to judge of the abilities of his Paſtour.
All, that I know, that is produced with any colour, is that
direction of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5.
<hi>When ye are gathered together with the power of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, to deliver ſuch a one unto Satan for the deſtruction of
the fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord
Jeſus.</hi> But if it be conſidered, that <hi>Corinth</hi> had more then
one Congregation (as ſeveral <hi>Diſſenting brethren</hi> have
yeelded, and as to other Churches may eaſily be proved)
then, it muſt follow, that this meeting was only of officers,
and not of all Members. And how this power is eſſential
to a community, I cannot conceive. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation
have judged themſelves a community, and yet there is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a free-borne Subject, that never had a thought of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſing
himſelf by way of vote; to naturalize ſtrangers, or to
make them free Denizons, nor yet to expulſe them in caſe
of intruſion. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orporations of <hi>England</hi> are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
yet every Member hath not his intereſt, for vote to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
into their body. When the chief Captaine bought his
Freedome in <hi>Rome,</hi> Acts 22 28 I ſcarce think, every Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of that ſociety was conſulted in it, neither did <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:55700:162"/>
when he heard of it, enter his exception, becauſe his intereſt
was infringed. The ſeveral companies in <hi>London,</hi> are ſo
many ſeveral communities; yet every one of the members
of thoſe Companies, doth not claime an intereſt, in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in, men, as free of their reſpective myſteries; an opinion
of ſuch a Liberty, will ſoon bring Church Members under
an heavy yoke, taking themſelves to be ſo farre intereſſed
in every publick act of their Officers, that they may not
without open oppoſition (which is ſeldome borne) or
actual ſeparation, keep themſelves from guilt in their aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">To gather Churches out of Churches to make up one Congregation out of many is unwarrantable.</note> to gather Churches out of Churches; to make up one
congregation of Members appertaining to, and locally ſeated in

arguments againſt this practice. The diſorderly confuſion, which
of neceſſity it doth occaſion; The weakening of the work of
God in the place where providence hath ſeated them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
many mercies upon them: The robbing of Paſtours of

But letting theſe paſſe, I ſhall onely urge this, that it is without all

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55700:162"/>
of the Jewes; Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſubmitting to that which
<hi>John</hi> did introduce, yet ſtill held communion with the Church of
the Jews; They were not Members at once of two diſtinct
Churches; of the new, becauſe more refined, and of the old
tainted and corrupted.</p>
                  <p>2. If <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> according to duty, ſet up a new gathered
Church in a Church of Chriſt; then all the Prophets from <hi>Samuel</hi>
to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> fell ſhort of duty. If they follow <hi>John</hi> in
what he did, we follow all the Prophets and Apoſtles in what
they did, All the Prophets till <hi>John,</hi> did propheſie in the ſame
Church of Chriſt and not any of them did ſet up new
Churches.</p>
                  <p>3. The old Church-way of adminiſtration among the Jewes
was then to fall, that preſent adminiſtration to be taken down
by Gods appointment, and a new one to be ſet up according to his
preſcript.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>John</hi> ſet up a new Sacrament, in a new way which after his days
was the alone Church-way. If any can ſhew (as our ſeekers look
after) that Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall now put an end to this way, and that,
they have a Commiſſion, for a new Sacrament of initiation,
then they ſpeak ſomewhat, for ſetting up new Churches, in like
manner.</p>

The Covenant is the ground on which baptiſme is bottomed,
otherwiſe Church-Memberſhip would evince no title either in
Infants, or in men of years to Baptiſme; But the Covenant (as we
have proved) is entred with men of Faith; not ſaving, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to them Baptiſme is to be adminiſtred. How the conſequent
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55700:163"/>
can be denyed by thoſe that grant the Antecedent; Baptiſme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> to men ſhort of ſaving faith, when they are in

affirme, <hi>If men be once taught that it is a faith, that is ſhort of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and ſaving Faith, which admitteth men to Baptiſme; it will
make foule work in the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1.) All that hath been ſaid for the latitude of the covenant,
may fitly be applyed in oppoſition to this tenent, for the like la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>(2) All the abſurdities following the reſtraint of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Elect, to men of Faith ſaving and juſtifying, follow
upon this reſtraint of intereſt in Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>(3.) To make the viſible ſeale of Baptiſme which is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

of the Spirit which is peculiar to inviſible members, is a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.</p>
                  <p>4. The great condition to which Baptiſme engages, is not a
prerequiſite in baptiſme. This is plaine, to man is bound to make
good his covenant conditions before his engagements to conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
no ſervant is tyed to do his work, to gaine admiſſion into
ſervice; no ſouldier to fight in order to get himſelf liſted under

baptiſme engages, and no condition neceſſarily required to veſt
him in it.</p>
                  <p>5. That Faith upon which <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in Primitive times
was baptized, is that which admitteth to baptiſme; <hi>Simon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

then none is able to baptize; ſeeing this by none is diſcerned;

placed in Scripture. So we may ſay, <hi>John</hi> baptized before he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the baptiſme of Repentance; for his baptizing is put before
his preaching of baptiſme, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 4. and that thoſe that he
baptized did confeſſe their ſinnes after their baptiſme, ſeeing it is
mentioned after that it is ſaid, that they were baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi>
3. 6. and both of theſe with a farre greater probability of reaſon,
ſeeing in both there is a narrative of the thing by the Evangeliſts,
and in the place in hand there is neither commiſſion given for the
work of baptizing, nor yet any narrative of the work,
but onely doctrine given in charge which they were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
which leaſt of all ſpeaks the order in which the duties ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
muſt neceſſarily be practiſed. All that can be collected,
is that we muſt in Gods ordinary way of conferring ſalvation,
have both Faith and baptiſme; though there be not the like ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſity of baptiſme as of Faith; baptiſme being neceſſary,
<hi>neceſſitate precepti;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt having inſtituted it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it; but Faith is neceſſary both <hi>neceſſitate medii,</hi> and <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti;</hi>
ſeeing Chriſt not only commanded it, but ſalvation at no
hand can be obtained (by men in capacity of it) without it; And
therefore it hath been well obſerved that in the words following,
the like ſtreſſe is not laid on Baptiſme as on Faith; not he that is
not baptized, <hi>but he that beleeveth not, ſhall be damned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Let <hi>Peter</hi> where he ſpeaks of ſalvation by baptiſme, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
theſe words; <hi>Baptiſme doth now alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſave us by
the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. and then explaines
himſelfe; <hi>Not the pntting away the filth of the fleſh, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of a good conſcience towards God.</hi> This anſwer or reſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
unto the outward adminiſtration of baptiſme, is that which
follows upon baptiſme; but juſtifying Faith is that reſtipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(at leaſt a principal branch of it), and therefore there is no
neceſſity that it go before, but a neceſſity that it muſt follow
after baptiſme. It is true that in men of yeares, juſtifying faith
ſometimes goes before baptiſme, as in <hi>Abraham</hi> it went before
Circumciſion, but it is not of neceſſity required to intereſt us in a
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55700:164"/>
right, neither of baptiſme, nor circumciſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi>

ſeal;) But it is onely ſolid true faith, which is the condition of the
promiſe (of Remiſſion; Therefore it is that onely that gives right in
<hi>foro Dei</hi> to the ſeal.</p>
                  <p>Here is an Argument firſt propoſed,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> ſecondly in a <hi>parentheſis</hi>
paraphraſed, for the propoſition I ſay faith is not ſealed to, but
remiſſion of ſinnes or ſalvation upon condition of faith. A profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
of Faith that goes no farther, may engage himſelf to a lively
working faith, and upon thoſe termes God engages for, and
puts his ſeale for Remiſſion and Salvation. For the parentheſis,
<hi>That faith which is the condition of the Promiſe, is the condition</hi> in
foro Dei <hi>of the title to the ſeale,</hi> I judge the contrary to be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable.
That faith which is the condition of the Promiſe, is not
the condition <hi>in foro Dei</hi> of title to the ſeale. An acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the neceſſity of ſuch faith with engagement to it, is
ſufficient for a title to the ſeale, and the performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of like neceſſity to attaine the thing ſealed. To promiſe
ſervice and fidelity in war is enough to get liſted, as to do ſervice is
of neceſſity to be rewarded.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as for the Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> framed againſt
thoſe who make initial or common faith ſufficient to entitle to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme,
and yet affixe remiſſion of ſins to all Baptiſme, even ſo
received without any performance of farther engagement; I leave
to them to defend who maintaine ſuch doctrine, and to ſpeak to
the abſurdities that follow upon it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, that of <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch ſeems to carry moſt colour.
<hi>The Eunuch muſt beleeve with all his heart before he be baptized,</hi>
and I have known it troubleſome that are fully convinced that a
dogmatical faith gives title to Baptiſme, ſatisfying themſelves with
this anſwer, That howſoever <hi>Philip</hi> called for ſuch a faith which
leads to ſalvation, yet did not expreſſe himſelf ſo far that no Faith
ſhort of this gives title to baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>It may be anſwered that a dogmatical faith is true faith, <hi>ſuo
genere,</hi> as well as that which juſtifies; therefore I know not why
men ſhould give it the terme of falſe faith, ſeeing Scripture calls
it faith, and ſuch as thoſe beleevers, and the heart in ſuch a
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55700:165"/>
Faith (as to an entire aſſent) is required. If we look into the
Eunuchs anſwer on which <hi>Philip</hi> did reſt ſatisfied, and proceeded
upon it to baptiſme, it will take away all ſcruple; his anſwer is,
<hi>I beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God.</hi> There is no more in
that then a common faith, this is beleeved by men not juſtified;
yet this faith entitles to baptiſme, and upon this confeſſion of
faith, the Eunuch is baptized.</p>

ſo they by ſin forſake the covenant by which they ſtand

name Chriſtian, and found in any of theſe ſinnes, are in a loſt
and unrecoverable condition; joyning with them that have ſaid,
that there is no grace or pardon for thoſe that fall into ſinne
after baptiſme. That he died not for their ſinnes that live and
die in final impenitence and unbelief, may be eaſily granted,
and that riſes to no more then that he died not for thoſe, that
finally and unrecoverably break covenant with him. It is
granted by a learned adverſary that final unbelief and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
are violations of this covenant, but no other impenitence
or unbelief; but that which is final, and for this, as is affirmed
Chriſt never died; To this I ſay, If unbelief and impenitence be

final unbelief and impenitence is no breach or violation of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

ſtood, in impenitence or unbelief; As Perſeverance in faith and
repentance, is the continuance of faith and repentance. If then
final unbelief and impenitence be a breach of the covenant of
grace, then all unbelief and impenitence, denominating a man,
an unbeleeving and impenitent perſon, is a breach of covenant

(were there no more arguments) doth witneſſe it, <hi>Gen. 17. 11.
Ye ſhall Circumciſe the fleſh of your fore-skin, and it ſhall be a
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:55700:166"/>
token of the Covenant between me and you.</hi> Circumciſion was bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
on the Command, we grant, had there been no inſtitution,
no man might have preſumed to have ſigned it with ſuch a Seale,
but the Command had relation to the Covenant; Men in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
were the <hi>adequate</hi> ſubject of Circumciſion, and are of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme;
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10. God ſaid to <hi>Abraham, Thou ſhalt keep
my Covenant therefore, thou, and thy ſeed after thee in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
This is my Covenant which you ſhall keep between me and
you, and thy ſeed after thee, every man-childe among you ſhall be
circumciſed.</hi> He was indeed after caſt out, with his ſeed, as was
<hi>Eſau;</hi> not by a Church-cenſure, as Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> affirmes, <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Church-Members,</hi> Church-cenſures, fall not ſo heavy as to
reach all poſterity; but by divine prerogative as the Apoſtle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. abundantly declares. His caſting out ſufficiently argues
that he was once in, and when he received the token of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
he was in covenant.</p>
                  <p>(2.) He does ill, in laying upon <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the brand of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardy,
as though he were a ſonne of whoredomes to faithful
<hi>Abraham;</hi> Concubines in Scripture have the name of wives, and
their ſeed was ever accounted legitimate; neither will this ſerve
his purpoſe at all to argue <hi>Iſhmael</hi> out of Covenant. It was the
caſe of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Nepthali, Gad</hi> and <hi>Aſher,</hi> (out of whoſe loines
a conſiderable part of Gods Covenant-people did iſſue) as well
as <hi>Iſhmaels.</hi> And could he faſten that ignominy on <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> to make it an illegitimate iſſue; yet this would not
caſt <hi>Iſhmael</hi> out of covenant. It was the caſe of <hi>Pharez, Zarah,
Jephthah,</hi> and yet they were all in Covenant with God. 2. He
makes applicat on of this diſtinction, and ſaith, <hi>Of the three former
kinds of</hi> Abrahams ſeed <hi>the promiſe recited is meant, but in a different
manner thus: That God promiſeth he will be a God to Chriſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
in him bleſſings to all the Nations of the earth, to the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>in Evangelical benefits to the natural ſeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting
in domeſtick and political benefits.</hi> So that it evidently
appeares, that he caſts out all the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
or baſe, as he calls them, inheriting or not inheriting) from
any title to that Covenant, ſave in domeſtick and political be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.
Here I ſhall undertake a Poſition in full oppoſition, that
<hi>that Covenant in thoſe words expreſt; I will eſtabliſh my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

ſpoken, in the largeſt comprehenſion (which according to Scripture they

Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob. But before I come to the confirmation of it
(which is a matter of eaſe, if any) give me leave, (as well for
the help of the Reader, as ſatisfaction of the Adverſary,) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

And ſo the Apoſtle explaines it, <hi>Rom. 9. 7, 8. Neither
becauſe they are the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all children; but

but of him that calleth. It was ſaid unto her, the elder ſhall ſerve

of the covenant, is mentioned in Scripture, it is not barely <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>

Neither is it as an upright man before God, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
covenant, for thoſe of his poſterity, whoſe hearts were not
ſtedfaſt, were in covenant, and did hand it over to their ſeed, But
as a profeſſour of the Faith accepting the covenant, taking God
for his God, in contradiſtinction to falſe gods, he accepted it for
himſelf and for his ſeed, his natural poſterity. And all that

                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The Covenant entitles to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mercies, and life eternal upon Gods termes and condition.</note> we entitle the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as before, to ſpiritual

Salvation is made over by vertue of covenant, to all thus
in covenant, in that ſenſe, as Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>John 4. 22. Salvation
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:55700:168"/>
is of the Jews.</hi> In that ſenſe as Chriſt uſeth it of <hi>Zacheus</hi> family;
<hi>This day is ſalvation come this houſe,</hi> Luke 19. 9. In that ſenſe as
the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks of it, where he ſets out the
danger of <hi>neglecting ſo great ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 2. 3. In that ſenſe (as
I conceive) the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it, where he ſaith, that upon the cal
of the Jews, <hi>All Iſrael ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 11. 26 They ſhall
enjoy thoſe priviledges, in which ſalvation upon Gods terms may
be obtained, and this is all that can by any means be ſqueezed out
of their words, that ſay, the covenant of Grace was made of
God, with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural ſeed, or with beleevers and
their ſeed. It is even irkſome to read the large buſineſſe that is
made, to find out our meaning about the covenant of God made
with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; and we muſt <hi>per force</hi> confeſſe that
we mean it of a covenant, infallibly, abſolutely, to conferre
grace, and conſequently ſalvation. To be ſo in Covenant, as that
a man cannot fall from it. To this end, words of mine are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
that I never uttered, and ſeveral arguments produced, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this ſuppoſed tenent and authorities multiplied out of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Writers, <hi>Beza, Twiſſe, Wallaeus, The Annotations on the

included in Gods entrance of covenant with a people,
engaging to be their God, and taking them for his people; is
here by this grand Charter of Heaven made over to <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his natural iſſue by <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> All their poſterity are
branches of this root by nature ſimply conſidered, and they are
holy branches by vertue of this covenant, which neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
priviledge of Ordinances, the fruition of Gods Oracles,
which are his covenant-draughts; without which no people are
in Covenant, but all are ſtrangers: And this priviledge of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances

                  <head type="sub">Arguments concluding the natural iſſue of Abraham, Iſaac,
and Jacob to be taken into Covenant.</head>
                  <p>MY firſt Argument is taken from the addition annext to
this covenant in the words immediately following.<note place="margin">The natural iſſue of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> poſſeſt the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>
                     </note> The
Lord having made a covenant in full words with <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his ſeed, he addes, <hi>and I will give unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee,
the land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the land of</hi> Canaan <hi>for an
everlaſting poſſeſſion, and I will be their God.</hi> That ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
that had poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> through the gift, and
by vertue of the promiſe of God, is the ſeed here taken into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
to have the Lord for their God. This is ſo plaine, that
nothing can be plainer to any that read the words. But the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> all the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> in their ſeveral Tribes,
(according as God ſet them their bounds) inherited the land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> which is called the land of their inheritance, and not
onely the ſpiritual ſeed Regenerate. Look into the Hiſtory of
of Scripture, who thoſe were that inherited <hi>Canaan,</hi> and you
may ſee who were in this covenant; The natural ſeed were
there, and not only the ſpiritual, Even thoſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
poſterity <hi>that died, not having obtained the promiſes,</hi> Heb. 11. 13.
that only ſo journed in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and were never poſſeſt of it, had
title to it. It was theirs in reverſion, though they never came
into actual poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>My next Argument is drawn from the Seale that is annext in
the words immediately following this additional promiſe,<note place="margin">Had the ſeal of Circumciſion.</note> 
                     <hi>ver. 9,
10, 11. And God ſaid unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>thou ſhalt keep my covenant ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

                        </gap>d thy ſeed after thee in their generations. This is my
Covenant which you ſhall keep between me and you, and thy ſeed after
thee; every man-childe among you ſhall be circumciſed. And ye ſhall
circumciſe the fleſh of your fore-skin, and it ſhall be a token of the
Covenant betwixt me and you.</hi> They that had the ſigne and ſeale
of the covenant, that had it by divine appointment, were
a people in Covenant. This is ſo plaine, that nothing can be
more plaine; God doth not enter covenant with one, and give
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55700:169"/>
the ſigne and ſeal to another: but all the natural ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
by <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> had the ſeal, <hi>viz.</hi> all the males, all thoſe
that were in a capacity of it, it was not limitted to the ſpiritual
ſeed. There had been no place for that diſtinction of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
in the fleſh, and Circumciſion of the heart; if none muſt
be circumciſed in fleſh, but thoſe that are circumciſed in
heart.</p>
                  <p>My third Argument is drawn from the Comment that God
himſelf makes of this covenant,<note place="margin">Were owned of God as his people.</note> in the whole <hi>Series</hi> of Scripture-hiſtory,
holding it out every where in this way of tenure, to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
and his natural iſſue, as before; Where God himſelf ſpeaks
to the whole body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were newly come up out
of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>I am the Lord your God,</hi> Exod.
20 2. Deut. 5. 6. God owned all of that whole people as his, all
of them being <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural iſſue, yet all of them were not
ſpiritual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and while they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> God ſpeaks of them all
in community as his; <hi>Let my people go, that they may hold a feaſt
unto me in the wilderneſſe,</hi> Exod. 5. 1. We ſee the titles that he
gives them, <hi>Children of the Lord your God, an holy People, a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
People above all Nations,</hi> Deut. 14. 1, 2. That ſpeech of the
Lord to <hi>Iſrael, Amos</hi> 3. 1, 2. is very full to our purpoſe: <hi>Heare
ye the Word of the Lord that he hath ſpoken againſt you, O children
of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>againſt the whole family which I brought up from the
land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>ſaying, You only have I known of all the families
of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that deſcended from <hi>Jacob,</hi> the whole of the family that
came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were a ſelect people to God in covenant; He
was according to the termes of that Covenant, <hi>their God.</hi> There
is not a place, where God calls them by the name of his people
(which are almoſt endleſſe;) but there we have this confirmed,
that that people were the Lords by vertue of this grant made to
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place,<note place="margin">Pleaded their intereſt in the Covenant for obtaining of mercy.</note> I argue from the practice of the people of
God, making this Covenant of God entred with <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his ſeed, a plea to obtaine mercy from God for all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the
worſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in their loweſt ſtate and condition, <hi>Deut. 9 26,
27. O Lord God, deſtroy not thy people and thine in heritance, which
thou haſt redeemed through thy greatneſſe, which thou haſt brought
forth out of</hi> Egypt <hi>with a mighty hand. Remember thy ſervants</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:55700:169"/>
Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>look not unto the ſtubbornneſſe of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
nor to their wickedneſſe, nor to their ſinne.</hi> If this Divinity
had been then known, <hi>Moſes</hi> might have been ſent away with this
anſwer; <hi>That he ſpake for dogges, and not for children; not for</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<hi>but for aliens and ſtrangers to the Common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael.
But as this and the like requeſts of the people of God were made
in faith, ſo they prevailed with God; <hi>Moſes</hi> there urges, <hi>They
are thy people, and thine inheritance,</hi> verſe 29. as doth the Church,
Iſa. 64. 9. <hi>Be not wroth very ſore, O Lord, neither remember ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity

<hi>Moſes</hi> petition takes as the Hiſtory ſhews, <hi>Exod. 32. 14. And

yea, when God vouchſafes mercy to his people thus in covenant,

                  <p>I ſhall ſay no more,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but leave it to the Reader, whether this
be any anſwer, only for his cenſure of <hi>Chamiers</hi> calling the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> an appendant to this covenant;
the thing is ſo clear in the narrative of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. that nothing
can be more evident. The Covenant is full, <hi>verſ. 7. To be a God
to</hi> Abraham <hi>and to his ſeed,</hi> and this he might have been had he
pleaſed, in the land of <hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Caldees,</hi> or in any land what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
where <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed had been planted: But when the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is thus made, there is added; <hi>And I will give unto thee, and to

thy ſeed after thee the land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the
land of</hi> Canaan <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſſion.</hi> As for that of the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi>
where he thinks the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks otherwiſe; the force of
this Argument muſt needs be this. That which is any where
called a Covenant, that is not an appendant to a covenant; but
the giving of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is there
called by the name of a Covenant. He will not, I think, ſay,
that Circumciſion is the Covenant between God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he will not deny, but it is a ſigne and ſeale annext to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
and yet, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. it is called a Covenant, <hi>This is
my Covenant which ſhe ſhall keep between me and you, and thy ſeed

of the adjunct are well enough known, and the common

of his trouble, that ſuch a people ſhould be caſt off; he reckons
up their priviledges, the priviledges of all that according to the
fleſh were Iſraelites; Priviledges formerly enjoyed, but now loſt,
nine in number: <hi>Who are Iſraelites, to whom appertaines the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the
Law, and the ſervice of God, and the Promiſes? Whoſe are the

the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the caſting off of Gods people.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55700:170"/>
Thoſe that are caſt off from being a people of God, were once his
people; thoſe that are put out of covenant, were a people in
Covenant; but the natural iſſue of <hi>Abraham</hi> (called <hi>natural
branches,</hi> verſe 21. being by right of birth of that Olive) are there
broken off, caſt off; therefore the natural iſſue was the ſeed in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 11, 12. Upon occaſion of the Faith of the
<hi>Centurion,</hi> which Chriſt ſo magnifies, and preferres before the
faith of any in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> he prophecies of the call of the Gentiles,
and the rejection of the Jewes, <hi>I ſay unto you, that many ſhall
come from the Eaſt, and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi>
Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdome of heaven: But the children of
the Kingdome ſhall be caſt out into utter darkneſſe, there ſhall be
weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Nations from all quarters of the
world, every point of the Heavens ſhall embrace the Faith, and
be received viſible members of the Kingdom of God; when the
children of the Kingdome that are now in it, and enjoy it, ſhall
be caſt out of it; children of the Kingdome that are to be caſt
out, are in the Kingdome only upon an intereſt of birth, for the
fruition of the priviledges of Ordinances, and not upon any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
title, infallibly giving intereſt in Salvation: But the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Kingdome were upon our Saviours ſentence to be caſt

Birth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 15</note> 
                     <hi>Gal</hi> 2. 15. In that chapter among other things we have
a narrative from the Apoſtle, of his dealing by way of reproof with
<hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Antioch.</hi> In which we may obſerve.</p>
                  <p>(1.) <hi>The occaſion given by</hi> Peter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. Before that certain
came from <hi>James,</hi> he did eat with the Gentiles; but when they were
come, he withdrew and ſeparated himſelf.</p>
                  <p>(2.) <hi>The iſſue which followed upon this carriage of his,</hi> And
the other Jewes diſſembled likewiſe with him, inſomuch
that <hi>Barnabas</hi> alſo was carried away with their diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Arguments brought for conviction of <hi>Peter</hi> of this error,
which are two. The firſt in the 14. verſ. <hi>If thou being a
Jew liveſt after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jewes,
why compelleſt thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jewes?</hi> Thus the
Argument runnes; It is unreaſonable to draw others into a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55700:171"/>
practice that thou thy ſelf purpoſely forbeareſt; But thou thy
ſelf keepeſt not the Jewiſh Rites and Ordinances, and therefore
it is an unreaſonable and blame-worthy practice, by thy example
to compel others to their obſervation; yea, thou being a Jew,
takeſt thy ſelf to have freedome unreaſonably, then doſt thou
draw on others, who were never under any ſuch obligation.
The ſecond Argument is in the 15. and 16. <hi>verſes, We who are
Jewes by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles; knowing that a man
is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt,
even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by
the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law; for by the works of
the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified,</hi> which is thus enforced. In that way
wherein we who are Jews, with all our birth-priviledges cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to righteouſneſs, we may not teach the Gentiles to attain to it.
But we who are Jews by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles,
cannot this way attaine to righteouſneſſe. We know that a man is
juſtified by faith; we are compelled to quit the Law, and to cleave
to Faith without works, for juſtification. Theſe words which
come up to our preſent purpoſe, containe. (1.) The priviledge
of <hi>Peter, Paul, Barnabas</hi> with the reſt of the Jewes. (2.) The
character of the Gentiles in oppoſition to the Jewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As to the
full purpoſe for which theſe words are brought by the Apoſtle,
they have for the ſenſe of them their dependance on the words
that follow; but ſo farre as they containe the priviledge of
the Jewes, in oppoſition to, and above the Gentiles, (to which we
are to ſpeak) ſo farre they are full of themſelves; ſhewing, Firſt,
Poſitively, what himſelf and <hi>Peter</hi> were, <hi>Jewes by nature.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Negatively, what they were not, <hi>ſinners of the Gentiles.</hi> Where
[nature] is taken, not in the proper, but vulgar acceptation, for
birth or deſcent from Anceſtours, as uſually in our common phraſe
of ſpeech we ſay, men are naturally <hi>Dutch, French, Spaniſh, Iriſh,</hi>
when they are ſuch borne and bred; This Scripture therefore <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero</hi>
cites for one, in which the Apoſtle ſpeaks after the vulgar
manner. We have a Scripture parallel with this. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24.
wher <hi>[nature]</hi> and <hi>[natural]</hi> is only by birth and off ſpring, <hi>Peter,
Paul, Barnabas</hi> were all naturally Jewes, borne of Jewiſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and bred up in the way and Religion of the Jewes; ſuch
onely Chriſt choſe for Apoſtles, being himſelf a Miniſter of the
Circumciſion. <hi>Peter</hi> therefore being one of the twelve muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55700:171"/>
be ſuch, <hi>Paul</hi> was ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we know from his own mouth,
<hi>a Jew, and of the Tribe of</hi> Benjamine <hi>Barnabas</hi> was ſuch, <hi>of the
Tribe of</hi> Levi. And being ſuch they enjoyed a priviledge which
the Gentiles wanted, they were by birth and off-ſpring of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is holy. No Nation was ſo great as they, who had God
ſo nigh unto them, who had ſtatutes and judgements ſo righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
The Jew had every way prerogatives and advantages, but
chiefly the Oracles of God. God had not dealt ſo with every
Nation; when other Nations were without God, they had God
nigh unto them; when others were uncleane, they were holy.
This great priviledge of Birth, Gentiles wanted, and ſo were by
off-ſpring ſinners; as Birth renders all, ſo they remaine unholy
and uncleane, among the unholy and unclean without any ſuch
title to the Covenant of God, that thereby they might obtaine
any other denomination; they are dogs, while the people in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
are children. And by this means the ſeeming oppoſition
which is between this text and that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3.
is eaſily reconciled. Here the Apoſtle makes an oppoſition na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
between Jews and Gentiles; Jewes by nature had privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
above Gentiles. There he makes Jewes and Gentiles in
nature equal? <hi>We</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were by nature children of wrath
as well as others,</hi> as well as Heathens, that have no Birrh privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>[Nature]</hi> in that Text is not the ſame as nature in this <hi>[Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture]</hi>
there is taken for the qualification of nature, which is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defiled in Jewes and Gentiles, which is there evidenced in the
converſation of the Jewes, being (before convertion by grace)
the very ſame with the Gentiles. <hi>Among whom alſo we all had
our converſation in times paſt in the luſts of our fleſh, fulfilling
the deſires of the fleſh and of the minde, and were by nature
children of wrath, even as others. [Nature]</hi> here is taken for a
Birth-priviledge, and ſo the Jews (though in themſelves ſinners) are
reputed an holy people a people by covenant holy to the Lord.
<hi>Nature</hi> ſimpl conſidered, is ſtained, and renders Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
equally ſinners and obnoxious to Gods wrath; of which,
Juſtification by faith is an acknowledgement, as the Apoſtle here
ſhews, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. But birth of Jewiſh Anceſtors, of the ſtock of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> puts them into a ſelect condition, into the number of a
people holy to the Lord. Neither is this any contradiction;
common things dedicated for holy ſervice and uſe, are holy: A
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:55700:172"/>
people by nature ſinners dedicated to the Lord, are for holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and uſe, for the ſervice of the Lord, when others are for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of idols. Therefore <hi>jeruſalem</hi> a City, none of the holieſt for
any tranſcendent manners of the inhabitants thereof, is yet called
by the Evangeliſt, <hi>the holy City,</hi> by reaſon of the Temple and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
there, that were holy.</p>
                  <p>That which is a priviledge of nature or birth, belongs to the
natural iſſue, that cannot be denied: But to be incovenant with
God as a people holy and exceeding others that are without as
ſinners, is a priviledge of nature or birth; therefore this priviledge
belongs to the natural iſſue. This Argument, as it is cleare of it
ſelfe, ſo it hath this advantage, that for interpretation of the
word <hi>[Nature]</hi> it hath approbation from profeſt adverſaries;
one ſaith, <hi>I grant his ſenſe of the word</hi> Nature, <hi>and that the
Apoſtle there ſpeaks of himſelf and other Jewes, as in reputation
more holy then the Gentiles, becauſe of their intereſt in Circumciſion,
and obſervance of</hi> Moſes <hi>Law;</hi> And this grant involves him not
in a few contradictions. 1. That this was a Birth-priviledge as he
here acknowledges, being the Jews priviledge by birth of nature,
and therefore belonged to the natural ſeed; when<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> elſewhere he
ſaith, they inherit onely domeſtick and civil benefits. 2. This inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
in Circumciſion, and obſervance of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, was a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Ordinances, and he is wont to deny, that birth entitles
any to ſuch priviledges. 3. This is ſpiritual mercy which the Jews
here had in Circumciſion, and <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. Circumciſion by
his confeſſion ſeales Goſpei-mercies, the ſame that Baptiſm ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
And <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Law wrote of Chriſt <hi>John 1 45. John</hi> 5. 46.
and yet he denies the natural ſeed any Promiſe of ſpiritual mercies.
Any one of theſe arguments ſeverally, much more all joyntly make
good this Poſition, that all the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Iſaac</hi>
and <hi>Jacob</hi> are in that great Charter (vouchſafed of God) taken into
covenant, ſo as to be the people of God, and to enjoy all priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of his people, in order (upon Gods termes) to everlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. and the very phraſe of

of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed, <hi>verſe 8. Sarah</hi> ſhall have

failed in making good his word) was that promiſe to <hi>Abraham;</hi> I will
be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed; whereto I may adde that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerers
of <hi>Arminius,</hi> and the cited Remonſtrants, to wit, <hi>Baine,</hi> and
<hi>Ames,</hi> do ſay it was the word of promiſe, not of the Law as <hi>Arminius</hi>
conceived; for the word of promiſe ſaith <hi>Ames, Animadv in Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtran.
Script. Synod. de praedeſt. Cap. 8. Sect.</hi> 4. is diſtinguiſhed
and oppoſed to the words of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17, 18. Now the word
of the promiſe there is to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. and this is
there called by him <hi>verbum foederis,</hi> the word of the Covenant; now
let us conſider how the Apoſtle anſwers it. He denies that Gods Word
made to <hi>Abraham</hi> did fall, though the Jews were rejected; becauſe
that promiſe, I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed; as it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
ſaving grace, was never meant by God of all <hi>Abraham</hi> poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or of any barely as they were deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi> by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
generation; but of the Elect, whether deſcended by natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55700:173"/>
from <hi>Abraham</hi> or not. And this is apparent, both from the
words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. Neither becauſe they are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are
they all children, but in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall thy ſeed be called, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. It is
expounded thus; that is, they which are the children of the fleſh, theſe
are not the children of God, but the children of the promiſe are counted
for the ſeed. Whence it is apparent, that the ſame are not always the
ſeed by calling, which are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by natural generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that the children of the fleſh are not the ſame with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the promiſe, and that the Apoſtle conceived this the right may of
anſwering thoſe that objected the falling of Gods word; upon the rejection
of the Jews, by reſtraining the promiſe of being God to <hi>Abrahams</hi>
ſeed, only to the Elect, whether of <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural poſterity or not;
with ſo little reſpect to any birth-right-priviledge, that he not onely
rejected <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and took <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but alſo loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hated
<hi>Eſau;</hi> by prophecie declaring his minde, The elder ſhall ſerve the
younger, and in this, the Apoſtle acquits God from unrighteouſneſſe,
in that he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
will he hardens; notwithſtanding his promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> or any Birth-priviledge they could claime. <hi>Yeelding that
this Text in that place is brought into queſtion by the Apoſtle:
Before I come to the Apoſtles words themſelves, I have divers
Queres to put.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. How <hi>Baine</hi> and <hi>Ames</hi> come to the name of <hi>Remonſtrants?</hi> I

                  <p>2. <hi>Where it appears that</hi> Arminius <hi>conceived that the
covenant there ſpoken to, was the word of the Law, and not of
Promiſe; I am ſure in his Analyſis on this Chapter to the</hi> Romans
<hi>he ſpeaks in another manner, even in our authours own</hi> Dialect, <hi>as

judge whether he can interpret this of the Law and not of the
promiſe.</p>
                  <p>3. When he affirmes that to be borne after the fleſh is all one
with the Apoſtle, with legal juſticiaries, as he doth (which is <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>
his Interpretation) how then can he by that diſtinction of
children of the fleſh, and children of the promiſe, ſhut out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

juſticiaries one and the ſame?</p>
                  <p>4. If the Apoſtle exclude all the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi>
from this Covenant of God (as <hi>Stapleton</hi> argues, and from him
the Anabaptiſts) and takes in only his ſpiritual ſeed, how
can he be reconciled to himſelf? in the words immediately before
this objection, he ſpeaks of the Jewes (as his kinſmen according
to the fleſh, which were the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi>) and ſaith,
<hi>To them pertaine the Adoption, the Glory, and the Covenants, &amp;c.</hi>
How then can his diſtinction be interpreted to throw them out
of Covenant, when in expreſſe termes he had affirmed that they
were in covenant? How can he deny that theſe are children,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 7. when he had affirmed that to them pertaineth the Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 4. Which may be confirmed by abundant other Texts
of Scripture; <hi>Ye are the children of the Lord your God,</hi> Deut. 14. 1.
<hi>Out of</hi> Egypt <hi>have I called my Sonne,</hi> Hoſea. 11. 1. <hi>It is not meet
to take the childrens bread, and caſt it unto Dogges,</hi> Matth. 15. 26.
where all that were not Gentiles, all to whom Chriſt was ſent,
are called children; <hi>Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the
Covenant which God made with your Fathers,</hi> Acts 3. 20. Doth
the Covenant appertaine to them, and they ſtiled the children of
the Covenant, and yet are they out of Covenant? Are they
children to whom the Adoption pertaines, and yet no children?
When they have given any faire anſwer to theſe Quere's, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the two laſt: we ſhall conceive ſome probability of
truth in their Gloſſe on the Apoſtles words; in the meane time
we cannot but look upon it in full oppoſition and contradiction
to that which the Apoſtle expreſſely delivers. For the Text of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55700:174"/>
the Apoſtle, it will be beſides my purpoſe to make any full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon it; it will be ſufficient to take it out of their hands,
and vindicate it from that which they would aſſert from it,
and to let the Reader know the Apoſtles ſcope in that place,
which is not to make a full Comment on thoſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7.
but only to free it from an objection which the unbeleeving Jews
might raiſe from it. God hath made a Covenant with them, <hi>to
be their God, and the God of their ſeed.</hi> If he now caſt them off as the
Apoſtle doth affirme, the Covenant then is broke, <hi>and the word
of God is of none effect.</hi> The Apoſtle denies that this follows, and
ſhews that the terme <hi>[Iſrael,]</hi> or <hi>[children of</hi> Abraham.] admits
of diſtinction, and produces a Scripture, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. where one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
is implied, <hi>viz. Gen. 21. 12. In</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
and ſo a numerous company by <hi>Iſhmael</hi> is excluded (who
were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed after the fleſh) and only the ſons of promiſe
by <hi>Iſaac</hi> are accounted the ſeed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. that come from <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
borne by miracle. And <hi>verſe</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. ſeconds it with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
concerning the children of <hi>Iſaac, Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> As then
there was a diſtinction of ſeed; ſo alſo now, one member he had
laid down before, <hi>viz. Iſraelites according to the fleſh</hi> veſted in
all thoſe priviledges there reckoned up, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. Theſe they
pleaded, and the Apoſtle yeelds them; And theſe men (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the diſcovery of theſe times) deny them. The ſecond
member he after falls upon, <hi>the eternally beloved and choſen of
God,</hi> and largely amplifies. In theſe <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed may continue,
though the other be caſt off; to whom yet God hath continued
(in ſucceſſive generations) a God in covenant, and continued
to them the priviledges of being his people, though now he was
upon the rejection of them: And that it may appear that I go

                     <hi>From whence</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Apoſtles
concluſion (in which he denies that Gods word concerning the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:55700:175"/>
with</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed, and the bleſſing and ſalvation by
the promiſed</hi> Meſſiah, Gal. 3. 17. <hi>did fall, or become void) is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
though the greateſt part of the Jews be ſhut out from Chriſt, and
accurſed. And this he proves by diſtinguiſhing Iſraelites and the
ſeed of</hi> Abraham; <hi>and thereby ſhews that the promiſe of God, reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the efficacy of it, is indefinite, and therefore particular, not
univerſal, and ſo an univerſal promiſe cannot rightly from thence
be concluded: for though the Iſraelites for a great part periſh, yet
that the promiſe of God is not thereby made void appeares, in that it
hath its efficacy in the Elect; for as he ſaith,</hi> verſe 6. <hi>All which are
of</hi> Iſrael (<hi>borne according to the fleſh) are not true Iſraelites, to
whom not only the tender of the Covenant of Grace, with condition of
duty to be performed; but the heavenly poſſeſſion and inheritance only
belongs, as in</hi> ver. 7. <hi>and</hi> Rom 2. 28, 29. <hi>is more fully ſhewn; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe they are the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they therefore all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or heirs of that bleſſing, and partakers of the ſame grace and
glory, as</hi> Rom. 4. 12. Gal. 4. 28. <hi>For though theſe things ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to themſelves, and to that alſo which was delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
where the Apoſtle affirmes that the unbeleeving Jews are</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahamites,
<hi>and Iſraelites; not only by reaſon of their birth after the
fleſh, but alſo by reaſon of acceptance of the Covenants, and promiſes,
yet there is no contradiction; For though the Fathers, and Adoption,
and Covenants, and Promiſes belong to all the Iſraelites, yet all
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55700:175"/>
are not therefore true children, and heirs of ſalvation. For theſe
things which are objected,</hi> viz. <hi>The Jewes great priviledges, are
attributed by the Apoſtle to the unbeleeving Jewes, by vertue of their
outward call, becauſe ſalvation is revealed and offered to them under
condition of obedience, and that offer ſealed with Circumciſion, from
whence all Iſraelites are promiſcuouſly called children of the covenant,
as</hi> Acts 3. 25.) <hi>and not by reaſon of their inward call according to the
purpoſe of Election effectual, becauſe ſalvation is not only outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under condition of a lively faith revealed and offered in the word,
and ſealed in the Sacrament; but alſo inwardly and efficaciouſly, (the
condition, that is, faith being given them) is conferred by the Holy
Ghoſt. For this belongs not indifferently to all, but only to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Sonnes and true elect Iſraelites.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Gomarus,</hi> in
which we have theſe three things. 1. This objection wholly

ſhould run in ſo narrow a limit now, being vouchſafed in ſo great
a latitude then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being once made of God as with men of yeares,
ſo with little ones, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. Why ſhould little ones be now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and onely men of growth admitted? when it is granted
on all hands that God continues a people to himſelf, how comes
it to paſſe that he admits them on ſuch new termes? That his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
are now thus ſhortened, that as a leaſe for terme of life,
differs from a fee-ſimple for inheritance, ſo the Covenant in New
Teſtament-times differs from the Covenant vouchſafed of God
to our fathers? Where the abſurdity lies that Baptiſme ſhould
be adminiſtred to thoſe that do not actually beleeve, when yet
Circumciſion was adminiſtred to infants in as great an inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we might demand how they can avoid that great ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
that muſt needs by this meanes be given to the beleeving
Jewes, (who waved the old way of the adminiſtration of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and embraced the new) to have their infants upon this new
admiſſion ſtruck out of Covenant, A man that ſhould be ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
on an inheritance for ever, will hardly be brought to quit that
tenure and accept with limit for terme of life, <hi>God was their God,
and the God of their ſeed,</hi> Gen. 17. 7. <hi>They did bring forth children to
God,</hi> Ezek. 16. 20. Now they bring forth children without
God. They have a ſeed, but no holy ſeed; a world repleniſhed,
but not a Church or people to God continued; The ſavage Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in a married condition have this priviledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that their iſſue are
not baſtards, and this is all that can be claimed by Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:55700:177"/>
Fourthly, we might demand if ſo great a change were made and
held in the Apoſtolique Primitive times, how it comes to paſſe
that there was ſuch ſilence, no man moving a queſtion about it?
The pomp of worſhip and obſervation of places formerly in uſe,
was laid aſide in Goſpel-times, but this we hear of, and the reaſon
of it, <hi>John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 4. 22. The initiating Sacrament of Circumciſion had a
period put to it, of this we hear, and many complaints about it?
Pſalteries, Harps, Organs, Cymbals, and ſuch inſtruments of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
in uſe in the time of the Law, were laid aſide in Goſpel-times,
and not known in the weſterne Churches till after <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
his dayes; As this was done, ſo it was not paſt in ſilence, but
ſpoken of, (as elſewhere I have ſhewn, and given reaſons of it) by
<hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> [or at leaſt one that beares his name,] <hi>Chryſoſtome,
Iſidore, Thomas Aquinas.</hi> When none of theſe changes can paſſe,
but obſervation is made, it is more then ſtrange that ſo great a
change as this in the termes of the Covenant, between God and
his people, can be ſo carried on without any obſervation at all, or
one word once moved about it, or ſpoken in it? See Maſter <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
Treatiſe of <hi>Infants Church-memberſhip,</hi> proving that Infants
were ſometimes Church-members, <hi>page</hi> 26, 27. that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
of this grant vouchſafed of God, <hi>p.</hi> 27, 28. Waiting for ſome
faire anſwer to the former demands, I ſhall proceed to thoſe
texts of Scripture, where the Covenant in New Teſtament-times
is held out in this latitude to beleevers and their ſeed, comprizing
their parents in the ſame priviledge of Covenant and participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 38, 39 vindicated.</note> let us look into thoſe words of <hi>Peter,</hi> delivered in his firſt
Sermon after the receiving of the holy Ghoſt, (the firſt place in
which the Covenant of promiſe, and Baptiſme the Seale of the
Covenant are mentioned) to the Jewes, with whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
as yet held communion being not actually rejected out
of a viſible Church-ſtate; <hi>Repent, and be baptiſed every one of
you in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſinnes,
and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt. For the promiſe is unto
you and to your children, and to all that are afarre off, even as many
as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi>

                        </gap>nalized.</note> Acts 2. 38, 39. In which words we
may obſerve. 1. An Exhortation, as, to repentance for the
guilt of the blood of Chriſt; (of which they ſtood convinced)
ſo, alſo unto Baptiſme. 2. A Motive ſtirring them up to
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:55700:177"/>
embrace baptiſme in the name of Chriſt, drawn from the benefit
which they ſhall reap, <hi>Ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
3. A farther encouragement to the acceptation of Baptiſm drawn
from their Covenant-priviledge, which is here ſet out in its full
latitude and extent (as <hi>Calvin</hi> rightly upon the words obſerveth)
1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o the Jewes, <hi>For the promiſe is unto you.</hi> 2. To their children,
<hi>and to your children.</hi> 3. To the Gentiles upon call, <hi>and to you that
are afarre off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> Where
an effectual call cannot be meant (which the Apoſtle calls a <hi>call
according to purpoſe</hi>) proper only to the elect, It is a call unto ſuch
a Church-ſtate, as the whole Nation of the Jews did then enjoy, as
the firſt-borne in the family; A call that puts them into a like
Church-ſtate, and condition with the Jews. From whence this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be drawn. Thoſe to whom the Covenant of promiſe
appertaines have a right to Baptiſme; But the covenant of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
appertaines to men in a Church-ſtate and condition, and to
their children. The major cannot be denied by any that will not
make themſelves the Apoſtles oppoſites. The minor propoſition
is now to be conſidered, That the covenant of promiſe to men in a
Church-ſtate and condition is in that latitude as to comprize their
children. For which the words of the Apoſtle are full and clear,
<hi>To you is the promiſe made, and to your children,</hi> on which <hi>Calvin</hi>
rightly comments. <hi>Peter obſerves</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a due order, when he
aſſigns the firſt place of honour to the Jewes, That it takes in children,
it depends on the words of the promiſe,</hi> Gen. 17. 7. <hi>I will be thy God,
and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> Where God joynes children with their
parents in the priviledge of adoption, in the inheritance of
priviledges belonging to all Church-members.</p>
                  <p>But this clear text wants not wits that ſtudy to cloud it; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Objections anſwered. </seg>

ſame as the <hi>ſons and daughters</hi> mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 17. of that chapter,
from <hi>Joel, chap.</hi> 2. 28. and conſequently the promiſe to be meant of
the Spirit of prophecie, and to appertaine to none but thoſe of age
and capacity for prophecie. To this I anſwer, 1. The extraordinary
gifts of the holy Ghoſt in this viſible way cannot be the promiſe
here by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> mentioned, ſeeing it is enlarged <hi>to all that are
afarre off, even to as many as the Lord ſhall call.</hi> But all theſe
have not the holy Ghoſt in that way extraordinary, nor any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of it; Baptiſme with the holy Ghoſt and with fire, is a
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:55700:178"/>
baptiſme proper to thoſe primitive Saints, wherewith they were
told that they ſhould be baptized not many dayes after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the promiſe be interpreted ſo, as to belong to all that are
beleevers, and call on the name of the Lord, as there followes,
yet that promiſe is on condition of their baptiſme; The meanes
are to be uſed in reference to the end, Baptiſme is the meanes,
receiving of the holy Ghoſt (there ſpecified) is the end; And
the Apoſtle confirming them in the promiſe of the end, doth
likewiſe encourage them to the uſe of the meanes, in Baptiſme to
expect the gift of the Spirit, and ſo (according to this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation)
that place is an encouragement to baptiſme. The
promiſe is the fitteſt encouragement to the Signe and Seale of the
promiſe. Baptiſme is the Signe and Seale to which they are here
encouraged, and in that latitude as they had formerly known the
command of Circumciſion. 3. Neither are the children here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
the ſame with ſonnes and daughters ſpoken of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
nor limitted to ſuch ſonnes and daughters as are of growth,
and capable of the gift of propheſie. 1. The Apoſtle urgeth the
promiſe in the way, as in the Scripture it is delivered, which is to
men and their poſterity, to them and theirs. So God promiſes
to be a God in covenant to his and their ſeed, and this the Apoſtle
holds out, to draw them on to the Seale of the covenant to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Baptiſme on the ſame terms that <hi>Abraham</hi> did circumciſion.
2. It is without reaſon to beleeve that the Apoſtle ſhould inſtance
in one peece of the diſtribution of the Prophet there, and to leave
out the reſt; to put in alone ſons and daughters, when we have
in the Text young men, old men, ſervants and handmaids. 3. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
here are mentioned under a promiſe to the parents, <hi>to you
and your children is the promiſe made,</hi> but not ſo in <hi>Joel,</hi> nor in the
quotation of the Apoſtle. That Scripture hath only an enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the ſeveral ſorts and conditions of people in any Nation,
on all which the ſpirit is promiſed, without any reference made
to the parents of thoſe ſonnes and daughters, more then to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of thoſe ſervants and handmaids; not the ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of their fleſh, but the ſonnes and daughters of the Nation. A
Language uſual in our ordinary expreſſions ſpeaking of men of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſort or condition, as your Lawyers, your Merchants, &amp;c. ſo here,
your ſonnes, your daughters, your old men, your young men, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Others ſay, <hi>That the promiſe made, is the ſending of Jeſus Chriſt, and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55700:178"/>
bleſſing by him as is expounded,</hi> Acts 3. 25, 26. Act 13. 32. Ro. 15. 39.
I anſwer; it is true, that Jeſus Chriſt is the moſt eminent mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
and may be called the promiſe <hi>virtualiter,</hi> being the ground
of all promiſes, and therefore ſome interpreters have mentioned
the gift of Chriſt on this occaſion. But it is plaine that Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and this gift are to be diſtinguiſhed; Chriſt is promiſed
in priority to the Jew, before the Gentile; The Jew then is taken
into Covenant before this gift of Chriſt can be of them expected:
It is therefore the Covenant it ſelf (entered with parent and child,
root and branch) that is here meant (as <hi>Calvin</hi> in the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obſerves) from which the giving of Chriſt in the fleſh follows.
And therefore <hi>Diodati</hi> fully pitches upon the true ſenſe of it, <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as you are</hi> Abrahams <hi>children, you are within the Covenant, you
ought to acknowledge Chriſt to be the head and fountaine of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
The Covenant, I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed, is here
meant, which from</hi> Abraham <hi>had been the Jewes priviledge,</hi> Rom. 9.</p>
                  <p>It is farther ſaid, that <hi>the limitation, as many as the Lord
our God ſhall call, ſhewes that the promiſe belongs to them, not
ſimply as Jewes, but as called of God; which is more expreſſely affirmed,</hi>
Acts 3. 26. <hi>To you firſt God having raiſed up his Sonne Jeſus, ſent
him to bleſſe you in turning away every one of you from his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
I wonder how it came into any mans head to call this
amplification, a limitation, it plainly enough ſpeaks their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in dealing with the Scriptures; Had the Apoſtle ſaid, To
you is the promiſe made, and to your ſeed, in caſe God ſhall give
you a call, he had ſpoke to their purpoſe; but ſaying, <hi>To you,
and to as many as the Lord your God ſhall call;</hi> it plainly ſhewes
that he does not limit, but amplifie the mercy, extending it
not barely to the Jewes (who in preſent by reaſon of fruition
of Ordinances were a people near to the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 14.) but
alſo to the Gentiles, who <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 17. we affare off. 2. In that
he ſaith, this promiſe belongs to them not ſimply as Jewes, but as
called, is a full contradiction: A Jew uncalled (at this time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Kingdome was taken from them) is as much as a Convert
unconverted, or a Gentile diſciple undiſcipled: In caſe they think
to come off by limitting it to an effectual call, the Scriptures by
themſelves quoted, doth evidently contradict it, Chriſt came to
give them, that effectual calling, and not onely to thoſe that were
thus called. It is yet ſaid, <hi>Peter doth exhort to repentance, and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55700:179"/>
Baptiſme together, and in the firſt place perſwades to repentance, then
to Baptiſme, which ſhews repentance to be in order before baptiſme.</hi>
To which I anſwer, that theſe who had crucified Chriſt as a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,
a ſeditious perſon, an impoſtour muſt needs repent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would accept Baptiſme in his name, or hope for remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſinne by him, I had been loſt labour for the Apoſtle, to have
preſſed thoſe, that had crucified Chriſt, and retained their former
opinion of him, to become diſciples to him, and to look to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by him, To perſwade them to look for remiſſion of ſinnes in
his blood, who took themſelves to be without ſinne in ſhedding
of it; Yet notwithſtanding this guilt (of which the Apoſtle would
have them to repent) he ſhews that they and their ſeed are under
the promiſe of God, and puts them into a way, in acceptation of
Chriſt in the Goſpel-tender, in his preſent way of adminiſtration,
to be continued his people ſtill in covenant, and that (as is plainly
enough ſignified) that they might enjoy it in their former latitude,
to them and to their children. The promiſe (of which they were
not yet diſpoſſeſt, but ſtood as a people of God in viſible Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and their children) is here brought as a motive to encourage
them to hold correſpondency with God (as his covenant-people)
embracing the way which their long expected, and deſired Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah
had now inſtituted &amp; appointed. But this promiſe was to them
and their children. Here is yet another evaſion, <hi>The text ſpeaks
not expreſſely of Infants, but of children indefinitely;</hi> And if infants
be not children, we will be content that they be caſt out of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and will hold no more plea for their Church-memberſhip nor
Baptiſme. God in the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> did not
expreſſely mention infants, but ſeed, yet infants were his ſeed, and,
as his ſeed, by Gods command to be circumciſed, And all our
infants are our children, and conſequently to be baptized, <hi>Acts</hi>
20. 7. is an expreſſe Text with ſome of this party (without any
help of conſequence) to prove that women received the Lords
Supper, <hi>Becauſe it is ſaid that diſciples came together to break
bread,</hi> as though woman, and diſciple, were <hi>ſynonyma?</hi> But here
the promiſe being made to children, infants muſt neither be
comprized in the letter, nor yet by any favour of conſequence
included.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is further objected, that the text ſpeaks not of the
children of the Gentiles at all (of whom we are) but of the children
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:55700:179"/>
of the Jews, and therefore if that promiſe be extended to infants, which
doth not appear, the promiſe is to be expounded ſo, as to note ſomething
peculiar to the Jews infants.</hi> If the Goſpel held out any ſuch tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
priviledges appertaining to the ſeed of the Jews above the
Gentiles, they may do well to produce a Text for it, otherwiſe
we ſhall take it for granted from Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that there is none at
all, that in Chriſt there is <hi>neither Greek nor Jew, Circumciſion nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion,
Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free.</hi> And when
the Apoſtle addes, <hi>To thoſe that are afarre off, even as many as the
Lord ſhall call,</hi> he plainly meanes the Gentiles, as appears, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 13. and though I take not the boldneſſe to adde
to the words, as ſome ſtand charged, yet it is cleare, that he
ſame is underſtood there in reference to the children of the
Gentiles, that is expreſt before to the children of the Jewes. If
any ſhall grant an inheritance to <hi>Titius</hi> and his heires for ever,
and to <hi>Caius,</hi> every one will underſtand that the heires of <hi>Caius</hi>
are meant as well as the heirs of <hi>Titius,</hi> eſpecially if it can be
proved out of the Grant it ſelf, that the priviledges conveyed to
<hi>Caius,</hi> are as ample, as that to <hi>Titius.</hi> We can prove the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
granted to the Gentiles in the Goſpel to be equal to thoſe
granted to the Jews; when the Jews children then are under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
with their parents, the children of beleeving Gentiles cannot
be excluded.</p>

commented upon. In both we ſee, 1. A ſuppoſition 2. An af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.
The ſuppoſition is, of the holineſſe of the firſt fruits,
the holineſſe of the root. The affirmation is, the whole lump is
holy, the branches are holy. This laſt is grounded on a principle
in nature univerſally true. <hi>As is the root, ſo is the branch,</hi> they are
both of one and the ſame nature; As is the one, ſo is the other.
Which he applies to the ſtate of the Church of God; firſt to the
Church of the Jewes, and that 1. In their ancient eſtate, when
they were a people of God, in Covenant-relation, holy, ſo ſtiled of
him frequently in Scripture. 2. In their preſent ſtate, for a great
part broken off, and ſo made no people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. In their future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
when they ſhould be called of God, and as it were riſen
from the dead. Secondly, he applies it alſo to the Gentiles. 1. In

ground ſeveral undeniable Poſitions, ſome concerning the ſubject,
[root and branch] ſome concerning the predicate [holy].<note place="margin">Poſitions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. 1. Of the root and branch.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, concerning the ſubject root and branch, in this place (as by
way of Metaphor) ſet out the eſtate of parent and childe, anceſtor
and iſſue. 2. The whole body of the Church is compared to a
tree, to an Olive tree. 3. The root of this tree (<hi>viz.</hi> the firſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
univerſal root) is <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> Not <hi>Abraham</hi>
alone, ſo Iſhmaelites would be of the body. Nor <hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi>
alone, ſo the Edomites from <hi>Eſau</hi> would have been taken in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But the Apoſtle in this chapter (from Old Teſtament-authority)
excludes both of them, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> are therefore
joyntly the root. 4. The branches of this tree are of two ſorts.

                        </gap>ome <hi>natural,</hi> iſſuing from the root by deſcent; others <hi>ingraffed</hi>
put in by way of inſition. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ewes were <hi>natural branches,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
from the loynes of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> The
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:55700:181"/>
Gentiles are branches by <hi>inſition</hi> put into the ſtock, the natural
branches being broken off. 5. The fatneſſe of this tree is the
glory of Ordinances, of which the whole Church partakes, or as
ſome ſay, Chriſt is the fatneſſe, but that is onely as he is tendered
in Ordinances, for he walks in the middeſt of the Golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks.
In which ſenſe onely we may yeeld that Chriſt is that
fatneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Of the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe here mentioned.</note> concerning the predicate, <hi>Holy.</hi> There is one and
the ſame holineſſe goes through the whole tree, all the branches
natural and engraffed through the whole Church, and all the
children of it Jews and Gentiles; The whole of this holineſſe is
from one Original root, and therefore one and the ſame. 2. This
holineſſe is ſuch as is communicable from parent to childe, and
neceſſarily communicated, as a root communicates ſap to the
branches. This is ſo plaine, that if it be denied, all the Apoſtles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
falls. 3. It is no holineſſe of inheſion, but relation, not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litative,
but federal. The holineſſe of the Jewes who were a holy
Nation was ſuch; The holineſſe of the Gentiles can be no other.
Holineſſe of inheſion is not communicable, but only holineſſe of
relation. In holineſſe of inheſion the propoſition holds not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as,
is the father, ſo, is the child, who knowes not that holy fathers
have unholy children? regenerate parents have iſſue unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things conſidered, it is evident, that, as the father is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of Church-ſtate, Covenant-holineſſe, ſo is the childe, both in
the Church of the Jews and Gentiles: The father being without,
the childe is without; the father being within, the childe is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe a branch of ſuch a root, a childe of ſuch a
father, which is a full confirmation of the point in hand, that
the childe is in Covenant with the father, and the perſon that
actually enters Covenant, is not ſolely veſted in it. One ſtands
upon the contrary part, and puts it to this iſſue for trial, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this ingraffing be into the viſible Church by profeſſion of Faith, or
into the inviſible by Election and Faith;</hi> and concludes, <hi>that it is
meant of the Church inviſible;</hi> which if he can make good, I ſhall
confeſſe all Arguments drawn from hence (as to this point) are loſt;
I would (to avoid impertinent cavils, and quarrels) each Text were
brought to ſuch iſſue. I ſhall in the firſt place bring arguments
to evince that the breaking off, and engraffing, is reſpective to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:55700:181"/>
the Church, as viſible, and then proceed to anſwer arguments
from a late hand againſt it.</p>
                     <p>1. That ingraffing which is into <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Arguments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing to be into the Church only as viſible, and the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oft to be fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church as viſible.</note> 
                        <hi>Iſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> as
a root is not an inviſible graffing by ſaving Faith and Election<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This is plaine, we live not by power received from <hi>Abraham,
Abraham</hi> cannot ſay he bears us up, in ſaving graces, and that
without ſap from him, we can do nothing, But the ingraffing is
into <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> as a root. This argument as
is ſaid by one, were of force if <hi>Abraham</hi> were made a root by
communication, and for prevention he is put to it to tell us of
a root communicating nothing, but an exemplary root, or an
exemplary cauſe of beleeving only; what an exemplary non-communicating
root is or meanes, let the Reader Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that ingraffing which cauſed diſputation and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in ſome, emulation in others upon the ſight and report of it,
was not by ſaving faith only into the inviſible body, but open, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and apparant into the viſible body; But this ingraffing of
the Gentiles into the Church of God, cauſed diſputation and
contention in ſome, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 2, 3. emulation in others, <hi>Deut.
32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21. Rom 10. 19. Rom.</hi> 11. 14. this therefore was into the Church
viſible.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That priviledge which is not reſtrained to ſome few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Churches, but is the priviledge of all that are contained in
it, and members of it, is not an inviſible work upon the heart to
a ſaving change, but only an intereſt in viſible priviledges. This
is evident, the inviſible work is not in all, <hi>Matth. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> 14. But this,
here mentioned is the priviledge of the whole body, as is cleare in
the Text, and adverſaries are conſtrained to acknowledge;
Therefore the ingraffing is only into the viſible body. That privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
wherein the Jewes while they were a people of God did
tranſcend the Gentiles when they were no people, is the priviledge
which theſe Gentiles have by their ingraffing, this is plain, <hi>verſe
17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> But it is the priviledge of Ordinances in being viſibly related
thus to God wherein Jews did then exceed Gentiles, as hath been
largely ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that Faith from which the Jews actually fell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the Gentiles ſtood in danger to fall from, is not a ſaving juſtifying
Faith, entituling to inviſible priviledges, but a Faith of profeſſion
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55700:182"/>
onely giving a viſible title. This is plaine, unleſſe we will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Bertius</hi> his <hi>Hymenem deſertur,</hi> and aſſert the Apoſtaſie of
the Saints. But this Faith whereby the Gentiles are ingraffed, is a
Faith from which the Jews fell, and from which they were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to fall, <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, that reconciliation or ingraffing, which is oppoſite to
caſting out of a viſible Church-ſtate, is an ingraffing into the
Church viſible; But this reconciliation or ingraffing is oppoſite to
the caſting out of a Church ſtate: This is plain, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 43. It
is a caſting out of them that bore not fruit, and not a caſting off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
branches.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, If the ſtate of the Jewes continued from the Apoſtles
time to this day, be an excluſion from a viſible Church-ſtate,
ſo that they are no people of God in name, then a viſible Church-ſtate
is that which they loſt and the Gentiles gained; This is
plaine. The ſtate in which they ſtand being rejected, is their
ſtate of rejection; But their condition ſince that time, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
out of a viſible Church ſtate. This needs no proof: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a viſible Church ſtate is that which the Jews loſt, and theſe
gained. I wiſh that theſe arguments to which many more might
be added, may be taken into conſideration, and for a cloſe of all,
ſeeing it is peremptorily aſſerted that it is manifeſtly falſe, <hi>that
the Chriſtian Gentiles were graffed into the ſame viſible Church
with the Jews, for then they ſhould have been Circumciſed contrary
to the determination,</hi> Acts 15. and <hi>that God hath quite taken away
the viſible Church of the Jews,</hi> or to that purpoſe. This Error be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
many others, I wiſh that it may be a little better thought
upon, whether it be the language of the Scriptures. I have learnt,
that as we and they, have one and the ſame God; one and
the ſame Faith; that is, the doctrine of Faith, one and
the ſame Covenant, eat of one and the ſame ſpiritual
meat, and drink of the ſame ſpiritual drink, one and the ſame
expected heaven; ſo, we are one and the ſame Church Let us to that
end further obſerve the manifold <hi>Metaphors</hi> by which the Church,
ours, and theirs, is ſet forth, all of them holding forth this
Oneneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That of a <hi>Tent</hi> which is the habitation of ſojourners,
<hi>Gen. 9. 27. God ſhall enlarge</hi> Japhet, <hi>and he ſhall dwell in the Tents
of</hi> Shem, <hi>and</hi> Canaan <hi>ſhall be his ſervant. Shems</hi> Tents muſt be
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:55700:182"/>
poſſeſt by <hi>Japhet,</hi> and not others built for their habitation,
The Tents of <hi>Shem,</hi> that is, his poſterity by <hi>Abraham</hi> (which <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
that is, the Gentiles by a ſpecial bleſſing did poſſeſſe) is the
Church viſible, as needs no proof; <hi>Shems</hi> Tents, and <hi>Japhets</hi> Tents
are one, and the ſame, <hi>Japhet</hi> comes to <hi>Shems,</hi> not <hi>Shem</hi> to
<hi>Japhets.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, That of a <hi>Sheep-fold,</hi> John 10. 16. <hi>Other ſheep I
have which are not of this fold, them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall
hear my voice, and there ſhall be one fold, and one ſhepherd,</hi> The Sheep
that in preſent were in the fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Jews, and thoſe not yet taken
in, <hi>viz.</hi> Gentiles, all make up one and the ſame fold; which
though ſome may limit to the Church inviſible, becauſe Chriſt
gives notes of thoſe that are indeed his ſheep. but that is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
at all; Chriſt ſpeaks to thoſe that were diſciples
only according to profeſſion, and gives notes, of diſciples indeed;
and it is againſt all reaſon that Chriſt ſhould in diſcourſe point
out the inviſible Church with the demonſtrative <hi>This,</hi> and that to
thoſe that were malignant enough in the Church viſible, namely
the Phariſees, as appears in the cloſe of the former Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
the mention of <hi>thieves creeping into it, hirelings employed in it</hi>
doth contradict it. The viſible Church of the Jews and Gen
tiles, in which Chriſt hath true ſheep for whom he dies, and
others that theeues and hirelings do deceive, makes up one ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By a <hi>natural body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. Mans body moſt aptly
to this purpoſe, that one <hi>new man,</hi> Eph. 2. 15. is the viſibly body
compact of both Jew and Gentile.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, to adde no more, that of a Kingdome, <hi>Mat. 8. 11.
Many ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The ſame King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
that Jews leave, Gentiles enter, <hi>Matth. 21. 41, 43. The
Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth the fruits thereof.</hi> That can be no more then the preſence
of God in Goſpel-Ordinances, which is without fruit among
Jewes (all inviſible Members bring forth fruit) and upon that
accout is given to the Gentiles; Neither is it of force that which is
ſaid againſt it, <hi>Then we muſt be circumciſed.</hi> As though we may
not be in the ſame Kingdom, and yet under a new way of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration,
Law-givers on earth, are ſometimes pleaſed to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55700:183"/>
change their Lawes; and ſo doth the Law-giver of Heaven; or
if he will limit his inſtance to Circumciſion, taking in no other
Lawes, the ſame houſe may have a new doore or porch; let
our oppoſites then know that they are in the ſame viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> and their poſterity after the
fleſh in <hi>Iſrael</hi> were, and I wiſh that they may take heed of making
diviſions in it or ſeparations from it.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This ingraffing is by a power of God, working the

if any were at fault for a full anſwer, he might eaſily finde

away. The Jewes then by reconcilation are brought into that
ſtate, out of which they were once caſt; But they were not caſt
out of the Church inviſible; not out of Election and juſtification,
but out of a viſible Church-ſtate and fellowſhip. Breaking off,
is rightly ſaid to be the ſame as caſting away, and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the ſame, as ingraffing. Their reconciliation, or ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
is, then, into that condition, from which they were broken
out of which they were caſt: Now they were caſt out of the

do ſtand in a viſible Church-fellowſhip; ſuch a faith upon
which all called ones, (among which few are Elect) are admitted.
Such a faith that gave <hi>Simon Magus</hi> title, that <hi>Hymeneus</hi> had, of
which he made ſhipwrack, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. Doctor <hi>Featley</hi> in the
words above mentioned, ſhewing <hi>Bertius</hi> and the Appealer their

Doctrine of Faith, this objector of the habit. The Apoſtle ſpeaks
<hi>de fide quam credimus,</hi> this objector ſpeaks <hi>de fide qua credimus.</hi>
The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the publick profeſſion of a Church, He
of a particular affiance of every Beleever in Chriſt. He addes,
<hi>This conceit I conceived, and ſtill think is ſo farre from the Apoſtles
expreſſions, that there ſeemes to be no ſhew of ſuch a ſenſe in the

no ſhew of reaſon unleſſe it can be affirmed, that there is no
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55700:186"/>
faith, but the Faith of the Elect, and that which is juſtifying;
therefore if it pleaſe the Authour, I ſhall enter the liſts with him
in theſe three <hi>Poſitions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. That Faith is taken in more acceptions then one in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
All Faith doth not entitle to the Church inviſible, and
therefore there is ſcarce ſhew of ſenſe in his reaſon, diſputing from
the <hi>Genus</hi> to the <hi>Species affirmativè,</hi> or from the <hi>Analogum</hi> to
the <hi>Analogatum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. That the Faith here ſpoken to, is (as Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts)
the doctrine of Faith, not the habit; Faith of Profeſſion,
and not a particular affiance; <hi>fides quam,</hi> and not <hi>fides qua cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus,</hi>
and ſo the fallacy is clear; and it will no more follow that
the ingraffing is into the Church inviſible, becauſe it is by faith;
then it will follow that becauſe bruits have ſouls that therefore
they have reaſonable ſouls.</p>
                     <p>3. That there is no ſuch thing in all Scripture as ingraffing into
the Church inuiſible by Faith; All ingraffing is into the body
viſible, and therefore by a faith of profeſſion. (1.) All ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
is into that ſubject, which immediately receives what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed,
as the ſtock receives the ſyens; but it is Chriſt, and not
the Church inviſible that receives the Elect Beleever; <hi>Chriſt
dwells in us by Faith,</hi> ſo we in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17. (2.) All in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing
is into that which gives ſap and juice to the ingraffed, as
the ſtock from the root to the ſyens; Now Chriſt gives ſap to
the Elect beleeving, not the Church, and therefore it is not into
the Church, but into Chriſt. (3.) If ſaving faith ingraffe the
branch into the Church inviſible, then the Church inviſible is
the proper object of ſuch Faith; but the Church is no ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Faith but Chriſt. (4.) That ſuppoſed ingraffing into
the inviſible Church, is either known to the body inviſible, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witting;
if know, then it is no inviſible. They have no light to
diſcerne an inviſible work; if unknown, then there could not
be ſuch a diſpute about the new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ingraffing of Gentiles, nor
complaint of breaking off of the Jewes, all being done by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
tranſlation, and ſo the ſubject of the queſtion is taken
away. To diſpute whether ingraffing into the Church, be into
the Church-viſible, or inviſible; is to diſpute whether the Mount
of Olives be a Mountaine of Earth, or Aire. I ſhall aſſoon finde
a Mountaine of Aire in <hi>Geography,</hi> as this ingraffing into the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55700:186"/>
inviſible Church in Divinity: And here I tie not any up to the
word (which I conceive in reference to any Eccleſiaſtical or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
ſtation, is not elſewhere uſed in Scripture) but to the thing.
All that acceſſe to the Church from Gentile Nations, which is
ſo large fore-propheſied in the Old Teſtament, and Hiſtorically
related in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> was an ingraffing into the
Church viſible, and this ingraffing here mentioned. The viſible
Church did immediately receive theſe new branches, and ſo the
whole body of Jews and Gentiles profeſſedly beleeving, <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
2. 15. became one new man. The viſible Church communicates
ſap and juice (which is the fatneſſe of the Olive) in Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
This is known by the Church viſible, they were ſenſible of, and
full of praiſes, for the new addition to this number.</p>

that <hi>Abraham</hi> can be a root of all the branches in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
reaching down to the Apoſtles times, no intermediate rootes
intervening, no more then <hi>Adam</hi> can be a natural root of
mankinde to this time, without intermediate fathers of
our fleſh, deriving us from him, as <hi>Jacob</hi> with <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi>
was a root from whom <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſprang as branches of an Olive;
ſo <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Tamar, Boaz,</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> were roots likewiſe: <hi>They
built up the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4. 11, 12. The houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
was this Olive-tree, theſe ſeveral Metaphors expreſſing the ſame
thing, the building of the houſe, and bringing out the branches
are one and the ſame. All builders are roots; theſe are builders
therefore roots; <hi>Abraham</hi> may be called the builder laying the
firſt foundation, ſo the root from whence every branch was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived;
yet every particular Beleever that had iſſue, a
builder, a root. Thoſe Iſraelites that had no holineſſe of inheſion,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:55700:187"/>
but only of relation that were members of the Church viſible,
not inviſible, were fathers by way of communication of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
1 <hi>Cor. 10. 1. All our fathers were under the cloud, and all
paſſed through the ſea.</hi> It is as neceſſary to have intermediate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
between us and <hi>Abraham,</hi> as to have intermediate mothers
between us and <hi>Eue. Eve</hi> may as well be the mother of all living,
and no other mother between us and her, as <hi>Abraham</hi> can be
the father of the Faithful, and no intermediate father to derive
from him, and communicate to us. But his proof is very well
worth the hearing, that every beleeving parent is not the root.
<hi>For then all the branches ſhould be natural; the childe of every belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Parent is a natural branch from his father. But here Apoſtle
makes the Gentiles branches, and a wild Olive graffed in beſides
nature, and the Jews only natural branches growing from the root,</hi>
verſe 21, 24. The Apoſtle makes them wilde onely at their firſt
ingraffing, and ſo was all <hi>Terahs</hi> race wilde likewiſe, till that
change of Faith wrought in <hi>Abrahams</hi> call, and the covenant
of God entered with him; We now are natural as they were, and
cannot be called wilde, but in our firſt Original. <hi>Poſitively,</hi> (he
ſayes) <hi>the root is no other then</hi> Abraham, <hi>that</hi> Abraham <hi>onely is a
holy root, or at moſt</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob. If this have any
face of Argument, it runnes thus. <hi>If</hi> Abraham <hi>be the root, and
not every beleeving Parent, then the ingraffing is by Election, and
Faith that juſtifies.</hi> The truth is, the ſequel is undeniable on the
contrary; If <hi>Abraham</hi> be the root, then the ingraffing is not
into the inviſible Church, (which he ſtrangely calls by Election)
but onely into the viſible. This Maſter <hi>Blakwood</hi> ſaw, and faine
would have maintained that Chriſt is the root; for ingraffing
into Chriſt, and not into <hi>Abraham,</hi> makes a member of the
Church inviſible. If the ingraffing be by a ſaving Faith only, to
derive ſaving Graces perſonally inherent, as a fruit of Election
from <hi>Abraham,</hi> then it muſt needs be that we are Elect in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.
Abraham</hi> may ſay, Without me ye can do nothing, and
he that beleeveth in me, out of his belly ſhall flow forth rivers of

and the breaking off be by blinding, then the ingraffing is by
inlightening, and that enlightening is according to Election, and ſo is all
one with giving of Faith.</p>
                     <p>The propoſition being; If the blinding be the effect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
and the breaking off is by blinding, then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing
is by enlightening, and that according to Election, then
the aſſumption can be no other, but that blindneſſe is the effect
of reprobation, and the breaking off is by blinding. No one
of the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants</hi> worthy the name of an adverſary of
Arminians, hath taught this doctrine: It that which their
adverſaries indeed charge upon them, but that which they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
do diſclaime. I have heard that reprobation is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
of ſinne, but never that it was the cauſe; and that ſinne
is a conſequent of it, but never an effect. Reprobation is the Act
of God, and in caſe it be the cauſe of blindneſſe, then God is
the cauſe of blindneſſe; ſo that the <hi>Contra-remonſtrants</hi> have
got a ſweet Advocate to caſt that upon them, that none of their
adverſaries (though they have turned every ſtone to do it) could
never proue by them. And the other member, that caſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55700:188"/>
way is by blinding, is little better. The Apoſtle ſpeaks in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner; Blindneſſe was their guilt, and caſting off was
their juſt ſentence; <hi>Becauſe of unbelief they were broken off,</hi>
verſe 20. upon this account God <hi>God did not ſpare them,</hi> as it
follows in the next <hi>verſe.</hi> The work, and the wages, the
guilt, and the puniſhment are not one: Unbelief and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off, are the work and the wages, the guilt and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Breaking off then, as not blinding. The Apoſtle
layes all at mans doore, makes his blindneſſe the moving cauſe,
according to that of the Prophet; <hi>Thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf,</hi>
and God only the ſevere, but juſt Judge. Our Authour layes
all upon God, Gods reprobation cauſes blindneſſe, and their
breaking off is by blinding; here is no hand but Gods, in their
deſtruction. And now the blaſphemy of the conſequence being
denied, ſo that blindneſſe is no effect of reprobation, breaking
off being not by blinding; what becomes of the rule of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites
here produced? Election and reprobation in the work
of ſalvation and damnation, do not <hi>per omnia quadrare,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
as Election leads to ſalvation without any merit of works,
ſo Reprobation ſhould lead to deſtruction without any merit of
ſinne, which <hi>Contra-remonſtrants</hi> unanimouſly deny, though
we finde it here affirmed. It is further ſaid, that from <hi>verſe</hi>

That it ſeems from this irrevocableneſſe of the gifts and calling of God,
the aſſurance of grace and ſalvation cannot follow. 1. Becauſe, as
<hi>Stapleton</hi> objects, and <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Martyr</hi> confeſſe, the ſpeech of the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:55700:190"/>
Apoſtle is not to be underſtood of the election of each particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but of the common adoption of the whole Nation, and this common
grace of adoption of the whole Nation was mutual, for they fell from
this gift. <hi>To which</hi> Paraeus <hi>ſayes,</hi> Stapleton's corrupt gloſſe, is eaſily
anſwered. 1. <hi>Saith he,</hi> It is not denied, that the Apostle spake this
of the Common, that is, the federal dignity of the Nation of the Jewes,
and that the irrevocableneſſe in God, is to be underſtood; yet it is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(<hi>ſaith he</hi>) that from hence the aſſurance of particular perſons is not
concluded, yea from the leſſe <hi>to the greater</hi> it is firmly concluded. For
if the Apoſtle from common grace do rightly conclude this irrevocable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in God, much more may it be determined from that grace which is
proper. Ravanellus <hi>in</hi> verbum Electio, <hi>underſtands Election in</hi> v. 28.

hath been ſaid; but (ſince I had any underſtanding) never
queſtioned but it was here applied (according to the minde of theſe
Authours) to the National priviledge of the Jews, the full ſcope
of theſe Chapters being to diſpute the rejection of</hi> Iſrael <hi>after the
fleſh, their former dignity, and conſequently their future recovery
unto the ſtate from whence they were fallen, in which the Gentile-Nations

                     <p>
                        <hi>Our Author addes,</hi> What ſhall I ſay more? It is ſo plain from the
whole ſcope, and tenour of the Apoſtles words, that the ingraffing there
ſpoken of is, into the inviſible Church by election and giving faith, that
from the firſt of the chapter, to <hi>verſe</hi> 13. there is ſcarce a verſe but
ſpeaks of rejecting, foreknowing, election, grace, hardening, giving a
Spirit of ſlumber, darkening the eyes, ſtumbling, falling, or ſome equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent
terme to theſe; and the Apoſtle doth plainly ſignifie his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in all that diſcourſe, to be the ſhewing the myſtery of Gods counſel
in electing, reprobating, blinding, conuerting, one while the Jews, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while the Gentiles; ſo that I cannot but admire that Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi>
ſhould interpret the ingraffing of bare admiſſion into viſible Church-memberſhip.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I would willingly learne what ingraffing by Election
is, I take Election to be an immanent act in God, which is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in himſelf, and not on the creature; ſuch expreſſions do not
ſuit with ſo high pretendings to ſcholaſtical learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as every
where may be ſeen in this Authour.</p>
                     <p>2. I would have this Argument made up by taking in the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
which can be no other then this. <hi>But the Jewes in their fall
from Church-fellowſhip cannot be ſaid to be rejected, hardened, given to
a ſpirit of ſlumber, or that their eyes are darkened, or that they have

viſible, to whom I referre the Reader. He places his greateſt
confidence in the firſt as he profeſſes, and thus enlarges upon it.
<hi>Now ſure the Gentiles were made fellow-heires of the ſame body,
and co-partakers of the promiſe of God in the Goſpel, not by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Ordinance, but by giving of faith according to Election;</hi>
Ergo <hi>the ingraffing,</hi> Rom. 11. 17. <hi>parallel to it is not by an outward
Ordinance, but by giving Faith according to Election.</hi> To this I
onely ſay. O that this were truth: Then as the Apoſtle ſaith
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at their reſtauration, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.
26. ſo we may ſay, all <hi>England</hi> in <hi>ſtatu quo</hi> ſhall be ſaved in the
ſenſe that he would underſtand ſalvation. Whether we be by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Britaines, Saxons,</hi> or <hi>Normans,</hi> we are gentiles and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
by his Divinity partakers of the Goſpel, by Fatih accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Election, But it is too clear that this Text is meant of
Goſpel-glory, in Ordinances diſpenſed by the Apoſtles Miniſtery,
And <hi>as to the Jewes appertained the glory and the promiſes,</hi> Rom.
9. 4, 5. So now the glory and promiſes belong to the Gentiles;
And as many Jews as fell not off, ſtill enjoy this this glory with
the Gentiles and ſo both make one new man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 15. The
viſible ſtate of the Jews was a diſtinct body from the Gentiles,
Now upon this glorious call they are one new man, or new body.
For the Texts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14, 26, 28, 29. when any ſhall tell me how
they are paralle, then I ſhall give my anſwer, There is an in
graffing into Chriſt mentioned; but none into the Church, and
ſo the parallels are without force, as are the Arguments. Two
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:55700:192"/>
things lie upon him to do, and neither is done. 1. To prove that
theſe Scriptures ſpeak of a Church inviſible. That they are parallel
with this Scripture. He is wont to reaſon with his full ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the force of all Arguments, <hi>à Pari</hi> and yet this argument
muſt carry force from the parity of Scriptures, which he only ſays,
and not at all proves to be parallel, nor yet ſhews ſo much as in a
word, wherein their parity conſiſts; he well knows that by this
means their diſparity might appear. There is a tenth Argument
drawn from Authorities produced, but to ſo little purpoſe that
I will not trouble the Readers patience in the recital
of it.</p>

two.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall mention the ſecond in the firſt place, ſeeing I am to
dwell upon the firſt, and that is their jealouſie of themſelves, of
their own ſtanding and perſeverance in the Chriſtian Faith. This
in reaſon they might well fear, who ſo active to ſeduce and draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
as a yoke-fellow? and this hath fair colour of Scripture for it,
<hi>Deut. 7. 4. They will turn away thy ſon from following me, that they
may ſerve other gods.</hi> Examples are not wanting, <hi>Nehem. 13. 26. Did
not</hi> Solomon <hi>King of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſin by theſe things? yet among many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
was there no King like him, who was belov'd of his God, and
God made him King over all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>nevertheleſſe, even him did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh
women cauſe to ſinne.</hi> To this the Apoſtle anſwers, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
the hopes of converſion of the unbelieving party; <hi>How
knoweſt thou O wife, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy husband? or how know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou, O man, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy wife?</hi> As there is fear
of ſeducing, ſo there is hope of converſion.</p>
                  <p>The other is the condition of their iſſue, leſt they ſhould not
be reckoned with the Saints, but of the fellowſhip of uncleane
Gentiles. Reaſon is ſtrong for this; they well knew that as it is with
the Parent, ſo it is with the Childe; for Church-ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being a priviledge communicable, and derived by deſcent from
Parent to Childe. If the Parent were without, and of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:55700:193"/>
the Childe was ever ſuch, and in caſe the parents, were of the
people of God, their children were reckoned ſo in like manner.
Now Parents being divided, the one holy, the other unclean, they
feared that the iſſue would follow the worſer part, a ſtaine would
lie upon them, they would be accounted unclean with the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
parent this hath a faire colour of Scripture likewiſe, and
in a like caſe it had been ſo determined, <hi>Ezra 10. 3.
Now therefore let us make a Covenant with our God, to put
away all the wives, and ſuch as are borne of them.</hi> The Apoſtle
takes off theſe fears of theirs, and tells them that the unbel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ving
party doth not (as they fear) defile the iſſue, but is ſanctified,
as to iſſue, by the Beleever, ſo that their children are holy, and to
be reckoned with the believing Parent, who is a Saint, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
&amp; not reckoned with the unbeleeving parent, who is a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
and ſo takes off their ſcruples reſpective both to themſelves
and their iſſue, and quiets their fears. So that ſeveral poſitions
might be here laid down for a right underſtanding of the
words.</p>
                  <p>1. By [Beleever] in this place is meant,<note place="margin">Explicatory Poſitions.</note> a man or woman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the true Faith, and bearing the name Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>2. By [Unbeleever] is meant, an Infidel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an unconverted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
living in Idolatry, ſacrificing to Devils, and not to God, of
ſuch the queſtion is put, and not of regenerate and unregenerate,
ſuch a ſcruple was never heard, whether or no ſuch might continue
marriage ſociety.</p>
                  <p>3. To be [ſanctified] here, is not to be made holy, which is the
caſe of the Regenerate; or to be ſet apart for God, which is the
caſe of the viſible Saint and Chriſtian; but together with
their yoke-fellow to be an holy root to produce an holy
ſeed.</p>
                  <p>4. By [Holy] is meant, federal holineſſe, to be reputed and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
among the people of God, who are holy, no other holineſſe is

                     <hi>Much ſtir is made about this doubt of the</hi> Coronthians,<note place="margin">The ground or riſe of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſcruples.</note> 
                     <hi>from
whence it might ariſe.</hi> In my apprehenſion, <hi>ſayes One,</hi> it is
likely that the doubt aroſe from the Epiſtle he wrote before to them
mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9, 10. not to keep company with Fornicators,
or Idolaters, which might occaſion the queſtion, whether they were
then to continue with their unbeleeving yoke-fellow. <hi>To this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
I anſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That many will not grant that the Apoſtle wrote any Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> before this; but as this carries the title
of the firſt, ſo there was none before it; and this they do, to
make it good that no Scripture given by divine inſpiration is loſt;
which would impeach (as they feare) both the providence of
God, and the faithfulneſſe of the Church to whom the Oracles
of God were concredited. But let it be grauted that he wrote
another Epiſtle, which he here mentions; yet the tenth verſe where
the ſtreſſe lies ſeems to be his preſent farther explanation of his
words there, and no part of the contents of that Epiſtle formerly
written, and ſo there is no roome left for this conjecture. But
put the caſe, that the ninth and tenth verſes do both expreſſe the
Contents of that Epiſtle, yet why do they take both the
ends, and leave out the middle? Making their converſe to be
with Husbands, or Wives, Fornicators or Idolaters, and not as
well with Covetous, or Extortioners? It is anſwered, <hi>the middle
termes</hi> [Covetous and Extortioners] <hi>are left out, becauſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it ſuperfluous for me to put them in. Their only ſcruple I
mentioned, was their converſing with the Idolatrous, or unbeleeving
yoke-fellow, becauſe the Apoſtle only reſolves that doubt,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 12.
13, 14. <hi>about which the diſpute I held was, Whether or no they
ſcrupled, converſing with Covetous and Extortioners, I could not tell;
becauſe the Apoſtle is ſilent about that doubt.</hi> If their ſcruple was
concerning converſing with their <hi>Idolatrous yoke-fellows,</hi> upon
occaſion of thoſe words, <hi>not to keep them company,</hi> they muſt
needs ſcruple their converſing with <hi>Covetous and Extortioners,
Husbands or Wives</hi> upon the ſame account, and the Apoſtle
being ſilent in his anſwer, it is clear they were ſilent in their letter,
and moving no ſcruple, they had no ſcruple; when it is impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them to ſcruple one upon thoſe words, and not ſcruple
all. When the Apoſtle names four evils reſpective to civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
converſe, it is a wilde fancy to imagine that they ſhould
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:55700:194"/>
ſtartle at one (reſpective to their marriage-ſociety) and queſtion
no more. I farther adde: If this conjecture hold, the Apoſtle
thus writes to the <hi>Corinthians, If any brother hath a wife that is
an Idolator, Fornicator, a Drunkard or Extortioner, let him not
put<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her away,</hi> and to this I am anſwered, <hi>Wiſe men do not alwayes
ſee the conſequent of that principle which they are poſſeſt with.</hi> And
how comes it I wonder into any mans thoughts, that the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
had wit to ſee the conſequence from his warning given of one
ſort of ſinners, and of never a one of the other named with them?
It is further ſaid, <hi>If they had the occaſion of the doubt from</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 9.
<hi>doth it follow that the Apoſtle muſt either know, that to have been the
occaſion, or reſolve their doubt with reference to it? and if he did, yet
there was no neceſſity he ſhould reſolve it in like manner concerning
Fornicators, as Idolaters.</hi> If the Apoſtle did not know it, how
comes it now to be known, did he want their Sagacity? If he did
know it, there muſt be a like neceſſity of reſolving the doubt in
reference to this, as any other at which they ſcrupled. And if
they doubted of all; why is there a neceſſity of clearing one, and
not all, the Apoſtle doubtleſſe took in every part, and piece of
their ſcruple. <hi>It is likely</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>the Apoſtle took in every
part and piece of that which is propounded to him as the</hi> Corinthians
<hi>ſcruple indeed; but there was no neceſſity he ſhould take in every
part of that which Maſter</hi> Blake <hi>may imagine, would have been
their ſcruple if my conjecture hold.</hi> But there was a neceſſity to
take in all that had the ſame evident ground of ſcruple, and
which every ratinal man will not onely with me imagine; but
certainly conclude (<hi>Hoc ſuppoſito</hi>) muſt be their ſcruple, Had the
Apoſtle taken in every part of their ſcruple, the queſtion about
divorce ſo much agitated, would have been determined. It is
wonder <hi>B. Howſon, Bunney,</hi> and others that ſay <hi>Moſes</hi> permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to put away wives, was in caſe of Adultery only, could not
have hit upon this Text which would have ſalved all, to this is
anſwered.</p>
                  <p>If the Apoſtle had taken in every part of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> imagined
ſcruple, and reſolved as I would have it; Yet, this doth not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the controverſie ſo much agitated, whether the innocent
party might marry after a lawful Divorce.</p>
                  <p>The full truth is here now ſpoken, ſuch a reſolution had indeed
deſtroy'd the the thing ſuppoſed, and there could have been no
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:55700:195"/>
lawful Divorce; and when the Apoſtle had determined againſt
all Divorce, and had given charge, as concerning the unbeleeving
wife, ſo concerning the wife of Fornication, If any man have
ſuch a wife, let him not put her away, why ſhould there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diſpute about it, either reſpective to Divorce, or
Marriage after it. But as to this enough is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                  <p>Having examined that which others by their conjecture would
make the ground of their ſcruple; I muſt ſpeak to that which
we make the occaſion of it before ſuggeſted, <hi>viz.</hi> that caſe of thoſe
Iſraelites, <hi>Ezra 9. 10. ch.</hi> who upon their returne from their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
had married ſtrange wives, and were ordered not to live
with them, but to put them away with their children, and here
to prevent tedious impertinencies, and to make this piece as brief
as poſſible, let me premiſe this as an undoubted truth; That
theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> had their ſcruples concerning their iſſue upon
their marriage in their diſparity. That which the Apoſtle ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
in his Anſwer, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſcrupled in their letter.
This no man can deny, for he writes to give ſatisfaction, (as is
plaine, <hi>verſe</hi> 1.) to their letter-ſcruples: But we ſee in the Text
that he as ſatisfies ſcruples concerning themſelves, ſo alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their iſſue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Let the Reader know, that I do not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
determine, that the determination of the caſe of the
Iſraelites, for their ſeparation from their wives, and putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their children with them, did occaſion this ſcruple in the
thoughts of theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> thus joyned, with unbeleeving
yoke-fellows, But I ſay, it is more then probable, that it did either
occaſion, or mightily ſtrengthen it, When they are men known
in the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 15. and did queſtion their own
marriage upon the account of the unbelief of their yoke-fellow,
and finding a caſe thus determined, both againſt mother and child
for ſeparation, how can we imagine but they hit upon it, and
were affected with it? 3. I do not ſay that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> caſe
and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were wholly the ſame, as it ſtood with <hi>Iſrael</hi>
then, and with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> now: I know it was not, for then
either <hi>Ezra</hi> had, been too harſh in ordering a ſeparation; or
<hi>Paul</hi> too indulgent in determining the lawfulneſſe of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of their marriage-ſociety, and ſo I may ſay of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
But I ſay their caſes were ſo like, and ſo ſeemingly paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:55700:195"/>
that it might well occaſion the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (thus in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
concerned) to judge them the ſame. Their caſes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
did differ, but the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had need of the Apoſtles help
to ſee the difference. The caſes were the very ſame in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but different in regard of divers adminiſtrations, under
which they reſpectively lived. <hi>He that would make their caſe the
ſame,</hi> (ſaith One) <hi>muſt not vary it in one particular: All Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts
and Lawyers determine a Caſe to be varied when one material
circumſtance is varied. The Jews being under the Law of</hi> Moſes,
<hi>and profeſſing it; the Corinthians, Chriſtians not ſo, and yet that
doubt as if occaſioned by that fact, muſt ariſe from the doubted force
of the Law of God.</hi> This hits right upon the difference between
them, which yet argues them to be ſtill in themſelves the ſame,
had not times differenced them; whereas he ſayes, the Jews were
under <hi>Moſes</hi> Law profeſſing it, but the <hi>Corinthian</hi>-Chriſtians
not ſo. I hope he will not deny they were under the Moral Law,
the Apoſtle even in this Epiſtle preſſing it upon them, 1 <hi>Cor.
9. 9. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 34. and it was not ſo eaſie for them to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
that the Command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. was judicial, purely reſpecting
their relation to thoſe Nations, and ſo their caſe by this meanes
better then thoſe Iſraelites, and being not able to determine, their
ſcruple remained, and they ſought to the Apoſtle for ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in it.</p>
                  <p>Having enquired into theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſcruples we are to
look further into the meaning of the words,<note place="margin">Two hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the words, holy, unclean.</note> and here we might
reckon up variety of interpretations of this Text in Ancient and
Moderne Writers, moſt of which are generally exploded, as
to the words <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>unclean,</hi> and therefore I think not fit to
trouble the Reader at all with them. Two there are which now
appeare eſpecially in competition with this here delivered, which
I ſhall hold forth in this place, that the Reader may judge of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">The firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up parent and childe too high, examined</note>
The firſt ſets up parent and childe, root and branch too
high; The ſecond layes the iſſue too low. The firſt is, that the
beleever here mentioned is an elect regenerate man, not only a
Profeſſor of the faith, but a man endowed with the grace of faith,
not onely of the Church viſible, but of the Church inviſible like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
That the holineſſe here mentioned is a real holineſſe,
that is, an holineſſe of regeneration, and the iſſue of one or both
regenerate perſons is alſo ſuch, regenerate. The iſſue of the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:55700:196"/>
unregenerate is (as they ſay) unregenerate likewiſe, An interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
as far from the Apoſtles minde as that which is fartheſt, and
the doctrine fetched from it as untrue as that which is untrueſt.
The Beleever here is the man that is not an Infidel, one that is
taken off from Gentiſme to the profeſſion of Chriſtianity. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi>
(whom <hi>Hierome</hi> ſo much admired) interprets it (as <hi>Hierom</hi>
relates his words, <hi>Ep.</hi> 153. of a baptized perſon. The <hi>Corinthians</hi>
never queſtioned the marriage between one party, in whom the
power of godlineſſe appears, and another profeſſingly of the
ſame faith, though not in that ſincerity, There was never ſuch a
ſcruple made, but the marriage between a profeſſor of Chriſtian
religion, and a Pagan; Neither is the iſſue of a regenerate man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his iſſue, regenerate; Habits, neither infuſed, nor acquired, are
thus communicated from parent to childe; Neither will it help to
ſay that this propoſition is not univerſal, but indefinite, which holds
<hi>ad plurimum,</hi> but not alwayes; The Apoſtles propoſition univerſally
holds, <hi>now are they holy,</hi> not in the opinion of charity, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
where neither are holy, the iſſue, not only <hi>ad plurimum,</hi> but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is unclean, not as to the judgement of our fears, but for his
preſent ſtate, ſo infallibly. That aſſertion to help this out, that
God draws regeneration through the loynes of the Elect, at leaſt
for the moſt part (few elect ones but their children are regenerate)
is ſuch a paradox that I ſuppoſe very few will receive; And thence
to infer the lawfulneſſe of the Baptiſme of all of ſuch birth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome are regenerate (and as then ſurmiſe the moſt, even in
the womb, and from the birth) is a bottome that will not bear it;
One without any name hath publiſhed a Treatiſe of Baptiſm, and
in it impugnes with all his ſtrength Infant-baptiſme. He takes
notice of this, and like poſitions of this nature, as our ground of
it, and then endeavours the battery of it It hath paſſed ſome yeers

I have often ſaid, if I be brought to theſe mens premiſſes, I ſhall
then conclude with the Antipaedobaptiſts. It ſo much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns

                  <p>3. The argument thus underſtood,<note place="margin">3. Untrue.</note> is untrue; The ſtreſſe is
wholly laid on the beleeving party, as to the holineſſe of the
iſſue twice over; The unbeleever is meerly paſſive in

                  <p>Againſt the former interpretation,<note place="margin">Arguments evincing the holineſſe in the Text not to be legitimation.</note> and for mine, which
<hi>Chamier</hi> affirmes to be <hi>Calvini, &amp; omnium nostrorum,</hi> take theſe
arguments. 1. That holineſſe which neceſſarily follows to the
iſſue, from the ſanctification of an unbeleeving, by a beleeving
yoke-fellow, is Covenant holineſſe, and not legitimation: But
the holineſſe in this place of the Apoſtle neceſſarily follows to
the iſſue, from the ſanctification of an unbeleever by a beleever;
<hi>Ergo</hi> it is Covenant-holineſſe, not legitimation. 2. That
which is derived from the eminency of one parent above another,
and not equally from both, is not legitimation: But this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
is derived from the eminence of one parent (<hi>viz.</hi> the
beleeving parent above the other;) <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
3. The reſult or fruit which follows from a beleevers faith is
not legitimation: But the holineſſe in the Text is a reſult of the
faith of the beleeving yoke-fellow; The minor is evident, ſeeing
faith is twice hinted at in the beleever. I know that there is one
that denies, that the unbeleeving husband, or wiſe is here ſaid to be
ſanctified in the beleeving; It is (ſaith he) <hi>in the husband, not
in the beleeving husband, in the wife, not in the beleeving wife, that
is not in the Text.</hi> The marriage is between a beleever and an
unbeleever, the unbeleever is ſanctified whether husband or wife
by their yoke-fellow, but not as is ſaid, by their beleeving yoke-fellow;

is not ſuch, that many words ſhould need to be ſpent about it,
But ſeeing that a learned hand, layes ſo much, and ſo great ſtreſs
upon it; It may not be ſlightly paſſed over, and who ſees not
here a wilde parallel well worthy of ſuch a monſtrous aſſertion,
The propoſition is, of two ſtanding in full diſparity, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

all, and by two adjuncts which are <hi>Synonyma:</hi> I deſire to know
how this ſequel may be proved, If a wife of an ignoble birth
be not made Noble by her husband, her iſſue is ignoble; muſt
it be proved by this Propoſition, The iſſue of every wife not
made noble by her husband, is ignoble? or will it ſerve,
The iſſue of every ignoble wife not made noble by her husband
is ignoble? If a poore man take a wife, and is not enricht by her,
he ſtill remaines in a poore condition; ſhall this be made good by
a propoſition, That all men taking wives, and not enricht by
them are in a poore condition; or will it ſerve that every poor
man taking a wife, and not enricht by her, is in a poore condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
are theſe true, or are they falſe propoſitions. Yea, what
is affirmed in his own inſtance, to prove that if an Engliſhman be
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:55700:198"/>
noble, he is honourable, it is ſufficient to prove it by this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
All Engliſhmen noble, are honourable, will not hold. Let
any one tell me how he will make good this Propoſition: If a
Dutchman be borne of a Duke, he is a Duke; if he be borne of
an Earle he is an Earle, muſt it be; All men born of Dukes, are
Dukes, of Earles, are Earles; This with us in <hi>England</hi> is falſe,
but of all Dutch men thus borne it is truth; But the reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

he) <hi>would be all one, whereas the Propoſition proving muſt be lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then the Propoſition proved.</hi> But who knows not, that the
Propoſition proving is larger here then the propoſition proved.
A propoſition expreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly univerſal, is larger in a Logick argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then either an indefinite or particular. The Propoſition
by him excepted againſt, in Logick conſideration is as univerſal
as that which is moſt univerſal; Every Engliſhman that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is honourable, is an univerſal Propoſition, as well as every
man that is noble, is honourable; and I never learnt that in the
quantity of propoſitions, there is <hi>magis &amp; minus.</hi> I am chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
for ſaying, <hi>The truth of the Apoſtles ſequel depends on this
propoſition; All the children of an unbeleever are uncleane, unleſſe
for generation he or ſhe be ſanctified by a beleever;</hi> and addes, <hi>I
deny it, in that the termes, [for generation by a Beleever] are
added by him, not in the Apoſtle, and ſo he changed the termes.</hi> I
pray leave generation out, and ſee whether there can be any ſenſe
in it, unleſſe it be underſtood; Their ſanctification will confer
no legitimation, without generation; If I ſay not beleever, I muſt
ſay husband or wife that is a beleever.</p>
                  <p>Another bottome on which the forenamed interpretation is
grounded is,<note place="margin">The Apoſtle brings not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal arguments to conclude the lawfulneſs of marriage-ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, but removes ſcruples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n ſtate and their iſſue.</note> That the Apoſtle in this Text brings a formal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prove the marriage-ſociety of theſe yoke-fellows to be
lawful, which in the two former verſes he had determined, and
(as was confeſt before) they ſcrupled, and it cannot be denied but
the words at firſt ſight, ſeem to carry ſome colour to underſtand
them ſo farre in this ſenſe, as to make them formal, concluding
reaſons of his former determination, Having ſaid, <hi>verſe 12, 13.
If any brother hath a wife that beleeveth not, and ſhe be pleaſed to
dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the woman that hath
an husband that beleeveth not, and he be pleaſed to dwell with her, let
her not leave him;</hi> then he adds, <hi>For the unbeleeving husband is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:55700:198"/>
by the wife; and the unbeleeving wife is ſanctified by the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> But
the way of inference will as well bear it; that the Apoſtle doth
firſt determine the Controverſie by revelation as an Apoſtle,
and then takes off their ſcruples which occaſioned their feares,
both reſpective to their poſterity and themſelves; This way of
interpretation is charged as making the Apoſtle immethodical,
but what better method then to determine a point, and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
reaſons againſt it; The Apoſtle meeting with their fears
in reſpect both of their poſterity, and themſelves, it muſt needs
be that they ſignified them, and he removes them; The Apoſtles
method (it is true) and manner of inference indifferently fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
either interpretation; But the words themſelves clearly
evince, that they are a removal of ſcruples againſt their marriage-ſociety,
and not a formal concluding argument for it. Let us
look firſt into <hi>verſe</hi> 16. where <hi>[For]</hi> may lay as faire a claime
to a formal reaſon as this in the fourteenth, and ſuch that ſtand
for this interpretation ſay, it is a formal reaſon, But I would
faine learn how any one can make it up into a reaſon; He muſt
thus draw it up, whom man in marriage-ſociety may have hopes to
ſave from idolatrous wayes, with ſuch a one he may continue
marriage-ſociety; But a beleeving husband in marriage-ſociety
may have hopes to ſave his unbeleeving wife from idolatrous
wayes, <hi>Ergo.</hi> This propoſition as to ſuch a concluſion is. 1. Vaine,
for, though there were no ſuch hopes, yet marriage-ſociety is to
be continued, Gentiliſme being not of the ſubſiſtence of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
2. This Propoſition is falſe as to this purpoſe; The inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Corinthian</hi> might have hopes to have had converted his fathers
wife, (if a Heathen) and yet ſuch hopes would not conclude the
lawfulneſſe of their ſociety together; <hi>Herod</hi> might have had like
hopes to have converted his brother <hi>Philips</hi> wife, and yet this was
not objected againſt <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and had it been objected, it had
been frivolous. We have many caſes put about marriage, if ſuch
an argument would ſerve the turne, it would ſalve them all. And
for <hi>verſe</hi> 14. though I cannot ſay, but in caſe it were made up
into a reaſon of the former concluſion, it would contain a truth,
and ſo far might paſſe in the way of a reaſon, yet I have many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
exceptions againſt it.</p>
                  <p>1. From the thing it ſelf, it would be a reaſon (though true,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:55700:199"/>
yet) ſilly, childiſh, vaine, your married condition is lawful, elſe
your children were baſtards; what childe in <hi>Corinth</hi> (as was
hinted when I ſpake of the Apoſtles words, as in themſelves that
knew the right hand from the left) but well underſtood it?
There is not a boy that plays in the ſtreets, but knows that children
born out of wedlock are baſtards. There is a Book publiſhed, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it to the queſtion, and diſputing it, whether marriages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween profeſſours of the true religion and Infidels, and ſo of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,
with Proteſtants, be not <hi>ab initio,</hi> null, and they to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in caſe any ſhall now come in with this argument for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
that they are not null, and to conclude their continuance;
If ſuch marriage be null; their children are baſtards: But they
are not baſtards, <hi>Ergo</hi> the marriage is not null; the Authour or
any other might be brought to a ſmile, not to conviction. As

that have paſt with many for <hi>Pauls</hi> to <hi>Seneca,</hi> charges them
with no falſe doctrine, but is bold to ſay, I ſee not what can be ſaid

of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit; So I may ſay of this ſuppoſitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s ſpurious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
put upon this Text in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
troubled that theſe Epiſtles ſhould have their verboſous
Comments, any may equally be troubled that ſuch a
reaſon ſhould finde defence from any hand in ſo many
words.</p>
                  <p>My next challenge is from the phraſe in which it is delivered,
altogether unſutable to a reaſon of this doctrine, upon a threefold
account. 1. The Apoſtle being onely to tell them, that the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation
of their iſſue proved the lawfulneſſe of their marriage-ſociety,
he ſhould attribute all (as to either ſex) to the beleever,
when the childe owes his legitimation equally to either parent,
to the unbeleever as much as the beleever. 2. That being to give
reaſon of the lawfulneſſe of marriage in ſuch a ſpecial caſe, he
ſhould give his reaſon of equal concernment to all marriages,
where both are unbeleevers, both beleevers, as well as this between
a beleever and an unbeleever. 3. When he is to ſpeak only of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation
and baſtardy, he ſhould praiſe it in ſuch uncouth
language, and in words, fit it onely, ſutable to their parent, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
capacity, whether title to it, as in the beleever, or want
of it as in the unbeleever; now, on the other hand interpret the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:55700:199"/>
Apoſtles words (as his method will equally bear) accordingly as
you have heard before, and no ſuch inconveniency follows from
the words either <hi>verſe</hi> 14. or 16. And now our adverſary may
eaſily receive an anſwer to that odious inference, which he makes
from our interpretation of Covenant-holineſſe: <hi>According to
this interpretation</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the</hi> medium <hi>of the Apoſtle to prove
the lawfulneſſe of the living of a beleeving wife with an unbeleeving
husband, will as well prove the lawfulneſſe of a beleeving fornicatrix
with an unbeleeving fornicator, as may appeare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by a
Syllogiſticall Analyſis of the Apoſtles argument, the major where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is this, That man and woman may live together, notwithſtanding
the unbelief of one party, whereof one is ſanctified to the other for
begetting an holy ſeed.</hi> This is manifeſtly the Apoſtles reaſon, he
ſayes after our interpretation. But he is manifeſtly miſtaken;
not to mention the liberty that he will ſcarce allow another to
leave out husband and wife expreſt in the text, and inſtead of it
to put man and woman: The Apoſtle doth not conclude the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of their marriag-ſociety by the federation of their iſſue,
but ſhews that the ſuppoſed and feared non-federation doth not
conclude the unlawfulneſſe, and I dare yeeld that any man and
woman may live together, notwithſtanding any feare of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſſe
of their iſſue; where one is ſanctified by the faith of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
to the begetting of a ſeed federally holy. And if he will
apply this, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, of a mans living with his
wife (<hi>ad faciendum populum</hi>) to the living with his whore, there
is no danger to yeeld it; <hi>Pharez</hi> his iſſue had belonged to the
Common-weale of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if <hi>Tamar</hi> had been an Infidel, as for
ought we know, and in all probability it was, with <hi>Jephtaes</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
If <hi>Sampſon</hi> had iſſue by the Harlot of <hi>Gaza,</hi> Judges 16. 1.
ſuch iſſue had belonged to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſuch iſſue male had right to
Circumciſion. To gratifie him I ſhall put it under my hand, that
if a man have no other reaſon from Scripture to leave his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
then the non-federation of his iſſue, he may ſtill abide with
her, and that he is not bound upon that ſole account to deſert her
If any ſhall attempt to keep up theſe two maine propoſitions by
me examined, on which the whole fabrick of a long diſcourſe is
built, for to make good the interpretation mentioned, and refute
the arguments againſt it, I ſhall readily and willingly look into
it, which for ſeveral yeares I have waited, till then I ſhall
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:55700:200"/>
conclude that federal holineſſe and not legitimation is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                  <p>A mighty ſtirre is here further made about inſtrumental ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,<note place="margin">A vindication of inſtrumental ſanctification.</note>
and arguments heaped by Maſter <hi>Tombes</hi> againſt it, the
moſt of them grounded upon thoſe two Propoſitions (which he
would have his Reader beleeve that I confeſſe, when he cannot
prove,) <hi>That al the children whereof one parent is not ſanctified to the
other are unclean; none of the children whereof the one is not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
to the other are cleane,</hi> together with the other; <hi>That this is
a concluding formal reaſon to prove the lawfulneſſe of their abode to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;</hi>
upon this account it is affirmed that our interpretation
fits not the caſe of perſons diſabled from procreation, it makes
the Apoſtles argument to be from a future contingent, <hi>I appeal
to any Logician and Grammarian whether a perſon may be ſaid
to be inſtrumentally ſanctified for ſuch an effect which he
neither doth nor can produce? Whether a woman may be ſaid to be
ſanctified</hi> quoad hoc, <hi>ſo farre as to bring forth an holy ſeed, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the faith of her husband, who is by age or accidental impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
utterly diſabled naturally from bearing any children, and
hath no ſupernatural power enabling her thereto? whether ſhe may
be capable to bring forth an holy ſeed, who is not capable to bring
forth any at all? bringing forth an holy ſeed cannot be without
bringing forth a ſeed, and therefore the woman uncapable to bring
forth a ſeed is uncapable to bring forth an holy ſeed.</hi> And <hi>I</hi> on the contrary appeal to any, yea, the meaneſt Chriſtian whether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that have children born in wedlock-bonds, in ſuch diſparity
may not have their fears and ſcruples about them, notwithſtanding
other in the ſame condition of marriage are childleſſe, or unable to
bring forth children? Whether the ſeed which came of thoſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
<hi>Ezra</hi> 10. were not uncleane, notwithſtanding many ſo
married had no children? many of the Prieſts had herein tranſgreſt,
and it was but <hi>ſome of them that had wives by whom they had children,</hi>
Ezra 10. 44. And becauſe this is the <hi>medium</hi> for proof of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
determination, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. that they might live together,
it muſt needs be from a future contingent; but when this is no
<hi>medium</hi> for proof of the Apoſtles determination, as hath been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſhewn it is not, this falls with the other.</p>
                  <p>Two arguments againſt inſtrumental ſanctification I ſhall
take notice of, which ſeeme to have ſome other bottome.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:55700:200"/>
1. <hi>That the act of producing an holy ſeed is not from any ſpecial
deſignation of God, and therefore cannot be meant of inſtrumental
ſanctification, ſeeing an inſtrument muſt be the inſtrument of the
principal agent which can be no other then God;</hi> I am ſure they
bring forth children unto God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20. and this they do
not independently of themſelves, ſo Chriſt would not have
warned, <hi>Matth. 23. 10. Call no man father upon earth, for one is your
Father whech is in heaven.</hi> All natural parents are inſtruments of
God to produce a ſeed to people the world, according to that
bleſſing of <hi>Gen. 1. 28. Gen. 9. 1. Be fruitful and multiply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh
the earth;</hi> All beleeving parents are inſtruments of God for
an holy ſeed, it being of his free grace that the promiſe is to them
and their ſeed.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond argument is that <hi>many a child of both unbeleeving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are federaly holy;</hi> and being anſwered that they are not
ſo at their birth, if afterwards by grace they are changed, this
is no fruit of their birth (of which the queſtion is in this place)
but the work of the Goſpel through grace. It is replied,
<hi>This is nothing to the purpoſe, ſith the Propoſition hath not thoſe
words in it, nor the Apoſtle; the Apoſtles reaſon ſuppoſeth it
cannot be at any time;</hi> It ſeems then that the Apoſtles Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath this in it, that their children ſo borne, are unclean
by birth and for all eternity ſhall ſo remaine never to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
or elſe this exception is leſſe to purpoſe, who does not ſee
that the Apoſtle ſpeaks uncleanneſſe or holineſſe as a product of
their birth? without conſideration of any thing which after by
providence (through the omnipotence and free grace of God)
might happen, as a mean woman given in marriage to a Senator or
Peer, ſhe is enobled by her husband, otherwiſe her iſſue were ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians,
yet ſo as they are capable of honour by the Princes muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
or their own merit; It ſeems that Propoſition of Chriſts,
<hi>That which is borne of the fleſh,</hi> John 3. 6. will not hold, unleſſe
it muſt for ever continue fleſh, and no omnipotence of God ſhall
be able to make it otherwiſe. It is further ſaid, <hi>and yet it may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the child of two unbeleevers may be federally holy at birth,
whether it be underſtood of Election, inherent holineſſe, or outward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
if God pleaſe to work, and declare it.</hi> To this I onely ſay, let that
propoſition ſtand, till God by ſuch a miracle confute, or contradict
it, and whenſoever he ſhall thus own ſuch unclean infants as fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
holy, I ſhall be ſilent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:55700:201"/>
It is farther ſaid, <hi>But the iſſue of them that are not lawfully
enjoyned as husband and wife, cannot be made legitimate by God,
becauſe it is contrary to the definition of legitimation, which is a
ſtate conſequent upon birth by the lawful copulation of lawful
husband and wife.</hi> So that the reply is brought to this, becauſe
God by his omnipotence can make our uncleane ones holy,
and to make their uncleane ones holy, is without the verge of
omnipotence; therefore his interpretation ſtands and ours muſt
fall. If we ſhould put caſe in their manner, that God ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in approbation of a mans enjoying a woman out of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-ſociety,
then there were a legitimation of the iſſue, as he
did the marriage of the brothers wife, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 5. otherwiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moral Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 16. Or as ſome underſtand it,
the Prophets taking a wife of whoredoms.</p>

                  <p>THe next Scripture Text to make good the point in hand, is
<hi>Gal. 4. 29. As then he that was borne after the fleſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Hiſtory we finde,</hi> verſe 22, 23. It is written that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
had two ſonnes, the one by a bond-maide, the other by a free-woman,
but he who was of the bond-woman was born after the fleſh,
but he of the free-woman was by promiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Myſtery by way of Allegory,</hi> verſe 24, 25, 26. Which
things are an Allegory, for theſe are the two Covenants, the one from
the Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> which gendereth to bondage, which is <hi>Agar.</hi>
For this <hi>Agar</hi> is Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and anſwereth to
<hi>Hieruſalem</hi> which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
But <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> which is above is free, which is the mother of

                     <pb n="367" facs="tcp:55700:201"/>
The parallel in theſe words, <hi>But as then, he that was born after
the fleſh perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit, ſo it is now.</hi>
From whence this argument is drawn,<note place="margin">The argumen deduced from it.</note> If there yet remaine in the
boſome of the Church children borne after the fleſh, as well as
thoſe that are borne of the Spirit, (ſo that the diſtinction of
births, as applied to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, ſtill hath place among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians)
then there is that priviledge of birth-holineſſe ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining;
The conſequence is plaine, Birth of the fleſh in the
Church gave a Church-intereſt, The Apoſtles kinſemen after
the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. were all Church-members. That there is
is ſuch a birth yet remaining, the Text quoted makes cleare;
<hi>Iſhmael</hi> was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, and was by birth of his family,
and did perſecute in the family, and was by birth of his family,
and did perſecute in the family, as the Apoſtles ſhews out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Hiſtory, Men in the Church, borne in the Church, by birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
of the Church, do perſecute, as upon experience he affirms,
and ſo makes up the parallel. There birth of the fleſh, is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
honour they attaine; when others have the ſame with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to it; this implies two things. 1. A birth of nature, a childe by
lineal deſcent of ſuch a father. 2. Outward prerogatives that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
ſuch a birth.</p>
                  <p>I know and have declared that this is not that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
here chiefly intends, or is about to hold out. But this I
affirme, that he occaſionally layes down, that which I here have
delivered. And by this free conceſſion of mine, any man in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
might have thought, that I had prevented that which is ſtill
charged upon that which from this Text I have inferred, or rather
that which in this Text I have obſerved, one largely ſhewing
that theſe words in hand, <hi>are a compound propoſition, which Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
call a comparative propoſition, in which are two parts, a
Protaſis, and an Apodoſis, or rendring, wherein that which anſwers
the fore part, firſt held out, is expreſſed, now that alwayes notes
ſome agreement, correſpondence, parity or likeneſſe, whether in
quantity, quality, action, &amp;c. But according to my Apodoſis or
reddition</hi> (as is ſaid) <hi>there is no ſuch anſwerableneſſe, or likeneſſe,
as hath the ſhew of a compariſon of things equal or alike (as this is
as the affirmative termes ſhew) for who would conceive any better
then non-ſenſe, in ſuch a ſpeech as this, Even as</hi> Iſhmael <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
Iſaac, <hi>ſo the children of Christian beleevers are viſible members
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:55700:202"/>
in the Chriſtian Church. It were all one as to ſay even as</hi> Eſau <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
Jacob, <hi>ſo godly men are heirs of heaven, or have acceſſe to God.</hi>
The abſurdity of which with him is ſo groſſe, that the man is ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
that I do not ſee it, nor will confeſſe it. Being above his ſtrength
to anſwer that ſenſe; which I give of the words, he is pleaſed to
take paines to make them up, by his gloſſe, into non-ſenſe, that ſo
no anſwer may need, But he well knows or might know, that I
have not to deale with the whole of that <hi>Protaſis,</hi> nor the whole
of that <hi>Apodoſis,</hi> and not at all with the perſecution there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
but onely with the diſtinction there let fall, which is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of births, both in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, and in the Church,
in Goſpel-times, which the Apoſtle in his Application in thoſe
words <hi>[Then]</hi> and <hi>[Now,]</hi> plainly doth demonſtrate. The truth
which the Apoſtle ſuppoſes, and takes for granted, I have here to
ſpeak to, and not to that, which by way of allegory, he infers from
it, or applies to it, and ſo the liſt of authours here brought in by
my adverſary; ſpeaking of the perſecution of Chriſtians, by Jews
and Papiſts, may all of them ſpeak truth; but none of them all, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing againſt me, who deduce no more from the words, but
that a diſtinction of births is there laid down, or rather taken for
granted, which is by the Apoſtle allegoriſed, but the allegory is
not at all within that which I am upon. I met with like dealings,
from the ſame hand; when I did compare, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7. 14. with <hi>Gal.</hi>

evidence of truth, with Maſter <hi>Cartwrights</hi> authority, making them
as to the thing, full parallel (as to every eye they are) hath there
wrought ſome ſilence, ſo I doubt not, but it will follow here. It is
not the Apoſtles intention, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15. to ſpeak of the birth-priviledg
of the Jews, nor yet the want of it in the Gentiles, yet there he
mentions both,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 29.</note> neither is it his intention to treat of ſuch a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of births, in the Church. Jewiſh or Chriſtian, but the hoſtile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of one, ſo born; againſt another, yet in that place he
plainly ſignifies ſuch a diſtinction of births in either Church, both
Jewiſh and Chriſtian. Can any man deny that <hi>Abraham</hi> had two
ſons of ſuch different births, as the Apoſtle from the hyſtory in
<hi>Geneſis</hi> ſhews, <hi>v. 22, 23. Iſhmael</hi> is ſet out as a ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and upon that account we know he had the honour of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:55700:202"/>
                     <hi>Iſaac</hi> had the ſame, but a degree of further honour with
it, being born as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was not) by promiſe, And whatſoever
Allegory the Apoſtle makes of it (which is not to my purpoſe to
examine) yet in his reddition or application, he looks at the hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtory,
not at the allegory, as the adverbs of time, <hi>Then, Now,</hi>
(neither of which are allegoriſed) do demonſtrate. And though
<hi>Iſhmael</hi> may be a type of a juſtitiary, ſeeking righteouſneſſe by
works, and perſecuting thoſe that ſeek a righteouſneſſe by faith,
whether <hi>typus, factus, or deſtinatus</hi> I will not enquire, yet, I
think, it will never be proved; that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was ſuch a one, in
his own perſon, perſecuting <hi>Iſaac</hi> on that account; which muſt
be proved, if the Apoſtle in his reddition do no look at the hiſtory,
but the allegory as my adverſary contends or elſe he ſpeaks beſides
the purpoſe, <hi>[Then]</hi> looks at the hiſtory denoting time, as none
can deny, and <hi>[Now]</hi> muſt not referre to the allegory without
great abſurdity. My interpretation (as is ſaid) will not hold,
in that according to it, there is no agreement, correſpondency,
or parity in the parts of the compound propoſition, And I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
what agreement, correſpondency or parity there is, or can
be, in the parts of this compound propoſition, according to the
interpretation oppoſed againſt me, confounding hiſtory and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory
together. Thus it muſt be, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> no juſtitiary, then
jeered <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a ſucking babe (as my adverſary out of <hi>Hierome</hi>
ſpeaks) who was not in capacity to look after any righteouſneſſe,
ſo it is now; juſtitiaries perſecute thoſe that do follow after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
by faith. If this gloſſe ſtand it ſhould not be, <hi>ſo it is
now,</hi> but rather, <hi>now it is otherwiſe.</hi> He that will come to a right
underſtanding of the Text, muſt refer this 29. <hi>verſe</hi> to 22, and 23.
looking upon <hi>verſe</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. (where the allegory is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted)
as a parenthiſis, ſeeing the words in <hi>v.</hi> 29. cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to the allegory in thoſe words, where there is no mention
made of perſecution but to the hiſtory in the former. I am told,
that <hi>the Apoſtles diſtribution, cannot be, of a ſubject by its adjuncts,
but, of a genus, into its ſpecies, becauſe</hi> [birth] <hi>is neither ſubſtance,
quantity, nor quality; but an action, or a paſſion, and actions though
they be capable of various modifications, yet Logiſcians (as is ſaid)
do not call them ſubjects.</hi> But doubtleſſe the perſon borne, is and
may be called a ſubject, and ſtands in a capacity of adjuncts, and
I look to the perſons here diſtinguiſhed, ſome with more inferior,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:55700:203"/>
and others with more noble adjuncts. When I cite may Maſter
<hi>Baine</hi> (brought in againſt me as an adverſary) ſaying, <hi>The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the fleſh here, are thoſe onely who in courſe of nature came from</hi>
Abraham, <hi>I am told, it is true, that Mr.</hi> Bayne <hi>ſo interprets the
terme [children of the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 9. 8.] as I have cited him, <hi>which
place he meant, but not the terme [he that is borne after the fleſh,</hi> Gal.
4. 29.] <hi>yea,</hi> p. 138. <hi>he ſaith, for though children of the fleſh, in ſome
other Scripture (meaning</hi> Gal. 4 29.) <hi>doth note out juſtitiaries, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſalvation in the Law, yet here</hi> (Rom. 9. 8.) <hi>the literal meaning
is, to be taken, a childe of the fleſh, being ſuch a one who deſcendeth
from Abraham according to the fleſh.</hi> But how can Mr. <hi>Bayne</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
meane, Gal. 4 29. (as I am here told he doth) when he ſpeaks
of the children of the fleſh, when thoſe words are not to be found
there, [but born after the fleſh] and thoſe terms [children of the
fleſh] and [born after the fleſh]<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are in this very place by my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
diſtinguſhed. And though Maſter <hi>Bayne</hi> do not quote,
<hi>Gal</hi> 4 29. in that place which I mentioned, yet <hi>Doctor</hi> Abbot <hi>in
Thomſoni diatribam,</hi> p. 115. ſaith. <hi>Circumciſus eſt</hi> Iſhmael, <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſus

natus est tantum modo ſecundum carnem,</hi> Iſhmael <hi>quanquam cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſus,

the birth of the fleſh, an honour giving circumciſion, though an
honour inferiour to that of the birth of the ſpirit which juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
accompanies, and he quotes <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. as a proof of what
he ſpeaks, and I am much engaged to my Antagoniſt, for his quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
out of <hi>Hierome. Sicut ergo, tum; major frater</hi> Iſhmael, <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctentem
adhuc &amp; parvulum perſequabatur</hi> Iſaac, <hi>ſibi circumciſionis
prerogativum, ſibi primogenita vendicans, ita &amp; nunc, &amp;c.</hi> Whence
had he this prerogative of circumciſion, but from this birth,
that I ſpeak of from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and there is, the like prerogative
of birth; ſtill continuing, or elſe there is no parity in the Apoſtles
reddition. Here I ſhall take notice of a fourfold abſurdity endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to be faſtened upon me.</p>
                  <p>1. That I underſtand <hi>this to be ſaid of Infants which then muſt
be ſaid to perſecute,</hi> But I underſtand it not of Infants, but of
thoſe, which ſometimes were Infants; and had their birth in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
from ſuch and ſuch parents.</p>
                  <p>2. That I take <hi>[being born after the fleſh] in the latter part to
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:55700:203"/>
note a natural birth, but that is clean beſides the Apoſtles meaning,
who conſiders perſons borne after the fleſh, not as borne by humane
members and ſeed, but as born by a fleſhly covenant, otherwiſe it would
import no allegory, contrary to the Apoſtles ſpeech,</hi> ver. 24. <hi>which tells
us theſe things are an allegory.</hi> If I ſhould take it in one part of the
propoſition, in one ſenſe, and in another part of the propoſition,
in another ſenſe I ſhould then quite ſpoile the agreement, which
I am told muſt be in it, and then <hi>I</hi> might have been indeed argued
againſt for an abſurdity whereas it is ſaid that the <hi>Apoſtle conſiders
perſons borne after the fleſh, not as born by humane members and ſeed,
but as borne by a fleſhly Covenant, I</hi> ſay, that, that is falſe, as to
the hiſtory, and <hi>I</hi> have ſhewed by reaſons that have yet no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
anſwer that the Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. lays down the hiſtory,
which afterwards he allegorizes in five verſes, and then makes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the hiſtory, and not of the allegory, <hi>v.</hi> 29.</p>
                  <p>3. That to be [born after the fleſh] ſhould import, birth of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
as a beleever, and ſo natural generation, of each child of a beleever in
that reſpect, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut then [to be borne after the fleſh] would be common
to <hi>Iſaac</hi> with <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> to him that is borne after the ſpirit, of the
free woman by promiſe, with him that is borne after the fleſh of the
the bond-woman; for to be borne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or a beleever agrees
alſo to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to him that is born after the Spirit, of the free-woman
by promiſe; whereas to be borne after the fleſh is taken in a ſenſe from
which <hi>Iſaac</hi> and we, that is, <hi>Paul</hi> and other Chriſtian beleevers are
excluded. <hi>That is, that certain clear truth by way of neceſſary co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary
would follow, which that great Doctor</hi> Abbot, <hi>in the
place quoted takes for granted, ſpeaking of both births, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
his</hi> tantummodo <hi>twice over to</hi> Iſhmaels <hi>birth, he clearly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies,
that</hi> Iſhmael <hi>had this honour, and that</hi> Iſaac <hi>had it likewiſe,
and that which is far more noble together with it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. It is ſaid, <hi>that I quite pervert the Apoſtles intent, in taking [to
be born after the fleſh] to impart an honour, whereas the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
birth after the fleſh, as a debaſement, takes it in the worſer part,
not as importing a deſcent from the father, but from the mother and
that mother a bond woman, and therefore the children, ſervants, or
bond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſlaves, by reaſon of their being borne after the fleſh.</hi> And doth not
the Apoſtle tell us, in the relation of the hiſtory, of their father
as well as their mother? does he not ſpeak of one common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in theſe words, <hi>Abraham had two ſons,</hi> as well as of two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:55700:204"/>
mothers? and <hi>I</hi> dare not take the boldneſſe to exclude ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>I</hi> confeſſe the Apoſtle mentions [birth after the fleſh] as
a debaſement, in putting it in oppoſition to [birth of the Spirit,]
yet <hi>I</hi> affirme, that he mentions it alſo, as an honour. As circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
was a debaſement in one reſpect, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 11, and an honour
in another, <hi>Rom. 3. 1. Phil.</hi> 3. 5. It was an honour to have Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
in the fleſh, they were thereby a people of God in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
but it was a debaſement, being put in oppoſition to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſſion
in heart; and to the worſhipping of God in Spirit and
in Truth; it was an honour to be born of <hi>Abraham,</hi> after the fleſh,
and frequently mentioned in Scripture as an honour, but an abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when it is oppoſed to the birth of God by the Spirit. Much
more might be animadverted, but this is enough (as <hi>I</hi> think) to
the cauſe, and <hi>I</hi> purpoſely avoid all that concernes the perſon, <hi>I</hi>
know not what more may be ſaid, but <hi>I</hi> finde nothing, as yet, ſaid;
but that which inſtead of evincing the contrary (being thoroughly
examined) is a more full confirmation, that in New Teſtament-times,
ſuch a diſtinction of births, is in New Teſtament-times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinned,
clearly hinted and taken for granted here, and in other
Scriptures fully expreſt.</p>

                  <p>In the words that we have in hand, we ſee. 1. Their admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
or at leaſt charge given for it; <hi>Suffer little children to come
unto me.</hi> 2. The reaſon, <hi>for of ſuch is the Kingdome of God.</hi> Here
is wont to be enquired. 1. What moved theſe thus to preſent
their children.<note place="margin">Upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to Chriſt.</note> This by the Evangeliſts is expreſſed; <hi>that Chriſt
would put his hands upon them, and pray.</hi> Which as they requeſted,
ſo he condeſcended to anſwer, <hi>He put his hands upon them, and
bleſſed them.</hi> They looked upon Chriſt (as it ſeemes) as a great
Prophet highly in favour with God, and ſuch were wont to bleſs
in the name of God, and their bleſſing was highly prized. Hands
were uſed to be impoſed as in ſacrifices, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 10. ſo on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48 14. The reaſon that moved his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
to forbid their coming, can ſcarce be doubted. They ſaw
men reſorting to Chriſt;<note place="margin">Why they were forbidden by the Diſciples.</note> either moved by his Doctrine, or his
Miracles, either to be inſtructed, or cured; neither of theſe could
be in their thoughts that preſented theſe little ones. They were
uncapable of his teaching, being infants; and that they needed
not his cure, being not diſeaſed, and therefore they rebuked
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:55700:205"/>
thoſe that came to tender them.<note place="margin">Poſitions rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to clear Chriſt admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them.</note> Now to come to a clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the words, we ſhall lay firſt ſome poſitions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe Infants admiſſion, and afterwards come to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That theſe were Infants, or as Infants in an incapacity to
learne ought from Chriſt, and ſo actually to imbrace Chriſt, or enter
Covenant themſelves with him.</hi> Which does appear. 1. In
that they are called little ones, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 2. They were brought,
and came not on their own accord. 3. In that Chriſt took
them up in his armes. 4. Had they been capable by age of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
with what colour could any have denied them? Why
might not they come as well as thoſe multitudes that flocked to
him? 5. Why were not the children themſelves ſpoke to, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to come, rather than thoſe that brought them, not to bring
them? If they were capable of inſtruction, they were capable of
rebuke. 6. Why is there no word of inſtruction ſpoken to them?
The young man that came to Chriſt, was inſtructed by Chriſt
in the ſame Chapter. So ſhould theſe have been inſtructed as
well as bleſt, had they been in a capacity for inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As they were in an incapacity by reaſon of age to be
taught, ſo they were not (as was ſaid) diſeaſed to have need of cure.</hi>
This the Diſciples well knew that this was uſual with Chriſt to
cure thoſe that laboured under infirmities of all ages, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
would never have had it in their thoughts to have rebuked
thoſe that brought theſe, and the Evangeliſt would never have
concealed this reaſon, and mentioned another. Such a thing
as this I ſaid was vented in a Manuſcript, but I knew not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any print had maintained it. Now I am told that there is a
book in Folio entituled <hi>Baby Baptiſme</hi> meere Babiſme, that doth
aſſert it. If any man will trouble himſelf with the book or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
he may enjoy his liberty. He ſayes the touch mentioned
was in order to healing, but I ſhall rather believe the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
that referres it to bleſſing, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Theſe were infants of ſuch parents, that were in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, as appeares, in that Chriſt</hi> who now was in the
Coaſts of <hi>Judea,</hi> was ſent alone to them of <hi>Judea</hi> in covenant
with God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 24. And was a Miniſter of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 15. And we ſee how facile he was to them, when
his carriage was otherwiſe, and of another ſort: when a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanitiſh
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:55700:205"/>
woman comes for her child, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 26. This further
appeares by that which they requeſted for theſe infants. This
ſeemes to be yielded, <hi>They came</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>to Chriſt upon the
conceit that he was a Prophet, and ſo they might bring children to
him to be bleſſed;</hi> and further ſayes, if this reaſon prove any
thing, it is, that the childrens parents were Jewes, which is
all that we contend for, the Jewes as yet were in Covenant
with God. To this is ſaid, <hi>if it be meant of all the Jewes, and
of the covenant of grace in Chriſt, it is palpably falſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to the Apoſtles determination,</hi> Rom. 9. 7, 8. <hi>I</hi> am
ſure, <hi>Rom,</hi> 9. 3, 4. Proves it to be above all contradiction true,
and that <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8. hath nothing againſt it, I have largely
ſhewed, which is paſt by in ſilence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Theſe infants themſelves were in covenant, and ſtood
in relation to Chriſt, bearing his name, and being of his people; and
were not as heathens in their preſent ſtate without Chriſt; aliens
from the Common-Wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenant
of promiſe.</hi> This is evident by their free admiſſion by Chriſt,
and the reaſon by him given, <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdome of heaven.</hi>
After ſome perſonal reflections which <hi>I</hi> am reſolved to wave, <hi>I</hi>
am told of the often complaint of the uſe of the word covenant,
in ſo various ſenſes, or rather ſometimes none-ſenſe by the Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſts,
and again of their non-ſenſe or proper gibberiſh,
which language <hi>I</hi> reſolve to bear, being the leaſt of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
that herein <hi>I</hi> ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>They were admitted upon a common right equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to all infants of covenanting parents, and not by vertue of
any extraordinary priviledge peculiar to them, and not common to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
This is plaine. 1. By the general admiſſion which he
gives to infants on this occaſion; <hi>ſuffer little children to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me,</hi> and <hi>extraordinarium non facit regulam communem;</hi> Here
is a general rule, all have admiſſion, and therefore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
extraordinary it is objected, <hi>theſe preſent infants onely were
admitted,</hi> but though one ſay it, me thinks another ſhould not be
found to beleeve it, of ſuch little ones is the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
therefore let theſe little ones come, and onely theſe. 2.
It was ſuch a right that the Diſciples of Chriſt ought to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
as plainly appeares by Chriſts ſore diſpleaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
againſt them, for forbidding their admiſſion to him, and
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:55700:206"/>
that muſt be a known right and not ſecret; One indeed ſayes,
<hi>They were not admitted out of any known right common to others, but
a peculiar priviledge as being elected;</hi> for which <hi>Piſcator</hi> is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
when as <hi>Piſcator</hi> ſylogiſtically concludes the contrary.
His evaſion of this argument is very well worthy of animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>The reaſon of Chriſts anger was their hindring him in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
not the knowledge they had of their preſent viſible title, this
is but a dream,</hi> afterwards he ſaith, <hi>the truth is, this thing was done
to theſe infants, not by reaſon of any viſible title they had, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them into any outward Church priviledge, but to accompliſh by
his bleſſing their intereſt in the inviſible Kingdom of God by election.
I</hi> would demand whether the Diſciples did underſtand Chriſts
deſigne, or whether they were bound to know it, or were their
ſinne not to know it; whether they knew theſe infants to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
or whether they were bound to know their election? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe having any ground (election being of the ſecrets
of heaven, and Chriſt had not made known any ſuch deſigne)
Chriſt who condemnes anger without a cauſe as a breach of the
ſixth commandment, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t.</hi> 5. 22. would not himſelf have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
where there could be no ſin the alone juſt ground of anger. It
is now confeſt that the Diſciples of Chriſt ought to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that they were to be admitted; but it was, <hi>either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they heeded not ſome particular intimation of his mind concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe infants, or ſome general truth concerning Chriſts office,
and his readineſſe to do good to all ſorts of perſons, as there was opper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
offered, from which he ought not to be hindred by them,</hi>
when Chriſt himſelf aſſigns an open known reaſon, of ſuch little
ones is the Kingdome of heaven, they that will may heed oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
conjectural reaſons. It is confeſt that elect infants might
be baptized were they known; but in this caſe Chriſt may be as
ſore diſpleaſed at mens non-baptizing elect ones, as he was at
his Diſciples for forbidding the admiſſion of theſe little ones.
And let them take heed upon this account leſt they ſuffer more
from Chriſts diſpleaſure in not admitting elect infants to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
than they can imagine that we ſhall ſuffer in the Baptiſme
of thoſe that are not elected. <hi>I</hi> am told that <hi>I</hi> have <hi>just cauſe
to fear the diſpleaſure of Chriſt for admitting to Baptiſme thoſe that
are neither known to be elect, nor beleevers, but infants of parents,
who are manifeſtly children of the devil, covenant breakers.</hi> If they
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55700:206"/>
be covenant-breakers as is here confeſt, then they are covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
for none out of covenant breakes covenant; and <hi>I</hi> here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that <hi>I</hi> will baptize none of whom <hi>I</hi> have not all aſſurance
that they are the children of God. As to that Adoption which
is to the inheritance of priviledges, as thoſe were,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>They are here admitted by our Saviour Chriſt to a
Church-priviledge, proper to Church-members, the Iſrael of God;</hi>
They are admitted to a bleſſing, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 16. Bleſſing is a
Church-priviledge, <hi>Num.</hi> 6. 22 23, &amp;c. to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>The Lord ſpake unto Moſes ſaying, ſpeak unto Aaron and his
ſonnes, ſaying, on this wiſe ye ſhall bleſſe the children of Iſrael, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto them, the Lord bleſſe thee and keep thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they
ſhall put my Name upon the children of Iſrael, and I will bleſſe them.</hi>
They are therefore admitted to a Church-priviledge; the <hi>Iſrael</hi>
of God are under the bleſſing, little ones are ordered to receive
this bleſſing, little ones therefore are of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The Lords por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is his people, <hi>Jacob</hi> is the lot of his inheritance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 9.
Theſe are the bleſſed of the Lord upon this account, <hi>Jerem.
31. 23. As yet they ſhall uſe this ſpeech in the land of Judah, and
in the Cities thereof, when I ſhall bring again their captivity; The
Lord bleſſe thee O habitation of juſtice, and mountain of holineſſe.</hi>
Children are within this number, they are the heritage of the
Lord, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 127. 3. and conſequently admitted by our Saviour
Chriſt to this priviledge of a bleſſing. The Authour that char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
non-ſenſe and gibberiſh on Paedobaptiſts in general, there
tells his Reader, that my arguing is as though my wits went on
wool-gathering, becauſe <hi>I</hi> was not mindful to put my argument
into an explicite ſylogiſtical form, but now it is done for his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; bleſſing is a priviledge of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.
23. 27. Chriſt admits infants to a bleſſing. Therefore he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them to a priviledge of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God or Church-priviledge.
It is objected that Chriſt admits onely a few, but
it is with a reaſon that gives admiſſion to others of ſuch is the
Kingdome of heaven. A great triumph is made of a ſpeech of
mine, <hi>page</hi> 91. of my anſwer, where I ſay we do not think that
this bleſſing was baptiſing, or that theſe deſired, or that Chriſt
intended their baptiſme; onely we affirme that a <hi>medium</hi> hence
may be taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence we may inferre the right of infants
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:55700:207"/>
to baptiſme; They that are admitted to one Church-priviledg,
may not be denyed another, whereof they are equally capable;
But infants are here admitted and order taken for their admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to one Church-priviledge, of which they are no otherwiſe
capable than of Baptiſme; ſo that here is no direct precedent
for baptiſme in particular, but for Church-priviledges of which
infants are capable. None that are intereſſed in the Church of
Chriſt which is his Kingdome may be denied an admiſſion to it
by Baptiſme. A ground it is, not immediate expreſſe, but by
neceſſary conſequence. Obſervation is made, <hi>Mark this ſpeech,
if [but] be adverſative, then he grants that infants are capable
of Church-priviledges; not of Baptiſme, which overthrowes all
his diſpute.</hi> But that is left out which would fully explaine my
meaning, and wholly take off the force of his reply. This act
of Chriſt is no direct precedent for Baptiſme in particular, but
of Church-priviledges in general. If he can but aſſume and
make good with our <hi>Socinian Antibaptiſts</hi> (who in the parts
where I live, begin to triumph over <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> beating
them down with their own weapons) that Baptiſme is no
Church-priviledge; then <hi>I</hi> ſhall confeſſe, that he hath wreſted
this argument out of my hands, and that this text as to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
falls, otherwiſe it is of force and an undeniable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
I am now told, that, <hi>if this act of Chriſts be a direct
precept</hi> (I intended precedent) <hi>of Church-priviledges in general,
then it is of Baptiſme in particular, being a Church-priviledge, that
which is ſaid of the Genus, being true (as Logicians ſay) of the</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
quicquid praedicatur de genere, praedicatur de ſpecie.
<hi>Whence it followes, he ſpeaks inconſiſtencies.</hi> But he ſhould have
taken in all my words [immediate expreſſe] as well as [direct]
and <hi>I</hi> think he that ſpeakes of the <hi>Genus</hi> doth not immediately,
directly, and expreſly ſpeak of the <hi>ſpecies.</hi> But if it be otherwiſe,
and that herein I was miſtaken, I am here content to retract it,
and confeſſe now, with help of this new light, that there is an
expreſſe, immediate, direct precedent for infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the reaſon given of admiſſion of infants in that
propoſition of Chriſts, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdome of heaven:</hi> We
have 1. The ſubject, <hi>of ſuch.</hi> 2. The predicate or attribute,
<hi>is the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> The particle <hi>ſuch</hi> cannot here have
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:55700:207"/>
reference to their qualification: that thoſe that were qualified as
theſe, in humility, and meekneſſe, had their intereſt; Sheep
and Doves as well as infants, are thus qualified. They are not
proud, nor revengeful. That which the Diſciples took to be an
impediment of force to hinder infants, and a juſt ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
of thoſe that brought them, is that which Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
in this reproof of the Diſciples, and admiſſion of their
infants; But it was their want of growth, their littleneſſe,
which the Diſciples took to be a juſt impediment, and which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
their reproof: So that the particle <hi>[ſuch]</hi> hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
reference to the quantity (as I may ſay) not to the quality
of theſe infants, to their infant-ſtature, or minority not to their
meekneſſe or humility. And ſo it is referred elſe-where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
by our Saviour himſelf; <hi>Who ſo ſhall receive one ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
child,</hi> Matth. 18. 5. the word is the ſame here, and there, it
reſpects littleneſſe therefore, and not meekneſſe. The whole
Text may be thus fitly parathraſed; Trouble not our Maſter
with ſuch as theſe, ſay the Diſciples, there is no uſe of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they need not his cure, and they are not capable of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
they have no infirmity to be healed, no capacity to be
taught; It is fit for men of abler parts, not for infants to make
their addreſſe to him, <hi>Let them come,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>and
let not their infant-age exclude them, how little ſoever they are
capable of the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the predicate or attribute, <hi>the Kingdome of heaven:</hi> This
as is ſaid, is meant of the Kingdome of Glory; and on this hinge
(as is further ſaid) the anſwer to the whole Argument turnes.
The Author therefore aſſumes his affirmation, and ſaith; <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the Kingdome of Heaven to be meant of the Kingdome of
Glory,</hi> and gives his reaſons. To encounter with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
aſſault of his, I ſhall undertake theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>1. To make it appear that the hinge of the whole hangs not
here.</p>
                  <p>2. That in his reaſons given are nothing ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to evince that it muſt be meant of the Kingdome of
Glory.</p>
                  <p>3. That in caſe it were granted him, yet it doth not at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, That all hangs not on this, appeares, in that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
had ſaid enough in his order for admiſſion of theſe infants,
on which we can build our concluſion. Thoſe that are admitted
to Church-priviledges, they are Church-members; But infants are
admitted by our Saviour Chriſt to Church-priviledges, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are Church-members. However Maſter <hi>Tombes</hi> can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the reaſon, yet he cannot deny Chriſts order for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
nor deny that it was a Church-priviledge to which they
are admitted. To illuſtrate it by a parallel. The Apoſtle ſayes,
1 <hi>Cor. 11. 10. The woman ought to have power on her head, becauſe
of the Angels.</hi> The womans duty is there cleare, to be covered
in token of ſubjection, though we do not agree what is meant
by Angels; Whether Angels of Glory, or Gods Miniſters in the
Congregations that are called Angels of Churches; our duty is
as plain to give infants admittance as Church-members, though
the reaſon annext remaines controverted; Whether Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
on Earth, or the Kingdome in Glory be here meant by the
Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For his Reaſons (which though I ſhould yield, the
cauſe is already gained) there is not force in them.</p>
                  <p>1. Saith he, <hi>The Kingdome of God muſt be underſtood,</hi> Mark 10.
14. <hi>as it is</hi> verſ. 15. <hi>and</hi> Luke 18. 16. <hi>as</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>and</hi> Matth. 19.
14. <hi>as it is in both thoſe; This is proved, becauſe our Saviour from
their eſtate, inferres a likeneſſe to them in others for the ſame eſtate,</hi>
Apolog p. 150. This Argument what colour ſoever it carries,
yet it is not concluſive. It may be taken more largely in Chriſts
argumentation, and in a more reſtrained ſenſe in his words of
Inſtruction or Application, as in a place much parallel I ſhall
ſhew, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2. There we have the Apoſtles reproof, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.
and his reaſon, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. as in the Evangeliſts we have Chriſts
aſſertion confirming his reproof, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and his application,
<hi>ver.</hi> 15. Now Saint, in the Apoſtles reproof is taken more larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than it is taken in his reaſon. A viſible Saint is meant in
the firſt place, a real and glorified Saint in the ſecond; viſible
Saints may judge in ſmall matters, for real Saints in glory ſhall
judge the world, ſhall judge Angels; and ſo it may be here,
infants have their preſent title to the viſible Kingdome; and
men qualified as infants, ſhall only enter the Kingdome of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
His ſecond reaſon, that Chriſt directs his ſpeech to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:55700:208"/>
already in the viſible Church, and therefore ſpeaks not of
the Church viſible, I know not how to make up into a reaſon; If
I underſtood it, I would either yield or anſwer it. The third
reaſon, that the ſpeech, <hi>Mark 10. 15 Luke</hi> 18. 17. is like <hi>Mat.</hi>
18. 3, 4. but there it is meant of the Kingdome of Glory; <hi>Ergo,</hi>
ſo here is anſwered already. If <hi>Mark 10. 15. Luke</hi> 18. 17. be
like <hi>Matth.</hi> 18 3, 4. yet <hi>Mark 10. 14. Luke</hi> 18. 16. which we
have in queſtion; is unlike to <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Were it granted him, that the Kingdome of Glory
muſt be underſtood both in Chriſts reaſon and application, yet he
is nothing holpen. Infants have right to the Church viſible mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant,
becauſe they are in a capacity of entrance into the Church
triumphant, <hi>Acts 2. 47. The Lord added to the Church daily ſuch
as ſhould be ſaved;</hi> Not neceſſarily ſaved, but now (having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
Covenant with God) they were in a capacity, and therefore
added as viſible Church-members. Infants ſtanding in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
ought to have admiſſion likewiſe. It is ſaid, <hi>that if this
propoſition were granted, that they have right to the Church viſible
militant who ſhall be of the Church triumphant, yet this right can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be claimed but by thoſe who are elect, and therefore from theſe
Scriptures ſo expounded, it cannot be proved that any other than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
infants are to be baptized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If election or non-election muſt ſteere us in admiſſion
to Baptiſme this were to purpoſe interpoſed, but when there is
nothing that can be objected againſt them as hindring their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
it is ſufficiently proved that it may not hinder their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.
That muſt not be pleaded againſt any as a barre to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their admiſſion into the Church on earth that will not hinder
their admiſſion into the Church in heaven.</p>

                  <p>HAving already ſo largely inſiſted upon by Scripture proofs,
that children are in covenant with parents, and that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of Ordinances (which neceſſarily imply a covenant) do

themſelves the concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This is of the nature of thoſe things which deſcend from
Parent to childe, from Anceſtors to Poſterity, which is in their
power to convey to their iſſue. There are thoſe things indeed
which are perſonally inherent in men, and proper to them, ſo
that they cannot convey them to their iſſue; there is no deriving
of them to others by ſucceſſion. As, 1. Individual accidents
of the body, wounds, ſcarres, or comelineſſe of feature, theſe
are ſo in the Parent, that they are not conveyed to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
2. Habits, or proper gifts; whether acquired by pains,
or infuſed. The ſon of a learned man inherits not his fathers
gifts; The ſon of an Artificer is no ſuch Artiſt; The ſon of a
Prophet hath not by vertue of birth the gift of prophecy; nor
is the ſon of a regenerate man endowed with ſaving grace for
that reaſon.</p>
                  <p>There are on the contrary thoſe things that paſſe from Parent
to childe, which the Parent by nature or ſpecial priviledge hath
power to convey. As, 1. The eſſential or integral part of a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
with the natural properties that do accompany it; ſo one
brute beaſt brings forth another, one brid brings for another, and
man brings forth one of mankind. 2. The priviledges or burdens,
which in Family or Nation are hereditary, they are conveyed from
Parents to Poſterity, from Anceſtors to their iſſue; As is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo is the child, as reſpecting theſe particulars. This none have
queſtioned, and theſe things in hand being of the ſame nature,
it is a faire propable ground of it ſelf (if evidence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be ſold unto thee, thou ſhalt not
compel him to ſerve as a bond-ſervant, but as an hired ſervant, and
as a ſojourner he ſhall be with thee, and ſhall ſerve thee unto the year

<hi>Root and Branch, Parent and childe are ſervants of God; As

are heterogeneal, and reſpective to Church-relation in the moſt
oppoſite condition: the Parent in the Kingdom of God by vertue
of the faith that he profeſſes: the childe in the Kingdome of
Satan by reaſon of his non-intereſt in the Promiſe, and want of
title to Covenant-relation. But Scripture makes them ſtill as
one, Jewes children are Jewes by nature, Gentiles children are
ſinners, that is, Gentiles by nature. The Root being holy, the
Branches are holy; Parents not ſanctified, children are unclean;
but Parents being ſanctified, they are holy.</p>

then the moſt godly of Parents bring up children; not in

to God, but at beſt in an hopeful expectation of it. They
bring not forth children to God, but at beſt they have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires

no ſuch example in all Scripture of a parent in covenant, train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the ſeed of their bodies for a covenant. No one in all
New Teſtament-Scripture, ever bred up a childe in yeares to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize
him, no more than in Old Teſtament-Scriptures they bred
their children to circumciſe them; we read of many baptized in
years, but we read of none borne of Chriſtian parents, kept till
yeares of diſcretion to be baptized.—</p>
                  <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Infants out of covenant ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording to Scripture-grounds are without hope of ſalvation.</note> If children be not received into covenant with

ſome have riſen up againſt this Argument with high cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
though hitherto with feeble, or rather no reaſons, I
ſhall ſomewhat more enlarge my ſelf in confirmation of it. That
which the prime authours of, and chiefeſt ſticklers for, the non-federation
of infants freely confeſſe, which the general conſent
of their adverſaries (Proteſtant Writers) unanimouſly upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
grounds conclude, that the preſent Patrons can maintain
with nothing but clamours, and ſuch reaſons (improved to the
higheſt) which will equally conclude the hopes of the greateſt
Drunkards, Idolaters, Adulterers, Heathens; that muſt be taken
for an Argument of force, and a reaſon concluſive this cannot be
denyed; But ſo it is here, as I ſhall make good in ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>1. Thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jeſuites our leading adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries confeſſe it.</note> that have ſtood up againſt
Infants covenant-holineſſe, do confeſſe that all infants going out
of the world as they came into the world, in that eſtate periſh,
and ſo have provided a chamber in hell, which they call by the
name of <hi>Limbus Infantum,</hi> and now ſince their <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi>
by Chriſts death is made empty by the fetching out all that were
there in expectation of him, and the number of infants thus dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
increaſing, it is ſaid by ſome that theſe two are laid together:
howſoever it falls out with theſe places about which we have no
reaſon to buſie our ſelves, this poſition that infants thus dying
without any covenant, or Church-intereſt, do periſh, followes as
directly from their principles as any concluſion from its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                  <p>2. Proteſtant Divines who aſſert Infant-ſalvation,<note place="margin">Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
no ſuch diviſion of hell into chambers, and have other
thoughts of the condition of Infants, ſtill bring this intereſt of
theirs in the covenant of God as their ground, (not prying into
the ſecrets of Election, nor urging prerogative above that which
is written) the covenant of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. confirmed by the
New Teſtament-Scriptures before mentioned. They very well
know, that in caſe Papiſts can wreſt this covenant-intereſt of
infants from them, they conclude according to Scripture-ground
their damnation: <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, there were daily added to the
Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved, namely to the Church viſible,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:55700:212"/>
as the Text is clear, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 47. Now if they ſtand not admitible
into the Church, they ſtand without hope of ſalvation; ſee how
the Apoſtle joynes theſe together, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 12. Without Chriſt,
being aliens from the Common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſtrangers from
the Covenants of Promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the
world.</hi> If any can conclude againſt the intereſt of any in the
Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, the Church of God, and
the covenants of promiſe (which thoſe do that will have them
to be no Church-members, nor to be taken into covenant with
Parents) they ſadly doome them to be <hi>without Chriſt, without
God, without Hope.</hi> Thoſe that diſclaime <hi>Zuinglius</hi> his opinion,
that <hi>Hercules, Socrates, Ariſtides, Numa,</hi> and ſuch like Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
are now in heaven; would be deſired to ſhew how they
caſt thoſe out, upon that account as Heathens, and take in infants
as great ſtrangers (according to them) to any Church-intereſt.
Infants want not ſin for condemnation; our firſt Original
eſtate being a corrupt eſtate, and by nature children of wrath,
and putting them out of covenant, they can finde no Scripture-way
to entitle them to Chriſt for redemption; They ſeeme to
conceive other hopes of the ſalvation of infants of Heathens,
that upon the ſame ground they may be charitable to the infants
of Chriſtians, that with them are in the ſame poſture with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
when they ſpeak of <hi>Hercules</hi> and other Heathens as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
yet ſpeaking of the infants of Heathens, they ſay, <hi>It is
bad to ſay, that God doth not ſave ſome of the infants of Indians</hi> pro
bene placito, <hi>according to his good pleaſure.</hi> For any warrant we
can finde in Scripture, it is as bad to ſay it of the parent as of the
childe. The Scriptures leave the whole of the Family, root
and branch under the fury and wrath of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Jeremiah 10. 25.
Pſal.</hi> 79. 6.<note place="margin">Our preſent adverſaries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reaſons oppoſe onely comers againſt it.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The preſent Patrons of this non-federation of infants, can
maintaine their ſalvation with nothing but clamours, and ſuch
reaſons improved to the higheſt, that equally conclude the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the greateſt drunkards, adulterers, idolaters, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;
I ſhall now purpoſely for peace ſake paſſe by thoſe high
clamors and bitter invectives that we meet with on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and come to take notice of the reaſons produced, to exempt
infants from this doom of condemnation, and all that I can find
is one and the ſame thing to fly for refuge to prerogative; <hi>This
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:55700:212"/>
is my judgement</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>that God will have us to ſuſpend our
judgment of this matter, and Reſt on the Apoſtles determination,</hi>
Rom. 9. 18. For ſatisfaction of which I need to adde no more
than what I have ſaid, <hi>page</hi> 15. of my Anſwer, ſeeing it reſts, &amp; not
one word yet replied to it. The Text of Scripture (which we
have over and over) is, <hi>that God will have mercy on whom he will
have mercy,</hi> telling his adverſary, <hi>that it is bad to ſay that God doth
not ſave</hi> pro bene placito, which no adverſary of his will deny,
But God is pleaſed in his Word to make known the way of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
of his mercy, otherwiſe the vileſt perſon againſt whom
in our miniſterial way, we denounce Gods judgments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may reply
that his hope of ſalvation is as good as the beſt, for God ſaves <hi>ex
bene placito,</hi> and hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and
the beſt ſoul, in a caſe of diſertion, will take off all his applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of comfort, with the cloſe of that Scripture, <hi>And whom he will
he hardeneth,</hi> Rom. 9. 18. And ſo the Jews even in their rejection,
(of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks ſo largely,) being cut off by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
might have pleaded their hope of ſalvation, as well as in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
condition; we muſt therefore not look to the ſecret Will
of God, of which no reaſon can be given, but his good pleaſure;
but into his revealed Will, where he is pleaſed to make known the
diſpenſation of this will and good pleaſure of his, and ſo we ſhall
learn not to carry our hopes beyond his promiſe. To that Text of

other New Teſtament-Ordinance whatſoever. Suppoſe a man of
20, 25, 30, 40, 50. years of age ſeeketh Baptiſm. According to this
rule, he muſt bring a preſcript for one of this age to be baptized,
and the ſame alſo for the Lords Supper. But it is replied, <hi>Beleevers
of any age may be baptized, beleeve, and the age is not regarded.</hi> This
will be eaſily yielded, if they be not already baptized, but then the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:55700:214"/>
inſtitution with limit to Infancy is waved; and upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Church-Members in Covenant of any age, ought to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized,
and ſo the inſtitution is not in queſtion about that there is
an agreement. But whether Infants be in Covenant, or whether
they be any Church-Members, is to be diſputed, which already is
ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>2. I ſay thoſe words of our Saviour. <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Diſciple all
Nations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Infants are within the verge of the inſtitution of Baptiſme.</note> 
                     <hi>baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> do comprize Infants in them as well
as men of years; Infants ſerving to make up a Nation as well as
Parents. The Infants of <hi>Nineveh</hi> did make a conſiderable party
of the City of <hi>Nineveh.</hi> The Infants of any Nation make up a
part of the Nation, and the Nation where they came was to be
diſcipled, and baptized. And that Infants are here comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
farther appears by this Argument.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame ſenſe and latitude as Nation was taken in reſpect
of the Covenant of God, when the Covenant and Covenant-initiating
Sacrament was reſtrained to that one onely Nation,
where the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r commiſſion was firſt limited; In the ſame ſenſe it is
to be taken (unleſſe the Text expreſſe the contrary) now the
commiſſion is enlarged. This cannot be denyed of any that will
have the Apoſtles to be able to know Chriſts meaning, by his
words in this enlarged commiſſion: But Nation then (as is
confeſſed) did comprehend all in the Nation in reſpect of the
Covenant, and nothing is expreſſed in the Text to the contrary;
therefore it is to be taken in that latitude to comprehend Infants.
This Argument hath ſtrength from that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts 3.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>5. Yea are the children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which
God made with our fathers, ſaying unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>and in thy ſeed
ſhall all the kindreds of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> As it was with the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of <hi>Abraham</hi> in reſpect of Covenant-holineſſe; ſo it is with
all kindreds of the earth, they joyntly make one party in the
Covenant But Infants of <hi>Abrahams</hi> kindred were in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and of the Nation, in reſpect of Covenant-bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But it will be ſaid, that</hi> an exception of Infants is implied, in that
all of the Nation muſt be diſcipled before they be baptized: But In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
are not capable of being diſcipled; and ſo they are made unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. 1. Here is implied that they are of capacity to be
Diſciples, in that Chriſt ſends to diſciple Nations, and they ſerve
to make up the Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="413" facs="tcp:55700:214"/>
2. It is the way of Scripture-ſpeaking of an univerſality of a
people in a Land, expreſſely to except Infants in caſe they be to be
excepted, as we ſee in the judgement that befell <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
to the cutting off of thoſe that came out of the Land of
<hi>Egypt, Numb.</hi> 14. 38. And in the Covenant entered by the body
of the Nation of all degrees and ſexes at their returne from
<hi>Babylon, Nehem.</hi> 10. 28. and an exception could be no where
more uſeful and neceſſary than there; to let us know that it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
with Gentiles in this particular, then it was with the
Jewes, that the Nations where their commiſſion thus enlarged,
were herein differenced from the Nation to which their Miniſtry
was firſt limited.</p>
                  <p>3. Let that Text of the Prophet be well weighed, where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Spirit of Prophecy of the rejection of the Jewes, and
the glorious call of the Gentiles in their ſtead (in that ample way
as it is there ſet out) he hath theſe words: <hi>Behold, I will lift up
my hand to the Gentiles, and ſet up my ſtandard to the people, and
they ſhall bring thy ſonnes in their armes, and thy daughters ſhall be
carried upon their ſhoulders,</hi> Iſa. 49. 22. If there were but ſuch an
hint as that, by way of Prophecy, to have left them behinde, we
ſhould from ſome, have heard of it with a noiſe.</p>
                  <p>4. In the Lord Chriſts own Dialect,<note place="margin">Infans are Diſciples.</note> who is beſt able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
his own meaning, they are Diſciples. To belong to Chriſt
is to be a Diſciple of Chriſt. This is plaine from our Saviours
own mouth, comparing his words recorded in <hi>Matthew</hi> and in
<hi>Mark, To give a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple,</hi>
it is in the one, <hi>Matth. 10. 42. To give a cup of water to
drinke in my name, becauſe ye belong to me,</hi> it is in the other,
<hi>Mark</hi> 9. 41. To belong to Chriſt, to be a Diſciple of Chriſt,
and to bear the name of Chriſt is one and the ſame thing with
our Saviour. Now that infants are of the number of thoſe who
as Diſciples in Chriſts account do belong to him, and bear his
name, is yet farther plaine by another Text of Saint <hi>Matthew,
Matth.</hi> 18. 5. where Chriſt ſetting a little childe in the midſt of
his hearers, ſaith, <hi>Whoſo ſhall receive one ſuch little childe in my
name, receiveth me.</hi> By all which it appeares, that which is done
to Infants, is done to Diſciples, &amp; hath a glorious reward as done
to Diſciples. Infants therefore are Diſciples of Chriſt, are of
thoſe that do belong unto him, and beare his name: Who then
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:55700:215"/>
is not afraid to refuſe them who will receive Chriſt? Who will
not baptize them that is willing to baptize Diſciples in the name
of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>For that part of the objection,<note place="margin">The invalidity of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that we have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſme examined.</note> that there is no example in New
Teſtament-Scripture on infant-Baptiſme. I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For an example of Baptiſme with limit to any one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
number of years, or dayes; we have but one that I know (if
that) in Scripture, and that is of Chriſt, who was (as is computed)
about the age of thirty, when he was baptized, if this be preſt
and followed, all muſt at that alone be for Baptiſme, and no other
of any age may be baptized.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are many things of which we make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
and yet we have no example of them: I have inſtanced in the
trial of the ſuſpected wife by the water of jealouſie, that there is
no example for it in all the Old Teſtament-Scripture; and for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
receiving of the Lords Supper, there is not a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
or any particular expreſſe precedent for it in the New
Teſtament; They cannot give us any inſtance of any one trained
up by believing Parents for Baptiſme, and aſſoon as he could
give an account, baptized; not one childe of a Beleever brought
up for covenant, and not in covenant. One goes about to give
inſtance of particular precedents for womens receiving the Lords
Supper. 2. And inſtead of a precedent urges, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28.
as an expreſſe command in formal termes for women, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
comprehending both Sexes. To this I have replied in my anſwer,
<hi>pag.</hi> 52. We are then furniſhed with an expreſſe command in
termes as formal, and with an example to boo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of womens cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion;
and ſo the difference between circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
(ſo often laid in the diſh of Paedobaptiſts) here falls to the
ground; <hi>Ye on the Sabbath-day do circumciſe,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>a man,</hi>

                     <hi>a man on the Sabbath-day receive circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
that the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>ſhould not be broken,</hi> John 7. 23.
Here is <hi>Moſes</hi> his command, the Jewes practice, with Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
in the ſame comprehenſive latitude in regard of both
Sexes, as in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper. And if arguments borrowed from Grammer uſe of
words, be of that force; you ſee what they have proved, As
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is taken in one Sacrament, ſo it is to be taken in another:
But in the Sacrament of circumciſion it is limited to the male on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:55700:215"/>
to which accords that Logick rule; <hi>Omne analogum stans
per ſe, ſtat pro famoſiori analogato.</hi> To this is replyed that the
ſubject matter of the command as well as the Grammar uſe of
the word, proves females to be included, but then his expreſſe
formal command is loſt, they are not expreſt, but included, and
by conſequence onely, which will not be denied. He farther ſayes,
<hi>that</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 17. <hi>is an expreſſe command in formal termes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
receiving the Lords Supper; we being many, are one bread,
and one body, for we are partakers of one bread.</hi> I demand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the perſon of Chriſtians, or in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of women? not of women ſure, for he takes in himſelf, and
he was a man, and then the formality of an expreſſe Example
falls. He brings <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. that <hi>the Diſciples on the firſt day of
the week came together to break bread.</hi> Here is an example as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
and formal, as the former. They cannot infallibly prove
by help of conſequence, much leſſe expreſſely, that there was
a woman there. At that night-meeting there might be none but
men, as at the firſt inſtitution. It can never be an expreſſe
example till it be made to appear that none are Diſciples but
women.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The examples that we have of a whole houſhold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
baptized; if ſome had them in hand, would be ſufficiently
formal; but any thing will ſerve as an expreſſe proof, when they
have a mind to affirme it, and nothing will ſerve to evince it by
conſequence, when they have a mind to deny it. But as Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are women, ſo families have children. There are Families
without children, and there are Diſciples there are not women.
The commiſſion is to diſciple Nations, and baptize them. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath happily ordered that Nations have been brought
in, and their Infants received to Baptiſme. In the Primitive times
houſholds were baptized, without mention of excluſion of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
in after-ages houſholds have come in with their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Infants want of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, no impediments of their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme.</note> It is yet objected, <hi>Men must believe and be baptized,</hi>
Mark 16. 16. <hi>Repent and be baptized,</hi> Acts 2. 39. Infants can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beleeve, nor repent, therefore they may not be baptized;
and will it not as directly follow, that when they can neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
nor repent, they muſt be damned; let them frame an anſwer
to the one, and then they have anſwered both; That which will
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:55700:216"/>
ſpeak for them to receive them into heaven (notwithſtanding
thoſe Scriptures that threaten condemnation to men in unbelief
and impenitency,) will ſpeak alſo, to receive them into the Church
by Baptiſme.<note place="margin">The want of thoſe expreſſe words, Infants ought to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized is no impediment of their Baptiſme.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Some ſay, <hi>Where is it ſaid in ſo many words, infants
muſt be baptized? Bring us thoſe words, we abhorre ſyllogiſmes and
conſequences.</hi> To deale with them with their owne weapons;
Where is it ſaid that Infants muſt not be baptized, where are
thoſe words written? if they care not for our conſequences, we
ſhall not care for theirs. They have anſwered. <hi>Negatives can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be proved.</hi> To this we anſwer. 1. Where is that ſaid? we
finde it no where in Scripture, that <hi>Negatives</hi> cannot be proved.
2. Chriſt proved <hi>Negatives,</hi> That himſelf was not a Spirit; <hi>A
Spirit hath not fleſh and bones, as you ſee me have,</hi> Luke 24. 39.
That God was not to be tempted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 7. 3. if <hi>Negatives</hi>
cannot be proved, then <hi>Negatives</hi> are not to be believed, ours
is an <hi>Affirmative</hi> which they yield may be proved, theirs, is a
<hi>Negative</hi> which they ſay cannot be proved, we then have
the better of it, there is hope of proof on our ſide, theirs is
deſperate.</p>
                  <p>To help the Reader in a word for the neceſſity of conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:<note place="margin">Neceſſity of Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</note>
If thoſe be fools that cannot gather conſequences from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
to ſettle their faith upon them, then much more thoſe
that deny them; But ſuch are fooles by our Saviours own teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
that cannot gather conſequences from Scripture to
ſettle their faith on them, <hi>Luke 24. 25, 26. O fools and ſlow of heart
to beleeve all that the Prophets have ſpoken, ought not Chriſt to have
ſuffered theſe things, and to have entred into his glory?</hi> Thoſe were
fools and dullards that did not beleeve from the Scriptures of
the Prophets, that Chriſt muſt ſuffer and enter unto glory. But
thoſe words are no where in expreſſe words written: It is alone
by conſequence from the Prophets words that we know them.
Somewhat I have ſpoken to thoſe that reaſon in this ſort,
leſt they ſhould be wiſe in their own conceit, I will have no
more to deal with them, leſt I be thought to be like them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Antiquity is for Infant-Baptiſme.</note> There is a great flouriſh made by ſome, as though An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
were againſt Infant-Baptiſme, and famous flouriſhing
Churches never received it: In which ſome have taken much
pains, but never did men travel in a buſineſſe to leſſe purpoſe,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:55700:216"/>
as all may ſee that will take the pains to read what they have
wrote, and bring it home to that which lies upon their hand to
prove, which is, that Infant-Baptiſme is not ancient, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that there were ſome ages of the Church in which it was
not in uſe. In all of which ſearch of theirs and help that they
have found from the greateſt Antiquaries of the <hi>Socinian</hi> party,
no friends to the Baptiſm of infants, they cannot finde one Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of any kinde whatſoever, or whereſoever, from the day that
<hi>John</hi> baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and in <hi>Aenon</hi> near <hi>Salom</hi> to this very
year, that hath ſaid, and left on record, <hi>That there was no ſuch
cuſtome as Infant-Baptiſm in his dayes;</hi> and when ſo many have
expreſſely affirmed that the original, was from the Apoſtles, and
that no beginning of it in the Church can be found, till ſome one
appear in contradiction to aſſert the non-uſage of it in his time,
let any indifferent Reader judge to what purpoſe all ſerves that
can be ſaid. The primitive times had not muſical inſtruments in
their congregations, they had not Altars, Images, they erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not Temples to Saints, this we hear from Writers in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ages, and in caſe they had not infant-Baptiſm (when the
Church of the Jewes had infant-circumciſion, and the ancient,
made Baptiſme to ſucceed circumciſion) and never any one men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
their non-uſage of it, or give any reaſon concerning it, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a wonder, the prime argument to render this practice to be
of lower ſtanding, than is pretended, is the ſilence of ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of ancient, who times in their workes (as is ſaid) do not
mention it, as <hi>Ignatius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Athanaſius,
Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius, if it had been known in their times, why
do they not once mention it?</hi> To this, much might be ſaid. 1. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Writer doth not treat of all Subjects, nor deal in all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſome have written in our age, and infant-Baptiſm is not
found in all their Writings, ſhall after-ages infer upon their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
that infant-Baptiſme was not uſed in our times? 2. If ſome
Writers do not mention it, yet others in the ſame time, or neer
about, ſpeak fully to it. 3. Maſter <hi>Marſhal</hi> full proofs of it,
in ſeveral of the Authors that are ſaid to be ſilent in it, as <hi>Clemens
Alexandrinus, Athanaſius,</hi> and that in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that doth
neceſſarily imply it. And thoſe that minde farther ſatisfaction
of his Objections, drawn from the Queſtions put to the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and the delay of Baptiſme by ſome, they may finde it in his
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:55700:217"/>
Anſwer, and if he ingenuouſly confeſſed, that he craved the help
of ſome learned Antiquaries, it ſpeakes but little ingenuity in
thoſe that once and again upbraid him for it. I have put to the
adverſaries ſeven Queries concerning the practice of antiquity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Infant-Bapti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me, with ſome Obſervations alſo about it, in
my Anſwer of his Letter, <hi>page</hi> 3. to the tenth, which I thought
might give ſome ſatisfaction to all that which hath been ſpoke
to this thing, but have received no anſwer; It is ſaid by one that
the determination mentioned by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ſo farre as he can finde
by ſearch, is the ſpring-head of infant-Baptiſme, which upon
challenge made, he thus explaines. <hi>I did not deny that I found
infant-Baptiſm practiſed before, but that the determination of that
Councel was the ſpring-head that is the firſt determined rule or
Canon, by force of which, it hath ſince continued in a ſtream, and
this is true.</hi> It ſeemes the River had runne ſome hundreds of
years before the ſpring-head brake forth, but not in ſuch a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
as a determinate rule or Canon, when it is well known that
infant-Baptiſme was not in that Councel of 66 Biſhops at all agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
much leſſe determined; It was not put to the Queſtion,
but taken for granted by all that were preſent. The diſpute and
the determination was upon that which <hi>Fidus</hi> queſtioned, which
was the Baptiſme of infants before eight dayes old, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſme;
how could he mean that it hath ſince continued
in a ſtreame, by vertue of that determination or Canon, when he
very well knowes there was neither determination nor Canon
upon it, nor yet any need of it? They determined that which
in their meeting was put to the Vote, that an infant under
eight dayes might be baptized. So that this Quaere, as
all the reſt, ſtands unſatisfied, and antiquity cleared for
infant-Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>It is yet farther ſaid,<note place="margin">Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that many learned men in former and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times, take infant-Baptiſme onely for an unwritten traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
giving us a liſt of Popiſh Writers that have ſpoke to this
purpoſe, <hi>a Cardinal in a Popiſh Councel,</hi> Bennus, Bellarmine <hi>and</hi>
Eraſmus <hi>that had ſcarce ſtept over the threſhold from them:</hi> To
which we anſwer, That it is no marvel, if theſe making it their
buſineſſe to parallel unwritten Traditions with Scriptures, ſome
of them to preferre them before them, and knowing infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
to be in honour in all Churches, do pin it upon unwritten
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:55700:217"/>
Tradition, that ſo they may advance the honour of unwritten
Tradition with it, yet even theſe cite Scriptures for it, and ſo
marre their own market of Traditions, as thoſe that procure them
are forced to acknowledge. When <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would argue the
Scriptures imperfection, and aſſert a neceſſity of unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
then he can affirme that infant-Baptiſme, hath no other
foundation, but when he will defend infant-Baptiſme againſt
thoſe that matter not Tradition, he can finde Scripture for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation:
Foreſeeing this Objection an Anſwer is brought out
of <hi>Bennus, That ſome things may be proved out of Scripture, when
the true ſenſe of Scripture is evident; and infant-Baptiſme is proved
from</hi> John 3. 5. <hi>but the ſenſe whereby to prove it is manifeſt by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
Becan. Manual. <hi>lib. 1. cap. 2. ſect.</hi> 24. It is very well
known that theſe Jeſuites will ſay as much of any point of Faith,
and leave the whole meaning of all Scripture to reſt on the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
interpretation, continued by tradition. As to the quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Proteſtant Authors, ſo many of them as have kept up the
honour of Scripture, and made no defection from that way, it
onely ſpeakes their boldneſſe to affirme that any of them ever
diſhonoured infant-Baptiſme in that way, as to ſettle it upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
tradition, or to fixe it on ſuch a bottome. They very
well know, that, as they defend the Scriptures full perfection,
and make it their buſineſſe to oppoſe all that would, have it ek't
out by any thing that is unwritten, ſo, they aſſert infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
on Scripture-foundation. Can they think that they have
to deal with ſuch weak adverſaries, that whiles againſt their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they contend with Scripture-Arguments, that infants ought
to be baptized, they will yield up the cauſe on the other hand to
Papiſts, and confeſſe the inſufficiency of Scriptures. But the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monymie

nor the examples of ſuch practice there delivered, though the
grounds, reaſons, and cauſes of the neceſſity of ſuch practice be there
contained, and the benefit or good that followeth it. Of this ſort is
the Baptiſme of infants, which is therefore named a tradition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not expreſſely delivered in Scripture that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
did baptize infants, nor any expreſſe precept there found

                  <p>THe ſeveral minor propoſitions, in the ſyllogiſmes before laid
down, being proved at large, in the foregoing diſcourſe. So
that nothing more needs to be added, yet if there be no neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
connexion, between the covenant, and the ſeale, the major
propoſitions, will yet be called into queſtion. Though it be
granted, that infants be Church-members, are in covenant,
have the promiſes, are Saints, are in the boſome of the Church by
birth-priviledge, are children of the Kingdome, &amp;c. Yet it
will be ſaid (though moſt unreaſonably) that they are not yet to be
baptized, I ſhall therefore 1. Bring Scripture proofes for the
real connexion between the covenant and the ſeale, clearing thoſe
Scriptures from exceptions taken againſt them. 2. I ſhall make
it good with arguments or reaſons. 3. I ſhall returne anſwer to
objections brought againſt that which is here aſſerted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That all in covenant, are to enjoy the initial ſeal of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
let the words of God himſelf, in the inſtitution of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
be conſidered,</hi> Gen. 17. 7, 9, 10, 11, 14. I will eſtabliſh
my covenant, between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, in their
generations, for an everlaſting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and
to thy ſeed after thee. Thou ſhalt keep my covenant therefore, thou,
and thy ſeed after thee, in their generations. This is my covenant
which ye ſhall keep, between me and you, and thy ſeed after thee, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man-child among you ſhall be circumciſed, and ye ſhall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
the fleſh of your foreskinne, and it ſhall be a token of the covenant
betwixt me and you. And the uncircumciſed man-child, whoſe fleſh
of his foreskin is not circumciſed, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from his
people. <hi>Here we ſee 1. A covenant entered. 2. A ſeal appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as the Apoſtle,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. <hi>calls it. 3. The neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
between the ſeal and covenant declared. They are to be
circumcised, becauſe they are in covenant, Having intereſt in the
covenant. They have together with it, intereſt in the initial
ſeal, againſt this is objected.</hi>

                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:55700:219"/>
Firſt, <hi>All the force of this proof hangs on the particle [therefore,]</hi>
verſe 9. <hi>and may be rendared; And thou, or, but thou, as well as,
thou therefore, and is by others rendered.</hi> Tu autem, <hi>and</hi> Tu ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,
<hi>which are neither of them illative termes.</hi> 1. We have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but that it may be an illative as well as a copulative, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an illative particle, he hath no exception againſt the ſtrength
of it. 2. I deny, that all the force of the proof hangs on that
particle; look farther on into <hi>verſe 10. This is my covenant, which
ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy ſeed after thee; every man-childe
among you ſhall be circumciſed,</hi> and take in with it <hi>Acts 7. 8.
And he gave him the covenant of circumciſion; And ſo</hi> Abraham
<hi>begat</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and circumciſed him the eighth day, &amp;c.</hi> and let them
at more leiſure finde an anſwer to this argument. That which
God himſelf calls by the name of a covenant, ought not to be
ſeparated from it: But God calls circumciſion by the name of a
covenant, <hi>Ergo</hi> they ought not to be ſeparated. 2. Let them
conſider the relation in which the Apoſtle puts this Sacrament
of circumciſion to the covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. An inſtituted
appointed ſigne and ſeale, is not to be divided from that which
it ſignifies and ſeales, circumciſion was an inſtituted appointed
ſigne and ſeale of the covenant; therefore it is not to be divided
from it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is ſaid, <hi>If it were granted, that [therefore] is the
beſt reading; yet that the inference,</hi> verſe 9. <hi>ſhould be made from the
Promiſe only,</hi> verſe 7. <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed after thee,
and not as well, if not rather from the Promiſe,</hi> verſe 8. <hi>of giving to
him and his ſeed the land of</hi> Canaan; <hi>I finde no ſufficient reaſon
given.</hi> This reference engages the adverſary, 1. In a contradiction
to himſelf, who ſayes elſewhere, <hi>the promiſe of the Goſpel was
confirmed to</hi> Abraham <hi>by the ſigne of circumciſion.</hi> He alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
that it was a mixt covenant, made up of ſpiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
mercies, and then it muſt take in the ſpiritual as well as the
temporal Promiſe. All that know the nature of covenants, and
uſe of Seales, know that the Seale ratifies all that the covenant
containes: But the covenant (according to him) contained not
barely the promiſe of the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
muſt carry it farther than the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> 2. It
engages him in a contradiction to the Apoſtle, who makes cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
a ſigne and ſeale, not alone of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but <hi>of
the righteouſneſſe of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="424" facs="tcp:55700:220"/>
Thirdly, It is ſaid, <hi>But if it were yielded, that the inference were
made peculiarly from the Promiſe,</hi> verſe 7. <hi>to be a God to</hi> Abraham
<hi>and his ſeed; it must be proved that every Believers Infant childe is</hi>
Abrahams <hi>ſeed, afore it be proved that the Promiſe belongs to them.</hi>
It muſt either be proved that they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or have
the priviledge of the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which from <hi>Geneſis
9. 27. Rom.</hi> 11. 17. is ſufficiently proved, eſpecially being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by thoſe Texts that carry the covenant in Goſpel-times
to the iſſue. And for his exception that the <hi>covenant was not
made to every childe of</hi> Abraham, though it were true, yet it
would not ſerve his purpoſe, provided, that we in Goſpel-times are
under the ſame covenant as was <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to whom the promiſes were
made, If ſome of <hi>Abrahams</hi> children were left out, that concerns
not us, ſo that we are taken in; yet the inſtance is very weak to
prove it. <hi>As appeares</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>verſe 19. concerning Iſhmael,</hi>
and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 9. that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was himſelf in covenant, though
not eſtabliſhed in covenant, (as God there, and <hi>verſe</hi> 21. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
concerning <hi>Iſaac</hi>) not his ſeed never received, appeares
not alone by the ſigne and ſeale which he received, <hi>verſe</hi> 23.
which yet is ſufficient (for God to ſeale to a blanke is very
ſtrange; to ſigne a covenant to a man never in covenant) but
alſo from <hi>Gal. 4. 30. What ſaith the Scripture? Caſt out the bond-woman
and her ſonne, for the ſonne of the bond-woman ſhall not be heir
with the ſonne of the free-woman.</hi> A man caſt out of covenant,
was before caſting out, in covenant; Ejection ſuppoſes admiſſion,
unleſſe we will give way to our Authors dreame of Ejection by
non-admiſſion. He was caſt out after the time of the ſolemnity
of his admiſſion by circumciſion, as may be ſeen, <hi>Gen,</hi> 22. For
that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 9. it is a myſtery what he will make of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he will conclude, that becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> ſojourned in the
land of Promiſe, that therefore none were in covenant that were
not taken into that land; ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> will be found out
of covenant.</p>
                  <p>It is further ſaid, <hi>As for a viſible Church-ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>that
is neither his ſeed by nature, nor by ſaving faith, nor by excellency,
in whom the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, to wit, Chriſt;
I know none ſuch in Scripture, therefore ſome men have fancied ſuch
a kind of Church-ſeed, as it is called.</hi> I know not how ſaving faith
comes in, when a faith of profeſſion will ſerve the turne; The
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:55700:220"/>
whole of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed had circumciſion as a ſeale of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
of faith, when many of their Parents had no more than
a faith of profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Were all theſe things yielded, yet the Propoſition</hi> (as
is ſaid) <hi>would not be made good from hence.</hi> All theſe we ſee are
made good againſt his exceptions. Let us now ſee the ſtrength
which is reſerved for the laſt puſh, for overthrow of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
<hi>The inference is not concerning title or right of infants to the
initial ſeale, as if the covenant or promiſe of it ſelf did give that;
but the inference is concerning</hi> Abrahams <hi>duty, that therefore he
ſhould be the more engaged to circumciſe his poſterity.</hi> This ſhould
rather have been left to us for the ſtrengthening of our propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than have made uſe of it himſelf for refutation of it. It
was <hi>Abrahams</hi> duty to give them according to Gods command
the initial Seale: in this we are agreed: whether it will thence
follow that they had right and title to it, or were without right,
let the Reader determine.</p>
                  <p>It is further ſaid, <hi>He was engaged to circumciſe onely thoſe that
are males, and not afore eight dayes, and not onely thoſe that were
from himſelf, but alſo, all in his houſe whoſe children ſoever they
were, which apparently ſhewes that the giving Circumciſion was not
commenſurate to the perſons intereſt in the Covenant, but was to be
given to perſons as well out of the Covenant as in; If of Abrahams
houſe, and not to all that were in the Covenant; to wit Females, which
doth clearly prove that right to the initiall Seale, as it is called, of
circumciſion, did not belong to perſons by vertue of the covenant, but
by force of the command.</hi> If it could be proved that <hi>Abraham</hi> kept
Idolaters in his houſe, profeſſedly worſhipping a falſe god, and
gave circumciſion to them in that faith and way of falſe worſhip;
it would prove that a man might have the ſeale, and not be in
covenant; but it would not prove that he might be in covenant,
and be denied the Seale, and then infant-Baptiſme might be of
eaſier proof. Though they were not in covenant, though they
were not holy, yet they might be baptized. But I will not yield
ſo much; I do not believe that <hi>Abraham</hi> carried circumciſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the line of the covenant, and that he had thoſe in his houſe
which were aliens from God; ſeeing I finde that Teſtimony of
the Lord concerning him, <hi>Gen. 18. 19. For I know him, that he
will command his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:55700:221"/>
keep the way of the Lord to do juſtice and judgement; that the Lord
may bring upon</hi> Abraham <hi>that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi> And
that reſolution of <hi>Joſhua, That if others would ſerve the gods that
their fathers ſerved that were on the other ſide the floud, or the gods
of the</hi> Amorites <hi>in whoſe land they dwell; yet he and his houſe would
ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſh. 24. 14, 15. As it is a private mans duty to
ſerve the Lord, and not Idols, ſo it is the Maſter of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
duty to ſee that the Lord and not Idols be worſhipped in his
houſe. As I do beleeve that if any of our adverſaries had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Heathen in his Family, he would not keep him there, and
not chatechize him, and that he would not during his profeſſion
of Heatheniſme baptize him: So, I beleeve concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi>
He catechized all that he took in as Heathens, and did not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe
them in their Heatheniſme. <hi>This ſome Paedobaptists</hi> (as
is ſaid) <hi>are forced to confeſſe, when they grant the formal reaſon
of the Jewes being circumciſed, was the command, and the covenant
he makes only a motive.</hi> I wonder what need there is of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to force ſuch a confeſſion. The reaſon I ſay, why Jewes
were circumciſed, and Chriſtians baptized, is the command;
were there a thouſand covenants, and no inſtitution of a ſigne,
or ſeale, ſuch a ſigne or ſeale, there could have been no circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
nor no Baptiſme. The command is the ground, and the
covenant is the directory to whom application si to be made. We
ſay, all in covenant are entituled to the Seale for admiſſion; but
we pre-ſuppoſe an inſtitution. They will have all Beleevers, and all
Diſciples baptized, which they cannot conclude upon their faith
and knowledge barely, but upon the command to baptize Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
and Diſciples; So that the command is with reference to
the covenant, with reference to intereſt in the covenant. From
theſe foregoing exceptions a concluſion is drawne, that <hi>all this
doth fully ſhew, that the proof of the connexion between, and the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitial
Seale without a particular command for it, is without any
weight in it.</hi> And I conclude, that it fully ſhewes that the proof
of the connexion between the covenant and the initial Seale,
(pre-ſuppoſing the inſtitution of ſuch a Seale, and a general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand)
is of that weight that all are meere frivolous trifles that are
brought for exceptions againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Another Scripture holding out the connexion between the
covenant and initial ſeale is, <hi>Acts 2. 38, 39. Repent and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:55700:221"/>
every one of you, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the
remiſſion of ſinnes, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy
Ghoſt, for the promiſe is unto you, and to your children, and to
all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi>
Here I muſt mind the Reader of that which I have already
ſpoken on this text, concerning this text, Chap. On which
words after a brief <hi>Analaſis</hi> (which there may be ſeen) I have
grounded this argument, They to whom the covenant of
promiſe appertains, have right to Baptiſme. But the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of promiſe, belongs to men in a Church-ſtate, and
condition; together with their children, therefore, thoſe
that are in a Church-ſtate, and condition, have right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
together with their children. My buſineſſe being then,
to aſſert the juſt latitude of the covenant; without reſpect
to Baptiſme or any other ſeale, I ſpoke only to the minor
propoſition, that the covenant extends it ſelfe not alone,
to men profeſſedly in a Church-ſtate, but alſo to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with them, and to that I think I have there ſpoke ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
Now I am put upon the proof of the major. That
they, to whom the covenant of the promiſe appertaines,
have right to baptiſme. If this faile, it muſt be confeſt, that
the ground of infant-Baptiſme, as to this Text, falls with it,
ſeeing their right is not aſſerted, <hi>quâ</hi> infants, no more
than the right of men of growth or men of yeares, <hi>quâ</hi> of
growth, or in yeares, but as they ſtand in reference to God
in coventnt, and this is clear in the Text. <hi>Be baptized, for the
promiſe is to you, and to your children.</hi> Becauſe they are veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the promiſe, they have their right and intereſt in the
ſeale. If this do not hold, the Apoſtles argument falls to
evade this full and cleare argument, one is bold to ſay,
that in the expounding of theſe words there are almoſt as
many miſtakes as words, when words are only brought to
convince us, of ſo many miſtakes, though in a multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of exceptions.</p>

there meant, were the promiſe,</hi> Gen. 17. 7. <hi>To</hi> Abraham

as if it were a promiſe of a thing to come ſome outward priviledg

do not interpret it of any preſent explicite Faith in Chriſt

                     <hi>As for that which follows;</hi> They would have the promiſe to be
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:55700:222"/>
to their children as theirs, whether they be called or no; which can
be verified only in their ſenſe of their infants, ſith they maintain that
even the children of Beleevers are not in covenant; the promiſe is
not to them, they are not viſible Church-members when they
come to years of diſcretion, except they be called in their own
perſons, and accept the call. <hi>Children as theirs, whether
they be called or no, is a contradiction; Children are called
in their Parents call, and we ſay, they are in covenant, the
Promiſe is made to them; they are viſible Church-members till
they reject the covenant, and deny their Memberſhip, this is a
calumny.</hi>

                     <hi>Eighthly, It is ſaid,</hi> Some would poſſeſſe people with this conceit as
if <hi>Peters</hi> ſcope were to take away by <hi>ver.</hi> 39. an objection or ſcruple
they would make. If we be baptized our ſelves, our children ſhall be in

if they be not to be baptized alſo; and that he anſwers them by aſſuring
them that in this diſpenſation alſo their children were in covenant,
and were to have the ſeale of the covenant. <hi>And then addes,</hi> There
is not a word of any ſuch ſcruple in the Text; nor i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> likely that they
were ſollicitous about ſuch an imaginary poor priviledge of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<hi>I am of the ſame mind that there was no ſuch ſcruple in their
heads. This unhappy conceit of caſting the ſeed out of covenant
was not then in being, though I think the reaſon given is little to
purpoſe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninthly, He ſayes,</hi> They all do moſt groſſely abuſe the meaning of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:55700:223"/>
the Apoſtle, in interpreting the inference of the Apoſtle, ſignified by
the particle [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for, <hi>verſ.</hi> 39.] which they would have to be this,
you have right and war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ant to be baptized; For the promiſe is to
you and your children, as if the illative particle did inferre a warrant,
or right for them and theirs to be baptized; whereas the thing inferred
is not any right, which in a legal way they might claime; but is a
plaine motive in a moral way urged to perſwade them to be baptized.
<hi>They do groſſely abuſe their own judgement in this way of
refutation, as though the right in which they ſtood, could be no
Topick, from which in a moral way the Apoſtle might perſwade
them to Baptiſme. When</hi> Shechaniah <hi>perſwaded</hi> Ezra <hi>to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the marriage of ſtrange wives in theſe words,</hi> Ariſe
for the matter belongeth unto thee, <hi>Ezra 10. 4. Here was a motive
in a moral way to call upon him to do it, and an Argument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
that it lay upon</hi> Ezra <hi>as a duty by command from God to
ſet upon it. The reaſon added is worthy of obſervation:</hi> This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
from the form of words, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. which if they had expreſt a right
to Baptiſme by vertue of the promiſe, ſhould have been in the indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
mood in ſuch a forme as this; you are to be baptized, you may be
baptized, you have right to it, the Minister ought to do it; but the
words are in the imparative mood, exhorting them and perſwading
them to it, <hi>They have quite forgotten, that the words holding out
their right, are in the</hi> indicative mood, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
For the promiſe is to you and your children. <hi>And
here is a notable correction of the Apoſtle, he ſhould have ſaid,
if this had been his meaning, you muſt be baptized; and he ſayes,</hi>
Ariſe, and be baptized.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is ſaid, <hi>In the paraphraſes, which uſually in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,</hi>
Paedobaptiſts <hi>make of</hi> Acts 2. 38, 39. <hi>they put not any thing
to anſwere the terme [repent] as if it ſtood for a cipher, but para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe
it thus, Ye may be baptized, you and your children; for the
Promiſe is to you, and your children.</hi> The ſixth exception was againſt
our interpretation of the word <hi>repent, ver.</hi> 38. as if it were as
much as to ſay, <hi>Covenant for your ſelves and your children;</hi> and
here it is complained that it is left for a cipher. And the Author
thinks he hath diſcovered the reaſon of this Omiſſion. <hi>The put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the word repent firſt, and be baptized after, doth manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overthrow their paraphraſe of a right to Baptiſme from the word of
promiſe, and ſhew that the particle, [For] doth not prove a right
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:55700:223"/>
to Baptiſme, but preſſe to a duty; and ſuch a duty as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
precedent, and that in every perſon that is to be baptized.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
it preſſeth to a duty, and ſuch a duty as is to have repentance
precedent in them that at that time were his hearers, to intereſt
themſelves, and with themſelves their children in this priviledge;
But right and duty do not ſhoulder out one the other, but very
well ſtand together; encouraging to a duty which is a priviledge
as well as a duty, he fitly makes uſe of their intereſt as a motive.
And they might ſee that the Apoſtle puts the promiſe in a greater
latitude than he urgeth repentance; He ſpeakes to his hearers,
when he ſayes <hi>repent;</hi> and he tells them, <hi>that the promiſe is to
them and to their children with them:</hi> Whereas our Author preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the precedency of the word, <hi>repent,</hi> to the command of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
baptized, and elſewhere ſaith, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>er doth exhort to Repentance
and Baptiſme together, and in the firſt place perſwades to Repentance,
then to Baptiſme, which ſhewes Repentance to be in order before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme;</hi>
I anſwer, as I did before <hi>Chap.</hi> 48. that theſe who had
crucified Chriſt as a blaſphemer, as a ſeditious perſon; an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor,
muſt needs repent before they would accept Baptiſme in
his name, or hope for remiſſion of ſinne by him. It had been loſt
labour for the Apoſtle to have preſſed thoſe that had crucified
Chriſt, and retained their former opinion of him, to become
Diſciples to him, and to look to be ſaved by him; to perſwade
them to look for remiſſion of ſinnes in his blood, who took them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be without ſinne in ſhedding of it, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this guilt (of which the Apoſtle would have them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent)
he ſhewes that they and their ſeed are under the promiſe
of God, and puts them into a way in acceptation of Chriſt in the
Goſpel-tender, in his preſent way of adminiſtration to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
his people ſtill in covenant, and that (as is plainly enough
ſignified) that they might enjoy it in their former latitude, <hi>to
them and to their children.</hi> So that Maſter <hi>Stephens</hi> his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſo much ſleighted by an adverſary, and repeated
not in his words, but in his own paraphraſe upon them,
is indeed the Apoſtles meaning. <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> (ſaith he. <hi>pag. 14.)
doth ſpeak to theſe Jewes who had crucified Christ; that if they would
receive him as the particular</hi> Meſſiah, <hi>the ſame promiſe ſhould ſtill
continue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to them and their children in the new diſpenſation: And on
this doth he build the word of command, to baptize father and childe;</hi>
                     <pb n="432" facs="tcp:55700:224"/>
To this the word <hi>repent</hi> here referres as may be made
plaine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By taking into conſideration the preſent ſtate of this
people, and that in ſeveral particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. As yet they had the promiſes with them, and were children
of the covenant, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 25. Though the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4.
do diſtinguiſh between the covenants and the promiſes; yet to
have the promiſes here, and to be children of the covenant, there
ſeemes to be one. If any can diſtinguiſh them, this people, had
the honour of both of them; God had not yet caſt them out of
a Church-ſtate and covenant-relation.</p>
                  <p>2. They were in preſent danger to be caſt off according to
what Chriſt had foretold, <hi>Mat. 8. 12. Mat.</hi> 21. 43. Being
ſo faſt riveted to the ceremonial Law which now was dead,
and preſently grew deadly: God denying any preſence (as
hath been ſaid) with them, now the ſubſtanee was
come.</p>
                  <p>3. Theſe particular perſons with whom <hi>Peter</hi> had to deale,
were now well prepared for a free acceptation of a Goſpel-way,
under this adminiſtration, which Jeſus Chriſt (having pulled
down the Law of Ordinances) was to ſet up: Being amazed
with the glory of the mircale which was wrought before their
eyes, and convinced with the powerful application of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
by <hi>Peter</hi> in that elegant Sermon, they fell upon enquiry
what they ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By comparing other Texts of Scripture, which may
ſerve as a Comment to the clearing of this; eſpecially two Texts
of two Evangeliſts, recording the words of Chriſt, and holding
out the impenitent obſtinacy of the Jewes, ſtanding out againſt
every call to repentance, reſpective to their rigid pertinacious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to former diſpenſations, and oppoſition of that now ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and offered to them. 1. That of our Saviour Chriſt,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 31, 32. Chriſt having held before them, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. 29,
30. the parable of a <hi>certain man, that had two ſonnes, and came
to the firſt, and ſaid, ſonne, go work to day in my Vine-yard; He
anſwered and ſaid, I will not; but afterward he repented, and went;
And he came to the ſecond, and ſaid likewiſe; and he anſwered and
ſaid, I go Sir, and went not,</hi> and made appeale to them, <hi>ver. 31.
Whether of them twaine did the will of his father?</hi> and they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:55700:224"/>
                     <hi>the firſt: Jeſus ſaith unto them,</hi> (as it followes in that and
the next verſe) <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that the Publicans and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
go into the Kingdome of God before you; For</hi> John <hi>came unto
you in the way of righteouſneſſe, and ye beleeved him not; but the
Publicans and the Harlots believed him. And ye, when ye had ſeen
it, repented not afterward, that ye might beleeve in him.</hi> The
Publicans and Harlots anſwer to the firſt brother, who from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
rebellion againſt the command of God, by <hi>Johns</hi> preaching,
were brought to repent, and accept of a Goſpel-covenant, and
enter into it by Baptiſme. The chief Prieſts and Elders of the
people (that here oppoſed Chriſt preaching the Goſpel of the
Kingdome) anſwer to the ſecond brother that ſaid, he would
go into the Vine-yard, and went not; Theſe repent not, but hold
faſt, and pertinaciouſly adhere to the way of old received, when
the Publicans accept and imbrace the ſpiritual ſtate of the
Church by Chriſt ſet up. From this impenitence of theſe chiefe
Prieſts and Elders with whom theſe joyned in crucifying Chriſt;
<hi>Peter</hi> diſſwades, and exhorts to the repentance of the Publicanes
and Harlots. The ſecond Scripture which may give light to this
text, is much parallel to this, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29, 30. Chriſt having given
a large teſtimony to <hi>John</hi> and his Miniſtry; holds out the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
effect that it took: Firſt, in the people and the Publicanes,
<hi>ver. 29. And all the people that heard him, and the Publicanes
justified God, being baptized with the Baptiſme of John.</hi>
Secondly, in the Phariſees and Lawyers, <hi>ver. 30. But the phariſees
and Lawyers rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not baptized.</hi> They perſiſted in their old way, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that way held forth by <hi>John,</hi> approved by Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
baptiſme, Theſe with whom <hi>Peter</hi> had to deale, had gone
with the Prieſts and Phariſees, kept full pace with them even to
the guilt of the death of Chriſt, they were now in a good way to
follow the ſteps of the Publicanes and People, to embrace the
counſel of God, and accept baptiſme, their impenitence had
held them from entrance into a new covenant-way by baptiſme,
<hi>Peter</hi> therefore exhorts to repent and be baptized.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This appeares by the Text it ſelfe, whereas they
will have the illative particle <hi>For,</hi> to inferre no warrant or
right in them to be baptized, but onely a motive in a moral way
urged, as we have heard in the laſt exception. It is worth our enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:55700:225"/>
to learne what good interpretation ſuitable to <hi>Peters</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
they put here on thoſe words, <hi>To you is the promiſe made,
and to your children,</hi> excluding all conſideration of right, in them
and their children, <hi>Becauſe Chriſt was promiſed to them and their
children, therefore they muſt repent and be baptized.</hi> Not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
upon that juſt exception of Maſter <hi>Gobbet,</hi> page 23. <hi>That
the Apostle doth not ſay, the promiſe was to you as in reference to the
time of making it to the fathers, with reſpect unto them, or in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Chriſt, who was not now to come, but already come, as the
Apoſtle proveth from</hi> ver. 3. <hi>to 37. Nor is it the uſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
when mentioning promiſes as fulfilled, to expreſſe it thus in the
preſent tenſe, the promiſe is to you, or to ſuch and ſuch, but rather
to annex ſome expreſſion that way which evinceth the ſame,</hi> giving
inſtance almoſt in twenty ſeveral texts, which utterly overthrows
his expoſition. Let them tell us why in this moral perſwaſive
holding out a bare motive to perſwade the parent onely, the
children (not concerned in the thing and in an utter incapacity)
ſhould be mentioned. And why the words ſhould be carried in
that way that intereſt in covenant and covenant-ſeales formerly
ran, and no right at all to covenant or covenant-ſeales intended?
This gloſſe puts too much violence upon the words. But carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it on as a diſſwaſive from perſiſtance in their former way of
old covenant legal rites, and perſwading to embrace the way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by him, whom God had made both Lord and Chriſt, it
ſingularly anſwers, as, to their preſent condition, yet in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
though in eminent danger to be caſt out of covenant, ſo, alſo
to the words of the text, holding out a covenant-right in Scripture
language according to the grand Charter of heaven. <hi>I will be
thy God, and the God of thy ſeed;</hi> ſo that I hope by this time, the
intelligent Reader will eaſily perceive the frivolous ſhifts inſtead
of a ful refutation that's here brought to avoid <hi>Paedobaptiſts</hi> proofs
of a word of command to Baptize infants from this Scripture.</p>
                  <p>As theſe Scriptures plainly hold out the neceſſary connexion
of the covenant and initial ſeale, ſo, the evidence of reaſon is
cleare for it. No man that ſtands enrighted or legally intereſted,
in any priviledge, or poſſeſſion, may be denied that ceremony
or ſeal which is appointed for confirmation. A copy-hold being
found the next immediate tenant, of a copy-hold-right muſt not
be denied, but received according to the ceremony, or ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:55700:225"/>
of the place, whenſoever the King did grant, out letters-pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
the Lord Keeper might not deny the ſeale, the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
may not now deny it to any, that by a juſt grant
have intereſt. This were to keep a childe out of his fathers
houſe, a ſervant from his place of abode and reſidence; when
Chriſt was ſo much diſpleaſed with his Diſciples on like occaſion,
theſe may well expect to be under as high diſpleaſure. Having
thus made good the point, it remaines that I take off ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
and meet with ſome quarrels that are raiſed againſt
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If there be any neceſſary connexion between the covenant and the
ſeale, it muſt be</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>either, by reaſon of ſome neceſſary
connexion between the termes which is none, for it is but a common
accident to a man that hath a promiſe or a covenant made to him, that
he ſhould have a ſpecial ſigne, it may adeſſe vel abeſſe à ſubjecto, it
may be preſent or abſent from the ſubject.</hi> Giving ſome inſtances
of covenants without ſeales. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By way of concuſſion
it will be eaſily granted, that a covenant may ſtand alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſeale annexed? but where a ſeale is appointed for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(as there hath been in the Church ever ſince God took a
people to himſelf out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> loines) there is a neceſſary
connexion. This anſwer he foreſees, and ſayes: <hi>But you will
ſay, All that are</hi> foederati <hi>ſhould be</hi> ſignati, <hi>ſince the ſolemne cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with</hi> Abraham; <hi>But neither is this certaine, ſith we finde no
ſuch thing concerning</hi> Melchizedek <hi>and</hi> Lot, <hi>that lived in</hi> Abrahams
<hi>time, nor concerning</hi> Job <hi>that it's conceived lived after his time.</hi>
If we read nothing to confirme it, the Reader ſees nothing to
contradict it; There is added, <hi>But you will ſay, it is true of all
the</hi> foederati <hi>in</hi> Abrahams <hi>family. But neither is that true, for male-children
before the eighth day, and women though</hi> foederatae, <hi>yet were
not to be ſigned.</hi> Is there no connexion between them, becauſe he
that receives into covenant and appoints the ſeale, hath preſcribed
a time when it ſhall be applied? A man that hath a grant from
King or State, hath <hi>ipſo facto</hi> right to the ſeale, and the right ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily

day before he poſſeſſe it.</p>
                  <p>For the exception of women, though <hi>foederatae,</hi> yet were not
to be circumciſed; I ſay, 1. Maſter <hi>Marſhal</hi> hath ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that they were of the circumciſion, and it was an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:55700:226"/>
againſt <hi>Sampſon</hi> by his parents that he would go to take a
wife of the uncircumciſed Philiſtines, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14. 3. Had he
married in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as he ought in obedience to God and his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
he had married a wife of the circumciſed, though that ſex
by nature is in an incapacity of that ſigne or ſeale. In diverſe
places of <hi>England,</hi> the husband being admitted by verdict of a
Jury into an eſtate, the wife is virtually admitted; his admiſſion
is her admiſſion, ſo it was in circumciſion. 2. They had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
actually received that ſigne of circumciſion as in New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
times they do Baptiſme, <hi>Acts 8. 12. Acts</hi> 16. 15. but
that it was a ſigne whereof they were in an incapacity. It is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
added, <hi>If then I ſhould farther grant the concluſion, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of beleevers were to be</hi> ſignati, <hi>yet you would not ſay they are
to be partakers of the Lords Supper, becauſe it is not appointed for
them; So in like manner if it were granted you that infants of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
were to be ſigned, yet it followes not that they are to be baptized,
unleſſe you can prove that it is appointed to them; and the truth is,
if it were granted that children were</hi> foederati, <hi>yet it were a high
preſumption in us to ſay therefore they muſt be</hi> ſignati, <hi>without Gods
declaration of his minde; and if it were granted they muſt be</hi> ſignati,
<hi>it were in like manner a high preſumption in us to ſay, therefore they
muſt be baptized, without Gods declaration of his minde concerning
that Ordinance.</hi> To this a reply is made by another hand, that
there is difference between a ſeale for initiation, and a
ſeale for confirmation; a ſeale, wherein no more is of neceſſity,
than to be paſſive; and that wherein we are to be active; yet to
come more near to them, I am content to yield the concluſion,
ſuppoſing that his argument is of force, Every Church-member
hath true title to all Church-priviledges; But infants are Church-members,
the Lords Supper is a Church-priviledge; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
infants have true title to it. But then I muſt diſtinguiſh <hi>jus ad
rem,</hi> and <hi>jus in re,</hi> every infant hath right to it, yet by reaſon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
hath his actual intereſt ſuſpended; <hi>Paul</hi> by birth had right to
all the priviledg of the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> being born free, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 28.
yet it does not follow that he was to give his vote, or appear in
Aſſemblies as a free Citizen in the time of his minority; <hi>James</hi>
the ſixth was crowned in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in the time of their minority, ſo that they were reckoned
among the Kings of Nations; yet neither of them did in their
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55700:226"/>
own perſons exerciſe <hi>regalia</hi> till yeares of diſcretion. As theſe
infants of title were crowned, ſo infants that are Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are to be baptized, when yet an infant can no more partake,
as a Chriſtian ought, of the Lords Supper, than an infant King
can wield the great things of his Kingdome. An infant-heir from
the firſt inſtant of his fathers death, and a poſthumous childe
from the time of his birth, ſtands ſeized of his fathers inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
The whole title is veſted in him, how ample ſoever, and
in no other, and he is received into it, and lives upon it, yet he
is held from the managing of it till he can improve for his own
and the publike benefit; So that the taking into covenant is a
ſufficient declaration of Gods minde, that the ſignes and ſeals in
an orderly way ſhould be granted to them, and all theſe appeare
to be cavils, and not anſwers.</p>
                  <p>As, theſe exceptions are cauſleſly taken againſt the connexion
between the covenant and eale; ſo, quarrels are raiſed, againſt
ſome phraſes in common uſe among Divines relating to this thing,
as making the metaphor of a ſeale the <hi>Genus</hi> of a Sacrament,
which (if an errour) was the Apoſtles errour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch like, with which it is needleſſe to trouble the Reader.</p>

                     <hi>Render unto Caeſar the things which are Caeſars, and
unto God the things that are Gods,</hi> Matth. 22. 21. Adverſaries
faſten the brand of will-worſhip on the practice of it; But if
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:55700:227"/>
Baptiſme be any worſhip according to the minde of Chriſt, then
infant-Baptiſme is out of all danger or poſſibility of will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
In caſe infants were not within he verge, yet their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
could be no will worſhip; we ſet not up of our ſelves the
Ordinance that we apply to them, but make application of the
Ordinance that Chriſt hath inſtituted; In caſe they have no title,
there is onely a miſapplication of worſhip inſtituted, and no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
of worſhip. To this is replied, and demand made <hi>whether
infant-communion were not will-worſhip? whether baptizing of
Bells were not will-worſhip? yet theſe are but miſapplications of an
instituted ordinance to a wrong ſubject.</hi> I anſwer, none of theſe
were will-worſhip, nor yet the Baptiſme of the Horſe in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon</hi>-ſhire,
but the horrid prophanation of an inſtituted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
Baptiſme is ſtill Gods, but the application mans, and here
the will is not carried to a deviſe of an ordinance, but alone to
the application of it. Our adverſaries making it a corruption of
the Ordinance of Baptiſme, acquit it from will-worſhip: But in
infant-Baptiſme we neither deviſe an Ordinance, nor of our own
heads make application of it: we know they belong to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Jeſus Chriſt, we know Chriſts order to admit them to the
priviledge that was proper to thoſe of his family, and as faithful
ſtewards we follow the will of our Maſter, not our own will,
but the will of Chriſt Jeſus. Could they waſh their hands of
Sacriledge, as we are able to clear our wills and wits from deviſe
of a worſhip, it were better with them; The times were, when
men looked upon things conſecrate (as holy to the Lord) in a
multiplying glaſſe; we had holy places, holy Altars, in which
ſome of our preſent opponents went too farre to the grief of the
godly, and farther than the times with their ſtreames needed to
have borne them, had he been meerely preſt, and no voluntier
in it.<note place="margin">Extremes are dangerous.</note> I wiſh they would ſeriouſly conſider, how ordinary it is
with men to carry on their wayes in extreames, and out of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
to runne upon Sacriledge. It is well known how apt
the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were for idolatrous wayes, and ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
every ſuperſtition after the way of the Heathen, and in
conformity to them; yet after the Babyloniſh captivity, they
were quite taken off that courſe; What wickedneſſe ſoever they
were otherwiſe guilty of, yet it is obſerved that they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from Idols; That ſinne had ſo conſumed them, that at laſt
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:55700:227"/>
it had even wearied them: And then (as it appeares from the
Apoſtle) they runne upon this extreame,<note place="margin">The Jewes lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving idolatry, run upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge.</note> to which we are here
ſpeaking; Therefore when in other things they are charged with
the ſame ſinne that (as men of knowledge) they condemned in
others, <hi>Thou that preacheſt that another ſhould not ſteale, doeſt thou
ſteale? Thou that ſayeſt a man ſhould not commit adultery, doeſt thou
commit adultery?</hi> And the <hi>Series</hi> of the words leading to a charge
of Idolatry, the Apoſtle changes the phraſe, and ſaith, <hi>Thou
that abhorreſt Idols, doeſt thou commit Sacriledge?</hi> Rom. 2. 22.
This was now their ſinne in the other extreame, not on their
own heads to put a ſuppoſition of holineſſe to the Lord on any
thing for worſhip, but to convert to other uſes that which was
ſanctified as holy. I know ſome underſtand theſe words in a
Metaphor, that by Sacriledge is meant the robbing of God of his
honour by ſinne againſt him; but that interpretation the next
words contradict, in diſtinct words forbidding that Sacriledge,
if they will ſo call it. <hi>Origen</hi> will turne it into an Allegory, and
underſtand the ſpoyling of the ſenſe of Scriptures, and ſtealing
Chriſt out of the Scriptures; But the text is plaine, that it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
applied to their capacities, and in the letter convincing, as
well as the former of ſtealing, and adultery, <hi>The plaine ſenſe,</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr) is the meaning.</hi> May not I now ſay that
theſe things are out examples, to the intent that we ſhould not
runne with them in theſe extreames from an abhorrency of the
one to the other, from an abhorrency of Idols to the guilt of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
which according to the Schoolmen is <hi>rei ſacrae viola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>io,</hi>
or <hi>rerum ſacrarum furtum, a deteigning from God that which for
an holy uſe is ſeparate for him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Separation for God of perſons or of inanimate or unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures. Whether Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge be any New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſin.</note> which ſeparation is either of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or of inanimate, or irrational creatures. I know there are
thoſe that affirme that there is no ſuch ſeparation for God in Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
times, and conſequently there can be no ſuch thing as this ſin
of Sacriledge in our times, for what is not, cannot be thus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
or detained. As to the ſeparation of inanimate or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creatures it cannot be fully denied, nor yet muſt it fully be
yielded, that no ſuch things are now to be accounted as ſeparate
to the Lord, we muſt therefore diſtinguiſh. Theſe may be ſaid to
be ſeparate for God,<note place="margin">Separation for God either by inſtitution or approbation.</note> and conſequently holy, two wayes. 1. By
divine inſtitution and appointment, So the Temple and Utenſils
of the Temple were holy. 2. By divine approbation, when men
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:55700:228"/>
let them apart for advancement of ſuch an holy uſe as God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves.
The former we confeſſe was proper to the times of the
Law, but the latter yet remaines in Goſpel-times, and upon this
account <hi>Ravanellus</hi> juſtly makes the ſinne of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi>
(in keeping back part of the price of their land that was
ſet apart by them for the ſervice of the Church) to be the ſinne
of Sacriledge. The land before ſale was his own, and the price
after ſale was his own, but now it was to ſerve (by their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
act) onely to a purpoſe that was holy; The detaining of
it is the violation of that which is holy.<note place="margin">Places for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenance of thoſe that attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worſhip ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And in this way, both
the places of publick worſhip, and the revenues for maintenance
of thoſe that attend upon this worſhip, are ſeparate for God:
It will be thought ſomewhat out of my way to ſpeak to theſe
things, yet having ſo fair an occaſion, I ſhall take the liberty of
a few words, concerning the places of worſhip, ſhall ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in the [negative,] and by way of conceſſion; There is
not any ſuch holineſſe in them, as in the Tabernacle and Temple,
This is diſavowed by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Poſitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning places.</note> 
                     <hi>John</hi> 4. 23. Theſe had the
preheminence above our places of meeting in foure ſeveral
particulars.<note place="margin">Negative.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>They had their inſtitution, and immediate injunction from
God,</hi> Exod. 35. 10, 11. 1 Kings 5. 5. 1 Chron. 22. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>2. Their direction and preſcription, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 5.</p>
                  <p>3. Their promiſe, not alone reſpective to the worſhip, but the
place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 42, 43.</p>
                  <p>4. Their ſanction or penalty in regard of typical prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Num.</hi> 19. 20. In all of theſe particulars we muſt give the
Temple and Tabernacle the preeminence, beſides that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Tabernacle were but one for all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we have many. In
the affirmative I ſhall lay down ſeveral poſitions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Poſitive.</note> there is equal warrant and reaſon for the building of our
places of meeting, for the worſhip of God, as there was for the
Synagogues of the Jewes; Though we put no ſuch holineſſe on
theſe places to parallel them with the Temple, yet they have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
warrant, and are to have equal reſpect with the Synagogues
which the Jewes had in every City, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 21. Not only in
<hi>Judea,</hi> but where they were diſperſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 14, 15. There
is no word in all the Scripture for the erecting of theſe Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
no mention made of them but once, where a ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:55700:228"/>
is made of the burning of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 8. But the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God being by Gods command to be inſtructed in the Law,
they built them places for conveniency of meeting, and in ſuch
places they met, The Law was there preacht, Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
did preach there, our places of meeting then ſtand in
equal honour with theſe Synagogues: Thoſe that can
ſay any thing for theſe Synagogues, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay for our publick places of meeting, let them produce
it.</p>
                  <p>2. There is as much reaſon and equal warrant to call our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of meeting by the uſual common Name of Churches, as to call
theirs by the common name of Synagogues; Nothing can be ſaid
to condemne the uſe of the word Church for our place of meeting,
but the like may be ſaid to condemne, the uſe of the word Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue
for their place of meeting. The Scriptures therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
theirs Synagogues, <hi>Luke 7. 5. Acts</hi> 18. 7. we may therefore
fitly call ours Churches. That which is objected againſt the word
Church, is, that Church ſignifies not a houſe of wood or ſtone, but
a ſociety or fellowſhip of men, profeſſing faith in Jeſus Chriſt;
So alſo the word Synagogue ſignifies not a building, but ſuch an
aſſembly or ſociety likewiſe; <hi>In the ordinary ſignification</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Spanhemius) Synagogue ſignifies the aſſembly, not the place where
they aſſemble, but in the New Teſtament it is ſometimes put for the
place of aſſembling,</hi> Luke 7. 5. Acts 18. 7. Synagogue, and
Church, are one and the ſame, both ſignifie the aſſembly met;
As the one, ſo alſo the other may be applied by an uſual figure
to the place of meeting, and therefore where it is ſaid,
<hi>the Centurion loveth our Nation, and hath built us a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,</hi>
Luke 7. 5. the laſt Annotations have it, <hi>a Church;</hi>
So that they that would reforme this language, which calls
our places of meeting a Church, muſt reform the language
of Scripture, which calls the like places by a name of the ſame
ſignification.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a pious work to erect theſe Churches, or publick
meeting places for advancement of the knowledge and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, as may be evinced from that Narrative of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion,
<hi>Luke</hi> 7. and the tranſactions between Chriſt and him.
1. There are ſeveral evidences of piety in the man. 1. He is tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected with his ſervants ſickneſſe. 2. He ſends to Chriſt for
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:55700:229"/>
cure, makes to him as <hi>Mary</hi> for <hi>Lazarus.</hi> 3. He evidences a
mighty faith in Chriſt, beleeves that Chriſts word without his
preſence will work for his ſervants recovery. 4. Makes this good
by an argument from the leſſe to the greater, <hi>I my ſelfe am a man
under authority, and have men under me,</hi> if my word ſtands, who
am an inferiour perſon, how much more then thine? 5. The Lord
Chriſt ſpeaks by way of commendation and admiration of his
faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. 2. There are evidences of the warranty of his fact.
1. The Elders of the Jewes take notice of it, and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
commend him to Chriſt to have his requeſt gratified, <hi>Lord,
he is worthy for whom thou ſhouldeſt do this: For he loveth our
Nation, and hath built us a Synagogue.</hi> 2. This takes with Chriſt,
<hi>Then Jeſus went with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, being a pious work as we ſee to erect them (not only
in the judgement of this Centurion, but of the Jewes, yea and of
Chriſt Jeſus) it is then an evil, a ſinne to demoliſh and deſtroy
them, this followes from the former; If piety let them up, ſinne
pulls them down: If he be a good Townſman that builds a Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
a School, &amp;c. then he is an ill-deſerving one that does ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
it. If the Centurion have his praiſe for building a Synagogue,
then it muſt be their reproach that deface them. Farther we have
a ſad complaint of ſuch acts of Sacriledge done by adverſaries, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
blaſphemers, <hi>Pſal. 74. 7, 8. They have caſt fire into
thy Sanctuary, they have defiled by caſting down the dwelling place
of thy name to the ground: They have burnt up all the Synagogues of
God in the Land.</hi> The burning of the Temple in the firſt place
is complained of, the dwelling place of Gods name. Then
of the Synagogues which were ſcattered through the Land,
all theſe were deſtroyed and conſumed. This the godly
lay to heart, as a ſore evil, and complaine of it heavily and
ſadly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Miniſtry maintenance aſſerted.</note> As to the revenue for maintenance of thoſe that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon this worſhip, I might ſpeak, 1. To that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly
due,<note place="margin">1. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly is due.</note> in which the minde of God is, that it be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
as might be made good, 1. By the Apoſtles authority.
2. By his Arguments and Reaſons. 1. By his authority, <hi>Gal. 6.
6. Let him that is taught in the Word, communicate unto him that
teacheth in all good things.</hi> Subſiſtence is of due to him that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
from them that are taught according to their abilities, and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:55700:229"/>
the proportion of their poſſeſſions. This is no almes or free gift,
but a due debt. The Apoſtle gives it in charge, and takes off ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
and evaſions in the words that follow; <hi>Be not deceived, God
is not mocked, for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reape.</hi>
And as the Apoſtle by his authority orders it, ſo he gives his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for it, which might be enlarged to a great length from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
9. He firſt argues from the practice of other Apoſtles, of all
the Apoſtles except himſelf and <hi>Barnabas, ver. 5, 6. I only and</hi>
Barnabas <hi>have we not power to forbear working?</hi> 2. He argues from a
civil right and common equity in three particular inſtances, <hi>ver.</hi> 7.
1. In Souldiers, <hi>Who goeth a warfarre at any time at his own char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?</hi>
2. In Husbandmen, <hi>Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth
not of the fruit thereof.</hi> 3. In Shepherds, <hi>Who feedeth a flock, and
eateth not of the milke of the flock?</hi> All theſe live of their labours,
Miniſters who undergo equal labours muſt live of theirs. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he argues from the command of the Law, <hi>ver. 8, 9. Say I
theſe things as a man? or ſaith not the Law the ſame alſo? For it
is written in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of
the Oxe that treadeth out the corne. Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi>
Where two obſervations are cleare. 1. The Law of force is to
Chriſtians; and ſecondly, Miniſters muſt live on their Miniſterial
pains. Fourthly, he reaſons from communicative juſtice, <hi>ver. 11. If
we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, it is a great thing if we ſhall
reap your carnal things?</hi> Whence three things are clear. 1. That
the things of earth carry no proportion with the things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
2. By the Miniſtery of the Word the things of heaven are
conferred. 3. When Miniſters conferre on their people the
things of heaven, there is all equity that they ſhould receive the
things of earth. Fifthly, he argues from the proviſion made in
the Law, <hi>ver. 13. Do ye not know, that they which miniſter about
holy things, live of the things of the Temple? And they which wait
at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar?</hi> If the Law judge it
equal for the Levites, to live on the paines that they take about
holy things, then it is equal that the Miniſters of the Goſpel live of
their paines, But the Law made ſuch proviſion for the Levites, not
with an hungry, narrow proportion, but in a liberal and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way; See Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> on <hi>Pſal. 110. pag.</hi> 478. Sixthly, he
argues from Chriſts inſtitution in a parallel way, <hi>ver. 14. Even ſo
hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould live
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:55700:230"/>
of the Goſpel;</hi> whence we ſee at large that it is the minde of Chriſt
that this be not detained in caſe the Apoſtle (as he ſayes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
2. 16.) hath the minde of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>For that which is legally due either by order of the Sate,<note place="margin">2. What is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally due.</note> or a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
gift of any perſon, to that end, it ought not to be aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
There is equity in the thing (as we have heard at large)
when authority ſhall put upon it their ſanction, it is a farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation;
for a voluntary gift, in caſe <hi>Ananias</hi> may not revoke
his own, none may alienate anothers; <hi>If it be a mans Testament,
no man diſanulleth it,</hi> Gal. 3. 14. The poore muſt enjoy that
which by free gift is ſetled upon them, ſo a Corporation, and
ſo the Miniſtery in like manner. To deſtroy publick places (of
neceſſary and convenient uſe) for advancement of publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
to alienate lively-hood which is in order to it, is
to devoure that which is holy, reductively holy: not
by Gods particular inſtitution, with limit to that
thing or place, but by his Warranty and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Separation of perſons, for God is of another ſort; they that
are thus ſeparate, God ownes; not only as reductively, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively
holy: This is either peculiarly, in ſome way of ſpecial
calling, to do ſuch work as is holy, of which there were ſeveral
ſorts in the time of the Law, Prieſts, Levites, Nazarites, Singers,
Porters, which will not be denied, and in a parallel way Miniſters
of the Goſpel as we have ſeen, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 14. Acts 13. 2. The
Holy Ghoſt ſaid, Separate me</hi> Saul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>for the work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

                  </p>
                  <p>Here an eminent adverſary gives in his aſſent, and ſayes, <hi>Paſtors
and Teachers, or Preſbyters to teach, and governe the Church of
God; I am aſſured are a divine inſtitution, and a very merciful gift
of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 11, 12, 13. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Acts 14. 23.
1 Tim. 3. 1. Titus 2. 5. <hi>to whom people ſhould yield obedience,</hi>
Heb. 13. 7. <hi>and yield maintenance liberally,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 14. Gal. 6.
6. 1 Tim. 5. 17, 18. <hi>If any go about to extirpate them, let him
be accurſed as an enemy to Chriſt and his Church.</hi> This the evidence
of truth forces him to confeſſe, though preſently he takes againe
all that from them, which he had under ſuch an Anathema yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. He that gives to every Free-man of <hi>London,</hi> in caſe
competently qualified, the whole power and authority of the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:55700:230"/>
Lord Major, to every free Subject of <hi>England,</hi> the whole power
of the Lord Chief Juſtice, goes a deſtructive way for extirpation
of thoſe places, or functions. This I think all will grant, when
each man may do their work, they ſhall ſoon have little honour
in the naked title. Now our Authour gives the work of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
promiſcuouſly to all. <hi>Notwithſtanding what ſuch and ſuch have
ſaid, I ſtill conceive</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that not onely for triall of expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
but alſo upon other occaſions, perſons not ordained, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
yea deſired to preach in the Pulpits.</hi> If all that ſuch have ſaid
cannot withſtand this conceit, me thinkes his Anathema (but
now pronounced) ſhould affect him ſomewhat. Let him take
heed leſt he let them looſe to runne upon ſo heavy a curſe that
hangs over thoſe of ſuch principles. It were to be wiſhed he
would have anſwered their reaſons in a better temper than he
hath done other mens, or have given in ſomewhat of his own far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than his bare conceit. I confeſſe, he ſpeakes ſomewhat by way
of caution. <hi>Nevertheleſſe I am againſt the courſes of many Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and others who againſt the denial of able Teachers, to whom
the teaching of the people is committed, love to get into the Pulpits
of the ableſt men, to vent their peculiar conceits, and often-times
their pernicious Errors, not regarding to preach to the ignorant the
clear Truths of Faith, and a holy life in places where they have no
Preacher, but to new Converts; to pervert them, and with-draw
them from their able Teachers, and to diſquiet them and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
by frivolous exceptions.</hi> If they have but their liberty
to become Pulpit-men, and may conſecrate themſelves without
laying on of hands (which is confeſt to be of divine inſtitution)
they will ſoon be their own carvers for the choiſe of Pulpits, They
will be the judges of the ability or inſufficiency of Miniſters gifts
where they quarter. All ſhall be clear truths that they vent;
Break down the Apoſtles fence, that by appointment from Jeſus
Chriſt he hath ſet up, <hi>Let them be proved, and then do the office,</hi>
and then a mound, Segges and Bul-ruſhes will ſoon be trodden
down. The God of order hath taken more care; The diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of the Sacraments is with theſe every mans work, as well as
preaching the Word, which he notably proves againſt Maſter
<hi>Baxter. Doth the Embaſſage of Chriſt, diſpenſing of his mysteries,
beſeeching in his ſtead, &amp;c. conſiſt</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>in breaking bread,
delivering it; bidding, take, eat, &amp;c? If it do, then a non-preaching
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:55700:231"/>
Minister who doth theſe things, may yet be an Embaſſador of Chriſt,
and Steward of his myſteries; then the breaking bread, &amp;c. is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
Ordinance, as Mr.</hi> Pryn <hi>held, which Mr.</hi> Gilleſpy <hi>and
Mr.</hi> Rutherford <hi>deny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be granted that this is the whole of a Miniſters work, is it
no part of it? are they to do nothing elſe, if they are to do this?
If it be an edifying Ordinance (which neither Maſter <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> nor
Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> will deny) it is a part of their function. <hi>For
my part,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I think to be an Embaſſador of Chriſt, and to
beſeech in his stead,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. <hi>to be a Steward of the myſteries of
God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1. <hi>are all one, as to preach the Goſpel, and that the
Aſſembly did miſalledge the Text,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1. <hi>as they have done
the other, to prove that neither Sacrament may be diſpenſed by any,
but a Miniſter of the Word lawfully ordained,</hi> Confeſſion of Faith,
<hi>Chap. 27. Sect.</hi> 4. Perhaps when the Aſſembly voted that Text
for this purpoſe, they had read that which our Author elſewhere
delivers, ſpeaking of admiſſion to Baptiſme, he ſaith, <hi>A Miniſter
in this caſe is to act as a Steward, who is to deale according to his
Lords will, not his own minde.</hi> Is not Baptiſme then one of the
myſteries of which they are Stewards? or perhaps they thought
that the Sacraments are contained in the Goſpel, and are <hi>verbum
viſibile,</hi> being teaching ſignes. A man that will oppoſe ſo quick-ſighted
a Society, ſhould have ſaid ſome little at leaſt to purpoſe;
It is ſaid, that <hi>Myſteries of God never ſignifie Sacraments in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
but the Goſpel, Epheſ. 6. 19. Rom.</hi> 16. 25. I never took
thoſe to be oppoſites, but have ever thought that Sacraments are
included within the Goſpel; we have ever taken them for ſignes
and Seales, and if they do not teach Goſpel-truths, and ſeale
Goſpel-promiſes, Miniſters are not to diſpenſe them, nor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to intermeddle with them: But <hi>Chamiers</hi> authority is here
brought, <hi>in Scriptur is</hi>

                     <hi>uſurpari pro ipſo rei ſacrae ſigno, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecto
impoſtura eſt.</hi> And is not the Quotation of this from him a
greater impoſture, who ever took the bare ſigne to be the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
then the definition would fall that calls it a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſigne of an inviſible grace. If marriage be not that
great myſtery, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 32. but the union of Chriſt and his
Church, then certainly the Sacraments (in which we have that
communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16.) are not
excluded from the number of myſteries.</p>

As there is a ſeparation for this publick work, ſo there is alſo
a ſeparation more general, from Idols to God, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Chriſtians are called Saints. Men holy by dedication to the
Lord, <hi>as the Temple of God which is holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 17. Our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
ſome of them at leaſt baptize, and by Baptiſme conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
men to God, upon no other account than ſuch a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by a profeſſion of Faith and holineſſe, as ſome of the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
of them expreſſe themſelves. To deny Baptiſme to theſe
in their own account, can be no other than Sacriledge. This
profeſſion gives them intereſt in God by way of viſible commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and therefore they muſt be given to God. Children are
ſeparated for God, and ſtiled (as we have heard) holy; if they
yield them this intereſt, they cannot deny them Baptiſme, and
avoid this charge of Sacriledg, They are ſervants of God and of his
holy Family, and they are to have admittance into the Family.
In caſe they deny it, they muſt leave them <hi>without God,</hi> and ſo
<hi>without Hope;</hi> ſo that of neceſſity one will follow, that either
they robbe God of them as belonging to him, or denying their
intereſt in him, they doome them to deſtruction. If they have no

how God hath followed the ſinne of Sacriledge, above other
ſinnes with his judgements; but inſtances can be given of no piece
of Sacriledge, ſo ſadly followed by the hand of heaven, as this
of deteining Infants from Baptiſme. They have heard not a
few, and it may well move pity in all Readers to take notice of
their anſwers. No conſent of Hiſtory, nor authority of men,
of moſt eminent piety can work their belief of ſuch a hand of
God, giving up ſo many of their party to ſuch abominations.
I ſhall to that which they have heard from Maſter <hi>Marſhal</hi> and

                  <p>THen it farther followes by way of neceſſary Corollary, that
according to the Parents Intereſt in the Covenant, the childe
hath Intereſt in the Sacrament of Baptiſm; But all profeſſing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

by any that acknowledge a right in infants, derived from
their Parents for Baptiſm, for it is intereſt in the covenant that
gives the title to parent and infant: The Minor I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
proved. The covenant muſt either be made to appeare
to run in a more narrow channel (which I ſuppoſe will hardly
be done) that a man in Ignorance, or in Impenitency, as he does
not keep covenant, ſo he never entred covenant, or elſe this muſt
neceſſarily follow. To aſſert this by<note n="a" place="margin">Arguments evincing the right of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in this latitude.</note> Arguments.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Their children whom God owns as his peculiar people,
above others have right to Baptiſme. This cannot be denied; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe have a juſt claim, or elſe no children at all. But God
owns all in viſible profeſſion, as his people, <hi>Iſa. 1. 2. Iſa. 5. 13.
Hoſ. 4. 6. Jer. 2. 11, 13, 31, 32. Jer. 4. 22. Jer.</hi> 5. 51. therefore the
children of viſible profeſſors have right to Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Their children, that are brought forth to God, by
their parents, have right to Baptiſm; This is as plain: But viſible
profeſſors bring forth children to God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20. therefore
their children have right to Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thoſe children whoſe Parents are children of the
Kingdome of God, have their title to Baptiſme; But thoſe that
are in ſin, and in a way to be caſt out for ſin, are children of the
Kingdome, <hi>Mat. 8. 12. Mat. 21. 43. Ergo</hi> the children of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in ſin have right to Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The children of thoſe, who are themſelves Diſciples
of Chriſt, ought to be baptized; But men in ſin are Diſciples of
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:55700:232"/>
Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 66. whole Nations, among whom are many wicked
ones, are Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. The children then of thoſe
that are in ſinne, ought to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The children of thoſe that are of the number of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in the faith of the Goſpel, have right to Baptiſm: But men
in ſinne are brethren in the faith of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 11. If any
that is called a brother, be a fornicatour, or covetous, or an idolater,
or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, &amp;c.</hi> This our diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brethren will not deny to be meant of Chriſtians, therefore
their children are to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Thoſe children that are holy by reaſon of birth from
one or both beleeving parents, are to be baptized: But the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of thoſe that are in ſin may be holy by reaſon of birth of
one, or both beleeving parents, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. To clear this place,
which ſome weakly enough, have urged for the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let us
enquire who the Apoſtle means by a Beleever, and who he means
by an unbeliever, and this will ſoone be decided; if we look to
the caſe propounded by letter from the Corinthians, which he
there reſolves, and anſwers their ſcruples; That is confeſt to be
marriage between a Chriſtian and a Heathen a profeſſed Believer
and an Infidel, a man removed from an Infidel, (to take upon him
the name of Chriſt), is there a Beleever, and many of theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in <hi>Corinth,</hi> were men in ſinne. They that will have the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
there to ſet out only a juſtified and ſanctified perſon, they
muſt by unbeleever mean all unſanctified perſons, and ſo the caſe
propounded and ſatisfied, is, whether a regenerate perſon ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by the Spirit, married to one that gives not full, or at
leaſt hopeful evidences of ſanctification, may continue a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-ſociety?
whether a man of <hi>Jobs</hi> integrity might have lived
with ſuch a wiſe to whom <hi>Job</hi> was joyned? a thing that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet brought into queſtion, either by Jew or Chriſtian; and
altogether unworthy of an Apoſtles determination. The thing is
plaine,<note place="margin">Amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> that as infants have right to Baptiſme, ſo all
the infants of thoſe parents that <hi>nomine tenus</hi> are Chriſtians,
have right to Baptiſm. See more, <hi>Treatiſe of the Sacraments,
page</hi> 161.</p>
                  <p>To amplifie this in ſome particulars, and if it may be, to make it
more clear to doubting Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A life in diſtruſt of God, and rebellion againſt God, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:55700:233"/>
him to the higheſt puniſhment of the parents doth not diveſt
the child of the title to the covenant, and intereſt in the Sacrament
of initiation into the number of Chriſtians. For proof of this,
look upon that act of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when the people were got out of
the Wilderneſſe, and were brought into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Joſh.
5. 6, 7. <hi>The children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>walked fourty yeers in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
till all the people that were men of warre that came out of</hi>
Egypt <hi>were conſumed, becauſe they obeyed not the voice of the Lord;
And the children which he raiſed up in their stead, them did</hi> Joſhua
<hi>circumciſe, for they were uncircumciſed, they had not circumciſed them
in the way;</hi> you ſee what the fathers were, yet the children <hi>Joſhua</hi>
ordered to be circumciſed; Concerning their converſation, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
were enemies, but as touching the election, the choice made
of God, the iſſue is to be numbred among the beloved. Who
had a worſe father than <hi>Joſiah,</hi> yet where was there a better ſon?
A circumciſed man, who in youth began <hi>to ſeek the God of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
David, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Misbelief in a parent diveſts not the iſſue of this
birth-priviledge; though the father erre in the faith, yet the child
is not to be ſhut out of the number of beleevers. We have in this
particular the Apoſtle for a precedent, had misbelief in the parent
denuded the childe of this priviledge. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had not beene
<hi>a Jew by nature,</hi> but an Heretick, or Sectary by nature, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
converſion a Phariſee, and the ſon of a Phariſee; Scribe was a
name of office, but Phariſee the name of a Sect, and therefore Chriſt
warns to beware of the leaven, that is, of the Doctrine of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,
as of the Sadduces; Such was <hi>Pauls</hi> parentage, and yet by
deſcent and off-ſpring, he is of the people of the Jewes. What we
ſay of Phariſees, is as true of Sadduces; It is not to be doubted
but they were circumciſed perſons, and entitled their children ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Directory in Scripture for circumciſion, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by their embodying of themſelves with the people of the
Jewes, <hi>Matth. 22. 23. Acts</hi> 23. 6. The moſt ſtrict of Phariſees
took them into their ſociety, which they had not done, had they
not been men of the circumciſion, we ſee the accuſation
charged on <hi>Peter</hi> on this occaſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 2, 3. A man
tranſmits not his errors, nor his vices no more than he doth his
graces.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ignorance of needful truths, in a parent doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:55700:233"/>
the childe of this priviledge. Thoſe were the people of
God (and therefore brought forth children to God) that did pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
for lack of knowledge, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. 6. that went into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
for lack of knowledge, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. A reverend brother, giving
his reaſons why he is among his brethren ſingular in this point,
not baptizing all born in his Pariſh; one maine one is, the groſſe
ignorance among them, and that (as he ſayes) <hi>not in Cumberland,
and thoſe parts, but in Eſſex, ſuch, that if he ſhould print, his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
would ſcaree beleeve it were poſſible to be true;</hi> To which I
only ſay, I wiſh that our own experience in the places where we
live, did give us occaſion of ſuſpition, that any wrong is done
them. Therefore to let the truth paſſe unqueſtioned, I would only
wiſh him to conſider, whether there might not have been found
the like in <hi>Corinth,</hi> that Church of the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 34. Some
have not the knowledge of God, I ſpeak this to your ſhame.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there he might not have found the like among the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Hebrews, were not there thoſe that were <hi>dull of hearing, that
when for the time they ought to be teachers, they had need that one
teach them againe, which be the firſt principles of the Oracles of
God, and were become ſuch as had need of milke, and not of ſtrong
meat?</hi> yet theſe were of the Church, and therefore with them their
children.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, illegitimation of birth, adulterous copulation in the
parents, diveſteth not ſuch iſſue of this priviledge, <hi>David</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in that manner ſought in faſting and prayer his childes life,
had he believed that he muſt not have been of the ſeed of the Jews,
but of the uncircumciſed Heathen; <hi>Pharez</hi> was of ſuch a birth, yet
who bore a greater name and glory in <hi>Iſrael</hi> than he, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily?
even where the illegitimation of his birth is noted, there
the glory of his race is magnified, which is yet farther honoured
in that Chriſt according to the fleſh was made of his ſeed. That
ſeed of <hi>Abraham per eminentiam,</hi> was out of his loynes; <hi>Jepthah</hi>
indeed was driven out by his brethren, but not becauſe that he
was not of the ſeed of the Jews, and people of God, but becauſe
they would not have him to ſhare of the inheritance among them.

<hi>Titus 1. 16. They profeſſe that they know God, but in works they deny
him, being abominable, and diſobedient, and unto every good work
reprobate.</hi> The Apoſtle (we ſee) ſaw no contradiction in it; and
for mockers of Religion, <hi>Peter</hi> did not foretell them to be out of
the Church, but within the boſome of it, when he ſaid, <hi>There ſhall

much as acknowledge in the words that follow, <hi>I deny not</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>but that in ſome ſenſe, any ſuch notorious offendor may have the
eſſence and being of a member of the Church as viſible, to wit, in
this ſenſe a corrupt and rotten member fit to be cut off. A member
of the viſible Church, (though formerly an inoffenſive profeſſor of
the faith) may afterwards fall away into any of theſe notorious ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
and yet for a while ſtill retain the eſſence and being of a member
of the Church as viſible.</hi> Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> that is there oppoſed
(I ſuppoſe) will affirme no more, Reſpective to the power of
godlineſſe, there is in them no ſoundneſſe, nor yet in thoſe that
are better than theſe; Some ſay <hi>that one that is ſuch in any known
foule ſinne, to them is no better than a Heathen, as bad as a Turke,
or Pagan, and nothing at all better for the name Chriſtian.</hi> And I
ſay, that to me they are as bad, as to them, and perhaps worſe
in the eyes of God. This priviledge in which they ſtand thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed,
is an aggravation of their ſinne, and a farther provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God againſt them; <hi>When the Lord ſaw it, he abhorred
them, becauſe of the provoking of his ſonnes and of his daughters,</hi>
Deut. 32. 19. yet ſuch is Gods long-ſuffering, and forbearance
of them, that he is pleaſed to vouchſafe them farther and more
large evidences of his favour, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 30. Hieruſalem <hi>was
corrupted more than</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Samaria, <hi>in all her wayes,</hi> Ezek.
16. 47. Sodom <hi>and her daughters, had not done as</hi> Hieruſalem
<hi>and her daughters,</hi> ver. 48. Samaria <hi>had not committed halfe her
ſinnes,</hi> ver. 51. In her abominations ſhe had juſtified both of
them; yet <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> enjoyed thoſe priviledges, that <hi>Samaria</hi>
and <hi>Sodom</hi> enjoyed not; <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was in covenant, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.
when <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> were no covenant-people, but worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
they knew not what, <hi>John 4. ver. 22. Corazin</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi> Cities of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were no better in the eye of God than <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>

judgement, <hi>Matth. 11. 22. It ſhall be more tolerable for</hi> Tyre
<hi>and</hi> Sydon <hi>at the day of judgement, than for you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour;
and ſo it was with <hi>Capernaum,</hi> compared to <hi>Sodom,</hi> ver. 23. yet
<hi>Chorazin, Bethſaida, Capernaum,</hi> enjoyed thoſe priviledges from
God, that <hi>Tyre, Sydon</hi> and <hi>Sodom</hi> wanted. As the Apoſtles zeal
againſt the Samaritanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſinnes, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54, did out-ſtrip our
Saviours, when they would have fire from heaven to conſume
them; ſo our zeale out-goes Gods, when we would have ſuch

men, root and branch, parent and child ſtruck out of covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God hath ſued out any Bill of divorce againſt them, or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his Candleſtick, and taken all covenant-priviledges from them.
For the baptiſm of children of Apoſtates, there is a greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Some of reverend worth ſay, <hi>They ſee not how juſtly a Parents
Apoſtaſy ſhould deprive the childe of Baptiſme,</hi> and ſome Texts of
Scripture ſeem ſtrongly to favour that opinion, <hi>Ezek. 16. 20, 21.
Moreover, thou haſt taken thy ſonnes and thy daughters whom thou
haſt borne unto me, and theſe haſt thou ſacrificed unto them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured;
Is this of thy whoredomes a ſmall matter, that thou haſt
ſlain my children, and delivered them, to cauſe them to paſſe through
the fire for them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There could not be an higher evidence of Apoſtacy, than to
give their children in ſacrifice to a falſe god. It was one of the
higheſt acts of obedience that <hi>Abraham</hi> could teſtifie to the
Lord, and yet theſe yield it to Idol-gods; <hi>They bring forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to God, and give them to</hi> Moloch, <hi>Pſal. 106. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39.
They were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works, and
they ſerved their Idols, which were a ſnare unto them, yea they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
their ſons and daughters unto devils. And ſhod innocent blood,
even the blood of their ſonnes and of their daughters, whom they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
unto the Idols of</hi> Canaan, <hi>and the land was polluted with
blood. Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with their own inventions.</hi> Theſe in this apoſtatized from God
in covenant, yet God lookes upon them as a covenant people,
<hi>ver. 45. And he remembred for them his covenant, &amp;c.</hi> But
this ſeemes to be but a partial Apoſtaſy, taking in the worſhip of
Idols, they did not totally caſt off the worſhip of God. A line
of profeſſion was ſtill (it ſeemes) held up, God was not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
caſt off in <hi>Judah.</hi> They ſeem to be of thoſe, <hi>that ſwore by the
Lord and</hi> Malcham, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 5. keeping up the worſhip of the
true God, and yet take in the worſhip of a falſe god with him.
As for thoſe in whom Maſter <hi>Firmin</hi> inſtanceth; our Engliſhmen
now in <hi>Turkey,</hi> apoſtatized from the Faith to that Religion;
concerning whom quaeres are often put, it may ſeem equal, that as
a man comes into covenant, and his poſterity with him; So, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
rejecting the covenant, denying God as well in profeſſion,
as in his works; that he and his poſterity ſhould be out of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
Being before an holy root, to tranſmit holineſſe to his
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:55700:235"/>
ſeed, now he becomes unholy, and put out of ſuch capacity, and
is diſabled from making over any ſuch priviledge to them. But
here we need not to trouble our ſelves with the Baptiſme of ſuch,
having renounced Chriſt, they baptize not their infants in his
name. A Miniſter ſhall have none of theſe rendered to him, and
to baptize them into this body, when he well knowes they muſt
be never ſuffered to be of it, were an high taking of Gods name
in vaine, and a mockery of ſo ſacred an Ordinance. Now in
caſe a grandfather ſhall take one of theſe children, and offer it
unto Baptiſme; and being a Progenitor, ſhall undertake the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
in the Chriſtian Faith, and not in the Turkiſh abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether in this caſe there be right to Baptiſme, is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
Now theſe may be looked upon, either as meer Heathens,
in the ſame condition, as if they never had an Anceſtor in the
Faith, or elſe as iſſuing out of the loynes of mediate Anceſtors,
believing, and ſo coming from a root that hath been holy. If
conſidered in the former way, they may have a title to Baptiſme
according to many eminent Divines, by vertue of their Adoption.
Reverend Maſter <hi>Cawdrey</hi> obſerves a three-fold way to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
from <hi>Gen. 17. One is perſonal upon profeſſion of Faith
in a mans own perſon,</hi> ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> entered. <hi>A ſecond is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
when a man comes in by right derived from his Parents,</hi>
ſo <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> had title. <hi>A third, adoptive, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into the family of a Beleever according to that,</hi> Gen. 17.
12, 13. <hi>He that is eight dayes old among you, ſhall be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
every man childe in your generations, be that is born
in the houſe, or bought with money of any ſtranger which is not
of thy ſeed. He that is borne in thy houſe, and he that is bought
with thy money, muſt needs be circumciſed, &amp;c.</hi> Any bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that he would take, and adopt into his family, in ſuch caſe
had right of circumciſion: <hi>Rive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cleare of this judgement, and ſayes, he remembers that it was
ſo determined in the National Synods of the <hi>French</hi> Churches,
quoting in like manner <hi>Proſper</hi> in his ſecond Book, <hi>De vocatione
gentium,</hi> Chap. 8.<note n="a" place="margin">Aliquando filiis infidelium praeſtatur baec gratia ut bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zentur cúm oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultâ Dei pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiâ in manus piorum quomodocunque proveniunt.</note> 
                     <hi>Sometimes this priviledge is vouchſafed
to the children of Infidels, when by a ſecret providence they
into the hands of the godly.</hi> Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> I remember in his
book of Infant-Baptiſme is for it. Maſter <hi>Norton</hi> againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius</hi>
for preſent ſuſpends his judgement, <hi>page</hi> 38. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:55700:236"/>
go his way, than theirs that determine it; and in my
thoughts with ſubmiſſion to better judgements, I rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
in preſent to the contrary. Thoſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> bought
with his money, I ſuppoſe were men of years, who were to
be circumciſed and their iſſue; But whether they were not
firſt inſtructed, is the queſtion. No uncircumciſed perſon was
to be in his houſe, and whether he might compel to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
may well be diſputed. He found them explicitely in
covenant with falſe gods, and whether he might give them
the ſeale of the covenant of the true God in that ſtate, I
queſtion. It is ſaid, <hi>Gods covenant ſhall be in their fleſh,</hi> verſe
13. and that this ſhould be done, and no covenant with the
true God at all profeſſedly in their mouth, no notion of
him by way of aſſent in their heart, to me is ſtrange; I
think it implies <hi>Abrahams</hi> work, firſt in inſtructing of them
in the covenant, and upon their aſſent they were received,
and their ſeed with them. Circumciſion did denominate
them a people of God, and that is a ſtrong contradiction
to have them circumciſed, whoſe faith was in a falſe god;
and who applied themſelves to ſuch worſhip; Their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
I ſhould rather take to be perſonal, than adoptive.
Conſider them then as deſcending from the loynes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
progenitors, having fathers of their fleſh heretofore in
covenant with God, and we ſhall finde them in a better
condition than thoſe Heathens that had ever been ſtrangers.
And here the Apoſtle will help us to a diſtinction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.
28. Speaking of the Jewes cut off from the body of the
Church viſible. <hi>As concerning the Goſpel,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they are
enemies for your ſakes.</hi> Their preſent condition is as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
being alienated from God by reaſon of unbelief of the
Goſpel (which Apoſtaſy of theirs hath given occaſion to, and
made way for the calling of the Gentiles:) <hi>But as touching
the Election, they are friends,</hi> ſaith he; God hath reſpect to
them, not totally to reject them <hi>for their fathers ſake;</hi> for
the covenant which he entered with, and the love that he
ſhewed unto their fore-fathers, being beloved upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their fathers; When there is a father found to do
them that office, to take them out of the wild Olive, to put
them into the true Olive; I do not doubt, but that they
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:55700:236"/>
have title: Though Baptiſme ſhould be denied to infants reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective
to all predeceſſors, pure Heathen (notwithſtanding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
which I will not determine) yet the Apoſtle ſpeaking
ſo much in favour of Jewes, even in their ſtate of blindneſſe,
reſpective to the hope of their future call; I do not doubt but it
might be vouchſafed (upon this account of Adoption) to an
infant. Jew, if we can have any ground fairely to conclude his
deſcent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> much more where we can eaſily evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
a deſcent from parents that are Chriſtian. And this I hope
is
ſome explication of my meaning where in anſwer to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of an adverſary I ſay, <hi>That infants be capable of Baptiſm,
by deſcent from parents, either within mans memory, or beyond
it; when a line of profeſſion holdi, or is againe restored, that
the infants may be received into the viſible Church, and enjoy
the ſaving Ordinances of Chriſt Jeſus, page</hi> 68. of my anſwer;
and ſome ſatisfaction to the queſtion concerning the power of
mediate Parents, giving title to Baptiſme, where out of the caſe
of total Apoſtaſy there is ſmall difficulty. I ſhall conclude in the

Sometimes he conſeſſes himſelf at a diſadvantage, and comes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
weakly off it, <hi>page</hi> 13. Sometimes he calls for better fingers
to untie the knot that he meets with, <hi>page</hi> 32. Sometimes he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
yeelds all, as the ſtate did ſtand not onely with the Jewes,
but alſo as it doth ſtand with us, though it ought <hi>de jure</hi> to be
otherwiſe, <hi>page</hi> 34. Sometimes he profeſſes not to deny any
infants, but to delay them, <hi>page</hi> 42. Sometimes he ſayes he had
rather grapple with thoſe, who think he is too large, than with
thoſe who judge him to be too ſtreight, <hi>page.</hi> 43. Suſpecting his
errour (as indeed it doth) if Scripture may determine) to lie
on that hand. I ſhall as briefly as may be take a view of it.
He premiſes two things, <hi>page</hi> 1, 2. for the clearing of the
queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Premiſes two grounds, on which he builds his diſcourſe;
2. Puts the Queſtion as above; 3. Brings arguments ſor the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
which I ſhall here take into conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The infant that is to be baptized, if we conſider it in it ſelf
as abſtracted from the parent, gives no reaſon for it ſelfe why it
ſhould be baptized.</hi> This we willingly yield, the infant hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
title, the right claimed is in relation to the parents,
and thence I inferre the infants right is ſomewhat, that parents
can tranſmit to their children that gives the title, otherwiſe they
might have regeneration from parents, as well as Baptiſme. It is
not then inherent graces that we muſt look after, reſpective to
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:55700:237"/>
the childes intereſt, but covenant-priviledge, covenant-holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond ground is inferred from the former. <hi>All children
then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are baptized by vertue of the parent, one or both, ever
conſidering the childe in relation to the parent, being the branch of
ſuch a root, and ſo I take in the childe together with the parent.
Hence we ſay commonly, they must be children borne in the Church,
that is, of ſuch parents as are members of the Church, being a ſociety
of viſible Saints joyned together, by way of covenant, to exerciſe an
holy communion with God in Chriſt, and ſo one with another, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the order of the Goſpel: for I preſume none are ſo ſottiſh to
underſtand a Church to be that place which by a Metonymy of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
we call a Church, nor the Pariſhes that men live in which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were of Ecoleſiaſtical conſtitution.</hi> I am utterly to ſeek
what is meant by that place, which by a Metonymy of the
ſubject we call a Church: our meeting places ſeeme to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but few children are borne there; and the Authonr
ſpeaks of a Church where children are borne.<note place="margin">Covenant of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite.</note> For the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of which he ſpeaks one with another, according to the order
of the Goſpel, which he ſeemes to underſtand of a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church, conſtituting covenant, and puts into the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Church; this ſhould not have been premiſed, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
His adverſaries in this thing, know no ſuch explicite
covenant. If an implicite one will ſerve, then the Pariſh inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
(which he ſayes were never of Eccleſiaſtical conſtitution)
are all in covenant; Men that profeſſe God in Chriſt, and by
vertue of conveniency of habitation, joyne in one, in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, in the uſe of Ordinances, tacitely and implicitely
are in covenant together, and we take it to be no ſottiſh thing
to eſteeme theſe as Churches. If this be his meaning, to aſſert
onely an implicite covenant, where he ſayes page 3. (<hi>This rule
warrants any Miniſter comfortably to adminiſter that Ordinance,
Here is a parent, one or both viſibly in covenant with God, and a
viſible member of Chriſts Church; I do therefore adminiſter the ſeal
of the covenant unto this infant by vertue of this parent, according
to that Command given to</hi> Abraham, <hi>the father of believers,
with whom when the Lord entered into covenant, and laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Church viſible in his family, he took his ſeed into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with him, and commanded that they with him ſhould keep that
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:55700:238"/>
Seale of his covenant,</hi>) we freely conſent, and then the queſtion is
determined in the affirmative; I am ſure the Church of the Jewes
took in ſuch by circumciſion, that ſome would exclude
from Baptiſme. In caſe he meanes an explicite Church-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
over and above the covenant of grace, as the Jewes
had no ſuch way, ſo neither had the Apoſtles or primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
Thoſe converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. did not that firſt day of their
converſion before their Baptiſme ſet up Congregational Churches
with officers,<note place="margin">The Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians knew no expli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cite Church-Covenant.</note> they dwelt in many remote places at great diſtance
(whither they were to returne to their reſpective families,) and
therefore could not in this way embody themſelves, in one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
ſociety for exerciſe of diſcipline. Aſſoon as the Eunuch
by <hi>Philips</hi> preaching of a Jewiſh proſelyte, is made a Chriſtian
Diſciple, he ſaith to <hi>Philip, See, here is water, what doth hinder me
to be baptized?</hi> Acts 8. 36. Had <hi>Philip</hi> underſtood a neceſſity of
confederation into a Church-way, over and above the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace before Baptiſme, he had doubtleſſe informed him;
and as Chriſt ſent the Leper that he had cleanſed, to <hi>ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to the Prieſt, and offer the gift that</hi> Moſes <hi>had Commanded,</hi>
Matth. 8. 4. ſo <hi>Philip</hi> would have obſerved the Goſpel-order
appointed, and have ſent him to ſome particular conſtituted vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Church, upon his covenant to have been received, and not
hand over head, upon his bare profeſſion <hi>that he beleeved that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Christ is the Sonne of God,</hi> baptized him. When the Gentiles
had received the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Acts 10. 47. Can any
man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> had there been any ſuch rule
of a Church-covenant, orderly to have preceded, he might
eaſily have ſeen that any man, upon that account might have
forbidden it. <hi>Paul</hi> had made much more haſte (as I may ſay)
than good ſpeed, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. In baptizing the Jaylour and his
houſhold, in caſe Jeſus had ſet down an order of a preconfedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into a particular Church-ſociety. Maſter <hi>Bartlet</hi> in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of the Congregational way, ſaith, <hi>that thoſe particular inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which are produced by divers reverend Divines, of the Eunuch,
Centurions, Jaylours Baptiſme, though not belonging to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church againſt what we have laid down, are of little force and
validity, in regard that which was done to thoſe perſons was by the
hands of extraordinary officers, that were not tied to particular
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:55700:238"/>
Churches, as ordinary Paſtours and Teachers were then, and ſtill are.</hi>
But theſe perſons whom they thus baptized, were not perſons
in any ſuch extraordinary capacity, and they muſt come in, in
a Goſpel-way. This might have priviledged the Leper cleanſed
by Chriſt, from offering his gift appointed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as
it could priviledge theſe new Converts from any covenant-way
appointed by Chriſt; and the Eunuch ſaith, <hi>What doth hinder
me to be baptized?</hi> without mention of any ſpecial priviledge of
an officer extraordinary, in a way otherwiſe irregular. And the
like we may obſerve in the ſpeech of <hi>Peter.</hi> (2.) They ſhould
ſhew us where, when, and by what authority, any ordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
and Teachers tied themſelves to ſuch an order, to bring
men into a Congregational Church-way, and to baptize into ſuch
particular Church Congregational, and not into the univerſal
Church viſible. (3.) Thoſe of his judgement, may do well
to give us their thoughts of their own Baptiſme. They had no
independant right all their right was in relation to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
Their parents were not (as we conceive) thus in any
particular Church federation, perhaps they were no fit perſons in
their judgement for admiſſion, neither were they baptized by the
hands of extraordinary Officers. If their Baptiſme was null, then
they are yet to be baptized; if valid, they had then title to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme,
and others in their condition are entitled. (4.) Then
it is in the power of man, at pleaſure to keep parent and childe
from the priviledge of Ordinances, to have them paſſe as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
and Infidels, yea believing godly men and their children at
their courteſie, muſt be reputed either of the number of dogges
or of children, this cannot be denied. The majority of theſe
have power at pleaſure of admiſſion of members. And to be no
Church-member (with them) is the ſame as to be a Turke, or
Indian, <hi>page</hi> 9. And how different their judgements are, who
are fit to be received, and who are to be denied, is evident.
Some of no obſcure note have affirmed, though minded, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
minded, <hi>that to render a man capable of admiſſion into Church-memberſhip,
grace is not ſufficient, but he muſt have expreſſions,</hi> and
ſo a fathers ſlow tongue, ſhall exclude his childe from admittance
into the fellowſhip of the Saints; when upon the other hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the bare account of his fathers glib tongue, (though there be
ſcarce another commendable quality) another may be received,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:55700:239"/>
when theſe are not judged worthy of fellowſhip, who are
not of abilities to ſit in judgemeut with the Congregation,
to admit members, to paſſe ſentence upon delinquents, to
judge of Doctrines, not only to elect, but to ordain Paſtours
and Church-Officers, we may eaſily gueſſe how many they
exclude as without, whom Chriſt receives. Such a way had it
been taken, had deprived the Church of an <hi>Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi>
and many others in their age renowned; How great a provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is this to ſuch children when once of growth to joyne with
them with whom the Church rancks them? and to oppoſe with
the uttermoſt of fury, ſuch that (after the revolution of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
generations inheriting that priviledge) now do debarre
them? And how great an encouragement to joyne with ſuch in
all holineſſe, with whom they are honoured with theſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges?</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond, whether the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> are bound
by the Word of God to baptize their children which ſay they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in Jeſus Chriſt, but are groſſely ignorant, ſcandalous in their
converſations, ſcoffers at godlineſſe, and refuſe to ſubmit to
Church-Diſcipline. Our Authour puts a Queſtion, <hi>What pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
do you mean; the immediate parent onely, or the predeceſſors?
For ſuppoſe the immediate parent be as your queſtion mentions; yet
it may be the Grand-father, or ſome of the predeceſſors have been
godly.</hi> And farther ſayes, <hi>I perceive diverſe of our Divines help
themſelves here, and ſome in diſcourſe are content to loſe that ground
of the immediate parent, and flie to this.</hi> Though I ſee no reaſon
that any ſhould fly hither, in hope of help, yet it is ſtrange to me
that he ſhould ſtand for the immediate parent, excluding all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
predeceſſours, who hath ſaid enough for their power in
giving of this intereſt to the children. He ſayes, <hi>I do adminiſter
the Seale of the covenant unto this childe by vertue of this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
according to that Command given to</hi> Abraham, <hi>the father
of Beleevers, with whom when the Lord entered into covenant, and
laid the foundation of the Church viſible in his family, he took his ſeed
into covenant with him, and commanded that with him they ſhould
keepe that Seale of his covenant,</hi> When God tooke <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
into covenant and his ſeed with him, it was not onely his
immediate ſeed, but the iſſue of his fleſh at the greateſt diſtance,
Gods covenant with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> is mentioned in
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:55700:239"/>
Gods apparition to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 3. 6. and was pleaded by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
in his interceſſion with God for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 32. 13. <hi>Moſes</hi>
then, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in this confederation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yea
all <hi>Iſrael</hi> in ſucceeding ages, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 42. When the worſt of
Jewes make that plea, that they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, the Lord
Chriſt yields it, <hi>John</hi> 8. 37. and the Apoſtle concludes a holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the whole body upon that account, that the root at ſuch
a diſtance, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> were holy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16.
I know not how we can bottome any thing upon the grand Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of God, made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and exclude the mediate parent
from all power to conferre this intereſt upon poſterity. When <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
calls <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> by the name of ſonnes. <hi>Gen.</hi>
48. 9. as a father gives his bleſſing to them, putting his name,
and the names of his fathers, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> upon them, <hi>ver.</hi>
16. and 20. were they not to be reckoned for the ſonnes and ſeed
of <hi>Jacob?</hi> doth not their mediate Parent, as well as <hi>Joſeph</hi> their
immediate Father, conferre an intereſt on them? Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was
before our Authour in this tenent, and his grounds are fully
anſwered by Mr. <hi>Caudrey,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Firmins</hi> reaſons and his replies to them.</note> in his <hi>Diatribe,</hi> concerning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſme.
I ſhall onely take into conſideration our Authors

                     <hi>he yields that</hi> England had Christians in Primitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.
Thouſands of Martyrs under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> but after the
waters grew brackiſh at <hi>Rome, and brings it to us in</hi> England;
we held (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) the name Chriſtianity under the <hi>Romiſh</hi> yoke,
till of late the State threw it off, and then the people following
the State concluding, I doubt not but God had his number in
thoſe dark times; but what were thoſe few in compariſon of the
body of the people, or predeceſſours, ſince the time of the Goſpel
reſtored to its purity; God hath wonderfully appeared in
<hi>England;</hi> but thoſe who uſe the argument of predeceſſours runne
very high.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the waters grew brackiſh at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that they
gave their ſent hither; ſo did the waters of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
grow as brackiſh, yea, and of a worſe ſavour in the dayes of
<hi>Ahaz;</hi> and at thoſe times when they brought forth children to
God and gave them to <hi>Moloch, Ezek.</hi> 16. 20.</p>
                  <p>2. Neither do we look ſo farre back (when we look back as
farre as <hi>Diocleſian</hi>) as the Jewes in Chriſt time; as <hi>Paul</hi> that
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:55700:240"/>
looked as farre as <hi>Abraham</hi> in his time: yea, himſelf ſtayes not
till he come up to him, we are not neceſſitated to look ſo high.
A pedigree in a ſhorter line as to this purpoſe will ſerve our turne;
we are not tied to make it out that our Progenitors were really
godly, to conferre ſuch covenant-intereſt upon us. Primitive-Chriſtians
were admitted upon the account of Profeſſion, by our
Authours confeſſion, and not upon the account of reality of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
and they gave their poſterity intereſt. We ſee how
much reverend Maſter <hi>Hooker.</hi> ſpeaking the opinion of his party,
gives to the Churches connivance, negligence, or indulgence in
this thing: <hi>If the Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>either through connivance,
negligence, or indulgence ſhall tolerate ſuch evils, and evil perſons
in that ſtate of Church-memberſhip, they cannot then deny them the
priviledge of Members.</hi> And I dare attribute as much to Gods
connivance, his indulgence, and long ſuffering; Till he ſue
out a bill of divorce, and openly caſts a people off, (that they
be none of his Kingdome, or called by his name,) they are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and their children with them. It ſeems Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi>
judges that the Church may thus connive without ſinne; ſeeing
he diſtinguiſheth between connivance, indulgence, and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
I am ſure God may, out of juſt prerogative; And to
have the line broken off, aſſoon as the power of godlineſſe, in a
race declines, is to be infinitely above God, rigorous, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
and the ready way to bring in a ſtrange and monſtrous
confuſion. He goes on, and ſayes <hi>he will a little conſider the
Text in reference to them;</hi> and then inſtances in that in the ſecond
Commandment, <hi>ſhewing mercy unto thouſands, of them that
love me, and keep my Commandments,</hi> as though that were the
alone Text we had, to reſt upon. Though much might be ſpoke
by way of Animadverſion of his Anſwer, yet I forbeare. Uſe
may be made of that Text, to evidence that it is no unreaſonable
thing to carry on a priviledge ſo farre, from generation
to generation, and an eaſie reply made to moſt that he
hath ſpoken; Yet I build not a formal Argument upon it,
therefore I ſhall not ſpend time in it. His ſecond, third
and fourth Argument come in to fill up his Comment on
that Text,<note place="margin">2, 3, 4.</note> and therefore might have been anſwers, not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5.</note> he ſayes, <hi>that Text,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. <hi>ſeemes to tie the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:55700:240"/>
federal holineſſe of the childe to the immediate parent; doth not ſay,
the child is holy, &amp;c. by vertue of a great grandfather:</hi> And ſo it
ſeemes to me alſo. Thoſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> being new Converts, their
iſſue had none but immediate Parents, from whom they might
claime their intereſt; and by whom they might be entitled. As
the Parents themſelves did claime it from no Parents or Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
at all, their Anceſtours having no power to communicate
it; <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> had right of circumciſion onely from their
immediate Parent; <hi>Abraham</hi> had right immediately from God,
<hi>Jacob</hi> and his poſterity had right from Parents, both mediate and
immediate, and theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> from their immediate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
onely, and their children from Parents mediate and
immediate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>He ſayes.</hi> If that promiſe doth give this power to prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours,
&amp;c. then though there are none to educate this childe, (For
the ignorant profane parents will not but teach them how to break
the covenant; The predeceſſours cannot, they are dead, and are
not;) yet we muſt ſeale to this childe, &amp;c. Where do you ſee
Churches take care of ſuch children? they muſt be of ſome bigneſſe,
and underſtanding before the Church meddle with them; the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
profane perſon brings him up in ignorance and profaneneſſe,
neither will take care to have his childe inſtructed by the Church,
as experience witneſſeth too much? Anſw. <hi>I underſtand here
the covenant-promiſe, as</hi> Acts 2. 39. <hi>by vertue of which
theſe Jewes were children of the covenant</hi> Acts 2. 35. <hi>and
not with limit to the ſecond Commandment; and then ſpeak
to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Here is enough ſpoke to conclude the childes intereſt, in
caſe he ſhall be taught to break covenant, then he is in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
An <hi>Indians</hi> childe breaks no covenant with God; And
being in covenant, he is intereſſed in the priviledge of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                  <p>2. Let him make it up into formal Argument, and then it
runnes thus. That childe whoſe immediate Parents will not
bring it up in the power of godlineſſe, hath no right to Baptiſm.
This, though it carry ſome fair ſhew, with thoſe that are not able
to judge; yet it is evidently falſe, Thoſe that were <hi>witneſſe to
themſelves, that they were the children of thoſe that killed the Prophets,
were of the circumciſion,</hi> Matth. 23. 31. yea, thoſe that had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:55700:241"/>
Chriſt, were in covenant with God, and their children in
confederation, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. That counſel of the Prophet, <hi>Zach.
1. 4. Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former Prophets have
cryed, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Turne ye now from your
evil wayes, and your evil doings, &amp;c.</hi> might have been ſpared,
in caſe none had been received as Members in covenant; but
thoſe whoſe fathers took all care for their education in the power
of godlineſſe, and <hi>Stephen</hi> might have ſpared his reproof, <hi>Acts</hi>
7. 51, 52, 53. or rather had runne upon a contradiction when he
ſaid, <hi>Ye ſtiffe-necked, and uncircumciſed in hearts and eares, ye do
alwayes reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt as your fathers did, ſo do ye. Which of
the Prophets have not your fathers perſecuted? and they have ſlaine
them which ſhewed before of the coming of the juſt One, of whom ye
have been now the betrayers and murderers; who have received the
Law by the diſpoſition of Angels, and have not kept it.</hi> They ſtood
veſted with their children in that great prerogative, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1.
The caſe of ſuch children is ſad, but not deſperate: Though the
Church cannot do the whole duty incumbent on a godly Parent,
yet it takes care for the diſpenſation of thoſe Ordinances that
are ſaving, and Scripture calls by the name of Salvation. I know
ſome ſeeing the truth of title in ſuch children to the covenant,
and conſequently to Baptiſme, and therefore dare not deny them;
yet are ſo farre ſcandalized with this looſe education of children,
that they will admit it onely with this caution, that ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
for their education; and ſo thoſe of looſe life, may have
their children baptized; <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſome difference ought
to be put in all divine Ordinances, between the pure and impure for the
comfort of the godly, the cenſure of the wicked, and the edification of
all.</hi> But I wonder how this difference of pure and impure is
ſeen between childe and childe, that is tendered to Baptiſm.
As to covenant-holineſſe they are both equal, otherwiſe theſe
mens undertaking would very hardly give them admiſſion; and
as to real-holineſſe, neither have it, by communication from
their Parents; <hi>otherwiſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the Ordinances of God cannot be
kept without blot and pollution.</hi> I wonder what pollution theſe
mean; I know none in children but Original ſin, and the childe
of the beſt Parents is tainted with it; and let us take heed of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying
our ſelves with more care for preſervation of Ordinances,
than ever God himſelf took about them. If theſe, thus borne,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:55700:241"/>
have no right at all, (I ſuppoſe) they ſhould not be admitted with
any caution whatſoever. Maſter <hi>Cawdry</hi> obſerves (and ſeemes
to be of that judgement,) that ſome think this proviſo to be too
hard: I confeſſe, I am of that minde; If (notwithſtanding ſo
ſad diſcomforts in ſuch Parents) infants ſtand veſted in any ſuch
Birth-right-priviledge; why ſhould it be ſuſpended on the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
of ſuch undertakers? being by birth-intereſt Chriſtians, they
muſt not on this account paſſe for Heathens. And how hard is it
to impoſe ſuch a burden upon any that is not ready to adopt the
iſſue as his owne? and in ſuch caſe, his undertaking upon that
ground brings the charge of a father upon him. This will ſoone
grow into the bare formality of former Suſceptors, God-fathers,
and God-mothers, without any real advantage to the childe.
If by education be meant, ſuch as a godly Parent ought to give,
none will be found to do it. If onely education in the way of a
Chriſtian, as in oppoſition to Judaiſme, Heatheniſme, it needs
not to be doubted, and that implies a covenant. What farther is
deſired, muſt be leſt to the bleſſing of God, by providence on Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
The want of piety in the Parent is ſupplied by
the piety of the Church, into which the infant is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> 
                     <hi>ſaith he.</hi> If the Predeceſſour may by this promiſe give
right to Baptiſme, without the immediate Parent; then I pray you
tell us how farre we may go for this Predeceſſour? how many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Where hath Gods Word limited Miniſters, you may go to
this Predeceſſour, and no farther? 1. <hi>I know few that ſay the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour
gives right, without the immediate Parent, but all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
in a joynt way to communicate a covenant-intereſt; but
his queſtion may have an eaſie anſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. I demand in titles of Honour, and inheritance of Lands,
which men claime by deſcent from their Anceſtors, where it is
that they ſtay? It will be ſoon anſwered that they ſtay, when
they can riſe no higher, to finde any other Predeceſſours veſted
in ſuch honours, or ſuch inheritance. Some can make no claim
at all from Parents, they are the firſt of their houſe, of honour
or inheritance. This was the caſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
from <hi>Terah;</hi> ſuch was the caſe of the Primitive Converts,
and ſuch is the caſe of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that now by a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
are converted by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Some can go no farther
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:55700:242"/>
then their immediate Parents; they were the firſt in honour, or
that gained an inheritance to their houſe. This was the caſe of
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of thoſe children called by the Apoſtle, holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
7. 14. and will be the caſe of the children of the <hi>Indian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
Others can riſe to the third or fourth generation; others
can go as high as the Conqueſt; ſome can claime beyond
the Conqueſt, by deeds beyond date: ſo it is with ſome
Chriſtians, all may go as high as Anceſtours have been in
Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eightly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">8.</note> If by vertue of that promiſe Predeceſſours may
without the immediate parent give right to Baptiſme, then
the children of an immediate parent apoſtatized from the
Faith, and excommunicated from the Church, may be
baptized.</p>
                  <p>I have ſpoke already to the children of Apoſtates,<note place="margin">The intereſt of infants of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate perſons in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme.</note> and as to
the children of excommunicate perſons, I readily yield his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
that I may baptize them, againſt which, he thus farther
reaſons.</p>
                  <p>If I may baptize the children of an excommunicate parent, then I
may baptize the children of one who is no Member of a Church, (for ſo
is the excommunicate perſon); ſo conſequently the children of a Turk
or Indian, for they are no members of a Church, and the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
perſon is no other, in reſpect of his communion in Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, if excommunication be onely out of a particular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
congregation (as ſome ſay,) then the reply is eaſie, being
thus excommunicate his right, in the Church univerſal viſible,
ſtill remaines, and into this, it is that we admit Members by
Baptiſme, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. otherwiſe a Chriſtian were a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
reſpective onely to one congregation, and that
congregation falling, his Chriſtianity muſt fall with it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken into a new one, he muſt be alſo admitted-anew by
Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>But I farther anſwer. A Church-Member may be conſidered,
either <hi>quoad jus ad rem,</hi> or <hi>quoad jus in re;</hi> either reſpective to a
fundamental proper right, or a preſent perſonal actual fruition
of his intereſt. An excommunicate man in the former ſenſe is a
Church-Member, not in the later; This excommunication is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration,
not a confiſcation. He himſelf is ſuſpended from
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:55700:242"/>
preſent benefit, not cut off from all title, as ſeveral wayes may
be made to appear.</p>
                  <p>1. The Text ſaith, <hi>Let him be as an Heathen or a Publican</hi> (in
reſpect of ſociety with him or familiarity, ſaith Maſter <hi>Cawdrey,
Diatribe pag.</hi> 218.) not an Heathen and Publicane. That Text,
2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 14. is ordinarily underſtood of Excommunication; yet
there the caution is added, <hi>Count him not as an enemy, but admoniſh
him as a brother,</hi> verſ. 15. A brother is a Church-member, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
perſon is a brother. That which is for cure, not
only of the body, but of the member in particular, is not a total
diſmembring: But this ſentence is for cure of the particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

man tranſmits not his perſonal vices, neither fault nor guilt, no
more than his graces. And for the ſentence that cannot reach
the childe, I never read that Church-cenſures were like that
plague laid upon <hi>Gehazi,</hi> to cleave to him and to his ſeed. In any
legal proceeding, the childe is not to be puniſhed for the fathers
fault; there was a Law againſt it, <hi>Deut. 24. 16. The fathers ſhall
not be put to death for the children, neither ſhall the children be put to

25. 34. and we read not that any Eccleſiaſtical cenſure ſhould
tranſcend it. The child of a thief is not committed with him to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
&amp; I ſee no reaſon that he ſhould be committed with him to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:
I ſay then there is right to Baptiſm in the child of an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

                  <p>
                     <hi>As to the third, our Authour; 1. Premiſes a queſtion,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this bare profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, (though Parents be
groſſely ignorant, ſcandalous, and refuſe to ſubject to Church-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline)
ſufficient to make a man, and continue him a Member of the
Church viſible. <hi>And then proceeds to arguments, as to his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
I wonder how he can imagine that it makes any thing
to his queſtion; and in caſe it were wholly yielded him, whether
thence he could draw his concluſion, that Miniſters in</hi> England
<hi>ſhould not baptize the infants of all that profeſſe the Faith in
Chriſt Jeſus. He confeſſeth in this queſtion he hath diſadvantage.</hi>
For if a man be looked upon (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) as a viſible Saint, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
a Member of a true Church; if that Member be very ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and the Church let him alone and not deale with him, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
may challenge any Ordinance in the Church, both Baptiſme and
Lords Supper. But I conceive ſuch a perſon is not ſufficiently quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to make a Member of a Church, nor ought to be continued a
Member of the Church; but the Church ought to ſeek to reforme
him, or if not to caſt him out: ſo that if the Church will let ſuch a
perſon alone, and give him theſe Ordinances, there will be guilt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon that Church.</p>
                  <p>Here, is his acknowledgement that they are continued Church-Members,
though they ſhould not be continued, and ſee what
he hath further; <hi>It is true, the wicked Jewes being members of
that National Church, ſo long as their Memberſhip held; they might
challenge circumciſion, ſo for wicked perſons ſo long as they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
members, and the Church lets them alone, they may challenge
Baptiſm,</hi> and ſo upon his own grounds, they may of right chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
it, and Miniſters then muſt needes do wrong in caſe they
deny it, and ſo in all mens judgements, the queſtion is concluded
in the Affirmative; yea, ſhould the Church paſſe to the higheſt
of her cenſures, through all that is allowed to the higheſt top,
yet ſtill the perſon under cenſure continues in a fundamental
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:55700:243"/>
right of Memberſhip, though debarred of preſent fruition, and
ſo their infants entituled, as we have ſeen, to Baptiſme. His
Arguments are worthy of examination, in which he concludes
ſuch a one is not fit to be a Member.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arguments to carry the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative anſwer.</note> Members of Churches according to the Goſpel are Saints
viſible: But ſuch a perſon as the queſtion mentions, is not a viſible
Saint: Ergo. <hi>The Minor he proves,</hi> Such as will ſay that ſuch a
perſon as the Queſtion mentions is a viſible Saint, I thinke his eyes
are not good. He that tells me, the Saints which <hi>Paul</hi> mentions in
thoſe places were no other than ſuch a perſon as is in the Queſtion, he
muſt pardon me, though I beleeve him not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Viſible Saint, is taken, either in regard of Separation for,
and dedication to God, or for real qualifications according to
the power of godlineſſe, in the firſt ſenſe, ſuch are real Saints,
that he mentions and rejects, in which ſenſe we have ſhewn
[Saint] to be frequently taken, and ſuch were moſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> there being few that had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
their garments, and many ſuch in the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi>
In the ſecond ſenſe (and I know not a third) his eyes are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than mine, that can determine concerning them. Inward
graces onely make a real Saint, and theſe to me are inviſible:
if he meanes ſo far as mens judgements can upon any fair ground
conclude that they are ſuch, then the Apoſtles will be involved
in our guilt, who hand over head admitted members the ſame
day they were converted, being in foul ſins, and never ſtaying
time to make judgement of the hopeful truth of their graces.
<hi>Paul</hi> calls all thoſe that he perſecuted, Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.
10. So doth <hi>Ananias, Acts</hi> 9. 13. all thoſe for whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
converſion he ordered and made Collections 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1.
And theſe were ſome of them as bad as any that in his Epiſtles he
reproves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If a bare profeſſion in Christ be ſufficient to make a
member of a Church, then no perſon can juſtly be excommunicated
out of a Church for the vileſt ſins or hereſies, provided he doth but
hold this profeſſion of his faith, the conſequence is cleare, the perſon
is the ſame which he was when you took him into the Church. <hi>The
conſequence is clearely erroneous: for he made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of his faith, and not of ſin, as we ſee in</hi> Simon Magus.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>He that manifestly oppoſeth Chriſt in his viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:55700:244"/>
is not fit to be a member of a Church. But ſuch a perſon as the
queſtion mentions doth manifestly oppoſe Chriſt in his viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Ergo,</hi> Not fit to paſſe without cenſure, ſhould have been
added: but whiles he acts rebellion, he profeſſeth ſubjection and
in the Apoſtles language is a profeſſor, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. Having thus
made way he propounds ſeveral Arguments, that Miniſters
by the Goſpel are not to baptize the children of ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                  <p>We come now to our Authours arguments; Firſt, <hi>Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as</hi> de jure <hi>ought, and</hi> de facto <hi>are excluded by godly Miniſters
from the Lords Supper, ought alſo to be excluded from their childrens
Baptiſme; But ſuch perſons as the Queſtion mentions</hi> de jure <hi>ought,
and</hi> de facto <hi>are excluded from the Lords Supper:</hi> Ergo. The Major
is proved, <hi>If Baptiſme doth ſeale to the ſame covenant which the Lords
Supper doth, and doth ſignifie and ſeale as great bleſſings and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
as the Lords Supper doth, then thoſe who are excluded from
the Lords Supper, ought alſo to be excluded from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r childrens Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme:
But the Antecedent is true:</hi> Ergo. <hi>The Conſequent.</hi> This
is Maſter <hi>Blackwoods</hi> argument to keep infants from Baptiſme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are kept from the Supper: And if it be of any validity
to ſerve our Authors turn, it is of as great force for Maſter <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood;</hi>
Give me leave in Maſter <hi>Blackwoods</hi> behalfe to urge it in
this manner, with the leaſt change of words that is poſſible:
If Baptiſme doth ſeal to the ſame covenant which the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
doth, and doth ſignifie and ſeale as great bleſſings and
priviledges as the Lords Supper doth: then thoſe that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the Lords Supper ought alſo to be excluded from
Baptiſme; But all infants are excluded from the Lords Supper
<hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe they are infants; and therefore they are to
be excluded from Baptiſme. When Maſter <hi>Firmin</hi> hath given
a faire and full anſwer to this Syllogiſme, he may eaſily fit it to
his own, to give like ſatisfaction. An infant in covenant may
be admitted by that ſigne and ſcale, in the uſe of which he is
meerely paſſive, and yet be kept back on the account of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
from that ſign and ſeale, which the Participants muſt actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
improve for their ſpiritual benefit, and conſequently a
Parent may put a preſent bar to his actual admiſſion (by reaſon of
preſent guilt) to the one, when his innocent infant can put no
barre to his admiſſion to the other. The Parent ſtands <hi>de jure</hi>
                     <pb n="473" facs="tcp:55700:244"/>
entituled, when for the preſent he may be for his ſpiritual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<hi>de facto</hi> ſuſpended. Another reverend Authour hath made
uſe of this argument from the uniformity of the ſervice of
God in general, and in particular from the uniformity in the
Sacraments to another purpoſe; not to exclude any infants at
all who deſcend from Chriſtian Parents, from Baptiſme, but for
admiſſion of all viſible Church-Members, not under the ſentence
of Excommunication, to the Lords Supper. As one from the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion
of Parents from the Lords Supper would conclude the
ſuſpenſion of infants from Baptiſm; So, the other from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of all infants without difference to Baptiſm, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
not onely a juſt warranty, but alſo a neceſſity of anſwerable
admittance of their Parents to the Lords Supper: <q>Let our Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
(<hi>ſaith he</hi>) anſwer, Why do you allow a <hi>Syntax</hi> in
the ſervice of God beſides, and bring in a <hi>Quae genus</hi> of <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males</hi>
and <hi>Heteroclites</hi> onely at this Ordinance? let ſome of our
Presbyterians anſwer how can we admit of children as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the viſible Church being borne of Chriſtian parents unto
Baptiſme, and yet turne away the parents of thoſe children
from the Sacrament? Thoſe that have gone about to anſwer
this, had better haply have ſaid nothing: for our free courſe
of Baptiſme, and a denial of this is ſuch a ſeam-rent, as will
never be handſomely drawn up, though ſtitcht together; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
in yielding the one, they have granted the other;</q>
As to this paſſage, I firſt marvel how this is laid to the charge of
Independents, that they allow a <hi>Syntax</hi> in the whole ſervice of
God beſides, and bring in <hi>Anomalaes</hi> and <hi>Heteroclites,</hi> onely at
this Ordinance; namely, the Lords Supper; when it is plain that
they have as many <hi>Heteroclites</hi> in Baptiſme as the Lords Supper.
And in both the Sacraments (as to thoſe that they judge admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible)
they keep the form as whole as himſelf contends it ought
to be kept, how many rents ſoever they may make beſides. The
ſame latitude that they hold in admiſſion of parents to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
they hold in admiſſion of children to Baptiſme. And for
Presbyterians, their admiſſion of infants to the one, will by no
meanes conclude them under any neceſſity of admiſſion of the
parents to the other Sacrament; Nor on the contrary will their
ſuſpenſion of parents, conclude any neceſſity of like ſuſpenſion of
infants; Every tub muſt ſtand on its own bottome, every one
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:55700:245"/>
muſt beare his own burden; when parents divolve a covenant-ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
they do not divolve a covenant-breach upon their children.
And I deſire to know how he will keep up any ſuch uniformity
that he contends for, according to that which I conceive to be
his own opinion. Perſons under Excommunication are confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be uncapable of the Lords Supper; I deſire to learne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that ſentence, cut off from the Church root and branch?
Whether it be a ſentence perſonal or hereditary? I much miſtake
my Authour, in caſe he will maintaine the latter, that that ſword
is held out with ſo keen an edge, to lop off both parent and child;
If he admit the former, than the ſame rent is made, of which he
ſo much complaines. Presbyterians that keep thoſe perſons from
the Sacrament as a degree of puniſhment in order to that
ſentence of Excommunication (as they uſe to ſpeake) whom
they judge to be in a way deſerving it, and admit their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
to Baptiſme, make no other manner of rent in the
worſhip of God, than thoſe that keep back perſons under
actual excommunication, and give the like admiſſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.
The ſtate of Parent and childe reſpective to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is homogeneal. If the root be holy, the branch is
holy, and ſo <hi>è contra,</hi> yet the parent by his miſdemeanour
may incur that cenſure of which his infant is not deſerving.
His argument ſhould run thus, If the guilty parent be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
of a priviledge, then the innocent childe ought to
be debarred likewiſe: me thinks a difference might be put
between a ſcandalous parent that is active, and an innocent
childe that is paſſive; a parent that cannot, will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it to his comfort, but to his judgement, and a child
that cannot miſ-improve it; <hi>My Argument</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>runs
upon the firſt ſuppoſition, that the childe brings nothing with
it, conſidered as abſtracted from the parent, but it is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
gives the right.</hi> And the parent conferres right in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
Though he breakes covenant, yet conferres not
the tranſgreſſion of it; the Argument were as good that the
childe muſt neceſſarily be admitted to the Lords Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the father did worthily receive it. If it be ſaid, the father
is worthy, ſo is not the childe; ſo we ſay, the father is unworthy of
the one, <hi>i.e.</hi> tenders himſelf unworthy, and ſo doth not the child
of the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="475" facs="tcp:55700:245"/>
The ſecond Argument. <q>Such parents as if they themſelves
were now to be baptized, ought not to be baptized, cannot
juſtly challenge Baptiſme for their children, neither are we
bound to adminiſter it. But ſuch parents as the Queſtion men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
if they now were to be baptized, ought not to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</q>
                     <hi>Ergo.</hi> This argument is of the ſame ſtamp with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and needs no other anſwer, The parent hath contracted a
great load of guilt, of which the infant is innocent; This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
well followed home might unbaptize a great part of
thoſe that are of this judgement, and render all their priviledges
in Church-Ordinances fruitleſſe, for want of a previous
Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>The third argument. <q>If Miniſters in baptizing are bound to hold
to their Commiſſion, then the children of ſuch parents as the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
mentions, are not to be baptized. But the Antecedent is true,
none will deny that; <hi>Ergo.</hi> The conſequence is true. Miniſters by
their Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19 (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>)
are bound to baptize Diſciples, but theſe are no Diſciples, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
My argument tends to this, If the parent be not a Diſciple, the
childe is none: But ſuch a parent is none, <hi>Ergo.</hi> his childe is
none.</q> Here he ſayes, <hi>the Anabaptiſts triumph,</hi> and well they
may, if there be any ſtrength in this argument. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>we can eaſily diſtinguiſh;</hi> and I ſay we can diſtinguiſh as eaſily.
Diſtinctions ſufficient may be ſeen, <hi>chap.</hi> 38. where it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
made good that theſe in queſtion are Diſciples, Diſciples as
to the participation of Ordinances; Even a truantly untoward
boy is of the number of Scholars, and, as he well deſerves the laſh,
ſo he hath the priviledges of the School.</p>
                  <p>The fourth argument. <q>To adminiſter the Seale of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace to a child by vertue of him who is viſibly in
covenant with Satan, muſt needes be a prophaning of the
Ordinance. But to adminiſter Baptiſme to a childe by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of ſuch a one as the queſtion mentions, is to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the Seal of the covenant of grace to a child by vertue of
one who is viſibly in covenant with Satan. <hi>Ergo. The
minor is thus by him proved.</hi> A perſon groſſely ignorant in
the fundamentals of Religion, his courſe of life, his trade
is to live in ſinne, ſcandalous, &amp;c.</q> What ſhall we ſay of ſuch
a one, though he doth not formally make a covenant with the
Devil, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="476" facs="tcp:55700:246"/>
To be viſibly in covenant, and formally enter no covenant, is
little leſſe than a contradiction: put the argument into form. To
adminiſter the Seale of the covenant of Grace to a childe, by
vertue of him that is formally in covenant with God, and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
does ſervice to Satan, muſt needs be a prophaning of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
and then the weakneſſe of his argument will appeare vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and no viſibility of a covenant with Satan found. I do not
know a man or woman in the world, whoſe childe I could refuſe
on this account. Thoſe to whom our Saviour ſpeaks in the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
language, <hi>Joh. 8. 44. You are of your father the Devil, and the
luſts of your father ye will do,</hi> were men in covenant with God,
and had their children initiated with the ſigne and ſeal of the
covenant, he farther ſaith, <hi>I wonder how Miniſters pray, when
they baptize the childe of ſuch a one, they cannot but have ſome
eye to Gods covenant, and do we not mention ſo much to the
Lord, that he having taken the parent into covenant with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he doth alſo the ſeed of the parent, and ſo we plead the
covenant, and a bleſſing, &amp;c. but when a godly Miniſter ſhall
carry the parent in his heart thus, doth not his heart check him,
trouble him, in the thought of the parent?</hi> They may well pray
that God will make his Ordinances (through his Spirit) of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that the infant of a covenant-breaking father, may be a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-keeping
childe, that ſuch an <hi>Abaz</hi> in covenant, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
covenant, may have an <hi>Hezekiah</hi> keeping covenant; ſuch an
<hi>Ammon,</hi> a <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and this without the leaſt check of conſcience.
This is frequently heard of God, and prayers for the children of
godly parents frequently denied: <hi>David</hi> hath an <hi>Ammon</hi> and
<hi>Abſalom, Jehoſhaphat</hi> a <hi>Jehoram</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> a <hi>Jehoaz;</hi> Their
conſcience would infinitely more check them, (if the word
regulate their conſciences) when providence conferres
priviledges of Ordinances on ſuch an infant to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
where ſalvation is, upon ſo weak, and as to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
unheard of plea, as his fathers tranſgreſſion to keep it
out.</p>
                  <p>For a fifth Argument. He hints two things which he would
have ſeriouſly taken into examination, though he ſayes he
will not put them into form. 1. <q>How exceedingly this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
is ſleighted, abuſed through this heedleſſe adminiſtring
of the Ordinance; for we ſee perſons never minde the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:55700:246"/>
beforehand, nor after: But come let us have our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
baptized, and that is all; if they can make a feaſt, and
drink after it, that is well.</q> This is the argument of <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>
againſt infant-Baptiſme; Becauſe ſome Reverend Divines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
that few improve their Baptiſme received in infancy, to
any ſpiritual advantage to their ſouls, therefore it is in vaine to
Baptize infants. One is like the other, in Ordinances of God,
to reaſon from the abuſe, to the caſting of them aſide. Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingers
of Pſalmes (which himſelfe profeſſes to oppoſe) may
reaſon in this ſort, and upon like ground ſome have warned men
out of Chriſt not to pray, they ought to forbeare till they are in
Chriſt. And when a natural man bleſſes God for a good crop,
that it were as good that he curſed him. If men were diſpoſed
to wrangle, here doubtleſſe were more colour againſt ſuch mens
performances of duties, in which onely themſelves are intereſſed,
than againſt parents tender of their infants to an Ordinance, in
which of right they are entitled, though they lay not to heart a
right and pious way of performance of it. <q>Beſides, (<hi>ſaith he</hi>)
it is ſtrange to ſee how we jumble the moſt holy and prophane
men together; If Maſter <hi>Greenham,</hi> Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> Maſter
<hi>Rogers,</hi> Maſter <hi>Dod,</hi> or whom you will, ſhould come and
bring their children to be baptized, let the moſt ignorant ſot,
drunkard, ſwearer, uncleane perſon, ſcorner of godlineſſe,
&amp;c. come, he ſhall have his childe baptized as well as they.
Have they their children taken into covenant? ſo have I ſayes
the drunkard, ſwearer, &amp;c. ſhall we owne all theſe men alike
under the covenant ſo as to give the ſeale of the covenant a like
to all?</q> This many a time hath been in my thoughts, and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
did I ever receive more full ſatisfaction, Not one of theſe
holy men, would have made any ſuch complaint, and in caſe
the children of ſuch ſhould meet in this Ordinance, I could as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
difference them by their viſage and features, as I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
to their ſeveral intereſts or priviledges. Parents are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, as long as they keep up the name and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſtians; the one with all care walks up to the termes
of the covenant, and the other are as looſe and careleſſe in it:
Maſter <hi>Greenham,</hi> Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> could not tranſmit to their
children their graces; Neither do theſe tranſmit their perſonal
wickedneſſe: Look into the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> and call
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:55700:247"/>
out the moſt deſerving Patriots, ſet againſt them <hi>Verres, Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi>
or who you will, freedome of birth, intereſt in native pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
is like to the iſſue of either, and ſo it is in the Church of
God, the Common-weale of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and it can be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
if there be any priviledge divolved from parent
to childe; And when this falls, infant-Baptiſme falls
together with it; nothing in the childe (as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour

The aggravation of the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> complaint is, that
<hi>the Heathens are come into thine inheritance, the dead bodies
of thy ſervants have they given to be meat unto the foules of the
heaven, the fleſh of thy. Saints unto the beaſts of the Earth,
Pſalme</hi> 79. 1, 2, 3. The whole body of ſuch a people, root
and branch, ſtand in relation to God as the inheritance, the
ſervants, the Saints of God; ſuch inſcriptions we finde in
Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, not one of the whole body is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

Enough hath been ſaid to make it to appeare that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination

5. As it is accounted an happy work to daſh the little ones
of <hi>Babylon</hi> againſt the wall, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 137. 9. becauſe of the
hoſtility of that Nation againſt God and his people: ſo it
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:55700:248"/>
is a like execration to intermeddle with the little ones of
<hi>Sion,</hi> by reaſon of the holineſſe of ſuch a people, their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-relations
in which they ſtand intereſſed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.

God obſerves every carriage of the adverſary towards them
in miſery, they ſpeak not a word but God hath it againſt
them; when Ammonites, Tyrians, cry Aha, againſt the

it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26. 2. 36. 2. Not a proud word that they utter

limit onely to the perſonally righteous, but all that are

in a righteous cauſe. The holy anointing oile did make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
when yet too often the man was wicked, and therefore
<hi>David</hi> looked upon <hi>Saul</hi> as the Lords Anointed. It holds
in Analogy and proportion unto all that have any unction
from God, as all the called of God have. When they
were but a few in number, yea very few, and ſtrangers;
when they <hi>went from one Nation to another, from one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

Anointed, Pſalme</hi> 105. 12, 13, 14, 15. All the people of
God have that Anointing from God, that none may dare
to intermeddle for their harme. God promiſes his people
that dwell in <hi>Sion,</hi> that the burthen of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

The danger of intermeddling with any is with us a like:
Even Papiſts and the worſt of men that are called Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
are thus of a people that are called Gods people,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:55700:249"/>
and go by the name of Chriſtians. For anſwer I ſhall not
enter upon that controverſie, what there is of the being of
a Church under the Papacy. The Papacy it ſelf is none of
it, but onely a botch bred in it, and cleaving to it; onely
this I ſay, That he that ſhall oppoſe a Papiſt, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Chriſtian, ſhall bear his ſinne, and that upon the
grounds that have been given. Though a Papiſts damnable
errors in the faith ſhut him out from the happineſſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
yet ſuch an adverſaries perſecution renders him guilty
of oppoſing the faith of Chriſt Jeſus. And he that follows
with injuries a carnal Proteſtant, becauſe of profeſſion of the
ſincerity of Religion, in oppoſition to Antichriſtianiſme,
is formally guilty of perſecution. The hearers reſembled
to the rocky ground ſuffer perſecution for the Word, as doth
the good ground that brings forth fruit with patience, <hi>Mat.</hi>
13. 21. But to come home with more cleare ſatisfaction.
A people of foully polluted Ordinance, ſtanding in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to a people of a pure and untainted way, are as a
people void of Ordinances, are as a people without God in
compariſon. The oppoſition of the purity of his ſervice,
God accounts as the oppoſition of his great name, though
it be by a people that go under that name of his people.
And therefore though <hi>Elijah</hi> take ſo much to heart the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

as Gods Altars, when it was done by <hi>Iſrael</hi> apoſtatizing and

from the mouth of God did cry out againſt that Altar, which
<hi>Jeroboam</hi> erected, and foretold the deſtruction of it, and
the ſlaughter of the Prieſts that offered upon it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
13. 2. and with what honour that act of <hi>Joſiah</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in accompliſhment of this prophecy, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 15.
and the brand that lies upon <hi>Jeroboam</hi> himſelf in bringing
in that worſhip of his, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 9. ſcarce the like on
any man in Scripture, the man of ſinne onely excepted, the
high phraſes alſo in which this worſhip is ſet out, making
Prieſts for the high places, and devils, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 14, 15.
with the heighth of guilt to which he roſe, in caſting the
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:55700:249"/>
                     <hi>Levites</hi> out from executing the Prieſts office, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. 6.
And howſoever God often calls that people of the ten
tribes by the name of his people as having Ordinances,
though miſerably polluted, yet in oppoſition to <hi>Judah</hi> where
more pure Ordinances were enjoyed, they are ſaid to be
without God, without a teaching Prieſt, and without the
law, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 3. And fighting againſt <hi>Judah</hi> (who could
reckon up the particulars of the Ordinances of God in their
purity) they are charged to fight againſt the Lord God of
their fathers, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 12. To come nearer home in an
inſtance. If the Turkiſh power ſhould fall upon a Popiſh
State, under the name and notion of Chriſtians, they were
guilty with <hi>Saul</hi> of perſecuting the Lord Jeſus. If this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
State fall upon a reformed Nation, they are much
more guilty; A fouler ſinne for a people of God in name
and title, to perſecute his people in truth, than for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſtrangers to God, to perſecute a people onely in name
and title. Scripture prayers againſt Heathens we may fitly
apply in our ſufferings under the hands of Papiſts. <hi>Pilate</hi>
might have been guilty of perſecution of a Phariſee, under
the notion of a Jew, and yet that Nation was much more
guilty in delivering up Chriſt into the hands of <hi>Pilate,</hi> though
Chriſt had been no greater than the meaneſt of his Diſciples.
A Papiſt perſecuting a formal carnal Proteſtant, under no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a man proteſting againſt Idolatrous wayes, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes
and perſecutes that faith which he holds in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt thoſe Antichriſtian tenents. This man being thus
perſecuted, perſecuting another for the power of godlineſſe,
profeſſing the ſame truth is equally, ye more guilty. The
very ſinne of <hi>Cain</hi> againſt his brother <hi>Abel, 1 John</hi> 3. 12.
their Religions were both one and the ſame, but <hi>Cains</hi> was
onely, in forme, and <hi>Abels</hi> in power. The reſult of the
whole is to let us ſee what it is to oppoſe a people under
any notion of Gods people, upon any ſuch account as
belonging to Chriſt. A man may have his reward, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to any in the name of a Diſciple, though he to
whom he gives be ſuch as God will never owne for a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and anſwerably may incurre vengeance in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of one under ſuch a name, though (with thoſe

ſeed of the ſinners of the Gentiles doomed both by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
and the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Pſalm. 79. 6. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10. 25. Pour out
thy wrath on the heathen that have not known thee, and upon
the families that call not upon thy name; they might with <hi>Rachel</hi>
weep for their children, and refuſe to be comforted, becauſe for
eternity they are not. But we finde God more rich in mercy,
entring covenant with his and their ſeed, Chriſt himſelfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
them in their infancy, and taking them into his ſpecial
love, as thoſe that bear his name: and though death ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their Baptiſme, whereby they have an actual intereſt in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Church-priviledges, yet he that hath appointed Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:55700:251"/>
is not tied to them, but where he hath entered covenant can
ſave without them. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth that the deſire of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme
in one that is in the number of the <hi>Catechumoni</hi> (inſtructed
in the principles of Chriſt, and not baptized) doth ſave, though
the text <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. ſo much urged by that party againſt the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of infants, underſtood with their Comment be in the
letter againſt it; why then ſhould not that grace which would
ſhew it ſelfe in like deſires, when the perſon is of capacity, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
for ſalvation in like manner? Finding this love in God, theſe
bowels in Chriſt, we may ſafely conclude, that children have bliſſe,
parents have comfort, parents and children have their intereſt
in Church-Ordinances and Adminiſtrations.</p>

preſent unto thee a Sermon with

I know the memory of his Name, will be
very gratefull and welcome to ſuch who were

laid to heart, the deportment of many at that

                  <p>valedictory Sermon, we know not whether the
<hi>matter,</hi> or the <hi>affection</hi> in the delivering of it, be
more admirable: It's milk that cometh hot from
the breaſt; excellent matter, without hearty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
is like a Meſſenger without feet, and a
Bird without wings. I ſhall not make a Sermon
upon his Sermon, onely in the general; by that
diſcourſe we have a deſcription of a <hi>Paſtor</hi> and
<hi>Officer</hi> in the Church, <hi>in Idea</hi> and <hi>in ſubjecto: In
Idea,</hi> or in the <hi>Theſi,</hi> there the Apoſtle deſcribeth
ſuch by their name and titles, they are <hi>Overſeers</hi>
and <hi>Elders, v.</hi> 17. from the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> the Holy
Ghoſt hath made them ſo, from the <hi>relation they
are in:</hi> The People are their Flock, and they are
Gods Church. And laſtly, from the <hi>dignity and
high thoughts put upon them by Chriſt,</hi> they were
purchaſed with his own blood, ſhall we think our
labor, our pains, our ſweat, too much, when Chriſt
thought not his blood too much?</p>
                  <p>To enter upon the Controverſie who theſe <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
and <hi>Overſeers</hi> were, is repugnant to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
at this time: Then you have this office <hi>in
ſubjecto, in Hypotheſi;</hi> in the practice of it, you have
the rule of a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and the example of a <hi>Ruler,</hi>
and that is in <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf: O the <hi>zeal, watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
the <hi>diligence,</hi> the <hi>courage,</hi> the <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>aime</hi>
and <hi>ends,</hi> which he profeſſeth in his Miniſterial
diſcharge! not that he ſpeaketh theſe for oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but imitation; for he would not have ſaid
thus much of himſelf, ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi> on the place,
but that hereby he would leave a <hi>patern</hi> or <hi>form of
life</hi> to all ſucceſſors; Inſomuch, that no Miniſter
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55700:266"/>
reading <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſions of himſelf in this place,
but may cry out, O me! a clod of earth to ſuch
a Star, Ice to ſuch a Fire, a worm to ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel!
Though he were a <hi>Paul,</hi> as ſome think his
name denoteth, little in ſtature of his body, yet
he was a Gyant in Gifts and Graces, ſo that Papiſts
themſelves cannot but give the pre-eminence to
<hi>Paul</hi> above <hi>Peter,</hi> in reſpect of Doctrine and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
abilities: He was the <hi>earthly Angel,</hi> the
<hi>Cor Chriſti,</hi> the <hi>Tuba Evangelii,</hi> as the Ancients
call him; yet I am not of <hi>Amyraldus</hi> his minde,
<hi>conſider.</hi> in <hi>cap. 7. ad Rom.</hi> who denying the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the ſeventh of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
perſonally of <hi>Paul,</hi> thinking this would
be injurious to the Grace of God ſanctifying of
him, and making him ſo eminent a Servant in his
Church: He affirmeth, that if God pleaſed ſo to
adorn <hi>Paul</hi> with the gifts of the Spirit, that he
ſhould in this life arrive at that fulneſs and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of holineſs, which other Believers obtain
no where but in Heaven, that thereby he might be
propounded as a perfect example to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and his Miniſtry be more happily efficacious;
here was not (ſaith he) any thing to be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy:
But though we grant <hi>Paul</hi> to have an el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Brothers portion in the Graces and Gifts of
Chriſt, ſo that if no Miniſter could be ſaved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he were a <hi>Paul,</hi> wo be to us all; yet that <hi>Paul</hi>
was not above the combate of the fleſh and ſpirit
within him, appeareth partly <hi>in that careful</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down of his body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. leſt ſin ſhould
prevail; as alſo in thoſe buffetings of Satan which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55700:267"/>
he was exerciſed with, that he might not be lifted
up above meaſure, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. Well, however
it be, the Apoſtle having both by rule and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as you heard deſcribed what a Miniſter or
Paſtor is to be, we have the conſequent of this
in my Text: When he had thus ſpoken, thus of
himſelf, and thus of a Goſpel-Miniſter, he kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down and prayed.</p>
                  <p>There are two actions of the body mentioned
in Prayer, which denote that excellent deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that ſhould be at that time in the ſoul; kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the body, that denoteth ſelf-humiliation;
lifting up the hands, that implieth faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence:
Thus <hi>deſcendendo aſcenditur,</hi> how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do the people of God keep theſe two Graces
co-operating together, but either their Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
abateth their Faith, or their Faith hindreth
their Humiliation; both theſe together are the
<hi>Calidum</hi> and the <hi>Humidum,</hi> which maintain the life
of holy Duties; he Prayed as well as kneeled, for
that is the onely key to open Heaven, that is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
Harp, to allay all thoſe unruly affections that
are apt to diſturb us.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, here is the effect of all upon the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
which is expreſſed, Firſt, In their paſſion of
weeping, with the aggravation. 1. <hi>They wept ſore.</hi>
2. Their great love, <hi>They fell on Pauls neck and
kiſſed him.</hi> 3. The motive of all this affectionate
carriage, That which did open theſe Flood-gates,
it was becauſe <hi>they ſhould ſee his face no more;</hi> they
ſhould for ever loſe him, enjoy no more of his
Miniſterial Labors and diligence: now this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55700:267"/>
by the Evangeliſt, as a commendation; It
was a ſpirituall, not a naturall weeping; It was not
like weeping for a dead Father, or a dead Wife,
but for a dead Paſtor, by whoſe ſpirituall labours
their ſouls had made great proficiency; I ſhall
from theſe words obſerve two doctrines ſuitable
to the two conſiderable parts of this auditory, the
one ſeaſonable for the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> here
preſent, The other opportune for the <hi>Congregation
of Tamworth,</hi> now bereaved of a <hi>faithful Paſtor,</hi>
whom I may ſee <hi>mourning</hi> and <hi>weeping,</hi> and that
<hi>moſt of all,</hi> becauſe <hi>you ſhall ſee his face no more,</hi> you
ſhall not behold him in this place again, you ſhall
not hear his voice from hence again. The firſt
Obſervation is grounded upon theſe words, <hi>when
he had thus ſpoken,</hi> This about the <hi>duty of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
This about <hi>his Holy, Godly,</hi> and <hi>exemplary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;</hi>
From whence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a faithful diſcharge of the miniſteriall Office
doth bring unſpeakable comfort to ſuch as can upon juſt
grounds aſſume this to themſelves;</hi> From this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
we ſee often <hi>Paul</hi> receiving a great deal of
comfort. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. The time of his departure
was at hand; doth not this then make him afraid?
how ſhall he give an account concerning the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of his talents? No, <hi>I have fought a good
fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, &amp;c.</hi> We have the
like glorious profeſſion made by this holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. which is an excellent Copy
for every Miniſter to write after, to live and
breathe from thence; and in this he is ſo cleare,
that he ſaith, <hi>Ye are witneſſes,</hi> and God alſo, how
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55700:268"/>
                     <hi>holily, juſtly</hi> and <hi>unblameably, we have behaved our
ſelves amongſt thoſe that beleeve.</hi> But yet let none
think that <hi>Paul</hi> doth thus magnifie inherent grace,
to exclude imputed grace, for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Though
he ſaith, he knoweth nothing by himſelf, yet he
concludeth, <hi>I am not thereby juſtified, but he that
judgeth me is the Lord,</hi> he knew more evill in <hi>Paul,</hi>
then <hi>Paul</hi> him ſelf could do, and certainly, ſo great
is this miniſterial work, that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf cryed
out, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things? Chryſoſtome</hi>
hath very diſcouraging paſſages, as if few Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
could be ſaved, but his meaning muſt be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
few are carefull, zealous, and diligent; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
ſuch as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> himſelf, that is ſaid to
fear nothing but ſin, and thoſe that by their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
and life, turn many from iniquities, ſhall have
more then ordinary glory in heaven; To ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this, I ſhall in ſome <hi>particulars</hi> or Characters
deſcribe how, or when the Miniſtery is faithfully
diſcharged, what is ingredient thereunto, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent
thereof; And firſt there is required <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
experimental ſavory work of grace upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
own heart,</hi> that thereby he may more <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately</hi>
and <hi>cordially</hi> deal with others; when we
know the terror of the Lord, and the love of
Chriſt experimentally, this maketh us able in the
work of the Miniſtery, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. I doe not ſay
that the Office of a Miniſter is null, if he be not a
regenerate man, or as if he were no Miniſter, or
might not be uſefull in the Church of God, but as
to himſelf, he cannot faithfully diſcharge this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
ſo as to obtaine a crown of glory hereafter,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55700:268"/>
unleſs he be thus qualified; There is <hi>Theologia ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinativa</hi>
and <hi>experimentalis,</hi> as <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſpeaketh.
A man may know things, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, <hi>per mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
cognitionis,</hi> or, <hi>per modum inclinationis;</hi> now
it is this experimental Divinitie, that worketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Knowledge an inclination and propenſitie to
the thing known, that maketh us able to diſcharge
this duty; To Preach of Regeneration, of Faith,
when a man hath no ſavory underſtanding of theſe
things, is to talk of the ſweetneſs of honey, when
we never taſted it, or of the excellency of ſuch a
Countrey, which we never were in, but know it
by Mapps only. If thou knoweſt the truths of
God, but by Books, by Authors onely, and thy
own heart feeleth not the power of theſe things,
Thou art but as the Conduit, that letteth out wine
or refreſhing water to others, but thou thy ſelf
taſteſt not of it, or like the hand that directeth the
Paſſenger, but thou thy ſelf ſtandeſt ſtill.</p>
                  <p>2. To a faithfull diſcharge, there is required a
<hi>ſound knowledge, judgement</hi> and <hi>skill in divine
things;</hi> hence they are called <hi>lights, guides,</hi> and
<hi>Shepherds,</hi> they are required to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 1 <hi>Tim.
3. 2. apt to teach, to reprove in all Doctrine. 2 Tim.</hi> 4.
2. It is not enough to cry out of Hereſies or of
ſinnes, unleſs we rebuke with doctrine; The leaſt
Knowledge that <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> condeſcend unto in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
is, that he muſt be learned, <hi>ſupra vulgus fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium:</hi>
Is he a fit Miniſter that can onely Preach and
pray by a preſcript, or form from another? He is
not a fit Phyſitian, or a fit Lawyer, that ſhould doe
ſo in his way; Miniſters therefore ſhould take
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55700:269"/>
that exhortation, which we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> gave even to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> though ſo well accompliſhed. 1 <hi>Tim. 4.
15. Meditate upon theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to
them, that thy profiting may appear,</hi> yea, <hi>verſ. 13.
Till I come, give attendance to reading.</hi> The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of time is to be obſerved, for though
<hi>Paul</hi> was to come ſhortly to him, yet that little
time he was abſent from <hi>Paul,</hi> muſt be improved
in reading Gods Word. Be thou aſcribe inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Kingdome of heaven, that can bring out
of thy treaſure, old and new; be a Fountain, not
a Ceſtern, that will quickly be dry; <hi>Cajetan Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula,
Tit. Doctoratus,</hi> maketh it a mortall ſinne to
approve any for a Doctor in Divinitie, who is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
inſufficient, becauſe hereby he is teſtified to
be a Phyſitian of ſouls, when yet through his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
may be the ruine of many; I dare not
avouch that of <hi>Luther,</hi> who ſaid it is a German
Proverb, <hi>that young Divines fill Hell,</hi> onely it is a
good warning, that ſuch be diligent in ſtudying,
that God may bleſſe them with all knowledge and
underſtanding, firſt in the Scripture, and then in
all other parts of Divinitie, whether controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall,
poſitive or practicall, eſpecially adde to thy
Miniſteriall knowledge theſe two things; Firſt <hi>a
firm faith,</hi> for to read and to know much, but not
to digeſt it, maketh us ſcepticall; Have faith, not
reaſon or opinion in religious things, <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith
in <hi>Comment. 2. Epiſt. ad Corin.</hi> that the Miniſters of
of God, who go up into the Pulpit in the name of
Chriſt, to preach his Word, ought to have ſuch
firmneſs of Faith in them, that they are aſſured
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55700:269"/>
that their Doctrine can no more be overthrowne,
then God himſelf; now truely, this faith is much
to be commended to us, we may have much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
much reading, but little Faith, be very ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
and deale in Divinitie as we uſe to do in
Philoſophy, <hi>videtur quod ſic, videtur quod non,</hi>
Great Schollars are not alwayes great beleevers,
The want of this maketh a man of a <hi>Socinian</hi> faith,
an <hi>Arminian</hi> faith, a Popiſh faith, as often as any
plauſible Argument, or carnal Intereſt interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
                  <p>2. With this knowledge labour much after
<hi>Caſuiſticall Divinity,</hi> whereby you may be able to
direct the tempted in caſes of Conſcience, To
guide the afflicted in ſoul, what they are to doe;
Indeed the Papiſts have a deale of Caſuiſticall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie
in large voluminous diſcourſes, but it is
for the moſt part calculated according to their
meridians of ſuperſtitious uſages and Cuſtomes,
but it is pitty that among us <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſall
Bookes are farre more then our caſuiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
yet remember the Scripture calleth it, <hi>the
tongue of the Learned, Iſa. 50. 4. To know how to ſpeak
a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary;</hi> The wounds
of Conſcience are the moſt tender, and therefore
require a Spirituall skilfull Phyſitian. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of men are the ſubject matter of your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and therefore look after that <hi>Ars Cordis,</hi>
which is indeed a liberall art that will ſet us
free.</p>
                  <p>3. He that will faithfully diſcharge the Office
of his Miniſtery, muſt regard the <hi>end of it,</hi> the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55700:270"/>
                     <hi>finis operis,</hi> and <hi>finis operantis,</hi> the <hi>finis miniſterii,</hi>
and <hi>miniſtri,</hi> muſt be all one: The end of the
Miniſtry is to exalt God &amp; Chriſt, to dethrone Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
to bring many out of their ſins unto the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the Goſpel: Now if a man aim at other
things in his Miniſtry then this he can never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
diſcharge it: To be a Miniſter for earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profits, for ambition and vain glory, theſe will
be like the gravel, that will preſently ſtop the
Ship in its paſſage; and truly herein we may much
lament our entrance in to this work, how many
ſet upon it as a profeſſion to live upon, by that
they hope to ſatisfie their needs, but if this end
and motive do ſtill reign in thee, it will be like a
milſtone about thy neck; outward maintenance
may be a ſecondary end, but not the principal;
ſtill then a we thy ſoul with the end of thy office,
that all other knowledge is exerciſed about the
body, or mens Eſtates, or the nature of things;
but thine is Theology, <hi>De Deo, à Deo, in Deum,</hi> its
concerning God objectively, its from God effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,
its to God finally.</p>
                  <p>4. He that will faithfully diſcharge this Office
of the Miniſtry, muſt as <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth, 2 <hi>Cor.
1. 12. have his converſation with all godly ſimplicity
and ſincerity:</hi> He is to carry on his work in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-ways,
avoiding thoſe two Rocks, <hi>Media
violentiae,</hi> and <hi>Media fraudulentiae;</hi> A man of a
crafty multiplicity of Spirit, will turn into any
ſhape diſpute for any thing a lawful: This the
Jeſuit ſaid to one (for ſo I underſtand it) who
doubted about ſomething he was to do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55700:270"/>
lawful or no, <hi>Aude</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>&amp; nos efficiemus
probabile, Janſen. St. Auguſt. lib. proaem. pag.</hi> 9. Be
daring to do it, and we will make it probable;
now this ſimplicity of Spirit in Miniſterial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
is greatly ſeen in an obediential depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
upon the word of God, whether in matter
of Duty, or of Faith: What is it that maketh
ſo many learned Men embrace Errors after Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
but becauſe they leave Faith, and attend to
reaſon? They think we come to be Chriſtians by
Diſputations and ſcientifical Demonſtrations; as
we come to be Philoſophers, not by a ſingle and
plain captivating of our underſtandings to the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
whereas it is Chriſtian Faith, not Chriſtian
reaſon: It is ſaid to be <hi>Nazianzens</hi> Emblem, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologia
noſtra eſt Pythagorica,</hi> by this ſimplicity of
Spirit, a man ſhall overcome thoſe Temptations,
which are uſually in Scholars to bring, <hi>inaudita &amp;
inviſa,</hi> ſtrange and unheard things unto our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
eſpecially let the Miniſters of the Goſpel be
ſo guided by ſimplicity of Spirit, that they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
theſe three Rocks.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that while they avoid a Popiſh blinde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to men, examining things by Scripture,
they therefore do not make all things uncertain:
That of <hi>Durand</hi> is true, whoſoever forſaketh
reaſon becauſe of humane Authority, <hi>incidit in
inſipientiam beſtialem,</hi> maketh himſelf like a Beaſt;
yet let not this liberty be abuſed to licentiouſneſs,
to believe nothing, to deſpiſe all thoſe Miniſterial
helps which God hath vouchſafed to the Church,
becauſe he is to try all things; though he muſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55700:271"/>
try, yet he muſt not be always trying, <hi>but hold faſt
that which is good, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 5. 21. This liberty and
particular Judgement of diſcerning, which God
alloweth every man, is not to be oppoſed to that
deciſive Miniſterial Judgement, which God hath
appointed in his Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, under pretence of a more moderate
and impartial handling of things, as not being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
unto parties, take heed thou do not make a
party of thy ſelf, as the Sect of Philoſophers, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Diogen, Laert. in Proent.</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they would be of no Sect, but chooſe the beſt
Art of all; thus they made a Sect, while they
condemned all.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Take heed of being deceived under
the pretence that thou doeſt not bring in any new
matter, but new words, or thou doſt digeſt things
into a better method; for by this means, men
leaving that ſimplicity and Scripture-dependance
they once had, have corrupted their Miniſterial
Office, inſtead of a faithful diſcharge of it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, To a faithful diſcharge of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Office, there is required an excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<hi>of many choice Graces,</hi> inſomuch that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
qualification, is like that Ointment that
was to be made for the Prieſt onely: There muſt
be love and compaſſion to Peoples Souls, which
was abundantly diſcovered in our Savior himſelf:
<hi>Paul</hi> compareth himſelf, ſometimes to a Father,
ſometimes to a Mother, ſometimes to a Nurſe,
becauſe of this affectionate deſire in him: There
muſt be Zeal, Fortitude, and Courage, the <hi>ſpirit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55700:271"/>
of love and of power alſo;</hi> he is not a Miniſter, that
is not <hi>ad mille mortes paratus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Chryſoſtome; as
a good Souldier endure hardſhip,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
1 Tim.</hi> 2. 3. There muſt be Prudence and
Wiſdom, elſe Love and Power will make us like
<hi>Sampſon,</hi> without eyes; there muſt be ſalt in the
Sacrifice, as well as fire; <hi>Oportet Paſtor ſit totus ocu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
a Paſtor muſt be an <hi>Argus,</hi> full of eyes.</p>
                  <p>Again, there muſt be an <hi>Heavemly heart,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
the world and all earthly advantages:
The eye that is to ſee for others muſt not have
duſt falling into it: <hi>Auſtin</hi> maketh an Heretick to
have ſome carnal profit or emolument that is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
of him: There muſt be a <hi>deſire to pleaſe
God, and not men,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. for ſo a man
cannot be a ſervant of Chriſt: This fear to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
men, whereby we do not reprove ſin ſo
Zealouſly, ſo Cordially and Faithfully as we
ſhould, hath eclipſed the comfort of ſome godly
Miniſters at their death. It is too true that the
Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>The fear of a man is his ſnare,
Prov.</hi> 29. 25. The Camelion for fear, ſaith <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
turneth into the likeneſs of every object it
meeteth with.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the ſpecial qualifications of a Godly
Miniſter, whereby he will be able to ſay with <hi>Paul,
I have fought a good fight. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 7. Yea, with
<hi>CHRIST, I have finiſhed the worke thou gaveſt
me to do. John</hi> 17. 3. To all which muſt be added
<hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>labour,</hi> all the names, they have denote
labour more then glory, office more then dignitie;
now in all theſe things there is one particular,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55700:272"/>
which doth much quicken, and that is <hi>temptation,</hi>
one of thoſe three things, <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, made a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;
we are not to deſire temptations, but God
for the moſt part doth prepare thoſe Miniſters,
whom he intends to be ſerviceable, by ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes;
This is the ſawing, and the poliſhing of the
ſtone, by this he is brought into the deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and ſeeth the wonderfull works of God, by
this he is able to underſtand the depths of Satan,
and by this he is adapted to be a moſt ſpeciall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
to comfort and refreſh others, when
they ſhall ſee theirs is not a ſingular condition, they
muſt not think none are tempted like them, for
they ſhall find that even <hi>Pauls</hi> have had the buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Satan, and that by theſe ſoule temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they have learned more then all Books or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
could teach them. And thus I leave the firſt
Doctrine, and proceed to the ſecond, which
is.</p>
                  <p>That a Godly People cannot but affectionately mourn
under the loſſe of their faithfull Miniſters.<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee here what theſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> did, with
what affection they were moved, becauſe they
ſhould never ſee <hi>Pauls</hi> face more; Grace doth not
lie in extinguiſhing, but regulating affections;
<hi>Chriſt wept,</hi> and they argued from thence, <hi>behold
how he loved him, Joh.</hi> 11. 35, 36. So that <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi>
commendation of his Mother <hi>Nonna,</hi> that ſhe
never wept under the many troubles ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went,
ſubmitting all to Gods hand, was rather
Stoiciſme, then Chriſtianitie; It is ſaid of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi>
when he heard of the death of any good
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55700:272"/>
Miniſter, he could not forbeare weeping; how then
can a people forbeare, when their own Miniſter,
their own Paſtor is taken away, ſhould not the
Congregation be a valley of tears, or a place of
mourners; now there are theſe grounds for it, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of that experimentall ſoul-good, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
advantage the Godly have reapt thereby; Oh!
when thou ſhalt remember what quicknings, what
meltings, what warning of heart thou haſt had,
this will cauſe grief to think they are gone. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
naturall men never are affected with the loſſe
of a Miniſter, they never got any good by their
Preaching; it was no converting Miniſtry, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning,
no comforting Miniſtry to them, and
therefore the loſs is no more troubleſome.</p>
                  <p>2. They muſt needs mourn, becauſe they have
juſt cauſe to fear, their ſinnes have cauſed God to
deprive them of ſuch helps; your unthankfulneſs,
your contempt, and low thoughts of the means of
grace, your unprofitableneſs and negligence, may
make you mourn, for if God upon the abuſe of
naturall Creatures, will take away his Wine, his
Bread, his flaxe, will he not much more remove
the candleſtick, for unfruitfulneſs under ſpiritual
mercies; mourne then, leſt thy ſinnes, thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs,
thy deadneſs and dulneſs of heart
have provoked God to take ſuch guides away; yea
in the third place, may not ſome mourn, who by
their Diſobedience, and unwillingneſſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Chriſts yoak, and oppoſition to his way,
have ſo filled the Miniſters heart with grief and
ſadneſs, as thereby to haſten his death, making
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55700:273"/>
his life the more uncomfortable, and cauſing him
to mourn in ſecret for your ſtubbornneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience;
Thus your ſinnes, not only meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
but efficiently may concurre to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of him by death; Conſider that place. <hi>Heb.
13. 17. Obey them that rule over you, &amp;c. that they
may give their account with joy, and not with grief;</hi>
ſome make this particular to relate to the former,
that they may watch over your ſouls with joy,
and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you.
A grieved Miniſter, a diſcouraged Miniſter cannot
do his duty, ſo powerfully, it will be unprofitable
unto you, you will find it in his ſtudy, in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
A dull people are apt to make a dull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</p>
                  <p>4. There is cauſe to mourn, becauſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
of the relation between a Paſtor and a
People, in ſome reſpects, it is above all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
relations. They are ſpirituall Fathers, your
ſouls receive good by them; They are Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
to bring you unto eternal glory, and
therefore there is more cauſe of Mourning in this
reſpect, then when God breaketh naturall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
no Father or Mother, or friend happily hath
done that for thee which his Miniſtery hath
done.</p>
                  <p>5. There is cauſe to mourn, becauſe it is a
ſign of Gods anger and diſpleaſure to a people,
you are not ſo much to look upon it; as the loſſe
of a man, as a token of Gods anger to the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
<hi>The righteous man periſheth, and none layeth
it to heart. Iſaiah.</hi> 57. 1. Who knoweth what ſoul-Judgements,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55700:273"/>
what bodily Judgements may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
come vpon you, and therefore it is for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be ſenſible, and mourn, when the deſire of
your eies, ſo I may call the Miniſter (as well as the
Wife) is taken away. The deſire of your eies,
you long to ſee him in the Pulpit again, and the
deſire of your eares, you long to heare him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>6. There is cauſe to Mourn, becauſe of the ſad
conſequents that many times falls upon the death
of a faithfull Paſtor; ſometimes the learning and
ſoundneſs of a Miniſter, keepeth a People from
licentious errors, and corrupt opinions; His Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie
and Pietie hath a ſpeciall influence upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but upon his removall, then the weeds of a
mans heart growes up: <hi>After my departure,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Paul, Wolves will ariſe from among your ſelves, Acts
20. 29. Pauls</hi> preſence was a great means to hinder
them.</p>
                  <p>2. What good Foundation is laid in Faith, what
Godly Order may be begun? there is danger, that
all theſe will die, when a Faithfull Miniſter dieth:
<hi>I wonder that you are ſo ſoon removed,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi>
1. Alas! that which the Miniſters of God have
with many years diligence, many Prayers, and
much oppoſition brought about, when the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
is dead, may quickly be deſtroyed, ſo that we
may wonder, how ſuch a Town, ſuch a place
ſhould be over-run with Bryars and Thornes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
                  <p>3. Another ſad conſequent is ſometimes, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and breaches among the People, while a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55700:274"/>
Godly Miniſter is alive, he is like a Corner Stone,
that uniteth both ſides of the Wall together, but
when that falls, then the wall falls with it. Then
one is for this Miniſter, and another for that, then
one liketh this, and another the contrary, and thus
ſeeds of contention and diviſion are ſowen, which
may come up too faſt, hence the preſence of a
Godly, Grave, Wiſe Paſtor is very neceſſary, it is
the Spirituall defence of a People, which made
him cry out, when the Prophet was taken, <hi>My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
my Father, the Chariots of Iſrael, and the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
thereof, 2 Kings</hi> 13. 14. And now we come
from the Doctrinal part to the practicall; And
although my cuſtome in ſuch Sermons, is not to
diſcourſe about the Dead, they being like Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Lectures, for the good of the living, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are celebrating the Funeralls of a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Godly Brother, who by his Office, was in
publick ſtation in the Church of God; I ſhall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpeak to ſome few of thoſe Miniſteriall qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
that were in him mentioned in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
not imitating <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> who in his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Orations of his Father, as alſo <hi>Athanaſius,
Baſilius</hi> and others induſtriouſly gathereth up eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that may make to their praiſe, if not hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolically
exceeding ſometimes; but I ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
come ſhort of what might be ſpoken. And
firſt, his Doctrinall abilities, and parts in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsrſall
points, are ſufficiently known by the Books
he hath written: thoſe Children will reſemble the
Father, though he left no bodily ones. It is true,
there were ſome particular opinions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55700:274"/>
he was fallen into with other Learned men,
on whoſe ſide the truth did ſtand, you will not
judge it meet for me to interpoſe, onely becauſe
of the difference that is ſometimes in Judgement
between Godly men, we ſee ſome by profaneneſs,
gladly have it in their mouthes, ſaying, what heed
is to be given to theſe Miniſters, there are not two
of a minde; They write againſt one another, they
have Book againſt Book, and then ſome good
people they are offended; what ſhall we do, ſay
they, we look upon both as Godly, and yet they
cannot agree; becauſe I ſay, of this offence, I ſhall
ſpeak a little to it. Firſt, that this difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves, is an old objection, The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>
and the <hi>Jewes</hi> urged it againſt Chriſtianity,
whoſe Arguments <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> anſwered,
retorting upon them the ſame diviſions; the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi>
likewiſe objected this to the Chriſtians,
when that <hi>Synod</hi> was gathered together at <hi>Nice,</hi>
as the Centuriators inform us; Though <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
(lib. de vera religione</hi>) brandeth them for
this, that the Heathens, though they had divers
ſchools, yet they had <hi>Commune Templum,</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
temple, which argued, they worſhipped
their Gods more out of Cuſtome, then becauſe of
their opinion.</p>
                  <p>2. We are to know, that all the Godly do know
onely in part, perfection in knowledge, and unity
is reſerved for heaven; there will be no parties,
no dividing opinions, there will be no different
Forms, and wayes of worſhipping of God in that
place, ſo that although this difference amongſt the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55700:275"/>
Godly be as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaid to <hi>Melanctlhon, peſſimi ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empli,</hi>
of a very bad example, yet if we conſider,
that the meaſure of Light &amp; grace in this world is
imperfect, then we may not wonder at ſuch brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
had not <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> a Paroxiſme, a
ſharp ſitt, for to underſtand the Word in a good
ſenſe, as ſome would, becauſe the Word is uſed ſo.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24. is very improbable. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts.</p>
                  <p>3. The differences of Godly Miniſters are not
in fundamentals; They all build gold and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtones, though ſome may adde hay and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, a brotherly and amicable diſquiſition
into truths controverſed, not fundamentall, but
between Godly men, though different in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is very lawfull and uſefull, indeed if this be
done with pride, paſſion, ſcornfull and diſdainfull
words, deſpiſing the gifts of others, This is not a
dead fly, but a dead toad in the box of ointment,
that maketh the wiſe Reader think, men do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
opinions, not ſo much as they are Gods
Truths, but as they are their opinions, wherein
they muſt have glory; But return we to our Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Brother; as God had given him ſuch Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Abilities, ſo alſo was he Prudent and Wiſe,
and wiſe to direct ſuch as were troubled in
their minde, and perplexed about what they
were to doe; It is true, it pleaſed God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his ſickneſs to exerciſe him with ſome ſad
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55700:275"/>
and black thoughts, ſometimes tending to the
great dejection and diſcouragement of his ſoul,
but by this we ſee, that comfort is not a flower
growing in our Garden, that we can pluck up
when we will, God is the God of Comfort only,
he giveth it when he pleaſeth, and he taketh it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
again as he pleaſeth. Chriſt had an Angel to
comfort him in his Agonies, ſo that all, both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
and People, are to take Goſpel-Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as mercies from heaven, not as the work of
our hands.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, the diligence, conſtancy and
faithfull Preaching of your Godly Paſtor is not
unknown; Theſe walls, theſe ſeats can ſufficiently
beare witneſs thereunto; Though you a great
People, and he declining in age, yet a laborious
Preacher to you, and a great Student in private:
The Catechizing alſo of the younger ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
diſcovered his vigilancy, and it was the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
deſire (as he would have you informed) and
requeſt of your dying Paſtor, that the younger
Perſons of this place would readily and willingly
ſubmit to that order; Beſides all this, his writing
for the publick good of the Church, ſtill demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
his faithfulneſs and zeal herein; when the
Perſecutor had cut out <hi>Cyprians</hi> tongue, and then
baniſhed him, yet he made a ſupply by his Pen;
but our Learned Brother was willing both by
Tongue and Pen to edifie the Church of God, ſo
that both his <hi>opuſcula,</hi> and his <hi>opera</hi> will praiſe him
in the gates, <hi>His tenderneſs of Spirit</hi> likewiſe was
exceeding much; and as in ſoft wood, wormes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55700:276"/>
ſometimes breed to weaken it, ſo did (as you
heard) diſcouragements ſometimes lie upon his
ſoul, but the Lord did quickly blow over the
clouds, and as I am informed, his expreſſion was,
<hi>That he dyed with full ſatisfaction of Spirit, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, you are not ignorant of the way he took
about the Sacrament, that he was not for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous
Admiſſion of all thereunto; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when a late Writer, Mr. <hi>Humphreys,</hi> would
have gathered ſuch concluſions from his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
he was willing publickly to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and to ſhew his diſſent herein; All this,
though comparatively little, I have ſpoken, not to
exalt man, for what have we, that we have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
but to bleſs God, and magnifie him, who
giveth ſuch gifts to men; he that praiſeth the gifts
and graces of any, thereby extolleth God; as he
that commendeth a Picture, magnifieth the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
that made it; and thus we take our dear and
laſt farewell of him, and come to you, ſheep left
without a ſhepheard, to you on the Sea without a
Pilate; To you Orphans, without a Spirituall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and firſt you ſee what cauſe there is for our
conſtant expectation and preparation for death;
Gods own Miniſters and ſervants muſt dye, God
needeth no mans labours or parts, <hi>Moſes, Joſhua,
Paul, Peter</hi> muſt die, <hi>ſola mors non habet fortaſſe,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Auſtin,</hi> only Death hath no may be; It may be
thou mayeſt be rich, it may be thou mayeſt thrive
in thy trading, it may be thou mayeſt have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55700:276"/>
in thy Children and friends, but thy death hath
no may be; Oh! let not the world, let not your
Shops, let not trading take off your hearts from
this Meditation, but think you hear God ſpeaking
to you, ſet not your houſe, but your ſouls in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for thou muſt die.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, here is ſome comfort, though
there be cauſe of much ſorrow, that though your
Faithfull Paſtor he dead, yet the chief Paſtor of
your ſouls is not; He that ſetteth Paſtors and
Teachers in the Church, he that ſendeth forth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
into his harveſt, he liveth for ever; as
one in the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, when newes was
brought him that his father was dead, <hi>Deſine blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias
loqui</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>pater enim meus immortalis eſt,</hi>
ceaſe to ſpeak blaſphemy, for my Father is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall;
Thus let this honey fall into your gall,
this Wine into your water, The great and Chief
Shepheard of your ſouls is not dead.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, now the will of God is done, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our deceaſed Brother, your duty is to be much
in <hi>Prayer</hi> to God, that there may be a <hi>Joſhua</hi> after
<hi>Moſes,</hi> That God would <hi>joyne your hearts together
as one man,</hi> to ſeek out a Paſtor for you, which
ſhall feed you according to his holy will; The
Lord hath made a great breach upon you, be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

ſadder then them both, I (who was deputed
to this work by him to whom I now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

of your ſorrow, then tell you the reſentments of
mine own. Being ſenſible of my ſtupefaction, (cauſed, not
through the want of my affections, but the want of their
object) I deſire out of a pious pollicy, to ſupply my dryneſſe,
by taking your Tears, and putting them into my pump, ſo
hoping to revive mine own, which yet I judge are rather
drowned then dryed up. And yet when I have done this,
I know that all my expreſſions will fall ſhort of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of my grief, as much as my grief does of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of its cauſe. This numerous Company of Pious groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
theſe ſo many blacks, not made, but occaſioned to be
Mourners (badges of profeſſion becomming badges of that
grief, which for its greatneſs can be equal'd by nothing
but their former happineſs which they once enjoyed) the
univerſall gloommeſs of this day, repreſents to me rather
the funerall of a Town, then a man, and the fall of a
Church, rather then a ſingle pillar: and rather induces

me to think that ye are come to quench the unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull

where you are, what you are doing, whoſe Obſequies you
are ſolemnizing with ſo great devotion, and take the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions

I ſpeak not to aggravate your loſs, but the ſenſe of it, as

his love; and if his ſucceſſe had anſwered his
care, we might happily have this day wanted an
object of ſo great ſorrow, in enjoying him. His writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
were not read without ſatisfaction: His Sermons were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

him from this place (which was alwayes happy in his

great to others in compariſon of what they finde; ſo that
I ſate by him, and I only, when with as great affluency of
Tears, as words, he prayed, Lord (with ſome ingeminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
charge not on me the ignorance of this people. And
indeed your ignorance had not been ſo remarkable, had not
his Knowledge, and deſire ſtill to communicate it been
ſo. With what a grace and majeſty have you heard him
Preaching, who is now (alas) confin'd to a worſer wood.
Could you ever reſiſt the power by which he ſpake; or find
in your hearts to contradict any thing that ever he ſaid,
but when on his ſick-bed he ſaid, I am a dying man? Ah!
who would not there have contradicted him, if they

Juſtice, and Tenderneſs were ſuch predomin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to expreſſe them, were infinitely to injure their greatneſs.
It is a ſad thing that ſo many reſplendent graces ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

that had them; and that we ſhould not ſo juſtly conſider
that he had them, till we have not them. But yet your

of a Judgement in it. But I fear that within a ſhort
time, it will appear as truly that God hath taken him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

him away: And that it is not only a miſery that must be
