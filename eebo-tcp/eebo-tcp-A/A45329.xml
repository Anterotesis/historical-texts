            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44914:38"/>
and purge our families from sin, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did his from Idols before he went to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> Gen. 35. 1, 2, 3. The people must be sanctified &amp; prepared, before the Lord will deliver his holy Law unto them; then and not tell then doth God speak, <hi>Exod</hi> 19. 14, 15. compared with 20. 1. He will not take a wicked man by the hand. What communion hath light with darknesse, Purity with impurity, Vertue with vice, beauty with deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, life with death, or the chiefest good with the foulest evil? There must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a purging of our hearts from sin before we draw nigh to God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> else the Lord will abhorre both us and our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and will answer us according to our Idols, <hi>Ezek</hi> 14. 3, 4. Under the Law, if any man came to offer a sacrifice with his uncleannesse on him, he must be cut off; there must be washing and cleansing before he came; so in all our approaches to God in duty, there must be not only a habituall, but also an actuall fitting and preparing of our selves for the work. Therefore when <hi>James</hi> (4. 8.) had commanded us to draw nigh to God, he presently adds,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44914:38"/>
                  <hi>Cleanse your hands ye sinners, and purifie your hearts.</hi> Our hearts are not fit to <note place="margin">See more <hi>Harsnet</hi> on Repent. <hi>p.</hi> 193. &amp;c.</note> serve the living God, till they be purged from dead works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14, God will not vouchsafe to reason with us, nor to have any communion with us, till we have first washt our selves and made us clean, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18. Then come let us reason together.

As the effect alway followeth the cause, light the sun, and fruit springs from the root, so sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ever attends on justification. Where Gods Spirit dwels, it is never idle, but is alwaies changing us into the image of God from glory to glory, working in us a detestation of sin, with a love and delight in newnesse of life.</p>
               <p>This is matter of singular Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to many gracious souls, who doubt of their justification, and yet they shew it by the fruits of sanctification; they walk humbly with their God, they have respect to all his Commandments, they hate every false way, they are fearfull to offend, carefull to please; they desire not only pardon for sin (which a carnal man out of self-love may do) but also power against sin; they would be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified as well as justified, they desire as freely to forgo their sins, as they desire God should forgive them; and to part with them, as to have them pardoned: they would be freed not only from the evil, but from the filth of sin; not only
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44914:39"/>
from the damnation, but also from the dominion of sin. When we see a man walk and move, we conclude he lives; when we see a tree bear fruit, though it be but small, we conclude there is life in the root, it is not yet dead; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who ever thou art that findest the graces of Gods Spirit wrought in thy soul, though they be but weak, yet if they be there in truth and sincerity, thou maist with comfort conclude that thou art justified; for though works of <note place="margin">Sani hominis act ones non sunt sanitatis causae, sed indicia</note> sanctification be not meritorious causes of our salvation, yet they are signes and evidences of it; so love and good works are not causes of our justification, but <note n="*" place="margin">Non Ã  Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ante, sed Ã  Parte post.</note> signes of a man that is justified; Christ only is the way by which we come, good works are signs that we are in that way: Hence the Apostle exhorts us to give all diligence to get assurance by doing the things named, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 5, 6, 7. with 10. and blessednesse is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to the doers of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22, 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 1, 2. and the sentence at the day of judgement of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution or condemnation will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced according to our works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they best show our faith or infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,

Though Christ only be a foundation fundamentall. So that I conclude, It is a safe and sure way to labour after assurance of our interest in Christ, by the fruits of sanctification; it is safe reasoning from the Effects to the Causes; Here is heat, therefore there is some fire; the trees flourish, therefore the spring is come; here is light, then the sun is risen; here is good fruit growing, therefore the tree is good; here are spiritual desires, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affections, spiritual ends and aims, spiritual acts and operations, therefore here is spiritual life.

               <p>Now to quicken thee, consider these fo ur things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider seriously who it is that cals on thee and intreats thee to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; is it not the great &amp; the mighty God? he whose frowns make rocks to rend, and Princes quake and tremble? he whose thou art in all relations? should but a mortall man, a friend intreat thee to observe some rules and directions which might tend to thy bodily health, how readily wouldst thou obey him? &amp; shall the great God become a suppliant unto thee (whose bare commands were
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44914:70"/>
sufficient to move thee, and who will have his will on thee whether thou wilt or no) shall the most high condescend so low as to stoop to thee, and his grace (as twere) kneel to thee for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and hast thou a face to deny him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet consider to what he cals thee, it is not to sin, it is not to destruction, it is not to any thing that should hurt thee, that is the devils work; but he cals thee to holinesse, and so to happinesse, that it may be well with thee and with thine for ever. Now should the meanest person in the world desire thee to do such or such a thing as would do thee good for ever, wouldst thou not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to him? And shall the great God intreat thee to be holy that thou maiest be happy, and canst thou reject his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet thirdly, Consider from what he cals thee; Not from any thing that might comfort thee, but only from sin, which is the greatest evil; to himself, which is the chiefest good; he cals thee from hell to heaven, from darknesse to light, and from the power of Satan to himself. Now did you but know the horror and uglinesse of sin, with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44914:70"/>
and torments that attend it, God and man should not then stand thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of you to forsake it.</p>

There ever hath been, is, and will be Heresies and, Schismes (though it is true the Magistrate should not tolerate them) in the Church of God.

watchfull because we hear of so many varlets abroad: So though our divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be great, and the errors amongst us many (which is our grief) yet if they were ten thousand times more, they would be no ground for us to dislike Religion, but only be matter of cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to us, to make us walk more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and watchfully before the Lord.</p>

But Christs yoke is easie, compared with this; For it is more easie and pleasant to live soberly in the use of the creatures, and so enjoy our selves, our friends and comforts, then to lie drunken and be fit for nothing. Is it not more easie and delightfull to follow those vocations and callings wherein God hath set us, and so to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our times and talents for our Masters honour, then thus sinfully to mispend our precious time and those talents of health, wealth, peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so destroy both body, soul, goods, and good name?</p>

               <p>All these are the ingredients of a sound confession. 1. We must confesse
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44914:112"/>
our sins Freely without compulsion, when we are in health, in our youth, in peace &amp; prosperity. Free-will offerings are most pleasing to God; 'tis the best hony which flows from the comb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out crushing, and the best wine that flows from the grape with least pressing. Compulsive duty is no duty in Gods esteem: A <hi>Pharaoh</hi> never confesseth his sin till he comes to the rack: A <hi>Saul</hi> till he is like to lose his Kingdom: A <hi>Balaam</hi> till he sees an Angel ready to slay him; nor will a <hi>Iudas</hi> cry <hi>Peccavi,</hi> till the pangs of hell surprise him. But the godly are drawn by Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, rather then driven by his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; they are free and forward to give glory to God, and take shame to themselves in the confession of their sins, as <hi>Nehemiah, Ezra, Iob, David, Paul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Fully. We must not hide any one sin that we know of; for every sin is a thief and traytor to the soul, and being concealed (though it should be but a little one in thy esteem, yet) may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt the door for greater. Hiding of sin hinders mens prosperity in body, soul, goods and good name,
