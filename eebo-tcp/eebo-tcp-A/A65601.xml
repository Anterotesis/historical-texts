         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

adde unto each Barrel about an handful of Bay Salt
burnt in a Cruſible or Earthen pot unglazed till it leave

            <head>II. PRESERVATIVES.</head>
            <p>TAke every morning and evening one good ſpoonful
of one of theſe Liquors following, drinking immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after it a draught of Mace-ale, or Purle, or ſtrong
Beer, if they find themſelves in any imminent danger.</p>
            <p>1. Take the beſt White-wine Vinegar one pint, of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-treakle
four ounces, mix them well together in a glaſs,
bottle and keep them cloſe ſtopt. Or,</p>
            <p>2. Take Carduus benedictus ſeeds, and Bur-dock ſeeds,
Ivie berries, and Juniper berries, of each well bruiſed one
ounce; the roots of Celandine, Angelica, Elecampane, and
Valerian, of each 6 drams, Garlick half an ounce, Baum,
Mint, and Vervine, each half an handful; let them all be
cut and bruiſed, and then infuſed in 6 pints of the beſt
White-wine Vinegar in a bottle cloſe ſtopped for 5 or 6
days, then ſtrain out the Vinegar, and keep it for uſe as
before. Or,</p>
            <p>3. Take of this following Electuary a dram, or half a
dram, according to the age and ſtrength of the Patient,
but for a Child much leſs, drinking after it a draught of
Purle, or as before.</p>
            <p>Take Conſerve of Wood-ſorrel 2 ounces, of flower of
Brimſtone finely powdered 2 drams, Diaſcordium half an
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37704:3"/>
ounce, of the temperate cordial Species 4 ſcruples, of ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
of Wood-ſorrel as much as will make it up into a
moiſt Electuary.</p>
            <p>Let the Rooms of every houſe, eſpecially ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
be well fumed at leaſt twice every day, either with
about half an ounce of Brimſtone groſly powdered, and
lapt up in a paper, and laid on a piece of Board or Tile,
and ſet on fire, and carried from Room to Room till it be
burnt out. Or with a Link lighted, and carried in like
manner from Room to Room till all be well ſmoked, and
then put it out.</p>
            <p>It will be advantageous in the way of Preſervation to
forbid the ſale or carrying out any infected Clothes, or
indeed any thing from infected houſes, till ſuch time as it
ſhall pleaſe God the Plague totally ceaſe.</p>
            <p>It is the general received Opinion of Phyſicians, that
all thoſe who meet in publick Congregations ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
take ſome little refreſhment, and if they are ſo
accommodated, to make uſe of ſome Antidote withall;
and not by being <hi>altogether empty</hi> to expoſe themſelves to
receive any Contagion each from other, which may eaſily
happen when many (as is uſually found) having the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in their clothes or otherwiſe, doe preſs into the ſame
place. For long Faſting draws in the Pulſe and Vital
ſtrength, weakens the Animal Spirits, and conſequently
induces Fear and Melancholy, whereby Contagion eaſily
enters the enfeebled Body, and ſo ſpreads and continues
the Plague.</p>
            <p>Further it is convenient for the preventing the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Infection, that about half an hour at leaſt before
the people meet there be burned in the Churches in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places ſome Powder of Brimſtone, or ſome Pitch, or
Tar, or other Perfume of like nature and efficacy againſt
the Plague, but there is none like Brimſtone.</p>
            <p>It will without doubt be advantageous, that plenty of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37704:4"/>
Sea-coles be timely provided, that they may be had at
reaſonable priſes, that ſo the Poor may be able to keep
Cole-fires in their houſes, which will be a great Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
againſt the increaſe of the Sickneſs.</p>
            <p>Alſo that there be eſpecial care had about Burials of the
Dead of the Plague. Firſt, that none be buried in the
Churches. Secondly, that they be buried very deep in
the earth. Thirdly, that no Grave that hath been made
ſince the firſt appearing of this Plague be digged up, or
another made very near it, leſt the venemous reeks of
the body break forth at the place opened, and infect the
Air. In caſe there be not room enough in the Church-yard,
ſome other ground-muſt be allotted and provided
without the City and Suburbs, where the Dead may be
buried diſtinctly, and not heaped one upon another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
when many are buried together, their putrid fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will eaſily grow to that ſtrength, that the Earth will
hardly be ſufficient to ſuppreſs the ſteems of it. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the conſtant Bearers be admoniſhed not promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly
and needleſly to mingle themſelves with others,
nor entertain diſcourſes with heedleſs Boys and Children,
who may eaſily receive harm from them.</p>

            <head>III. CURE.</head>
            <p>THoſe Poor People that are actually infected and begin
to be ſick, muſt by all means (as they tender the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of their recovery) keep themſelves within doors,
and avoid rambling out into the open Air, or looking out
at windows, either of which ſtrikes the venom inward to
the Heart and Bowels; wherefore their ſafeſt courſe is
preſently to betake themſelves to their beds, where they
muſt lie alone, and in bed take this Medicine following,
or the like.</p>
            <p>Take London-treakle a quarter of an ounce, one ounce
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37704:4"/>
of White-wine Vinegar, one ounce of the juice of Wood-ſorrel
or juice of Orenges, 20 grains of the Salt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
and one ounce and an half of Plague-water of
<hi>Matthias,</hi> deſcribed in the College laſt book, pag. 13. and
if they vomit it, renew it again as ſoon as the Stomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to be ſetled. About an hour after let them drink about
half a pint of White-wine or other Poſſet-drink, and lie in
bed as quiet as they can, and ſweat as long as they can well
bear it, taking now and then a draught of the ſame or
other Poſſet-drink; and about 6 hours after the firſt
draught, take another of the ſame Medicine; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
every 6 or 8 hours till the poiſon of the diſeaſe be
ſpent. In the mean time once in 12 hours at the leaſt let
them be refreſhed with Water-gruel, Mace-ale, Oatmeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caudle,
Harts-horn gelly, Chicken-broth with Mace, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigold-flower,
and Harts-horn, with a handful of Wood-ſorrel
boiled together, or any ſuch like, which they can
beſt get.</p>
            <p>Children and Women with child being infected may
take Gaſcoine powder made by the Apothecary, 20 grains
in a ſpoonful of White-wine Poſſet-drink, drinking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after it a good draught of the ſame with two
ſpoonfuls of the Plague-water, or one for a Child.</p>
            <p>It is expedient in the courſe of cure that Bliſters be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in ſeveral parts of the body, provided that not above
four (if large) be applied at once; onely the diſeaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
or increaſing, others may be ſucceſsively laid on
ſome two or three days after the firſt; leſt otherwiſe if
there ſhould be too many laid on at once, they ſhould
procure ſuch a difficulty and pain in making water, as will
not eaſily then be born. The places moſt proper for Bliſters
are the inſide of the Arms a little above or a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Elbow, the inſides of the Thighs a little above the
Knees, the inſides of the Calves of the Legs, alſo a little
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37704:5"/>
below the Croin, and a little below, the Arm-pits; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
behind the Ears: and upon the ſhape of the Neck,
which may be near double as large as any of the others.
The place ought to be elected by the preſent Phyſician; ſo
that it may beſt evacuate the matter from the parts to
which Nature endeavours to thruſt it.</p>
            <p>Let the Rooms whereany ſick perſons are lodged be
diligently kept clean and ſweet, free from allmaſtineſs and
ſluttiſhneſs, &amp; where conveniently there may let Sea-cole
fires be made; and ſometimes let the Rooms be fumed with
Brimſtone, as before directed. Some change their Linen
before the diſeaſe be fully ſweated out, which is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be very dangerous; therefore we adviſe they do
not change till all Symptoms ceaſe.</p>
