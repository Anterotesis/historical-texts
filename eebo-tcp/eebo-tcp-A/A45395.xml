            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A brief Account of one Suggeſtion
OF THE
ROMANIST.</head>
            <p>§. 1. IT is the Stateman's Maxime concerning a
falſe Suggeſtion, that if it be believed but
four and twenty hours, the value of it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable;
which though it muſt be allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a grand abatement, when it is applyed to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
and leſs conſiderable tranſactions, yet the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
of Religion, in the maintenance of truth, are
not ſo deſpiſeable, as that he that hath appeared or
embarked in them, can ſafely neglect the advantages
which evil arts may yield, or furniſh an adverſary
againſt him.</p>
            <p>§. 2. Such in reaſon, and in Experience, beyond
all others is the charge of <hi>falſifying,</hi> which if it be but
ſuggeſted, and believed of any, and much more if a
pregnant and viſible proof of it be tendred, there
needs no other blaſt, or ſmut, or vermine to lay waſt
the whole field, and deprive him of all harveſt of his
ſeed and labours.</p>
            <p>§. 3. How this is my concernment at this time, the
Reader will not ſuddenly divine, till I have entertain'd
him with a ſhort relation of that, which I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my ſelf <hi>proclaim</hi> on the <hi>houſe top,</hi> then leave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to whiſper it in <hi>corners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 4. <hi>I was lately advertiſed by a judicious and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
friend, that it was particularly urged againſt
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:108221:3"/>
me, by a</hi> Romaniſt, <hi>that I had</hi> miſtaken, or perverted
M. <hi>Whites</hi> words, which I referr to in one Diſpatcher Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatcht,
Chap. III. Sect. 4. p. 279. where I ſuppoſe him to
anſwer (<hi>in his</hi> Apology for Trad. p. 56.) that the beatifical
viſion of the Saints before the day of Judgement was not yet
held a matter of Faith, but onely a Theological concluſion;
when (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) the Apologiſt in that very place had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſaid, that this point is a matter of faith, grounded
on Tradition, and not a Theological concluſion.</p>
            <p>§. 5. That I ſhould be guilty if but of ſuch an oſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy
or <hi>mistake,</hi> much more of ſuch a vile <hi>perverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
as this, I may be allowed to have been as unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my ſelf to believe, as I am obliged to take care
that others ſhould not cauſeleſsly apprehend it of
me. Therefore without delay I turned firſt to mine
own words (which as I then could not doubt, ſo now
I acknowledge to be faithfully related) then to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>VVhites</hi> words, in the page of his <hi>Apology,</hi> whence
I had cited them, and thoſe I found exactly, and to a
letter concordant to my tranſcript of them in <hi>Diſp.
Diſp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 6. For thus I ſtill read (if I will not at noon-day
ſuſpect mine own eyes) in that <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> p. 56. l. 12.
[<hi>For, nothing is more clear, then that the validity of Baptiſm
by hereticks was a Tradition, and decided by it: ſo the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical
viſion of the Saints before the day of Judgement, the
Spirituality of Angels, are not yet held matters of Faith, but
only Theological concluſions; as likewiſe the ſouls being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
to the perfecting of the body.</hi>] What can be more
manifeſt, then that in this period the <hi>Beatificall Viſion
of Saints before the day of judgement</hi> is by that <hi>Apologiſt</hi>
ſet down, as one of the <hi>two</hi> things (to which after a
<hi>third</hi> is ſubjoyn'd) of which it is affirmed in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:108221:3"/>
that they <hi>are not yet held matters of Faith, but onely
Theological concluſions?</hi> which was all to a ſyllable, that
I cited from him in that place, with this onely change,
that ſpeaking onely of <hi>one</hi> of theſe, <hi>the Beatifical viſion</hi>
&amp;c. I ſet it (as it was neceſſary) in the ſingular [<hi>is not
yet held a matter of Faith, but onely a Theological concluſion.</hi>]</p>
            <p>§. 7. That I might be ſure not to have miſtaken my
Author, I carefully conſulted the <hi>Errata;</hi> but there
was none noted, relating to that page: and indeed the
whole compoſure of the period was ſuch, that there
muſt be a concurrence of very many changes in the
compaſs of very few lines (more I believe then the
moſt negligent Compoſitor and Corrector have at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time conſpired to be guilty of) to wreſt this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
from me, or change it into what this <hi>Romaniſt</hi>
had affirmed it to be.</p>
            <p>§. 8. Having diſpatch't this account to my friend,
from whom I received the former advertiſement, I
had no cauſe of doubt, but that this affair had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
its full period, the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> being obliged to yield
to ſuch full uncontrollable evidence, and every mans
eyes, to whom the contrary ſuggeſtion could be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
being as well qualified as mine, to ſecure him
from being miſled by it. And on theſe grounds of
ſafety I had no leaſt thought of troubling the Reader
with any account, or complaint, which I now ſee is
become ſome part of my intereſt, and my duty.</p>
            <p>§. 9. For I was ſoon aſſured by my friend, that the
words which I had punctually tranſcribed from my
copy of the Apology, were not to be found in that,
which he had before him, but quite transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the contrary ſence, even that for which the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi>
had vouch'd them; for thus he found them [<hi>For,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:108221:4"/>
nothing is more clear, then that the validity of Baptiſm by
hereticks was a Tradition, and decided by it: ſo the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
viſion of the Saints before the day of judgement. The
Spirituality of Angels is not yet held a matter of Faith, but
onely a Theological concluſion.</hi>]</p>
            <p>§. 10. By this repreſentation I was ſoon forced to
confeſs, that the whole ſcene was changed, the firſt
part of the words remaining the ſame, but the ſecond
(of the <hi>Beatifical viſion of the Saints</hi>) which were
my onely concernment, wholly transformed, that
which before was joyned with the <hi>ſpirituality of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
as not yet held matters of faith, but onely Theological
concluſions,</hi> being now annext to the <hi>validity of Baptiſm
by hereticks,</hi> and ſo affirmed to be a <hi>Tradition</hi> (and that
is with him a matter of <hi>Faith) and decided by it.</hi> And
then I had reaſon to acknowledge the candour of that
<hi>Romaniſt,</hi> who proceeding on theſe appearances, had
laid no heavier a cenſure on me, then that of <hi>either
miſtaking, or perverting M.</hi> Whites <hi>words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 11. In this new poſture of affairs, firſt it was
preſently diſcernible, that the very many changes,
which I had foreſeen, had been really made, to bring
this about. And as all this was obvious, and credible
to be done by a <hi>new Edition</hi> of the book, ſo it remained
uncertain to me whether mine, or that other ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it, were the true and authentick <hi>Edition:</hi> this
therefore was my next care to examine.</p>
            <p>§. 12. And herein again I met with an intricacy;
for if the title-pages, and a concurrence of all obvious
indications, might be believed, there was all this
while but <hi>one edition,</hi> both copies carrying in their
front, <hi>A Paris, chez Jean Billain Rue S. Jacques à l'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
S. Auguſtin</hi> 1654. the ſame volume, print, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:108221:4"/>
of pages, beginning and end of every page, &amp;c.
This ſoon ſuggeſted that which was the onely clue to
extricate me then (and the reader now) out of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth.
For ſending to the Stationers for another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of the <hi>Apology,</hi> as from one I received a copy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
agreeing with mine, ſo by the help of another
I was furniſht with one exactly accordant to what my
Monitor from the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> had repreſented to me,
yet not diſcernibly differing from my own in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſave in this one paſſage; and looking more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
firſt the paper and ink wherein that leaf was
printed (diſcernibly differing from all the reſt of the
book) was apt to inject ſome ſuſpicion: but I ſoon ſaw
that I had no need of this, or other obſcurer intimation,
it being groſly viſible, that in this place a leaf had been
cut out, &amp; a new one paſted in. And what <hi>Gordian</hi> knot
might not have been untied by the like inſtrument?</p>
            <p>§. 13. <hi>VVhen</hi> this change was thought fit to be
made, I did, and ſtill want augury to divine; onely
this is apparent, that it was a work which ſecond
thoughts ſuggeſted, after the Book was publiſhed, elſe
my copy which came regularly to me from the <hi>VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-ſtationer,</hi>
(in the year, if my memory fail me not,
1655.) and another now ſent me from another Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
(which aſſures me there be many more) muſt
have had their parts in the change.</p>
            <p>§. 14. Having given the Reader a brief and ſingle
view of this matter, I abſtain from any farther obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
or reflexion on it, then what a
<q>Quo teneam vultus mutantem—?</q>
will amount to. But that is alſo unneceſſary, my
whole deſign being compleated in this, that it is now
manifeſt to the moſt imperſuaſible of their diſciples,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:108221:5"/>
that dare read what is written againſt their Maſters
(which I perceive few are permitted to do) that I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>miſtook,</hi> nor <hi>perverted</hi> the <hi>Apologiſts</hi> ſence or
words, thoſe, I mean, which I read in his book, from
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> alone I could be imagined to receive cognizance
of them, not being able to forecaſt, that what I had
thus really tranſcribed from him, would be ſo ſoon
ſnatcht from me again, or that what was to me ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſhould vaniſh, and become inviſible to other men.</p>
            <p>§. 15. This indeed is an unexpected proof of what
<hi>S. VV.</hi> had told me, concerning the <hi>VVits</hi> (enormous)
power to transform <hi>Teſtimonies;</hi> which yet ſhal not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
me from dealing in that ware, (being firmly
reſolved never to make uſe of my <hi>duller</hi> faculties, to
work ſuch <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi>) nor yet from diverting
ſometimes into ſuch pleaſant fields, adorned with ſo
great varieties, as that <hi>Apologiſt</hi> frequently affords the
world, hoping, that I ſhall not again meet with ſuch
miſadventures as theſe, or any greater interruptions
in reading him, then what a competent attention, and
a table of <hi>Errata</hi> ſhall enable me to overcome.</p>
            <p>§. 16. This account I conceived would more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donably,
becauſe more moderately, divert the Reader
at this time, then if I ſhould ſtay till it were ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and articulately call'd for, and moreover deliver
<hi>S. VV.</hi> from ſome temptation, himſelf to think, or to
perſwade others, that he had ſprang ſome <hi>reall</hi> game
to invite his chaſes, ſome guilt to ſupport his <hi>contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
and perhaps prevail with ſome of their moſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
followers, to think it equitable to ſubject the
ſuggeſtions they meet with to ſome other waies of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
and triall, then the bare authority or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of the ſuggeſters.</p>
