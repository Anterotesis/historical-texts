         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Enemy being quartered between the two Rivers of <hi>Noer</hi> and the <hi>Barrow,</hi> and Masters of all the Passages thereupon, and giving out their Resolution to fight us thereby, as we conceived laboring to get reputation in the Countreys, and accession of more strength; It was thought fit our Army should march towards them, which accordingly upon Tuesday the fifteenth instant was done. The Major General and Lieutenant General (leaving me very sick at <hi>Ross</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them) with two Battering Guns, advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Enistery,</hi> a little walled Town about five miles from <hi>Ross,</hi> upon the <hi>Noer,</hi> on the South-side thereof, which was possessed by the Enemy; but a party of our men, under the command of Colonel <hi>Abbot,</hi> the night before approaching the Gates, and attempting to fire the same, the Enemy ran away through the River, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good store of Provisions behinde them: Our Commanders hoped by gaining of this Town, to have gained a Pass, but indeed there fell so much sudden wet, as made the River unpassable, by that time the Army was come up: Whereupon, hearing the Enemy lay about two miles off upon near <hi>Thomas</hi> Town, a pretty large walled Town upon the <hi>Noer,</hi> on the North side thereof having a Bridge over the River; our Army marched thither, but the Enemy had broke the Bridge, and Garisoned the Town, and in the view of our Army marched away to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> seeming to decline an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50337:3"/>
although I believe they were double our numbers, which they had power to have necessitated us unto, but was no ways in our power (if they would stand upon the advantage of the Passage) to engage them unto, nor indeed to continue out two days longer, having almost spent all the bread they carried with them: Whereupon (seeking God) for direction, they resolved to send a good party of Horse and Dragoons under Colonel <hi>Reynolds</hi> to <hi>Carrick,</hi> and to march the residue of their Army back towards <hi>Ross,</hi> to gain more bread for the prosecution of that design, if by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God it should take. Colonel <hi>Reynolds</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with twelve Troops of Horse, and three Troops of Dragoons, came betimes in the morning to <hi>Carrick,</hi> where dividing himself into two parties, whilest they were amused with the one, he entred one of the Gates with the other; which the Soldiers perceiving, divers of them and their Officers escaped over the River in Boats; about a hundred Officers and Soldiers taken Prisoners, without the loss of one man of our part: In this place is a very good Castle, and one of the ancientst Seats belonging to the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> the same was rendred without any loss also; where was good store of Provisions for the refreshing of our men. The Colonel giving a speedy intelligence of Gods mercy in this, We agreed to march with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient speed, the residue of the Army up thither, which accordingly was done upon Wednesday and Thursday, the 21 and 22 of this instant; and through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy I was enabled to bear them company. Being come thither, we did look at it as an especial good hand of Providence to give us this place, inasmuch as it gives us a passage over the River <hi>Sewer,</hi> to the City of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50337:3"/>
and indeed into <hi>Munster,</hi> to our Shipping and Provisions, which before were beaten from us out of our <hi>Waterford</hi> Bay, by the Enemies Guns. It hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us also opportunity, to besiege or block up <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi> And we hope our Gracious God will therein direct us also. It hath given us also the opportunity of our Guns, Ammunition, and Victuals; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Quarter for our Horse, which could not have subsisted much longer; so sweet a mercy was the giving of this little place unto us, having rested there a night, and by noon the next day gotten our Army over the River, leaving Col: <hi>Reynolds</hi> with about One hundred and fifty Foot, his own six Troops of Horse, and one Troop of Dragoons, with a very little Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, according to the smalness of our marching store: We marched away towards <hi>Waterford</hi> upon Friday 23, and on Saturday about noon came before the City; the Enemy not being a little troubled at this unsuspected business (which indeed was the meer guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God) marches down with great fury towards <hi>Carrick,</hi> with their whole Army, resolving to swallow it up; And upon Saturday the Four and twentieth, assaults the place round, thinking to take it by storm; but God had otherwise determined, for the Troopers and the rest of the Soldiers with stones, did so pelt them, they continuing very near four hours under the walls, having burnt the Gates, which our men Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado'd up with stones; and likewise digged under the walls, and sprung a small Mine, which flew in their own faces; but they lost above forty or fifty men dead under the walls, and have drawn off, as some say, near Four hundred more, which they buried up and down the Fields, besides what are wounded, and as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiquin</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50337:4"/>
himself confessed, in the hearing of some of their Soldiers lately come to us, hath lost him above One thousand men: The Enemy was drawing off his dead a good part of the night; they were in such haste upon the assault, that they killed their own Trumpet, as he was returning with an Answer to a Summons sent by them; both in the taking and defending of this place, Col: <hi>Reynolds</hi> his carriage was such, as deserves much honor. Upon our coming before <hi>Waterford,</hi> I sent the Lieutenant General with a Regiment of Horse, and three Troops of Dragoons, to endeavor the reducing of <hi>Passage-Fort,</hi> a very large Fort, with a Castle in the midst of it, having five Guns planted in it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the River better then <hi>Duncannon,</hi> it not being much above Musquet shot over where this Fort stands, and we can bring up hither Ships of Three hundred Tuns, without any danger from <hi>Duncannon;</hi> upon the attempt, though our materials were not very apt for the business, yet the Enemy called for Quarter, and had it, and we the place: We also possessed the Guns, which the Enemy had planted to beat our Ships out of the Bay, two miles below. By the taking of this Fort, we shall much streighten <hi>Duncannon</hi> from provisions by water, as we hope they are not in a condition to get much by Land; besides the advantage it is of to us, to have provisions to come up the River. It hath pleased the Lord whilest these things hath been thus transacting here, to adde to your interest in <hi>Munster, Bandon-Bridge,</hi> the Town as we hear upon the matter, thrusting out yong <hi>Jepson,</hi> who was their Governor, or else he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting it upon that jealousie; As also <hi>Kingsale,</hi> and the Fort there, out of which Fort Four hundred men marched upon Articles when it was surrendred, so that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50337:4"/>
now by the good hand of the Lord, your interest in <hi>Munster</hi> is near as good already, as ever it was since this War begun. I sent a party about two days ago to my Lord of <hi>Broughil,</hi> from whom I expect to have an Accompt of all. Sir, what can be said to these things? is it an Arm of Flesh that doth these things? is it the Wisdom and Councel, or Strength of men? it is the Lord onely; God will curse that man and his house, that dares to think otherwise. Sir, you see the Work is done by divine leading; God gets into the hearts of men, and perswades them to come under you. I tell you, a considerable party of your Army, is fitter for an Hospital then the Field: If the Enemy did not know it, I should have held it impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique to have writ it: They know it, yet they know not what to do. I humbly beg leave to offer a word or two; I beg of those that are faithful, that they give glory to God; I wish it may have influence upon the Hearts and Spirits of all those that are now in place of Government, in the greatest Trust, that they may all in Heart draw neer unto God, giving him glory by holiness of life and conversation, That these unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mercies, may teach dissenting Brethren on all sides to agree, at least in praising God. And if the Father of the Family be so kinde, why should there be such jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and heart-burnings amongst the Children? And if it will not yet be received, that these are Seals of Gods Approbation of your great change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which indeed was no more yours, then these Victories and Successes are ours: with us say even the most unsatisfied heart, That both are the Righteous Judgments, and Mighty Works of God; that he hath pulled down the Mighty from his Seat; that calls to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50337:5"/>
accompt innocent blood; that he thus breaks the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his Church in peeces; and let them not be sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, but praise the Lord; and think of us as they please, and we shall be satisfied, and pray for them, and wait upon our God; and we hope we shall seek the Welfare and Peace of our Native Countrey; and the Lord give them hearts to do so too. Indeed I was constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Bowels to write thus much: I ask your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and rest</p>
