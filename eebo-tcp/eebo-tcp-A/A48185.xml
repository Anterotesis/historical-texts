         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

LETTER
TO A
Member of Parliament
CONCERNING
Clandeſtine Trade.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THAT the Trade of this Nation is the
chief Support thereof, is viſible to any
Perſon, that conſiders the vaſt Supplies
which have been given to his Majeſty by Funds laid
upon Trade during the War. And the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of maintaining the Trade of the Nation
neceſſarily follows upon the Conſideration of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37151:3"/>
Premiſes, which cannot be done while the Fair Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
is unfairly dealt with, and indeed the whole
Affair of Commerce embaraſs'd throughout the
whole Kingdom. The intrinſick Value of the Lands
of this Realm will not defray the Charge of a long
and expenſive War, without the Auxiliary Aſſiſtance
of Merchants Traders, who are not only the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Realm at ſuch a Juncture, but in times
of Peace are the Support of the Civil Liſt, and
their Stocks the Funds of his Majeſty's Revenue.
His Majeſty is very ſenſible of the Advantage of
Trade, who in his Gracious Speech to both Houſes
of Parliament at the opening of this Seſſions was
pleaſed to aſſure his People, he would make it his
buſineſs to encourage it, and as an advantage to it,
propos'd the preparing of ſome good Bill for the more
effectual preventing and puniſhing Clandeſtine and
Unlawful Trading, which does not only tend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
the Publick, but prejudices the Fair Merchant,
and diſcourages our own Manufactures.</p>
            <p>There is nothing conduces more to the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of clandeſtine Trade than the Diſcouragement
of the fair Dealer; for the Fortune of the one is built
upon the Ruin of the other; 'tis the ſame in Trade as
in Government: Where Knaves and ill Men are in
favor and prefer'd, and Men of Probity and Honeſty
diſcountenanced, that Government looks with a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37151:3"/>
languid and ſickly Aſpect. The Clandeſtine Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is a Creature bound neither by the Laws of
God nor Man he robs <hi>Ceſar</hi> of his due, and makes
a Nullity of Human Laws; he ſacrifices his Soul,
Conſcience, Honour, Reputation, and all that is
dear to Mankind, to his inſatiable Avarice; while
the Fair Trader languiſhes under Oppreſſion, and
becomes a Sufferer by dealing honeſtly.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſay? Where lies the fault?
Have we no Laws reſtraining Clandeſtine Trade?
Yes, a great many; but what ſignify Laws if they
are laid aſide by <hi>Noli Proſequi</hi>'s, Letters of Licence,
or Orders of Compoſition from above? Theſe are
Encouragements to the Clandeſtine Trader, while
the Fair Merchant is haraſſed by perpetual Delays
at the Cuſtom Houſe, by the irregular working at
the Water-ſide, by the new Gimcracks and Methods
introduced inſtead of Regulations in the Cuſtom-houſe,
by the trouble they meet with in paſſing
their Entries, attending many times ſeveral days
together upon the Officers: theſe are all Hardſhips
and Diſcouragements to the fair Dealer, while the
Smuggler eaſes himſelf of theſe Perplexities, and the
Payment of his Duties at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate the thing more plainly, I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the latter, and ſhow how the Innovations
in the Cuſtom-houſe are a common Grievance and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37151:4"/>
Perplexity to Merchants. After a Merchant has
learn'd his Trade, he has one thing yet more difficult
to underſtand, <hi>viz.</hi> the manner of paſſing his Goods
at the Cuſtom-houſe, and paying the King's Duties;
and by that time he is pretty well inſtructed in this
Affair, come new Commiſſioners, new Laws, new
Methods, and new Practices, and he is as much at a
loſs as if he had never learn'd. I ſhall only touch
a little at the Innovations lately made in the Cuſtom-houſe
at <hi>London;</hi> for my Trade lying very little in
the out Ports, my knowledg of their Management
there is as ſmall.</p>
            <p>In the year 1695, the Wharfingers belonging
to the Keys adjoining to the Cuſtom-houſe enter'd
into a Combination to bring all their Wharfs into
one Intereſt, that by that means they might the
better manage the Merchants to their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
which ſucceeded to the no ſmall trouble of
the Merchants. Out of this ſprang a Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongſt the Land-waiters and King's-waiters,
which prov'd more fatal to the fair Trader than
that of the Wharfingers. Theſe combined to leſſen
the number of the Land-waiters: this Plot was
under the care and management of ſeven Directors,
and their Intereſt in this management was to have
the working of all Ships to themſelves, with all
the Profits thereby ariſing. At this time two or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37151:4"/>
three of that Board being either dead or removed,
they prevail'd upon the Commiſſioners (one part
of which were new ones) to diſcontinue at leaſt
thirty of thoſe they now call Key-men from their
Employments, which was done ſeventeen days
before the Lords of the Treaſury gave any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
in that Affair; and they did this at a
juncture when the greateſt <hi>Virginia</hi> Fleet that ever
was known, join'd with a great Fleet from other
Parts, arriv'd in the River: and how prejudicial
this was to his Majeſty's Revenue, cannot be eaſily
imagin'd; beſides the vaſt Credit of ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds was at this time given upon account
of Poſt-Entries. Had ſome ſort of People enter'd
into a more innocent Combination than this in the
late Reigns, they would have been decently hang'd
for their pains. It is at leaſt thirty years ago there
were eighty Land and King's-waiters in the
Port of <hi>London,</hi> when Trade was leſs conſiderable
than now it is, and then thought few enough to
diſcharge ſo weighty a Truſt.</p>
            <p>Now let us a little conſider the Effects of this
Combination; the Loſs thereby acruing to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Revenue, and the Trouble it brings upon
the Fair Merchants. By former Inſtructions, no
Officer was allowed to work without his Partner, nor
to have more than one Ship at a time upon his hands;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37151:5"/>
but ſince this Combination they have had ſix or ſeven
Ships at a time, and one Officer has often work'd
two or three Ships at once without his Partner,
which renders them uncapable of doing either the
King or Merchant Juſtice; and the fair Merchant
for want of Officers cannot get his Goods aſhore,
during which time the Intereſt of his Mony is loſt,
his Time ſpent to no purpoſe, and perhaps for want
of his Goods he loſes the Sale of them, which is
worſe than all the reſt. See now the Keys all in a
Confuſion, one Officer running from one Ship to
another working both at one time, another ſtaring
about him to find his Ships out, having ſo many he
knows not half of them; here the Porters curſing
and ſwearing, there the Merchants fretting and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for want of Officers: here is the moſt exact
Picture of Diſorder and Confuſion; the diſorderly
Crowd ſeem more like a Gang of <hi>Babel</hi> Bricklayers
than regular Workers at the Keys. This hurry makes
well for the Clandeſtine Trader, who has now an
opportunity of doing his buſineſs, who, like the
Pickpocket, carries on his Trade moſt ſecurely in a
noiſy buſy Crowd. To corroborate this we may
add, that very few Seiſures have been made ſince
the aforeſaid Officers have been diſcontinued; for
how can a Perſon that works alone, and perhaps
upon two or three Ships at one time, have leiſure
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37151:5"/>
to examine Packs and Bales of Goods? ſo that
Goods prohibited, or charged with a higher Duty, may
paſs in ſuch Packs or Bales for want of inſpection.
It is worthy Remark, that as ſoon as this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
was detected, and the Combinators Books
and Papers order'd to be ſent for, they had time
enough given them to make away the Book of their
Accounts, which contain'd the Particulars of their
Disburſements; for all Plots are carried on by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
and Mony rais'd for that purpoſe. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an Oath of Secrecy, as ſome have hinted, was
adminiſtred or no I can't tell, but I underſtand that
a Sum of Mony was laid in Bank for the Security
of the Combination; and ſome have been heard
to ſay they have been 20<hi>l.</hi> out of Pocket towards
the carrying on of the Deſign; and I am told one
Article of the Combination was, that no Perſon,
upon pain of divers Penalties therein mention'd,
ſhould ask or inquire how the Mony was diſpoſed
of, or to whom it was paid: which looks as if ſome
Perſons of a higher rank than themſelves were in
the Combination.</p>
            <p>It would be worth enquiry to know to whom
the Mony has been paid, and what Sums they have
levied upon themſelves ſince the Commencement
of the Combination; and ſuch a Power as that
of your Houſe may command the original Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37151:6"/>
of Combination to be laid before you, which
I underſtand is yet in being. And I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it a thing worthy your Notice to inquire into
Matters of this nature; for a Combination that
leſſens the King's Revenue, increaſes the Taxes
upon the good People you repreſent; and what
is loſt by this means, muſt be made good by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Supplies from you. And 'tis a juſt Query,
Whether thoſe Men who combine to leſſen the
King's Revenue, would not do the ſame to ſhorten
his Life? for taking away Life and Livelihood are
very near akin.</p>
            <p>Tho it is not much my buſineſs to enquire into
the Managery of the Cuſtoms, any farther than
it relates to the paſſing of Goods and payment of
Duties, yet what lies in a Man's way he may better
take notice of than ſtumble over it: It is certainly
viſible to a very mean Capacity, that the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Officers at this time can be no ways ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the King nor Merchants, when the increaſe
of Trade requires an addition of many more.
The abundance of Officers added in the long
Room at the Cuſtom-houſe, is no Indication that
any ſhould be diſcontinued upon the Keys: this
Practice is obvious to no man's Reaſon, but muſt
be left as a Riddle and Myſtery to be unfolded only
by thoſe that have power to examine into it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:37151:6"/>
The Lords of the Treaſury did indeed examine
into the Affair, and thought fit to diſcharge
<hi>Colcheſter,</hi> one of the Principals in the Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But this Combination is a Monſter of many
Heads, and to take off one is juſt the cutting a
Sucker from a Tree, which makes it grow the
better; this is true in fact, for the Combination
is ſtill in force, which appears by the viſible Effects
of it, for the thirty Officers are ſtill diſcontinued,
and the Merchant labours under the ſame Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.
The diſcontinuance of theſe Officers was the
effect of the Combination, which rationally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates
that the Cauſe is not removed; if it were,
the Effect would ceaſe.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of puniſhing the Combinators, as a
Terror to ſucceeding Officers that ſhould attempt
any thing of this nature, two of them ſince that
time have been preferred to be Surveyors, when
at the ſame time it is generally noted that the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
diſcontinued are Men of the beſt Characters
in the Cuſtoms in relation to their knowledg in
Buſineſs, and their Integrity and Affection to his
Majeſty and Government. It could be wiſh'd
that none but ſuch were imploy'd in the Cuſtoms;
for the King's Intereſt would be better conſider'd,
when the King's Duties are under the Care of
ſuch Men as think themſelves bound by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37151:7"/>
of Honeſty and Conſcience to do the King
Juſtice.</p>
            <p>But in this Office we have Men imploy'd that
have paid double Taxes to the King as Non-jurors;
and I remember ſome time ſince I read two Papers
concerning one <hi>Daſſel</hi> a Land-waiter: one Paper
recites an Order of Council for diſcharging the
ſaid <hi>Daſſel</hi> from his Imployment for trading and
correſponding with <hi>France</hi> during the War; and the
other, two Acts of Parliaments expreſly prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his being imploy'd in the Service of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
for the future: and yet the ſaid <hi>Daſſel</hi>
(notwithſtanding other Complaints againſt him in
the Execution of his Office) is continued a Land-waiter
to this very day.</p>
            <p>I ſhould not, Sir, have enlarg'd ſo much upon
the Subject of this Combination, could I have
found out any way of redreſſing ſo great a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
but by the Power of Parliament. The
weekly Obſervations of the irregular working at
the Water-ſide are conſtantly laid before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners;
the diſcontinued Officers complain, the
Merchants complain, and the honeſteſt of the Land-waiters
themſelves murmur at the multiplicity of
Buſineſs they have on their hands: but all ſignifies
nothing, for it ſeems the Merchants and King's
Intereſt muſt both be ſacrificed to the greedy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37151:7"/>
Avarice of a parcel of ſelf-intereſted Perſons.</p>
            <p>And upon the whole, the Premiſes conſidered,
may we not rationally conclude that this Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
ſubſiſts by the influence of ſome greater
Perſons than the Combinators themſelves? In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
days no ſuch thing was aim'd at, tho then
there was more room for ſuch an Attempt than at
this juncture, when the Increaſe of Trade requires
an Addition of Officers; and how ill a thing
muſt this ſeem to any diſintereſted Perſons, that
the King's Intereſt ſhould be conſpir'd againſt, and
deſtroy'd by Men that eat his Bread? Had ſuch a
Retrenchment of Officers been for the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
the Lords of the Treaſury would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
and not diſcharged <hi>Colcheſter:</hi> But the
thing is condemn'd and exploded by all hands,
yet kept afoot only for Reaſons beſt known to the
Pocket of ſome body or other.</p>
            <p>Should I mention the many other Abuſes in the
Cuſtoms, as in the King's Ware-houſe, in the Ware-houſe
belonging to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
I ſhould too far exceed the limits of a Letter, and
ſhall therefore conclude with my Sentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Cauſe of thoſe Irregularities.</p>
            <p>Not only the Misfortunes of Nations and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
but of particular Perſons, often do ariſe
from Intereſt and Avarice: From hence had the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37151:8"/>
Combination its undoubted Original: And by my
Converſe with the Officers of the Cuſtoms I find
moſt of them came in by Intereſt of Friends, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any farther Recommendation of Merit, or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonials
of their Affection to the Government, or
their Services to their Country. But becauſe they
have ſerv'd in the quality of a Footman, Valet, or in
any other Capacity to the Lords of the Treaſury, or
are related to the Commiſſioners, or have had ſome
other dependance upon them, therefore they are
made Officers of the Cuſtoms. Now ſhould we
Merchants manage our Stocks as the King's Revenue
is manag'd, every week would produce at leaſt a
Column of Advertiſements of Commiſſions of
Bankrupt in the <hi>Gazette.</hi> If I have a Relation that
is a Carpenter, I will imploy him to build my
Houſe, but not to keep my Books: I will not ſend
him my Factor into a Foreign Country, nor will I
make him Super-cargo of my Merchandize; and
certainly as great Care ought to be taken of the
management of the Publick Revenue as of a Private
Concern. Is a Perſon juſt come from cleaning
of Shoes, and rubbing of Horſes heels, or carrying
a Cloak, fit to be imploy'd in the management of
ſo great a Concern? And are not Men of a ſervile
Education (how fawning and creeping ſoever they
may be to their Superiors and Benefactors) the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37151:8"/>
moſt imperious and inſolent in the Execution of their
Office?</p>
            <p>Such Promotions as theſe ſeem at the very firſt
view oppoſite to the King's Intereſt, for the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Perſons employ'd can never fail of
Miſcarriages; and if wilful Crimes are added to
their Sins of Ignorance, no notice is to be taken of
either, for they have Advocates at hand, whoſe
Intereſt it is to bear them out in their Miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
And to complain againſt ſuch Men is beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Air, and knocking Heads againſt Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls.</p>
            <p>I ſhall enlarge no farther, but ſince I have given
you the Clue that leads into the <hi>Maze</hi> of the
Cuſtom-houſe, ſhall leave the Improvement of the
whole to your better Underſtanding, and remain,</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Your moſt humble Servant.</signed>
