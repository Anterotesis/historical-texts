            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If any <hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>Iudas</hi> be so hastie, that he will not stay till it be made <hi>Bread,</hi> tarry for tentation, but tempt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; the Deuill is glad that they saue him a labour: howsoeuer, he will haue his Graine ready; his sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion shall not be to seeke when he should vse it. Hee would be loath that the lustfull eye should want a Harlot, the corrupt Officer a bribe, the Papist an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the Vsurer a Morgage, the theefe a bootie.

Hee cries out, as the Vsurer at his

But when <hi>Diues</hi> hath dined, the Deuill takes away: Death is his knife, and Hell his voyder. Hee takes away one Dish more then he set downe; in stead of the reuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Feasters themselues, nay the Feast-maker too: for <hi>Diues</hi> is the founder, and <hi>Sathan</hi> is the confounder: the one prouides meate for the belly, the other, by Gods sufferance,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.13.</note>

this sad sequell is (if not a relatiue, yet) a redditiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of their miserie; for after the infection of sinne, followes the infliction of punishment.

like a Bee with a sting in the taile.

A little Colliquintida, that embitters the Broath. A perillous, a pernicious, rocke, that splits the Ship in the Hauen.

                  <p>It is obseruable that <hi>Salomons</hi> prouerbiall sayes, are so many select Aphorismes; contayning, for the most part, a paire of crosse and thwart sentences; handled rather by collation then relation; whose coniunction is disiunctiue.

                  <p>Thus haue wee discribed the <hi>Temptresse.</hi> The <hi>Tempted</hi> followes, who are here called the <hi>Dead.</hi> There be three kindes of death, corporall, spirituall, eternall. Corporall, when the body leaues this life. Spirituall, when the soule forsakes, and is forsaken of grace. Eternall, when both shall be throwne into hell. 1. is the seperation of the soule from the body. 2. is the seperation of body and soule from grace. 3. the sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them both from euerlasting happinesse. Man hath two parts, by which hee liues; and two places, wherein he might liue, if hee obayed God: Earth for a time, Heauen for euer. This <hi>Harlot Sin,</hi> depriues either part of man in either place of true life; and subiects him, both to the first and second death.

                  <p>These are the <hi>dead</hi> guests. <hi>Dead</hi> to all goodnesse.

To all religion the heart is a piece of dead flesh. No loue, no feare, no care, no paine can pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate their senselesse and remorselesse hearts. I know, that according to the speech of the Philosopher, <hi>Nemo fit repente miser:</hi> This is no sodaine euill: they were borne sick, they haue made themselues dead. Custome hath inveterated the vlcer, rankled the conscience, and now sinne flowtes the Physitians cure, knowing the soule dead. Through many wounds they come to this death. At first they sinne and care not, now they sinne and know not: The often taken Potion neuer works. Euen the Physicke of reproofe turnes now to their hardning. Oh that our times vvere not full of this deadnesse! How many neuer take the maske of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but to serue their owne turnes!

The conscience, I confesse, will not euer lye quiet in these dead guests: but as they haue iayled vp that for a while in the darknesse of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie</hi>; so when God looseth it, it will rage as fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and dogge them to their graues. For as there is a Heauen on earth, so a Hell on earth. The dead to sinne are heauen'd in this world: the <hi>dead</hi> in sinne are hell'd here, by the tormenting anguish of an vnappeaseable conscience. As Bishop <hi>Latimer,</hi> in a Sermon, told these guests of a Feast in Hell; which wil afford them little mirth: where <hi>weeping</hi> is serued in for the first course, <hi>gnashing of teeth</hi> for the second.

                  <p>But these spiritually <hi>dead guests</hi> doe not euermore scape so long: sometimes God giues them in this life a draught of that viall of his wrath which they shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sup off to the bottome. The wicked man, that had no feare, now shall haue too much feare. Hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with the wanton Comedie of presumption and profanenesse, ends with the Tragedie of horrour and despaire. Before he was so a-sleepe, that nothing could waken him: now hee is so waking, that nothing can bring him a-sleepe.

The more thou offerest to damme vp this current, the more ragingly it swels, and gusheth ouer the resisting banckes. This wounded Conscience runnes like the stricken Deare,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:23676:103"/>
with the arrow of death in the ribbes, from thicket to thicket, from shelter to shelter, but cannot change her paine with her place. The wound ranckles in the soule, and the longer it goes on, the worse still it festers. Thus sinne that spake thee so faire at her inuiting to the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> now presents to thy waked soule her true forme; and playes the make-bate betwixt God and thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thee and thy selfe. So long as securitie hath kept thee sleeping in thy delighted impieties, this quarrell is not commenced. The mortallest enemies are not alwayes in pitched fields one against another.</p>
                  <p>This truce holds some till their death-beds; neither doe they euer complaine, till their complaints can doe them no good. For then at once, the sicke carkase, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many tossings and turnings to finde the easiest side, moanes his vnabated anguish: and the sicker consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, after triall of many shifts, too late feeleth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth her vnappeased torment. So <hi>Cain, Iudas, Nero,</hi> in vaine seeke for forraine helps, when their executioner is within them. The wicked man cannot want furies, so long as he hath himselfe. Indeede the soule may flye from the body, not sinne from the soule. An impatient <hi>Iudas</hi> may leape out of the priuate hell in himselfe, into the common pit below; as the boyling fishes out of the Caldron into the flame. But the gaine hath beene, the addition of a new hell without them, not the losse of the old hell within them.

All his vitall parts, whereby he should liue to goodnesse, are in a swoune: he lies bed-rid in his <hi>securitie,</hi> and hath little lesse then giuen vp the <hi>(Holy)</hi> Ghost. It cannot be denied, but that he lies at the <hi>mercie</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> It is therefore too late to tolle his <hi>Passing-bell,</hi> that hath no breath of obedience left in him: I might rather ring out his knell. Yet because there are many in this world, that are not of this world: many sicke of the generall disease of <hi>Sin,</hi> whose recouerie is not hopelesse, though their present state be happelesse; and some, that if they knew but themselues sicke, would resort to the <hi>Poole of Bethes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,

I haue endeuoured the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the other to <hi>God;</hi> who can both <hi>kill</hi> and <hi>giue life:</hi> who is yet pleased, by his <hi>word,</hi> to worke our recouery; and to make me one (vnworthy) instrument, to administer his <hi>Phisicke.</hi> Now as the most accurate <hi>Phisitians,</hi> ancient or moderne, though they deliuered precepts in their facultie, worthy of the worlds accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and vse; yet they set them forth vnder some No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Patronage: so I haue presumed, vnder the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of your protection, to publish this (phisicall or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) metaphysicall Treatise: for as the Sicknesse is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, so the cure must be supernaturall. Assuring my selfe, that if you shall vse any obseruation here, and giue it your good word of <hi>Probatum est,</hi> many others wil be induced the more redily to embrace it. My intent is to doe good: and if I had any better Receite, I would not (like some <hi>Phisitians,</hi> I know not whither more enuious or couetous, with an excellent Medicine) let it liue and die with my selfe.

                  <p>How few shalt thou meete, if their tongues would be true to their griefes, without some disturbance or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?

through the <hi>Prophets</hi> lips, who toles like a Passing-Bell, for <hi>Israell,</hi> yet they come from the mouth of the <hi>Lord of Hoasts.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ezekiell</hi> vseth like words;<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note> and addes with them, <hi>the Lord of Hoasts saith it.</hi> There is no doubt of his spirituall inspiration: all the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is of his personall appropriation.

is the <hi>Wisedome</hi> of God in working on mens affections; which leades vs here from naturall wants subiect to sense, to supernaturall, inuisible, and more secret defects: from miseries to mysteries.

                  <p>Horrid and to be trembled at are the sinnes, that bring heauinesse into the Courts of happinesse; and send grieuance to the very thresholds of ioy.

They doe (if I may speake) grieue and mourne at the auersion of our soules, (so hopefull and likely to be brought to Heauen) and at the aspiration of our climbing sinnes.</p>
                  <p>But it may be questioned, how God can be said to <hi>grieue, to complaine,</hi> to be <hi>sorrowfull</hi> for vs. True it is, that there is no passion in God. Hee that sits in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, hath all pleasure and content in himselfe. What is here spoken, is for our sakes spoken. He dwelleth in such brightnesse of glory, as neuer mortall foot could approach vnto: the sight of his face is to vs on earth insufferable: the knowledge of the inuisible things in the Deitie vnpossible. Therefore to giue some ayme and coniecture to vs, what hee is, hee appeares (as it were) transfigured into the likenesse of our nature, and in our owne familiar termes speaketh to our shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vnderstandings. <hi>Hominem alloquens humano more loquitur.</hi> As an old man speaking to a Childe, frames his voyce in a childish phrase. Before a great vessell that is full, can powre liquour from it selfe into a little empty Pot, that stands vnder it, it must stoope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it selfe. Thus he descends to our capacities; and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:23676:125"/>
that man may know him in some measure, hee will be knowne as man. Sometimes by bodily members, Eyes, Eares, Hands, Feet. Sometimes by spirituall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Anger, Sorrow, Iealousie, Repentance. By which he signifies, not what hee is indeed, but what is needfull for vs to know of him. For being well acquainted with the vse, office, and effect of these na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things in our selues, wee may the better guesse at the knowledge of that God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nothing pleaseth a furious mans nature, but wreaking himselfe on his prouoker. The passion is Anger, the effect Reuenge.

                  <p>Complaints are the witnes of a grieued soule: both are sufferings. God is here said to complaine. Why? he is grieued at our sinnes. Can he be grieued indeed? No nor need he complaine, that hath such power to right himselfe. Yet hee is often said to be grieued; <hi>Grieue not the Spirit of God, by whom you are sealed vp to the day of Redemption:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.30.</note> And here to complaine.

                  <p>The nature of Repentance is Sorrow: the effect of repentance is the abrogation of something deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or vndoing (if it be possible) of some thing done. Repentance is not in God, in regard of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall nature of it; he cannot sorrow: but is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the euentuall fruit; when hee destroyes that world of people, hee had made.

It is like the Vine for this vertue; onely the Vine (but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) nourisheth: the <hi>Balme</hi> both nourisheth the good, and expelleth the euill, that is in man. These two are Gods trees. When euery God, saith the <hi>Poet,</hi> chose his seuerall tree; <hi>Iupiter</hi> the long-liued Oake; <hi>Neptune</hi> the tall <hi>Cedar, Apollo</hi> the greene <hi>Laurell, Venus</hi> the white Poplar; <hi>Pallas</hi> (whom the <hi>Poets</hi> faine, to be borne of <hi>Iupiters</hi> braine, and Mythologists interpret <hi>Wisedome</hi>) chose the <hi>Vine.</hi> Our true and onely God, that oweth all, hath more especially chosen the <hi>Vine</hi> and the <hi>Balme,</hi> one for preseruation, the other for restauration of our health. Onely the <hi>Balme</hi> hath both elementall Phisicke, and alimentall vertue in it.</p>

Liuer in the body, compared with zeale in the soule. The Liuer (according to Phisitians) is the third prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall member, wherein rest the animall spirits.

For a man is begotten <hi>of immortall seed,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> at once. Now as the Liuer calefies the stomach, (like fire vnder the Pot) and thence succours digestion: so doth zeale heate a mans workes, with an holy feruour; which are without that, a cold sacrifice to God.

infectious breathings of your corruption and malice; and reproue vs with the <hi>spirit of meekenesse,</hi> to our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads. If wee neither cleare our selues from imputed guiltinesse, nor amend the iustly reproued faults, nor kindely embrace your louing admonitions, proceede with your impartiall censures. But still know, that we are nothing in our selues; though we be called <hi>lux mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> the <hi>light of the world,</hi> yet <hi>solummodo lex est lux,</hi> Gods <hi>word</hi> is the <hi>light,</hi> that must conduct your beleeuing and obeying soules to the <hi>land</hi> of <hi>Promise.</hi> Did we liue like Angels, and yet had our lips sealed vp from teaching you, you might still remaine in your sinnes. For it is not an ignorant imitation of goodnesse, but a sound faith in <hi>Christ</hi> (neuer destitute of knowledge and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) that must saue you in the day of the <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Lastly, let this teach you, to get your selues fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar acquaintance with the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> that if you be put to it, in the absence of your <hi>Phisitian,</hi> you may yet helpe your selues. We store our memories, and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not trusting them) our Bookes, with diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites for ordinarie diseases. Whom almost shall you meete, (whiles you complaine of an Ague, of the Tooth-ach, of a Sore) but he will tell you a Salue or a Medicine for it? Alas, are our soules lesse precious, or their wounds, griefes, sicknesses easilier cured, that wee keepe the Clossets of our consciences emptie of Medicines for them? The <hi>Iewes</hi> were commaunded to write <hi>the Lawes</hi> of God on their <hi>walls,</hi> &amp;c. God <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 8.10.</note>writes them on the <hi>Christians hearts.</hi> So <hi>Dauid</hi> found it. <hi>Thy Law is within my heart.</hi> This is true acquaintance with it. It is our Masters charge, if at least we are his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 5.39.</note> 
                     <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them is eternall life.</hi> We plead, that our faith is our euidence for Heauen: it is a poore euidence, that wants the <hi>seale</hi> of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>

                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:23676:179"/>It was the weapon, that the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God himselfe vsed, to beate backe the assaults of the Deuill. Many ignorant persons defie the Deuill: <hi>They will shield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from Satan, as well as the best that teach them: the foule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table way, to braue a Lyon, and yet come within his clutches. Hee will beare with thy hote words, so hee may get thy colde soule. The weapon, that must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and conquer him, is <hi>the sword of the spirit,</hi> the <hi>word</hi> of God. No houre is free from his temptations, that wee had neede to lodge with Gods Booke in our bosomes. 1. Who knowes, where he shall receiue his next wound, or of what nature the sicknesse of his soule shall be? 2. The <hi>Minister</hi> cannot be present with euery one, and at euery time. 3. <hi>Satan</hi> is neuer idle; it is the trade of his delight to spill soules. Lay all these together, and then (in the feare of God) iudge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you can be safe, whiles you are ignorant of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> This is the <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>Eden,</hi> whence runne those foure Riuers, of <hi>Wisedome</hi> to direct vs, of <hi>oyle</hi> to soften vs, of <hi>comforts</hi> to refresh vs, of <hi>promises</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vs.</p>
                  <p>As lightly as you regard the <hi>word,</hi> and as slightly as you learne it, you shall one day finde more comfort in it, then in all the world. Lye you on your Death-beds, grone you with the pangs of nature-oppressing Death, or labour you with the throbs of an anguished con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, when neither naturall nor spirituall Phisitian stands by you, to giue you succour; then, oh then, one dramme of your old store, taken from the <hi>treasurie</hi> of <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> shal be vnto you of inestimable comfort. Then well-fare a Medicine at a pinch, a drop of this <hi>Balme</hi> ready for a sodaine wound, which your memory
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:23676:179"/>
shall reach forth, and your faith apply to your diseased soules, afflicted hearts. Thinke seriously of this, and recall Gods <hi>Booke</hi> from banishment, and the Land of forgetfulnesse, whither your securitie hath sent it. Shake off the dust of neglect from the couer, and weare out the leaues with turning: continually imploring the assistance of Gods <hi>spirit,</hi> that you may read with vnderstanding, vnderstand with memorie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member with comfort: that your Soules Closset may neuer be vnstored of those heauenly rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
