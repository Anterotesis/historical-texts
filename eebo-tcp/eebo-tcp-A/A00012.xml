            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Thus vnto me two Dreames by night he told,</l>
            <l>Which, as they proue, my <hi>Grand-sire</hi> did vnfold,</l>

            <l>His dreame, whom now the King so honored,</l>
            <l>But hauing learn'd with <hi>Patience</hi> to attend</l>
            <l>Gods leasure, and to hope vnto the end,</l>
            <l>Eu'n at that time, when as I least expected,</l>

            <l>On whom they all attend to doe his pleasure,</l>
            <l>By one poore Dreame but from an heathen King,</l>
            <l>What's long before decreed to passe doth bring:</l>
            <l>I rais'd to <hi>Grace,</hi> the World from <hi>Famine</hi> quite,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Butler</hi> doth acknowledge his <hi>ore-sight</hi>:</l>

            <l>My <hi>Brethren</hi> bold are to <hi>Repentance</hi> brought</l>
            <l>For all the wickednesse, which they had wrought:</l>
            <l>And this my wicked Mistris may reclame,</l>
            <l>And bring her to acknowledgement with shame,</l>
            <l>And make my master see his foolish passion,</l>
            <l>And learne to Iudge by better information:</l>
            <l>My two first Dreames proue true which I had told,</l>

               <hi>Pharoh</hi> thus gaines the wealth of all his Land,</l>
            <l>And must acknowledge it from Gods owne hand,</l>
            <l>Thus all the parts of this sweet sacred story,</l>

               <l>And though the wormes my skin and flesh destroy,</l>
               <l>I God shall in my body see with ioy,</l>
               <l>Eu'n with mine owne; and with no other eyes:</l>
               <l>But now my <hi>spirit</hi> begins so high to rise,</l>
               <l>As if she meant to leaue this habitation,</l>
               <l>And flye to heau'n, by holy contemplation;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:19269:49"/>Oft hath she striu'd to rise before this day,</l>
               <l>As weary of her brittle Tent of Clay,</l>
               <l>But hath beene by the weight thereof deprest,</l>
               <l>But now shee feeles her selfe from thence releast,</l>
               <l>I cannot last, my Lampe so fast doth spend,</l>
               <l>And now burnes clearest, nearest to the end,</l>
               <l>Farewell deare sonnes; my Blessing on you all</l>
               <l>Continue to your after-Ages shall.</l>
               <l>Oh <hi>God of Life</hi>; now thou dost me denie,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Powre to liue,</hi> me willing make to die.</l>
               <l>These all are those twelue <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Which good old <hi>Iacob</hi> blest and wished well,</l>
               <l>Besides the blessing to each seuerall,</l>
               <l>Wherein he told them what should after fall:</l>
               <l>And now as <hi>Ioseph</hi> erst he made to sweare,</l>
               <l>So chargeth he eu'n all his Children there,</l>
               <l>To lay him in that place of Buriall,</l>
               <l>Where his fore-fathers were interred all:</l>
               <l>Thus when his swan-like song was at an end,</l>
               <l>And all commanded that he did intend,</l>
               <l>He plucked vp his feete into the Bed,</l>
               <l>And was vnto his people gathered.</l>
               <l>Oh happy man! saith <hi>Pharoh, God</hi> me send</l>
               <l>Eu'n such a <hi>life,</hi> and such a happy end.</l>
               <l>Lo, farther <hi>Pharoh</hi> did that day command,</l>
               <l>That all his <hi>Peeres</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Should goe with <hi>Ioseph</hi> and his Brethren all,</l>
               <l>To honour holy <hi>Iacobs</hi> funerall:</l>
               <l>Where they seu'n dayes made so great <hi>Lamentation,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>They draue the <hi>Cananites</hi> to admiration:</l>
               <l>And after he was buried in this sort,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ioseph</hi> returnes againe to <hi>Pharohs</hi> Court,</l>
               <l>His Brethren vnto <hi>Goshen,</hi> where in peace,</l>
               <l>They Liued, and did mightily increase,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:19269:49"/>Till <hi>Ioseph</hi> was an hundred ten yeares old,</l>
