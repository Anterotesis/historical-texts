         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It grieveth my Soul to think, what Pitiful, Raw, and Ignorant Preaching is
crowded moſt after, meerly for the loudneſs of the Preacher's Voice:
How often have I known the ableſt Preacher undervalued, and an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Man by Crouds applauded, when I, who have been acquainted with
the Preacher, <hi>ab incunabilis,</hi> have known him to be unable to anſwer moſt

this Book is to your Lp; ſo there
were never any Reaſons more ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than thoſe that have iniduced me to this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication:
For, firſt, if in this Incredulous Age,
ſome men ſhould charge the following Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of any falſhoods; it were an injuſtice done
to your Lp, to pretend, that any man is ſo capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

the throng of ſo much Eccleſiaſtick and Civil Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſs

Solitude in the Country) have been very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

a hearer of thoſe wonderful Preachers of
whom I now treat, that you have every day
heard them with joy for many hours together;
and never fail'd, with your own hand, to write
thoſe learned and Elaborate Diſcourſes I have
here publiſhed; and many more of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
in which Zeal (to your glory and to the
ſhame of other Profeſſors be it ſpoken) you had
no equal, but one Reverend Ruling Elder, a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net-maker

Your Lp. knows well, that it's in poſſible for the

Heart-ſerarching Elequence</hi> of thoſe Sons of <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Kirkrone, Rule, Schilds, Areskine, Chrightone,
Dickſon, &amp;c.</hi> and that there is ſuch a real diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt their Sermons and that of the
Prelatical Party, that if the firſt be Goſpel, as
your Lp. is fully perſwaded; then it muſt be
received by all men, for an unqueſtionable truth,
that the Goſpel was never preached in <hi>Scotland</hi>
when Prelacy prevail'd in it, as your Lp. and
the Godly party you Patronize, have often af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd:
And tho' this were not evident to all
that compare the Works of the preſent Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
with thoſe of their Oppoſits, yet your Lps.
ſimple word would paſs in the World for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
proof of it, Lying, Slandering, or the leaſt
known falſhood being infinitely below ſuch a
true Gentleman: Nay, there is no Heroick Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
more conſpicuous in your Lp, than your Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity,
which hath ſo fill'd the Minds and
Mouths of all who intimately know you, that it
muſt needs one day make a conſiderable figure
in the account of your Lps. Life, which cannot
miſs to ſee the light in a ſhort time, being, that
for thoſe three years laſt paſt, you have ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully
laboured to furniſh plenty of Memoirs
and Authors for ſuch a work.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>2dly.</hi> Some of the Malignants, who have
no taſt for ſuch Spiritual Sayings, as daily drop
from the Pens and Tongues of the Covenanted
Brethren, may accuſe the Books and Sermons
here cited of <hi>Nonſenſe;</hi> but for as ill natured as
the World is grown, they muſt own, that your
Lp. has been very long, and very intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the trueſt and beſt <hi>Nonſenſe;</hi> ſo
that being a complete Maſter of it your ſelf, it
muſt be allowed that you are alſo a very
good Judge. Beſides, My L. the <hi>Curates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>
cannot deny, but that your Lp. is fully
qualified to judge of the Works of ſuch
learned men as are ſpoke of in this Treatiſe; if
they conſider your wonderful knowledge of,
and great concern for the Mother Univerſity at
St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> which had the happineſs to be
neareſt to your Lp, and to be your particular
charge; and the Kingdom is not unſenſible how
you Reformed and Purged it throughly, with
ſuch unſpeakable Juſtice and Impartially, that
even aged Gentlemen, Drs. of Divinity, and
Heads of Colledges, ſome who had been your
Lordſhips own Maſters, and one your Kinſman,
had not he leaſt regard nor reſpect from you,
becauſe of their wanting <hi>Covenant Grace,</hi> without
which no man is valuable in your Lps. Eyes: Let
men but conſider with what deliberation &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight
<pb facs="tcp:62829:3"/>
you did proceed, and what Prudent and
Learned Advice you did follow in providing for
the Education of the rising Generation in that
Society; and then they can never doubt of your
being wonderfully qualified both to be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
and a Judge of this Book.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations, joyned to that of your
Lps. unexpreſſible Merit (for which I want
a Compariſon) naturally led me to beg you
would take the following <hi>Flowers of Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Eloquence</hi> into your Protection, as cordially
as you do the Anthors of them: If your Lps.
unknown Modeſty would allow it, I could tell
the World in a few words, ſome of your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and acquired Endowments: To your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Conduct which are equal, you have
added ſuch a ſucceſs, as to raiſe the Church and
State of Scotland to be the wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World: Such burning and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
Zeal; ſuch ſtrange and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Prudence, and unparallel'd Piety hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in all your publick Actions, that if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had but wrought together with your Lp.
in any meaſure, then I dare ſay (as your Lp.
excellently words it, in your pious printed
Speech to the Parliament) <hi>A greater diſpatch
had been made of the Prelatiſts, and many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſuffering Miniſters e're now had been delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of their pinches;</hi> and the Enemies of the
Kirk and Covenant had evaniſhed, as they did
lately from Court, when your Lp. condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to appear in perſon at it: It is to you that
the Nation owes her miraculous deliverance
from the Idolatries of the <hi>Creed, Lords-Prayer,</hi>
and <hi>Gloria Patri:</hi> It's your Lp. that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued
us from the Superſtitions of obſerving
<hi>Chriſtmaſs, Eaſter,</hi> and <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> and from
all the Popiſh fopperies of Caſſocks, cloſe
ſleev'd Gowns and Girdles: It's your Lp. that
enriched Their Majeſties Treaſure with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of fourteen fat Biſhops, and with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
expedition have voided more than half
of the Churches of the Kingdom; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
ſuch a ſet of Preachers as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
never flouriſhed in any period of the
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> under any of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Predeceſſors; and now that ſome malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Lords have been brought into the Council
again; your Lp. hath retir'd from it, bravely
ſcorning to ſit at the ſame Board with the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>My L. tho' the times have been reeling and
dangerous, yet your Lp. has, by extraordinary
management, put your ſelf beyond the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
reach and Malice of Fortune, for you have,
indeed, deſerved well of all Parties; K. <hi>James</hi>
is obliged to thank you for the real Service
you have done him; and K. <hi>William</hi> for your
good Will to ſerve His Majeſty: The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Clergy own their good Livings to you;
and the Epiſcopal Divines are bound to you,
for advancing them to the Honour of being
Confeſſors: The ſtubborn <hi>Highlanders</hi> owe all
their Compoſition-money to your Lp; and the
<hi>Weſt Country Rabble</hi> were highly enriched by
your Lp's Countenauce and Protection: You
ſcorn that malignant way of making your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
a Cooks Shop for Strangers; but tho' your
Commons be ſhort, yet, it's well known, that
your Graces are long; at leaſt after Dinner, the
full length of a Curates Sermon, and that is
three quarters of an hour: There is one thing
more that your Lordſhip is moſt remarkable
for, and that is, your daily practice of Family
Duty; it's well known, that there have been
more new Creatures begotten in your Lp's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
than in any other we have yet heard of;
and in this matter, ſuch is your great Goodneſs
and Humility, that you condeſcend often to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to ſome of your Servants, the Paternal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that's known to be due to your Lp. But
all theſe, and many more ſuch like extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Qualifications which the World admire in
your Lordſhip, are nothing to thoſe Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Gifts and Graces which are ſo evident in all
your Actions, that you often take God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that you never make one ſtep without the
ſpecial Aſſiſtance and Direction of the Holy
Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>My L. theſe and other Reaſons (that I now
omit, ſince I hope this ſhall not be the laſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
of this nature) makes me bold to give your

            <p>OUR Bleſſed Saviour, in his Sermon on the
Mount, bids us beware of falſe Teachers; and
tells us, That <hi>by their Fruits we may know
them:</hi> Such Fruits are not open and publick
Scandals, for then the ſimple Multitude (that meaſure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

that the End of Preaching ſhould be the Edification of
the Hearers; the Deſign of it being to perſwade Men
to Piety towards God, and Charity towards one another,
and to draw the Image of God upon the Souls of Men.
But it will appear from what follows, That the <hi>Scotch
Presbyterians</hi> Sermons have no ſuch tendency; for the
Preachers themſelves (who would have the world believe,
that they only are the Powerful, and Soul-refreſhing Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers)
have not been induſtrious to draw the likeneſs of
God upon the Hearts of their Hearers, but meerly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
their own Image there; that is, they labour'd not
to make good Chriſtians, but rigid <hi>Prebyterians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may not be thought to aſſert this without
ground (for I would not ſlander the Devil) I ſhall firſt
give you the true Character of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Paſtors
and People. 2. I ſhall ſay before you, ſome remarkable
paſſages taken out of their own Printed Books, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this Character. 3. Some ſpecial Notes (written
from their own Mouths) as they preach'd them under
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62829:4"/>
the happy Reign of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II, and ſince the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution.
<hi>Laſtly,</hi> I ſhall give you ſome taſte of that
Extemporary Gibberiſh, which they uſe inſtead of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and for which they have juſtled out, not only all
the Liturgies of the Pure and Primitive Church, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Lord's Prayer it ſelf, becauſe it is an evident Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
and Pattern for Chriſtians praying in a ſet Form;
and in all this I ſhall ſay nothing but what I know to
be true, and what I am ready to make appear to be ſo,
upon a fair and free tryal, if that may be had where
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> Rule.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, then I am to give you the true
Character of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Paſtors and People. I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the People, for they are truly the Guides, and
their Paſtors muſt follow them, whom they pretend to
Conduct. For the Preachers of the new Goſpel, knowing
that their trade hath no old nor ſure Foundation, they are
forced to flee to this new and unaccountable Notion, that
the Calling and Conſtituting of Miniſters is in the Power
of the Mob: Now the World knows by too long and ſad
Experience, that their Mobile is not led by Reaſon nor
Religion, but by Fancy and Imagination; ſo that we
may be ſure when the Election of Miniſters is put in
their hands, they will chuſe none but ſuch as will readily
ſooth and indulge them in their moſt extravagant and
mad Humors: What Miniſters can be expected from the
choice of a People void of common Senſe, and guided
by irregular Paſſions, who torture the Scripture, making
it ſpeak the Language of their deluded Imaginations.
They will tell you, that ye ought to fight the Battels of
the Lord, becauſe the Scripture ſays in the Epiſtle to the
<hi>Hebrews, Without ſhedding of Blood there is no Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
They are generally Covetous and Deceitful; and
the Preaching they are bred with, hath no tendency to
work them into the contrary Virtues. They call Peace,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62829:4"/>
Love, Charity, and Juſtice, not Goſpel, but dry Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
only. I had once very great difficulty to convince
one of them, that it was a Sin for him to cheat and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon his Neighbour in matters of Trade, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the faults of his Goods from the Buyer. He ask'd
my Reaſon: I told him, Becauſe he would not wiſh one
to deal ſo with himſelf. <hi>That is</hi> (ſaid he again) <hi>but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality:
for if I ſhall believe in Chriſt I ſhall be ſaved.</hi> I
ask'd him, Was not this Chriſt's ſaying, <hi>Whatſoever ye
would that others ſhould do unto you, that do you unto others?
Yes,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>that was good, but that Chriſt, becauſe of the
hardneſs of the</hi> Jews <hi>Hearts ſpake very much Morality with
his Goſpel.</hi> The poor man ſpoke as he was taught and
bred in the Conventicles; for it will be very long e're
they hear a Sermon upon Juſt Dealing, or Reſtitution of
ill-gotten Goods; and who knows not that deſpiſing of
Dominions, ſpeaking evil of Dignities, and riſing in Arms
againſt the Lord's Anointed, is with them but fighting
the Battels of the Lord. One <hi>George Flint,</hi> in the Pariſh
of <hi>Smalholm,</hi> in the Shire of <hi>Teviotdate,</hi> was look'd upon
as a very great Saint among them; and yet out of Zeal
againſt the Government, he kept a Dog whom he named
<hi>Charles,</hi> after the King; and a Cat which he named <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi>
after the Queen; and another Dog whom he
named <hi>Gideon,</hi> after the Miniſter of the Pariſh. They
are a People that will not Swear in common Diſcourſe
for a World, yet they never ſcruple before a Judge, any
Perjury that may ſeem to advance the Cauſe, nor ſtand in
their ordinary dealings to cheat for a penny; nay, Murther
it ſelf becomes a Virtue when the work of the Covenant
ſeems to require it; and the new Goſpel which they Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
is ſo far from condemning Lying, Cheating, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Rebellion, when committed to fulfil the Ends
of the Solemn League, that many of theſe whom they
reckon Martyrs, have at their Execution gloried in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62829:5"/>
theſe Crimes, as the ſure Evidences of their Salvation.</p>
            <p>Morality being thus diſcountenanced by the generality
of that Party, the poor People are thereby lock'd up in a
Cell of Ignorance. This did clearly appear, when the Laws,
in the former Government, diſcharg'd Conventicles,
the people being brought thereby home to the Churches:
When the Miniſters began to Catechiſe them in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Chriſtian Religion, they found them groſly
Ignorant; for when they were deſired to repeat the Creed,
Lord's-Prayer, and Ten Commandments; they told they
were above theſe childiſh Ordinances; for if they believed
in Chriſt, they were certainly well: And yet theſe Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norants
would Adventure to pray <hi>Ex tempore,</hi> and in
their Families to Lecture on the moſt myſterious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters
of <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> or the <hi>Revelation.</hi> A grave and
good Miniſter told me, that upon a certain occaſion he
deſired a very zealous She-Saint to repeat the Creed:
And that ſhe return'd this Anſwer, <hi>I know not what ye
mean by the Creed. Did not your Father,</hi> ſays the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<hi>promiſe to bring you up in that Faith? Indeed did he
not</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>for I thank my Saviour, that Superſtition
was not in my Father's time. What then was in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
time?</hi> (ſaid the Miniſter.) <hi>It was</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>the
holy Covenant, which you have put away. Whether was it
the Covenant of Works or Grace?</hi> ſaid the Miniſter. <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that is handy Labour. It was the
Covenent of Grace which was made with</hi> Adam, <hi>and which
all of you have put away.</hi> At Night ſhe went home, and
a number of the ſighing Fraternity flock'd after, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to hear her pray: Their Family Exerciſe being
ended, ſhe told them the Conference that paſs'd betwixt
the Curate and her, and they all concluded ſhe had the
better, and that ſhe was certainly more than match for
the ableſt Curate in that Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62829:5"/>
Generally their Conventicles produced very many Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards,
and the Excuſes they made for that, was, Where
<hi>Sin abounds, the Grace of God ſuperabounds. There is
no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt.</hi> Sometimes
this, The Lambs of Chriſt may ſport together: <hi>To the
pure all things are pure.</hi> Nay, generally they are of
Opinion, That a Man is never a true Saint, till he have
a ſound fall, ſuch as that of <hi>David</hi>'s with <hi>Bathſheba.</hi> The
following Narration of a well known Truth ſhall ſerve
for Inſtance.</p>
            <p>A party of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. his Guards being ſent to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Mr. <hi>Dav. Williamſon</hi> (one of the moſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
of their Miniſters now in <hi>Edenburgh</hi>) for the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Rebellion and Treaſon he preached then at Field
Meetings; and the party having ſurrounded the Houſe
where he was, a Zealous Lady, Miſtreſs of the Houſe,
being very Solicitous to conceal him, roſe in all haſte
from her Bed, where ſhe left her Daughter of about Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years of Age, and having dreſs'd up the Holy
Man's Head with ſome of her own Night Cloaths, ſhe
wittily advis'd him to take her place in the warm Bed
with her Girl; to which he modeſtly and readly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented:
And knowing well how to employ his time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
upon ſuch and extraordinary Call, to propagate
the Image of the Party; while the Mother, to divert the
Troopers enquiry, was treating them with ſtrong drink
in the Parlour; he to expreſs his gratitude, applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with extraordinary Kindneſs to the Daughter, who
finding him like to prove a very uſeful Man in his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
told her Mother ſhe would have him for her
Husband; to which the Mother, though otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
yet for concealing the Scandal, out of Love to
the Cauſe conſented, when the myſtery of the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
was wholly diſcloſed to her. This whole Story
is as well known in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as that the Covenant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62829:6"/>
was begun and carried on by Rebellion and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Nor was the Actor, who is at this day one of the chief
Props of the cauſe,<note place="margin">Me was but laſt Year ſent to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent their Affairs at Court.</note> more admired for his extraordinary
diligence and courage in this Matter, than for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Invention in finding a paſſage of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, to
prove that the Scandal of this was very conſiſtent with
the ſtate of a perſon truly Regenerate; <hi>Verily, I do not,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>deny, but that, with St.</hi> Paul, <hi>I have a Law in my
Members, warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me into Captivity into the Law of Sin, which is in my
Members.</hi> Now according to the Gloſs which that whole
Party puts upon this Scripture, ſaying, That St. <hi>Paul</hi>
here ſpeaks of himſelf, and does not perſonate an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
Man, this Defence of <hi>Williamſon</hi>'s muſt be
allowed to be good; as alſo that the height of Carnality
is conſiſtent with the greateſt Grace. Even ſo the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Days, wreſted ſome things hard to
be underſtood in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, to their own Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>There was among them a married Woman near <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
who had paid ſeveral Fines for not going to Church,
yet ſcrupled not to commit Adultery with one of the Earl
of <hi>Marr</hi>'s Regiment, and the Fellow himſelf: that was
Guilty, told, out of deteſtation to their damnable Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
that the vile Woman had the confidence, in time of
her Abomination, to ſay to him; <hi>O you that are in</hi> Marr<hi>'s
Regiment, but you be pretty able Men, but yet ye art great
Covenant Breakers; alas, few or none of you are Godly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are very many Inſtances of this Nature, but I
ſhall only add one more which was old me by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of good Reputation and Credit, who himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
to me, with regret, that in the heat of his Youth,
he had been guilty of the Sin of Fornication with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
of that Holy Sect; he ſays, that being with her
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62829:6"/>
in a Garret, and ſhe hearing ſome body coming up Stairs,
ſhe ſaid to him, <hi>Ah, here's my Aunt, I muſt deviſe a Trick
to divert her;</hi> upon which ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell a whining and howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aloud, as theſe People uſe to do at their moſt private
Devotions, <hi>O to believe, to believe; O to have Experience,</hi>
ſaid ſhe. And by that means ſhe diverted her Aunts fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Approaching, who inſtantly retired, commending
her Niece's Zeal and Devotion. The Gentleman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals
the Woman's Name, out of regard to her Honour
and his own; begs Pardon for the Sin, and tells it only
to diſcover the abominable Nature of their Hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>They are generally deluded by Perſons that have but
ſpecious pretences to Godlineſs. And ſuch is the force,
that a loud Voice and a whining Tone, in broken and
ſmother'd words, have upon the Animal Spirits of the
Presbyterian Rabble; that they look not upon a Man
as endued with the Spirit of God, without ſuch canting
and deformity of Holineſs. A perſon that hath the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
of whining, may make a great Congreation of
them weep with an Ode of <hi>Horace,</hi> or Eclogue of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
eſpecially if he can but drivel a little either at Mouth,
or Eyes, when he repeats them. And ſuch a perſon may
paſs for a Soul-raviſhing ſpiritualiſt, if he can but ſet off
his Nonſence with a wry mouth, which with them is
called, <hi>A Grace pouring down Countenance.</hi> The ſnuffling
and twang of the Noſe, paſſes for the Goſpel ſound; and
the throwings of the Face, for the motions of the Spirit.
They are more concerned at the reading the Speeches of
their Covenant Martyrs, yea ſuch Martyrs as died for
Rebellion and Murder, than in reading the Martyrdom
of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> or any of his Followers. A Sermon of
mere Railing and Nonſence will af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect them more than
Chriſt's Sermon on the Mount; and no wonder, for all
they do is to affect the Paſſions, and not the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62829:7"/>
One Mr. <hi>Daniel Douglaſs,</hi> an old <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preacher
in the <hi>Mers,</hi> ſimple man as to the World, yet of more
Learning, Ingenuity and good Nature than moſt of
them; he was not long agoe preaching before the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Brethren, and agoe annalyſing a Text Logical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and very remote from vulgar Capacities, yet ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
and melting was his Tone and Actions, that in the
Congregation he ſpies a Woman weeping, and pointing
towards her, he crys out, <hi>Wife, what makes you weep?
I am ſure thou underſtandeſt not what I am ſaying; my
Diſourſe is directed to the Brethren, and not to the like of
you; nay, I queſtion whether the Brethren themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
this that I am ſpeaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several Inſtances can be given of their ſtrong deluſions;
this is none of the leaſt, that they take it for a ſure Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon their Death-beds, that it's well with them,
becauſe they never heard a Curate in their lifetime. For
an indulged <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> who is the Author of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of the Hiſtory of the Indulgence,</hi> tells us thus much,
<hi>Page</hi> 527, and <hi>Page 528, That ſome of the leading people
among the</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>were of Opinion, that Baptiſm
by Epiſcopal Miniſters is the mark of the Beaſt; and the
hearing of them as unlawful as Fornication, Adultery, or
the worſhipping the Calves of</hi> Dan <hi>and</hi> Bethel: And I think
that a Curate can tell no worſe tale of them, than this,
which a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> himſelf owns and declares to the
World in Print.</p>
            <p>I cannot here paſs by what happen'd a few Years ago,
in the Pariſh of <hi>Tindrum</hi> in the <hi>South-weſt;</hi> a perſon that
was Executed for Beſtiality there, in his Prayers bleſs'd
God, that for a long time he had heard no Curate preach;
at which the Hearts of ſome <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Saints began to
warm with Affection to him, and expreſt ſo much Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that upon that account they doubted not but that
he might be ſaved; and were ſorry that he was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62829:7"/>
to live, becauſe of the good that ſuch a Zealous
man might have done.</p>
            <p>It is a well known truth in the Pariſh of <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> that
two or three ſighing Siſters, coming to a Man in Priſon,
the Night before he was burnt for Beſtiality; the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt
Advice they gave him was this, <hi>O</hi> Andrew, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,
Andrew, <hi>all the Sins that ever you committed are
nothing to your hearing the curſed Curates; if you get Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for that Sin,</hi> Andrew, <hi>all is right with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A young Woman in <hi>Fife,</hi> Daughter to a <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
Preacher there, reading that of St. <hi>Peter, Chriſt the Biſhop
of our Souls,</hi> blotted out the word (<hi>Biſhop</hi>) and in the
place thereof incerted <hi>Presbyterian of our Souls.</hi> And by
the ſame Spirit of Biggotry, one of her Zealous Siſters
in the ſame Family, tore every where out of her Bible
the word <hi>Lord; Becauſe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>it is polluted by being
applied to the Profane Prelates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtances of their Madneſs and Deluſions might ſwell
into an huge Volume, but I ſhall only mention two or
three which are commonly known. What greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Deluſion, than that Seven or Eight thouſand peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould be raiſed to Rebellion at <hi>Bothwel-bridge,</hi> from
laboring their ground, and keeping their Sheep; and
that by Sermons aſſuring them, that the very Windle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraws,
the Graſs in the Field, and Stars in Heaven would
fight for them: And that after the Victory they ſhould
poſſeſs the Kingdom themſelves. <hi>O it's the promis'd Land,
and you</hi> Iſraelites <hi>ſhall inherit it:</hi> but in this they found
their Preachers to prove ſalve Prophets. After their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
a Gentleman told me; that going to view the Field,
where the Battle was fought, he ſaw one in the Agony
of death, crying out, <hi>Ah, cheated out of Life and Soul:</hi>
The Gentleman inquired what he meant by that expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Ah</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>our Preachers, our Preachers, they made
us believe, that as ſure as the Bible was the word of God,

            </p>
            <p>About the ſame time a perſon of Quality returning
from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> with ſome of the King's Forces, being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate
to lodge in a Country Houſe, where there was
but one Woman, and ſhe with child; for the Men and all
that were able to run, had fled out of the way. The
Nobleman encouraged the poor Woman, deſiring her not
to be afraid; ſent one upon his own Horſe for Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
and other Women to attend her. The poor Woman
ſurpriſed and encouraged with this unexpected kindneſs,
began to talk more freely, and ſaid, Sir, I ſee you that
are Kings-men are not ſo ill as we heard ye were; for we
heard that it was ordinary for you to rip up Women with Child;
but pray will you tell me, Sir, what ſort of Men are your
<hi>Biſhops? They are,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>very good Men, and they are
choſen out from among the Clergy to overſee the reſt of the
Miniſters. But are they,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>ſhapen like other Men?
Why ask you that,</hi> ſaid he? <hi>Becauſe our Preachers made us
believe, the Biſhops were all cloven-footed.</hi> There is ſcarce
one of an hundred among the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Vulgar, that
will be either reaſon'd or laugh'd out of the ſtrange Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they have of Biſhops; as particularly, that they will
not ſuffer Witches to be burnt, becauſe (<hi>as they alledge</hi>)
every Biſhop loſes five hundred Marks <hi>Scots,</hi> for every
Witch that's burnt in his Dioceſs. Nay, the generality of
The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Rabble in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> will not believe that
Biſhops have any Shadows, being perſwaded by ſome of
their Teachers, that the Devil hath taken away their
Shadow as an earneſt of the Subſtance, for their oppoſing
of Covenant Work in the Land.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add but one Inſtance more of the ſillineſs of the
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> People, and that is of a certain perſon well
known both in the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not a degree and an half from an Idiot, and to be a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62829:8"/>
Man that can ſcarcely read an Engliſh Book. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
takes on him to be a Preacher, and among <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
People has procured a great eſteem to himſelf for a
wonderful and rare Goſpeller, for having not the leaſt
degree either of natural or acquir'd Parts, they therefore
conclude him to have a large ſtock of Grace, and to be
a moſt heavenly Man. He came lately to the <hi>Mers,</hi>
where he was never known before, and lodging on a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi>'s
Night in a Country-town, he cauſed call in the
good people in the Town to Prayers. Immediately
the Houſe was fill'd with a Crow'd, then he lectures to
them on the firſt of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and he told them, that the
Wheel ſpoken of in the Sixteenth Verſe, was <hi>the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi>
and the Wheel in the middle was the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and
the <hi>Curates; For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>here's a Wheel within a Wheel,
juſt ſo the Curates are within the Biſhops, and both of them
within</hi> Antichriſt. <hi>Then the Wheels are</hi> (ſays my Text)
<hi>lifted up; even ſo, Beloved the Biſhops and Curates are
lifted up; lifted up upon Coaches with four Wheels, juſt as
Sathan lifted up Chriſt to the Pinacle of the Temple, but
God will take the Hammer of the Covenant in his own Hand,
and knock down theſe proud Prelates, and break all their
Coaches and their Wheels to pieces, Beloved, and lay the
Curates on their Backs, ſo that they ſhall never riſe again;
for the Prophet ſays here, that when they went they went up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their four ſides, and they returned not when they went, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved:
That you may ſee it very plain and clear, for tho' they
may go out and Perſecute God's own Covenanted People, yet
they ſhall return falling upon their Broad-ſides, and get
ſuch a fall that they ſhall never be able to ſtand or return to
perſecute the Godly, ſo long as they go upon their four ſides,
and are lifted up upon four Wheels.</hi> The people ſaid, they
never heard ſuch a ſweet Tongue in a Gracious Man's
Head. He ſpoke much againſt thoſe that took an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
from K. <hi>James.</hi> The next day he told them, that

the Epiſcopal Miniſter in the Pariſh was his Couſin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he would go to Church, and hear how he could
Preach. <hi>Truly, Sir</hi> (ſays the people) <hi>we ſhall go along
with you wherever you go, albeit it be our ordinary to go to
the Meeting houſe in the Pariſh.</hi> And that ſame very day
he brought all the Diſſenters in the Pariſh to the Church.
The people intreated him to deal with the Miniſter to
turn <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and promis'd to deſert the Meeting-houſe
Preacher, whom they ordinarily heard, and to hear
the Epiſcopal Miniſter upon his Converſion. He promiſed
to deal very ſeriouſly with him: For that purpoſe, the
next day he came to the Miniſters Houſe, and after a
few ſighs and affected groans, he expoſtulates thus, <hi>Dear
Couſin, what makes you own perjur'd Epiſcopacy? What have
you to ſay againſt that Office?</hi> replies the Miniſter.
<hi>I have many Arguments,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and one I am ſure you
can never anſwer; and you will find it in</hi> Pſal. 45. 1. My
Heart enditeth a good thing: <hi>Now is not this,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a
plain Argument agaiſt Biſhops; for when will they endite
good things?</hi> The people wondered that the Miniſter
could not be perſwaded by ſo clear an Argument, and
ſaid, <hi>Poor Soul, his Heart is heardened, he has not Grace
enough to believe and be Converted.</hi> This Account is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before very many famous witneſſes in the City of
<hi>Edinburgh.</hi> All I have told of them is truth, but the
hundred part is not told. You may judge of the Tree
by theſe Fruits; and of what a delicate Set of Reformers
we have at his time in the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come in the next place, to give you a true Character
of their Preachers. And truly, to be plain, they are a
<hi>Proud, Sour, Inconverſable Tribe, looking perfectly like the
Phariſees, having Faces like their horrid Decree of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</hi>
They are without Humanity, void of common
Civility, as well as Catholick Charity, ſo wholly enſlaved
to the Humours of their people, that they give no other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62829:10"/>
Reaſon why they converſe not with Men of a different
Opinon, but only that their People would take it very
ill if they ſhould. However, I fear there is ſomething
in it more, and that is, leſt their Ignorance ſhould be
diſcover'd; for it's certain, they have as little Learning
as good Nature: And we have both felt and ſeen, that
that is next Neighbour to none at all.</p>
            <p>They have their Souls caſt into a different mould from
all Chriſtians in the World. There is no Church but they
differ from, both in Worſhip and Practice: They have
quite baniſh'd the uſe of the Lord's Prayer, and what ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
ſtuff they have foiſted in for it, ſhall be told in its
proper Place, The ſmootheſt reaſon that they alledge for
their forbearing it, is, That the uſe thereof is inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.
This is Dr. <hi>Rule</hi>'s own Reaſon in that pretended
Anſwer he has publiſhed to the Ten Queſtions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Epiſcopal and Presbyterian Government in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
Their famous Preacher <hi>James Kirktown,</hi> when one of the
Magiſtrates of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> enquired why they did forbear
the publick uſe of the Lord's Prayer? told down-right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was the badge of the Epiſcopal Worſhip. I doubt
not but many have heard long ere now of a Conference
that paſt betwixt my Lord <hi>B</hi> . . . and a ruling Elder in
the North. In ſhort it is this, Five Presbyterian Preachers,
laſt Year, appointed themſelves Judges, to purge Two
or Three Dioceſſes in the North. They took to aſſiſt, or
to accompany them, ſome whom they call Ruling-Elders,
one of whom entreated my Lord <hi>B</hi> . . . to further with
his help the happy and bleſſed Reformation, particularly
by giving in Complaints againſt Ignorant, Scandalous,
and Erroneous Miniſters, that the Church of God might
be repleniſhed with the Faithful: <hi>Truly then</hi> (ſaith my
Lord) <hi>there is one whom I can prove to be very Atheiſtical,
Ignorant and Scandalous.</hi> At which the Ruling-Elder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to prick up is Ears; <hi>And pray you, Sir,</hi> (ſays he)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62829:11"/>
               <hi>who is the Man? Indeed</hi> (ſays my Lord) <hi>I will be free
with you, it is Mr.</hi> James Urquhart, <hi>one of your own
Preachers, who is come with you now to ſit as a Judge upon
others; and by Witneſſes of unqueſtionable Honeſty I can
make it appear that he ſaid, If ever Chriſt was drunk upon
Earth, it was when he made the Lords Prayer. And I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to your ſelf, who are a Ruling-Elder, whether or not this
be Blaſphemy? Some other things of Scandalous Nature I
can prove againſt him. O but</hi> (ſays he) <hi>we are not come
here to Judge our Brethren, our Buſineſs is with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ordinary to hear their People ſay, That if Chriſt
were on Earth again, he would think ſhame of that Form,
that they could make better themſelves, and that he was
but young when he compos'd it. All which Blaſphemies
muſt needs be the Effects or Conſequent of what they hear
from their Preachers. And as for the Apoſtles Creed, it is
not ſo much as once mentioned at the Baptiſing of Infants;
for all that they require at Baptiſm, is, That the Father
promiſe to breed up the Child in the Belief of the <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
Confeſſion of Faith, and that he ſhall adhere to all
the National Engagements laying on them to be <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Though Mr. <hi>Rule.</hi> who defends the New Goſpellers by denying their Prints, and by palpable vntruths, ſeems to diſown this in his Second Vindication of his Kirk. Yet much honeſter Presbyterians affirm it, and glory in it. <hi>Vid.</hi> Covenants with acknowledgment of Sins and Engagement to Duties, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Leſmahago. 1688. Et</hi> Hind let looſe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here I cannot forget what Mr.</hi> John Dickſon, <hi>Preacher
in the Meeting-Houſe at</hi> Kelſo, <hi>ſaid once in a Sermon;</hi>
Ask (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) an old dying Wife, if ſhe hath any Evidence
of Salvation, ſhe will tell you, I hope ſo; for I believe the
Apoſtles Creed, I am taken with the Lord's Prayer, and I
know my Duty to the be Ten Commands. But I tell you, Sirs,
there are but old rotten Wheel-barrows, to carry Souls to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62829:11"/>
Hell. Theſe are Idols that the falſe Prelates and Curates
have ſet up, to obſtruct the Covenant and the Work of God in
the Land.</p>
            <p>For reading the Scriptures in Churches, they have abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
that with the reſt, and in place thereof, he that
raiſes the Pſalm reads the Sermon that was preach'd the
Sabbath before; And for the Goſpel Hymn, called the
<hi>Doxology,</hi> or <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> they reject that as a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
prelatical Addition to the Word of God. A certain
Maid being lately Catechiſed by one of theſe Preachers,
the firſt queſtion he propos'd to her was, <hi>Maggi, Now
what think you are the Saints doing in Heaven? I know not,
Sir: O</hi> Maggy, <hi>that is a very eaſie queſtion, anſwer it,</hi>
Maggy. <hi>I think then</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>they are doing that in Heaven
which ye will not let us do on Earth; What is that,</hi> Maggy?
ſays he. <hi>They are ſinging Glory to the Father, Son and Holy
Ghoſt, Sir. Now that is your Miſtake,</hi> Maggy (ſaid he)
<hi>for there's no ſuch malignant Songs ſung there; you have been
quite wrong taught,</hi> Maggy, <hi>the Curates have deceived
you,</hi> Maggy.</p>
            <p>They have no diſtinguiſhing Garb from Lay-men, and
yet they took upon them to admoniſh the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner
to their laſt Aſſembly, for wearing a Scarlet
Cloak, and told him plainly, That <hi>it was not decent for
his Grace to appear before them in ſuch a Garb;</hi> upon which
my Lord told them, That <hi>he thought it as undecent for
them to appear before him in gray Cloaks and Cravats.</hi>
When the Church of <hi>Arrol</hi> was laſt Year made Vacant by
the Expulſion of the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Niclſon,</hi>
the Elders and Heritors there, whereof many were Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the beſt quality met together, that according
to the preſent Law and conſtant Practice of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
they might chuſe and call another Miniſter to be
their Parſon; after they had unanimouſly agreed, and
ſign'd, and ſent a formal Legal Call to Mr. <hi>Lisk,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62829:12"/>
of indiſputable Qualifications for the Miniſtry, in
which he has been imploy'd with great Reputation for
ſeveral Years in the <hi>North,</hi> and one who has given ſignal
Evidence of his good Affections to heir preſent Majeſties;
my Lord <hi>Kinnard,</hi> Chief Heritor, went with the reſt to
ſignifie their Calling of Mr. <hi>Lisk</hi> to the Presbytery; at
my Lords entering into the place where the Presbytery
was ſitting, he ask'd if they were the Miniſters of the
Presbytery; <hi>Do not you ſee that we are?</hi> ſaid the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator.
My Lord replied, <hi>That by their Garb no Body could
know them, and that their Spirit was inviſible;</hi> now whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
it was for this Jeſt, or becauſe they knew Mr. <hi>Lisk</hi>
to be Epiſcopal in his Judgment I know not; but this I
know, that theſe grave New Goſpellers, rejected the Call,
in deſpite both of the Heritors and of their own Law,
brought in a Hot-headed Young Man of their own Stamp
and Election. However, that they uſe no diſtinguiſhing
Garb, muſt be acknowledged to be very Congruous; for
truly they are but Laicks, and it will ſurpaſs all their
Learning, to prove that they are Miniſters of Jeſus
Chriſt, but meerly Preachers ſent and call'd by the People,
who are generally but very ill Judges of Mens Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the Miniſtry; hence their conſtant and vaſt
Heats and Diviſions about their calling of able Men.
The Mobile ordinarily take their Meaſures only from the
appearances of things, and indeed a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preachers
Out-ſide is not his worſt, for they appear commonly,
though in Lay-garb, yet in Sheeps-clothing; but as we
have often formerly, ſo do we now, feel that they are
inwardly nothing but ravenous Wolves.</p>
            <p>Now as to their Sermons (which is the main deſign
of this Paper) they are ſtill upon the Government and
the Times, preaching up the Excellency of their Kirk-Government,
which they call Chriſt, the Crown, Scepter,
and Government of Chriſt. This was an old Cuſtom
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62829:12"/>
among them to preach up the Times, and the neglect
thereof they call'd ſinful Silence. When in the former
Confuſions of the State they violently intruded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and Uſurped the Government of the Church, which
they never had in ſettled Times. In thoſe Days at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Synod they openly reproved one Mr. <hi>Lighton</hi> for
not preaching up the Times. <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth preach
up the Times?</hi> It was anſwer'd, <hi>That all the Brethren did
it. The</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Lighton) if all you preach up the Times,
you may allow one poor Brother to preach up Chriſt Jeſus and
Eternity.</hi> But this was never, not is like to be the Deſign of
their Sermons; for, trace them in their Politicks, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
Myſticks, and Metaphyſicks, you ſhall find them
Selfiſh, Singular, and full of Nonſenſick Rhapſodies, Theſe
perhaps may ſeem hard Words, but an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> muſt be
painted black, and that's no ſault in the Painter.</p>
            <p>For their Politicks, there is no Government under the
Sun could tolerate them, if they but act in other Nations
as they have done in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſince their Intruſion there;
to inſtance but in our Times, Did nor Mr. <hi>Cargill,</hi> one of
their Celebrated Preachers, Excommunicate all the Royal
Family, the Biſhops and Curates, and all that ſhould hear
them and adhere to them? They, indeed, that affect the
Name of Sober <hi>Presbyterians</hi> diſown'd theſe Hill-men,
particularly becauſe they refuſed to join with them in
thanking King <hi>James</hi> for the Toleration, which he
granted to them. And yet ſuch is the Diſingenuity of
theſe who would be called Sober <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that
they cry out that they ſuffered Perſecution; whereas
it was the <hi>Cameronians</hi> only, whom they diſown,
that did ſuffer any thing: For theſe others were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
in Churches by an Indulgence granted by the
King. Againſt which Indulgence all the Sufferers,
like true <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> gave their Teſtimony, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it a meer brat of <hi>Eraſtianiſm.</hi> What Government
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62829:13"/>
could tolerate ſuch Miniſters, as <hi>John Deckſon,</hi> whom I
named before, who in a Sermon Preached by him in the
Pariſh of <hi>Gallaſhiels,</hi> declar'd, <hi>That it was all one to Sacrifice
to Devils, as to pay Ceſs to King</hi> Charles. The Author
of the Review of the Hiſtory of Indulgence, one of the
Sober ſort of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> tells, <hi>Page</hi> 610. the ſame of
a Preacher of his Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more of their Sentiments concerning Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but only referr the Readers to their Printed
Acts of General Aſſemblies, and to thoſe Covenants which
themſelves have Printed, often Subſcribed and Sworn,
and which are now again, for the benefit of Strangers,
publiſhed in that Excellent Vindication of King <hi>Charles</hi> II.
his Happy Government in <hi>Scotland</hi> by Sir <hi>George Mac
Kenze,</hi> in which it's Evident, that they plainly renounce
Monarchy and all Power, but that of the Covenanted
Kirk.</p>
            <p>As to their Diſpoſition to live peaceably, I appeal not
only to their Principles vented in theſe Covenants and
Acts of their general Aſſemblies, but alſo to the many
private Murthers, and open Rebellions which they have
been guilty of under every Reign, ſince their firſt entry
into <hi>Britain.</hi> Even in our own Days, ſince 1666, they
have raiſed no leſs than Three formidable Rebellions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
many leſſer Inſurrections and Tumults, wherein
many Chriſtians have ſuffered. With what Violence did
they flee to Arms, and perſecute all who were not of
their Party, upon the occaſion of the late Revolution;
when, if it had not been for their indiſcreet and fiery
Zeal, this Kingdom might have been happily united
to <hi>England:</hi> But what ever Advantage ſuch an Union
might have brought to the Church and State; yet,
becauſe it ſeemed to have no good Aſpect to the
covenanted cauſe, therefore the motion of it, though
offered, was induſtriouſly ſtifled, and that Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62829:13"/>
which we can hardly hope to recover, quite
loſt. Nay, under the preſent Government, for which
they in the beginning pretended to be ſo zealous, 'tis
well known over all the Kingdom, that they were laſt
Year contriving by force, without any regard to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to have the Solemn League renewed, and impoſed
after the old manner, upon all Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
and in order to this good end, many Thouſands of
them, at Field meetings in the Weſt, conveened after
their ordinary way, with Bibles and Muſquets, Pſalm-Books
and ruſty Swords, and ſubſcrbed a new Aſſociation
for raiſing of Men, Horſe and Arms, to advance the Old
Cauſe, repurge the holy Kirk, and make a thorow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
in the Land. But I ſhall take occaſion by and
by to give you ſome later and more evident Inſtances of
their Neglect and Contempt of their preſent Governors.</p>
            <p>In the next place ſurvey them in their Learning, and
you ſhall find that it lies only in the ſtudy of ſome <hi>Anti-Arminian</hi>
Metaphyſicks, and in the practical Divinity
they pretend to draw from the Heads of Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
whereby they preach Men out of their Wits,
and very often into Deſpair and Self-murder. It's gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
known, that <hi>Joſeph Brodie,</hi> Preacher in <hi>Forreſs</hi> in the
time of the late Presbytery, did in the preſence of a very
Learned and Eminent Perſon, take occaſion in the Pulpit
to ſpeak of a poor Man, who was then in ſuch a deſperate
Condition, that it was judg'd neceſſary to bind up his
Hands, leſt otherwiſe he ſhould cut his own Throat, as
he continually threatned; of this deſperate Wretch the
pious Preacher above-named pronounced thus; <hi>Sirs, this
is the beſt Man in my Pariſh, would to God ye were all like
him; he does truely fear Reprobation, which moſt of you are
not aware of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a common printed Pamphlet compos'd and
publiſh'd by a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preacher, concerning one <hi>Beſſie
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62829:14"/>
Clarkſon,</hi> a Woman that lived at <hi>Lanark,</hi> who was three
Years in deſpair, or to ſpeak in their Cant, <hi>under Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</hi>
Whoſoever reads that Pamphlet will find, that the
poor Woman's Diſtemper proceeded only form their indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Preaching, repreſenting God as a ſower, ſevere and
unmerciful Being. It is known in the Shire of <hi>Teviotdale</hi>
that Mr. <hi>William Veach</hi> murder'd the Bodies, as well as
Souls, of two or three Perſons with one Sermon; For,
preaching in the Town of <hi>Jedburgh</hi> to a great Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he ſaid, <hi>There are Tow thouſand of you here to day,
but I am ſure Fourſcore of you will not he ſaved;</hi> upon
which Three of his ignorant Hearers, being in Deſpair,
diſpatched themſelves ſoon after. And lately in <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
Mr. <hi>James Kirkton,</hi> (the Everlaſting Comedian of
their Party) one of their famous Preachers in that City,
praying publickly for a poor Woman much troubled in
Spirit, ſaid, <hi>A wholeſome Diſeaſe, good Lord, a wholeſome
Diſeaſe, Lord, for the Soul. Alas,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>few in the Land
are troubled with this Diſeaſe. Lord, grant that ſhe may
have many fellows in this Diſeaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not only do they make their People diſtracted with
ſuch deſperate Doctrine as this, but moreover they
incourage them in direct Impieties. Mr. <hi>Selkirk</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Muſſelburgh</hi> expreſſed himſelf thus, <hi>God ſeed no Sin
in his Choſen; Now, Sirs, be you guilty of Murder, Adultery,
Beſtiality, or any other groſs Sin, if you be of the Election
of Grace there is no fear of you, for God ſees no Sin in his
Choſen covenanted People.</hi> And this is conſonant to an
expreſſion of Mr. <hi>Samuel Rutherford</hi>'s printed Letters,
<hi>Hellfulls of Sins cannot ſeparate is from Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Pariſh of Mr. <hi>Macmath,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Leſwade,</hi>
ſome of thoſe who were lately the moſt active in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
and driving him form his Reſidence (even after he
had the Privy Councils Protection, and a Guard aſſign'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62829:14"/>
him for his Defence) have ſince ſuffer'd violent deaths;
two of them prevented the Hangman's pains by becoming
their own Murtherers. When the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and
Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> dyed laſt year much about one time,
the party who pretend to unriddle all the moſt ſecret Cauſes
of God's Providence, called their Deaths a viſible Judgment,
for their being Enemies to the good Cauſe, altho' it be well
known that both theſe honourable Perſons dyed of a natural
Death, in a good age, being both of them worn out with
their great diligence in their King and Country's Service
(perhaps, indeed, their days were ſhortened, by ſeeing ſuch
Firebrands able again to force themſelves into the Church, as
had before ruin'd both it and the State, and were the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of Chriſtianity as well as Diſgrace of their Nation.) But
when theſe abovenamed Self-Murtherers of the Pariſh of
<hi>Leſwade</hi> had divided <hi>Judas</hi>'s death betwixt them, the one
hanging himſelf, the other ripping up his own Belly, till
all his Bowels guſhed out: The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preacher in
that Pariſh, holding forth next <hi>Sunday,</hi> was ſo ready of
Invention as to find Arguments from thence for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the good Cauſe: <hi>Ab Sirs</hi> (ſays he) <hi>nothing
has befallen theſe Men but what God had from Eternity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed;
and I can tell you, Sirs, why he decreed it, indeed
it was even becauſe they had gone ſometimes to hear the
Graceleſs Curates. Ah, Sirs, ye may ſee in this Judgment
the danger of that Sin, beware of hearing Curates, Sirs, you
ſee it's a dangerous thing, Sirs, but I'll tell you more yet
anent this, Sirs, this is a plain proof that the Goſpel has
non been preached in this Pariſh theſe twenty eight Years,
for in all that time you have no: heard ſo much as of one
that had a tender Conſcience like theſe men; but now when
we begin again to preach the Goſpel, it's ſo powerful, that
it awakes mens Conſciences, and pricks them ſo at the Heart,
that they cannot bear it, nor live under it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I leave the World to Judge, whether this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62829:15"/>
ſort of Learning and manner of Preaching, doth not ſtand
in diametrical oppoſition to all Religion and Reaſon, and
does not in its Tenure and Effects, appear to be indeed
the Doctrine of Devils, and another Goſpel; and yet by
it our Rabble Reformation has been wrought. All true
and ſolid Learning, particularly Antiquity is decryed by
them, becauſe in it there is no veſtige, no not ſo much
as any ſhadow of <hi>Presbytery</hi> to be found; to preach Peace
and Righteouſneſs (tho' that be the deſign of the Goſpel)
yet ſince it does not anſwer the Ends of the Covenant,
it muſt be condemn'd as temporizing, time-ſerving, and
the pleaſing of men more than God, who, they are ſure,
can never be pleas'd but in their Covenanted way.</p>
            <p>Morality with them is but old, out-dated, heatheniſh
Virtue, and therefore ſuch a Book as <hi>The whole Duty of
Man,</hi> is look'd upon with wonderful contempt by them:
<hi>Frazer</hi> of <hi>Bray,</hi> one of the greateſt among them, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
downright, that there is no Goſpel, nor any reliſh of
it in that Book, and that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Ethicks</hi> have as much
true Divinity as that Book hath. And <hi>John Vetch</hi> of
<hi>Woolſtruthers</hi> ſays, That that Book is too much upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Duty. A certain Lady of their Stamp, getting it once
into her hands, and hearing that it was a Moral Book,
done by an Epiſcopal Divine, ſhe made a Burnt Offering
of it, out of her great Zeal againſt Epiſcopacy and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Mr. <hi>Macquire,</hi> one of their celebrated Profeſſors and
Preachers, in his Preface to <hi>Brown</hi>'s Book, entituled, <hi>Chriſt
the Truth, Way, and Life,</hi> calls the people that are taken
up with <hi>the whole Duty of Man,</hi> or any ſuch Books, <hi>a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralizing,
or rather,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a Muddizing Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt of their Sermons are Nonſenſick Raptures,
the abuſe of Myſtick Divinity, in canting and compounded
Vocables, oft-times ſtuffed with impertinent and baſe <hi>Similes</hi>
and always with homely, courſe, and ridiculous Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
very unſuitable to the Gravity and Solemnity that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62829:15"/>
becomes Divinity. They are for the moſt part upon <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
Believe;</hi>
and miſtaking Faith for a meer Recumben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
they value no Works but ſuch as tend to propagate
<hi>Presbytery.</hi> When they ſpeak of Chriſt, they repreſent
him as a Gallant, Courting and Kiſſing, by their Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
Amorous Diſcourſes on the myſterious Parables of
the <hi>Canticles;</hi> and making Chriſt and his Goſpel to be
their own Kirk Government; they have quite debaſed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
and debauched the Morals of the People: This
is evident, not only from their manner of Preaching,
but alſo from their way of Writing moſt of their Books,
whereof ſome Inſtances ſhall be given in the next Section.</p>
            <p>Some of them have an odd way of acting in the Pulpit,
perſonating Diſcourſes often by way of Dialogue betwixt
them and the Devil. Such ways were of old familiar to
the Monks, as appears from Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of the <hi>Defence of the Reformation, Chap.</hi> 10.
where he vindicates <hi>Luther</hi> from an aſperſion caſt upon
him by the Church of <hi>Rome. For,</hi> ſay the Papiſts, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>profeſſeth in his Writings, that he had a Conference
with the Devil concerning the Maſs, and that the Devil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
him for being an Idolater.</hi> To which <hi>Luther</hi> anſwers,
That he was then in Ignorance, and that he obey'd his
Superiours. Hence the Papiſts conclude, that <hi>Luther</hi> was
the Devil's Scholar. But Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> lets them ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that <hi>Luther</hi> ſpoke in a Monkiſh Stile, and that the Stile
of the Convent did repreſent conflicts betwixt the Fleſh
and Spirit, as perſonal exploits with the Devil: To prove
this, he inſtances St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who ſays, That he
ſaw the Devil one Night, in his Iron Hands carry a
Paper to him, which he read by the light of a Lamp,
and told it was a Catalogue of his ſins, and the ſins
of his Brethren, upon which St. <hi>Dominick</hi> commanded
him to leave the Paper with him, which was done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
and afterwards he and his Brethren found cauſe to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62829:16"/>
correct ſomething in their Lives. All that is ſaid for this,
is, that it is a Romantick Stile proper to the Monks,
and all that is meant thereby is this, that the Devil could
lay ſuch and ſins to their charge, their Conſciences did
ſmite them, therefore they corrected what they found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs.
But ſuch a Stile did create wrong Ideas in the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
Interpreters of ſuch Narrations: And it is like ſome of
our Reformers reading Books of this nature, either thought
ſuch Appariſions real, or that they affected the Stile; for it
its reported of Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> one of our <hi>Scotch</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
that having ſtudied the Civil Law, and going
one day to the Colledge of Juſtice, to paſs his Tryals in
order to commence Advocate, he ſaid, that he ſaw a great
Gulph in the Cloſe or Court of the Parliament-Houſe,
like the mouth of Hell, and this diverted his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Houſe, upon which he gave over the Study of the
Law, and applyed himſelf to Theology. Whether the
thing was litterally true, or whether the man had a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
Imagination (as good men may have) or whether
he affected the Stile of the Convent, and meant thus
much buy it, That the imployment of a Juriſt was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and apt to lead men into ſuch Temptations as he
feared might be too ſtrong for him, I know not which to
conclude; but this I am ſure of, That one Mr. <hi>Thomas
Hogg,</hi> a very popular <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preacher in the <hi>North,</hi>
asked a perſon of great Learning, in a Religious Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
whether or not he had ſeen the Devil? It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him, <hi>That he had never ſeen him in any viſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance:
Then I aſſure you</hi> (ſaith Mr. Hogg) <hi>that you
can never be happy till you ſee him in that manner; that is,
until you have both a perſonal Converſe and Combat with
him.</hi> I know nothing more apt to create a more Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Madneſs in poor well-meaning people, that this ſort
of Divinity, in which our <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have quite out-done
the ſenſeleſs old Monks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62829:16"/>
Their Principles and Doctrine being, as ye have heard,
oppoſite to Morality, it will not be thought ſtrange that
the height of Pride and Ruſticitie ſhould appear in their
Converſation: The common Civilities due to Mankind,
they allow not to Perſons of the Quality, that are
of a different Opinion from themſelves. To avoid and
flee from the Company where a Curate is, as if it were a
Peſt-houſe is a common ſign of Grace: To affront a Prelate
openly is a moſt meritorious Work, and ſuch as becomes a
true Saint: To approve and applaud the Murtherers of the
Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> is an infallible Evidence of one
thoroughly reformed. That the World may be ſatisfied
of their Behaviour towards ordinary Men, I ſhall give
you ſome late Inſtances of their Carriage towards thoſe
of the higheſt Rank and Quality; the matters of Fact are
ſuch as are known to be true by Multitudes of People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom they were acted; and themſeves have the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
ſtill to Glory in them; and yet I will not ſay,
but ſome of the Party may deny them upon occaſion at
Court, as they do other things as evident; for I know
what Metal their Foreheads are made of.</p>
            <p>1. Then when their Majeſties Privy Council, by advice
of all the Judges conform to a ſtanding Act of Parliament,
and common Practice, appointed a Sermon upon the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Day of <hi>January,</hi> 1690: The Council ſome time before
ſent a Perſon of Quality, one of their own Stamp and Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to the Commiſſioners of the General Aſſembly, to
deſire them in their Majeſties and Council's Name, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
one of their number to preach before them in St.
<hi>Giles</hi>'s Church on that Day, and to put them in mind
that it was the Anniverſary for the Martyrdom of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and that a Sermon proper for the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was expected according to the Religion, Law, and
Cuſtom of the Nation. The grave Noddies of the Aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
anſwer'd thus, <hi>Let the Council to do their own Buſineſs,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62829:17"/>
for we are to receive no Directions from the State, nor to the take
our Meaſures from the Council, eſpeciallly in preaching Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary-Sermons.</hi>
Upon which they appointed <hi>Shields,</hi> a
<hi>Cameronian,</hi> one of the moſt wild and violent of the Hill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to preach in the <hi>Tron-Church,</hi> where-in they uſed to
have Weekly Lectures, as it happened upon that Day of
the Week, but where neither the Lords of Council nor
Judges were uſed to come. All that he ſpoke concerning
the King's Murther was this, <hi>Ye Sirs, perhaps ſome of you
may fooliſhly fanoy that I came here to day to preach to you
concerning the Death of King</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt: What?
preach for a Man that died forty Years ago; if it be true what
ſome Hiſtories tells of him, he is very mach wronged; but if
it be true what we believe of him; and have ground for, he
is ſuffering the Vengeance of God in Hell this day for his own
and Fore-fathers Sing.</hi> The ſame <hi>Shields</hi> as he was hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth ſometime before at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> ſaid, That for
ought he ſaw, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> were rather
ſeeking an earthly Crown to themſelves, than ſeeking to
put the Crown on Chriſt's Head. That is, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
ſtile, to ſettle Presbyterian Government.</p>
            <p>This ſame Year again they peremptorily refuſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
the Privy Council's Order, requiring them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a ſtanding Act of Parliament, to preach upon that
day.</p>
            <p>2. Inſt. Mr. <hi>Areskme</hi> preaching in the <hi>Tron</hi> Church at
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the day after the King by open Proclamation
had adjourned the General Aſſembly, ſaid, <hi>Sirs, Ye heard
a ſtrange Proclamation the other day, which I hope the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of may Repent ſome day: It brings to my mind, Sirs,
an old ſtory of King</hi> Cyrus <hi>who once ſet his Hands fairly to
the building of God's Houſe, but his Hand was not well in
the Work, when he drew it out again: All is well that ends
well, Sirs; for what think ye become of King</hi> Cyrus, <hi>Sirs?
I'll tell you that Sirs; He e'en made an ill end, he e'en
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62829:17"/>
died a bloody death in a ſtrange Land. I wiſh the like may
not befal our King; they ſay Compariſons are odious, but I
hope ye will not think that Scripture-compariſons are ſo; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you may think, I am ſure of this, that no King but King
Jeſus, had Power to Adjourn our General Aſſembly.</hi> This
was ſpoken ſo lately, before ſo great an Auditory, that
whatever <hi>Rule</hi> may ſay in his next Book, yet I think the
Author himſelf will not have the Impudence to deny it.</p>
            <p>3. When laſt Summer their Commiſſioners returned
from King <hi>William</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and told the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
That the King had poſſitively told them, that he
would not any longer ſuffer them to oppreſs and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Epiſcopal Subjects; and deſired them in his Name
to acquaint the General Aſſembly with his Mind, that
for the time to come they ſhould proceed more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
otherwiſe he would let them know that he is their
Maſter. The Moderators ſaid openly, That if it were
not for the great Army he had with him, he durſt not
have ſaid ſo to them; and however, he had been wiſer to
have held his peace, for that they own'd no Maſter but
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When King <hi>William</hi> in <hi>January</hi> laſt deſired them, by his
Letter to the General Aſſembly, to re-admit into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of the Miniſtry, ſo many of the Epiſcopal Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as ſhould be willing to ſubmit to and comply with a
Formula which his Majeſty ſent to them, and appointed
to be the Terms of Communion betwixt the Parties:
This Propoſal of Peace and Union, which moderate Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
might have been thought to have rejoyced in,
was inſolently rejected, and exclaimed againſt by all the
Aſſembly, except one Mr. <hi>Orack</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">A Perſon who was well edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and juſtly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed at St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi>'s V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity.</note>. Then the common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
and preaching of Presbyterians was. That King
<hi>William</hi> deſign'd to Dethrone King Jeſus; that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
to them any Formula was an Incroachment upon
Chriſt's Kingdom, and a violent Uſurpation of his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62829:18"/>
that any Formula but the Covenant, is of the
Devil's making, and ought not to be tolerated by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians.
The Moderator of the General Aſſembly, in his
Prayer immediately after its Diſſolution, reflected upon
King <hi>William</hi> as ſent in Wrath to be a Curſe to God's Kirk.
He and the whole Aſſembly proteſted againſt the King's
Power to diſſolve them, and before his Commiſſioner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
all his Authority that way: Afterwards, to make
their Teſtimony (that's their word for Treaſon) publick,
they went to the Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and took a formal
Proteſtation after the old manner againſt the King in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the People of God (by which they intend their
own Subjects.) The Magnanimous Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the Commiſſioners, that he would adhere to the
Proteſtation with his Life and Fortune, two things equally
great and valuable.</p>
            <p>Their ordinary Doctrine and Diſcourſe in the Pulpit and
out of it, ſpeaking of the Kirk and King, is, Deliverance
will come from another hand, <hi>but thou and thy houſe ſhall
periſh.</hi> Mr. <hi>Matthew Red,</hi> holding forth the New Goſpel
at his Kirk in <hi>North Berwick, Feb.</hi> 20th, 1691-92, ſaid, <hi>The
Kirk of</hi> Scotland <hi>is preſently under the ſame condition that</hi>
David <hi>was, when he was ſo ſore perſecuted and purſued by</hi>
Saul, <hi>that he ſeemed to have no way left him to eſcape;
but then a Meſſenger came and told</hi> Saul, <hi>that the Philiſtines
had invaded the Land; this gave</hi> Saul <hi>ſome other</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">That is in <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſome other Fiſh to fry.</note> 
               <hi>Tow in his
Rock, and by that</hi> David <hi>was deliver'd.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Red</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ſame night with another of his Brethren at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
at a Knight's Houſe in that Pariſh, told plainly, That
by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> in his Sermon, he meant the <hi>French.</hi>
And both the New Goſpellers agreed, that the Kirk of
<hi>Scotland</hi> could not now be otherwiſe deliver'd but by an
Invaſion of the <hi>French</hi> to reſtore King <hi>James.</hi> This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connt
I had from a Gentleman of good Credit who was
preſent both at the Sermon and Supper. Mr. <hi>Stenton,</hi> one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62829:18"/>
of their noted Preachers, ſaid in an open Company, the
day after the Aſſembly was diſſolved, That they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
their next Meeting in 1693, hoping that before
that time they might have another King who would allow
them better Conditions. They now lay great ſtreſs upon
the Propheſie of an old Man in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> who at his dying
in 1689, ſaid, <hi>The perfect Deliverance of God's Kirk muſt come
after all by the</hi> French, <hi>for this King</hi> William <hi>will not do it.</hi>
And ſay commonly, that they brought in a Dog for God's
ſake, and that he now begins to bite the Barnes.</p>
            <p>This being their way of treating a King who has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
to oblige them even to his own loſs, and to the
wonder of Mankind; what may their Fellow-ſubjects, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
ſuch as are not of their Biggotry of Opinion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from them? That this is no new thing to them,
nor the actings only of ſome few of the more rigid ſort
of them, is evident from their extravagant and conſtant
courſe of Rudeneſs to King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, and to both the
<hi>Charles</hi>'s, whereof many inſtances are to be ſeen in their
own Books, ſome of them you may meet with in the next
Section.</p>
            <p>All the Presbyterians profeſs, that the keeping of Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
Days, even for the greateſt Bleſſing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
is Superſtition and Popery. For the modeſteſt of them
that ever ſpake laſt Year againſt <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> was <hi>Frazer</hi> of
<hi>Bray,</hi> who preaching in the High Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
in his ordinary turn upon that day on which <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>
fell, all that he ſaid was, <hi>Some will think that I will ſpeak
either for the Day or againſt it: To ſpeak againſt it I ſee no
reaſon, and to ſpeak for it I ſee as little; for why ſhould we
keep our Saviour's Birth-day, and not his Conception.</hi> Had
this Man been but acquainted with the Liturgy of the
Primitive Church, or of that in the Neighbour-Nation, he
might have found that they keep Annunciation-day for
the Conception, and this would have broke the ſtrongeſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62829:19"/>
Horn of his <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Dilemma. But for all the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have, and do profeſs againſt
the Obſervation of Anniverſary-days, yet they never miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to preach an Anniverſary Sermon on Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> who
built and indued the great Hoſpital in the City of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi>
the reaſon is, that for every Sermon on <hi>Heriot</hi>'s
Commendation, they get five Ponds, a new Hat and a
Bible. If they could have made but the ſame Purchaſe by
preaching on <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> it's more than probable that they
would have thought the Annual Obſervation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Birth, as little ſuperſtitious as that of Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi>'s
Memory.</p>
            <p>But the Diſingenuity, Hypocriſy, and Covetouſneſs of
that Party appears not only in this, but in many other
particulars; for who clamour'd more than <hi>Presbyterians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Plurality of Benefices, which was never allowed nor
practiſed under Epiſcopacy in our Kingdom, and now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verals

as Nature craves; and yet this very Man that would ſeem
ſo denied to the World, got himſelf into the poſſeſſion of
two fat Benefices, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Counter</hi> in which he never
did preach, and that of <hi>Dunſire</hi> Pariſh, in which the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Paſtor had ſerved for the whole Year, 1688, and for the
greater part of the Year 1689, and yet was not allow'd
one Farthing of the Living for either: altho' when he was
drove away he had eight young Motherleſs Children, and
no Bread for them, whereof <hi>Murray</hi> it ſeems not having
one Child, had no ſence at all.</p>
            <p>Who cried out more againſt the Covetouſneſs of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,

yet in the time of his ſuppos'd Perſecution, he made up
two thouſand and five hundred Pounds Sterling; and to the
certain knowledge of his Acquantances he was two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pounds Sterling in debt when he abdicated his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.
This ſame <hi>Johnſton</hi> being called to a dying Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

At which words, a merry Man ſtanding by,

            <p>What greater act of Injuſtice than that done to Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander

encouraged two or three Knights of the Poſt to ſwear,
That the Miniſter had danced about a Bon-fire the 14th
of <hi>October</hi> 1688. And when it was made appear to the
conviction of all Men, that there was no Bon-fires in
the Town upon that Day, and that the Town was never
wont to uſe any ſuch Solemnity upon the occaſion of that
Day; all that the Presbytery ſaid, was, That they could
not help it, for the matter was ſworn and deponed, and
and they behoved to proceed, having a Call to Purge the
Church.</p>
            <p>Beſides, their not having good Notions of the Goſpel,
nor of any good Heathen Morals; one reaſon of their
malicious and crabbed Nature may be, that they never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
Affliction, for after they abdicated their Churches in
1662, they began every-where in their Sermons to cant
about the Perſecution of the Godly, and to magnifie their
own Sufferings; by this means they were pamper'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of being perſecuted; ſome of the godly Siſters ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
them with plentiful Gratuities to their Families, and
Mony to their Purſes; they really lived better then ever
they did before, by their Stipends. They themſeves boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that they were ſure of Crowns for their Sufferings;
and that Angels viſited them often in their Troubles; and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62829:20"/>
both were materially true. I know ſeverals of them who
got Eſtates this way, and that grew fat and luſty under
their Perſecutions. Mr. <hi>Shields,</hi> one of their honeſteſt and
beſt Writers, being well acquainted with all that they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
and a great Sharer in it, glories in this, that they
were highly provided for in their greateſt Difficulties, and
makes an Argument for it of their being God's People: In
his Annalyſis (as he calls it) on the 29th of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
delivered in a Diſcourſe to the People on the Preparation-day
before they renewed the Covenants, <hi>p. 10. l.</hi> 8. theſe
are his words: <hi>Tho' in the Wilderneſs of Prelatick, Eraſtian,

&amp;c. <hi>the poor Wilderneſs-Wanderers have look'd as Meat-like
and Cloath-like a others that ſat at Eaſe in their Houſes,

finding ſuch good Fruits of their Itinerary Labours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to preach the unthinking Mobile out of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and Senſes, and well as out of their Duty to God and

was rather kindled than abated; the only Men and

out to die for a broken Covenant: It's true indeed that
many ſuch Men being deluded into ſeveral Rebellions,
put the State under a neceſſity of defending it ſelf, by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
ſome of them, and killing others in Battels;
but yet before the danger of theſe Battels, the Preachers
were generally ſo wiſe as to ſave themſelves, by running

or ſo couragious as to have but ſhew'd their Faces in

            <p>Tho' upon certain occaſions the more ſubtile and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> knowing that no art can defend or
diſguiſe the unaccountable wildneſs and madneſs of ſome
of their party, are forc'd, to diſprove and condemn them;
Yet they never fail to make uſe of the Sufferings of theſe
ſame wild Men, to magnify that Perſecution which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
pretend to have undergone, but had not the leaſt
ſhare in. Eminent inſtances of this we have in <hi>Rule</hi>'s late
book. To whom among other favours we owe this new
diſtinction of wild and ſober <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> Truly if the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> had met with the ſame meaſure with which
they formerly ſerved the Prelatiſts, if they had been uſed
as they did good Biſhop <hi>Wiſhart,</hi> whom they made to
lye ſeven Months in a dark ſtinking cloſe Priſon, without
the conveniency of ſo much as changing his Shirt but
once, ſo that he was like to be eaten up of himſelf, and
the Vermine which that naſty place produced; its proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that by ſuch Severities (which I am glad they ſuffered
not) they might have been brought to ſomething of that
good Man's Chriſtian Temper and Diſpoſition: And that
this was very great, the worſt of themſelves were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained

from what hand it came, nay his Compaſſion to them was
ſuch, that he continued ſuch <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preachers as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62829:21"/>
were any thing tollerable, in their Churches and Office;
without impoſing on them the conditions of Conformity
which the Law then required: But now <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
even thoſe that are called the ſobereſt, as we may
ſee by their daily Practices, and Expreſſions, are highly
galled, becauſe they are not allowed to treat the Biſhops
and other Miniſters of God's Word, after the ſame Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
manner that they formerly did, that is, <hi>Hew them
in pieces before the Lord,</hi> as they were wont to Phraſe it,
for they commonly compare Biſhops to <hi>Agag,</hi> and thoſe
ordained by them to the <hi>Amalekites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Epiſcopal Miniſters and Rulers uſed all Chriſtian
and diſcreet Methods when they had Power to gain and
oblige the Diſſenters, and to ſave them from the Penalties
of the Law. But now ſuch is the ingratitude of ſome, even
of thoſe ſame <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whom the Epiſcopal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
had ſaved from the Gibbet, to which the Law had
juſtly doomed them; that they were the only Perſons
that invented falſe Stories, forged malicious Lybels, and
raiſed Tumults againſt thoſe very Miniſters who had been
formerly ſo exceeding kind to them; we have but too
many inſtances of their rendering Evil for Good in this
manner: And that which makes this the more ſtrange
and odious, is, that it is Acted under a pretence to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and Reformation, and that the giddy People are
inſtigated to this Wickedneſs by their Preachers; I ſhall
trouble the Reader at preſent only with two Particulars to
this purpoſe: Mr. <hi>Monro,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Sterling,</hi> was lately lybel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and accuſed before the Brethren of the Inquiſition, by
one whom, as all the Neighbourhead knows, he preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from being Hanged, when he well deſerved it. And
now, tho' the ſaid Parſon <hi>Monro</hi> has viſibly baffled all the
Articles of his Lybel to the diſgrace of his ungrateful Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
and of thoſe Preachers who openly prompted him to
this Villany, yet they daily moleſt and diſquiet him, becauſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62829:22"/>
of his conſtant adherence to the Sacred Order of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
which is the greateſt Fault his Judges can accuſe
him of, except that of his poſſeſſing a good Living, and
that his Parts and Piety darken the whole Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
of which his Pariſhoners being fully convinced,
Love him ſo well, that they reſolve, coſt what it may,
they will not part with him as their Miniſter; and have
therefore, to the great mortification of the Presbytery there,
joyntly ſignified ſo much to them under their hands.</p>
            <p>The other particular inſtance of this Nature, ſhall be
that of one <hi>Ronaldſon,</hi> a Tenant in the Pariſh of <hi>Cranſton,</hi>
whom the Orthodox Miniſter there, Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> by his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
with Perſons of Quality, preſerved from having his
Goods confiſcated, and Perſon Baniſhed; after <hi>Ronaldſon</hi> by
his ſignal Diſobedience to the Law had expoſed himſelf to
that Sentence: This kindneſs <hi>Ronaldſon</hi> then looked on as
ſo great and ſurpriſing, That he often and openly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
he knew not how to be thankful enough for it; he and
his Family conſtantly kept the Church thereafter, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every occaſion acknowledged the Miniſter's ſingular
favour, with all the Signs of ſincere gratitude; But yet
upon the new light of the late Revolution, he appeared
the moſt open and avowed Enemy that the Miniſter had:
The Miniſter juſtly ſurpriſed with this, challenged his
many promiſes of continuing grateful. To whom <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldſon</hi>
gravely replyed, that the Thanks of his Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
was not due to him, but only to God; who oft-times
(ſaid he) ſtirs up ill Men to befriend his own People.
This change was wrought upon the Man, and this anſwer
put in his Mouth (as himſelf ſometimes owns and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes)
by frequent Conferences with their Preachers, who
in their private Diſcourſes and publick Sermons have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
him, that he is not to look to the Inſtrument, but
to the Cauſe of his Preſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62829:22"/>
I ſhall ſhut up this head concerning the Perſecution they
pretended to have ſuffered, with a remarkable note of a
Sermon preached lately by Mr. <hi>Daniel Douglaſs,</hi> one of their
great * Mufties, <q>Now Sirs, (ſays he) I will be even plain
with you, and perhaps e'en more plain than pleaſant, Sirs,
I'le tell you now, Sirs, its ordinary for us to cry out that
we were perſecuted under Epiſcopacy, but we are yet
living, Sirs; and why were we not Hanged as well as
others were, beloved? It is e'en becauſe we thought they
did caſt away their Lives needleſly, and that we would
not venture our Lives for ſuch matters as they ventured
their Lives, for I knew to meet with kindneſs both from
the Church-men and the Stateſ-men: And particularly I
knew that the Clerks of Council and Seſſion would take
nothing from us, but there are no ſuch Clerks now: For
there is one <hi>Gibbie Eliot,</hi> Sirs, that has no Charity nor
Diſcretion, for if we were all made up of Dollars, he
would ſwallow us up; pray God, Sirs, to keep our Purſes
from that falſe lown <hi>Eliot.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Ingenuity is a thing they are not concerned about, for
that's but a Branch of dry Morality, below Men ſo full
of Grace; ſome young Men among them that have had
the Advantage of being abroad are more affable, and in
their Conferences with Men of Sence, they ordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
againſt the peeviſh ſowr and unconverſable Temper
of <hi>Scotch Presbyterians;</hi> but yet theſe ſame Sparks of the
Cauſe, ſing to a quite contrary Tune when they are in a
collective or repreſentative body. I have read of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Monk who being wearied of the Cloyſter aimed at
a vacant Dignity, the poſſeſſion whereof he knew would
ſet him free: For this end he applied himſelf to every one
of his Acquaintances that had a Suffrage in the Election,
and from every ſingular and individual Perſon he received
very fair and ſatisfying promiſes, bet yet he found himſelf
ſtill diſappointed when they met together in Aſſemblies
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62829:23"/>
for the Election, whereupon he invites moſt or all of them
upon a ſet Day to Dine and be merry with him. They
that were invited knew that he was not in condition to
make any competent Proviſion for ſo many Gueſts;
Wherefore according to the uſual Cuſtom of that Fraternity,
they ſent each of them ſome material or other, proper
to make up the Feaſt; ſome ſent Fleſh, ſome Fiſh of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Kinds, ſome ſent Butter, ſome Cheeſe, ſome Wine,
and others Oyl. All which he boyled in one Kettle toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and his Gueſts being conveen'd, he cauſed ſerve
up that Hotch-potch in ſeveral large Diſhes to them, ſo
that every Diſh as they taſted it equally diſguſted them:
Where upon they asked what manner of Victuals it was?
He ſaid it was juſt ſuch as themſelves had ſent, all well
boyled in a large Kettle together. That, ſay they, is
the worſt Meat in the World when thus jumbled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but very good when every thing is dreſſed by it
ſelf. Juſt ſo are ye to me, ſays the <hi>Monk,</hi> you are very
fair and kind, when ſingle, and one by one: But I can
find nothing worſe than you, when you are all together.
The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> reſemble the <hi>Monks</hi> in this, as in many
other things, for take them ſingly, and they generally
condemn the Methods and Proceedings of their Brethren,
as rigid and ſevere, but take the ſame Men met together
in a Presbytery, Synod, or Aſſembly, and the whole Body
is the moſt unpalatable and moſt unſavory Hotch-potch
in the World.</p>
            <p>And now to haſten to a cloſe of this Section, Strangers
may juſtly wonder that Men of ſuch Temper and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
as ye have now heard the <hi>Pretbyterian</hi> Preachers
to be, ſhould have any followers. But this will not ſeem
ſo ſtrange to ſuch as confider what Multitudes of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
crowd after <hi>Jack Bowels</hi> in his Drunken Fits,
Women and Children are ordinarily led by noiſe and
ſhew, tho' it were but of Hobby-Horſes and Rattles. And
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62829:23"/>
indeed the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preachers are only flocked after
by ſuch a Herd, ſome out of a blind Zeal and Itch after
novelty and change, ſome again loving to Fiſh in the
troubled Waters of ſuch Confuſions as are inſeparable
from <hi>Presbytery,</hi> hoping thereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o mend their broken
Fortunes. And to palliate their want of Sence, and greater
Faults, by a pretence to ſtrict Religion: Others frequent
them for ſport and diverſion, as Men of little Sence and
leſs buſineſs run after Stage-Players and Rope-dancers.</p>
            <p>Sometimes ago theſe Preachers were converſant only
with Shepherds, and a few ſilly Women, laden with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Luſts, whoſe hot Zeal had no knowledge to guide
it; the Preachers then indeed admired themſelves for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of great Gifts and Learning, becauſe of the eſteem
that theſe ignorant Creatures had for them; but now that
they are brought to Act in publick, and poſſeſs the Pulpits
of Learned Men, they are at a great Diſadvantage, for
their better Auditories expect ſolid Divinity, Rational
and cloſe Diſcourſes, and that being none of their Talent,
puts them quite out of their Road and Element, and hence
it is that the People generally forſake and abhor them,
and nothing but a few of the Rabble frequent their beſt
Churches and Preachers: So that now their own dear fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
begin to complain and cry out, <hi>That Chriſt did
more good in the Hills than he does now in the Churches.</hi>
And if they hold on at their uſual manner of Raving in
Pulpits, they cannot fail to render themſelves as Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and odious as they deſerve, which they have made
pretty good Advances to already. They frequently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
Curates, as deſerted of the Spirit, becauſe they own
that in the compoſing of their Sermons they make uſe
of Books, and yet Mr. <hi>David Williamſon,</hi> one of their
<hi>ableſt Men,</hi> Preaching before the Parliament, on <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2. and
<hi>verſe</hi> 10. ſtole moſt of his Sermon from <hi>Herle</hi>'s <hi>Tripus</hi> of
Wiſdom, and had the Confidence to reprint the ſame at
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62829:24"/>
               <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Indeed the nonſence and railing of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
is wholly his own; for none but himſelf ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
or preſumed as he does there, That Chriſt dyed
a Martyr for the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government; becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
this Inſcription was written on his Croſs, <hi>Jeſus of
Nazareth King of the Jews.</hi> I do not diſcommend the uſe
of Books, but the Hypocriſie of theſe Men, who give out
that they Preach meerly by Inſpiration and Meditation,
as Mr. <hi>Areskine</hi> did in a Sermon which he Preached lately
in the <hi>Tron</hi> Church at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> his words were theſe,
<hi>The Curates goes to their Books for Preachings, but we go
to our Knees for our Preachings.</hi> And yet ſuch is the ſillineſs
of ſome deluded People, that they proclaim theſe for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refreſhing
and powerful Preachers, and for Men that, as
they Phraſe it, have an inbearing Gift, ſpeaking home to
their Hearts: Indeed make ſome People judges, we know
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> Sermons will gain the applauſe. I remember the
Old Fable of the <hi>Cuckow</hi> and the <hi>Nightingale,</hi> both conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
who ſhould Sing ſweeteſt, the <hi>Aſs</hi> becauſe of his long
Ears is made judge, the <hi>Nightingale</hi> Sung firſt, the <hi>Cuckow</hi>
next, the <hi>Aſſe</hi>'s determination was, that truly the <hi>Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi>
Sung pretty well, but for a good ſweet plain taking
Song, and a fine Note, the <hi>Cuckow</hi> Sung far better.</p>
            <p>Some who are not ſo well acquainted with the <hi>Scotch
Presbyterian</hi>'s manner of Preaching and praying may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
think that matters are here aggravated againſt them,
becauſe things ſo very Ridiculous were never vented by any
former Sect, as theſe I have and am hereafter to diſcover
of them; but they are too well known to be denyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us: And that Strangers may not think themſelves
impoſed upon, I ſhall in the next Section give the Reader
ſome little taſte of their Printed Books, and leave him to
judge from the Ridiculouſneſs of what they have delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
publiſhed to the World that way, what extravagancy
they may be Guilty of in theſe extemporary Ravings,
which they miſ-call Spiritual Preaching and Praying.</p>

on <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 2. 2. (for their Texts are generally out of the

that the Mountain of the Lord's Houſe there ſpoke of,
is expreſly meant of <hi>Scotch Presbytery; Which,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is
terrible as an Army with Banners.</hi> This laſt, I confeſs,

theſe ridiculous Diſtinctions<note n="*" place="margin">Herle<hi>'s Tripus.</hi>

and then to divide his Head from his Body; Well,
it's granted by all hands, that ſuch Men are well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Government, uſes theſe words, which we eaſily grant
to be peculiarly his own: <hi>It's no light matter,</hi> (ſays he)
<hi>it's an Ordinance of God, the Royal Diadem of Chriſt; he
was a Martyr on this Head, for it was his Ditty on the Croſs,
John</hi> 19. 19. Jeſus of Nazareth King of the Jews. If <hi>this

publick breach of Covenant; the Year,</hi> as the Author at

much Zeal for confederating among Men, but little for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting

compareth the <hi>Scotch</hi> Covenants to the Covenant of Grace,
and to the Covenants at <hi>Horeb</hi> and in <hi>Moab.</hi> In the 6th

               <q>When Monarchy becomes oppoſite to the Ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
the Contagion of it affects that very Species
of Government; and then the Houſe is to be pulled
down, when the Leproſie is got into the Walls and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
The People may make their publick Servant
ſenſible, that he is at his higheſt Elevation but a Servant:
Hence now when the Species named in the Covenant,
<hi>viz.</hi> Monarchy, is ſo vitiate, that it is become the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Deſtruction of all the Ends of that Covenant,
and now by Law tranſmitted to all Succeſſors, as an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary,
perfect, and perpetual Oppoſition to the coming
of Chriſt's Kingdom; ſo that as long as there is one to
wear that Crown, (but <hi>Jehovah</hi> will in Righteouſneſs
execute <hi>Coniah</hi>'s Doom upon the Race, <hi>Jerem 22. ult.</hi>
write this Man Childleſs,) and to enter Heir to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
as now eſtabliſhed, he muſt be an Enemy to
Chriſt: There is no other way left, but to think on a new
Model, moulded according to the true Pattern.</q>

are neither moderate nor ſober; and to theſe he imputes
all the Rebellions and Murders committed by the Party,
and yet he calls the Legal Reſtraints, put upon theſe wild
or mad <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> (for ſo they muſt be called, if they
be neither moderate nor ſober,) cruel Perſecutions: Now
their whole pretended Martyrology being only made up
of theſe Men, I would fain know whoſe Martyrs ſuch
Men were; for the Devil has his Martys too. This is
Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>'s beſt way of Reaſoning, for which I am apt to
think there's few of the Party that will thank him; it
being moſt evident, that thoſe whom he ſo much diſowns
and reflects upon, are the only true <hi>Scotch Presbyterians;</hi>
for whereas <hi>Rule,</hi> and ſome few with him, who would be
thought moderate and ſober, have evidently deſerted the

and the Decrees of the General Aſſemblies; which muſt
be acknowledged to be the Rule for <hi>Scotch Presbyterians,</hi>
or elſe it muſt be confeſt that they have none.</p>
            <p>I ſhall leave the Reader to judge which of theſe two are
indeed the trueſt <hi>Scotch Presbyterians,</hi> by the account
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62829:34"/>
which one of their own famous Writers gives of thoſe
whom Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> calls ſober and moderate; in <hi>the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Repreſentation of the Teſtimonies of the Church of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
(printed 1687, <hi>p.</hi> 162. and downwards,) ſpeaking
of the Toleration granted in that ſame Year by the King,
he ſays, and truely too, <hi>that thoſe who embraced it, acted
contrary to the Presbyterian Principles of the Church of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>particularly to the Declaration of the General Aſſembly,</hi>
July, 27, 1649; <hi>And contrary to the Covenant.</hi> And on
this Head his Arguments are infinitely beyond any that
ever we have heard from Mr. <hi>Rule; For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
is founded on Soveraign Authority, Prerogative Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and Abſolute Power, which all are to obey without reſerve.
Again,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it comes through ſuch a Conveyance, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpends,
ſtops, and diſables all Penal Laws againſt Papiſts, and
thereby everts all the Securities and Legal Bulwarks that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
can have for the Eſtabliſhment of their Religion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them depend only upon the Arbitrary Word of an Abſolute
Monarch, whoſe Principles oblige him to break it: So they
that accept this Toleration, do thereby recognize a Power in
the King, to ſubvert all Laws, Right, and Liberties; which
is contrary to Reaſon as well as Religion, and a clear breach of
the Covenants: By this Toleration the Papiſts are encouraged
and encreaſed in Numbers, the whole Nation overflow'd with
their Helliſh Locuſts, and all places fill'd with Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits;
yea, the Executive Power of the Government is put in
the Hands of the Romaniſts.—Watever Liberty this may be
to ſome Conſciences, it's none to the Tender: it's only a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which is always of Evil, for that which is good cannot
be tolerated, under the Notion of Good, but countenanced and
incouraged as ſuch: therefore this reflects upon our Religion,
when a Toleration is accepted, which implies ſuch a Reproach,
and the annexed Indemnity and Pardon, tacitely condemns the
Profeſſion thereof, as a Fault, or Crime; which no Chriſtian
can bear with, or homologate by Acceptance; whatever ſome
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62829:35"/>
Addreſſers, particularly the Presbyterians at</hi> London, <hi>have
blaſphemouſly alledged, that God is hereby reſtored to his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
over the Conſcience: Moreover,</hi>

all Idolatry, Blaſphemy, Hereſie, and Truth; making the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors

Toleration is contrary to the Scriptures of the Old and New
Teſtament; it's like</hi> Julian <hi>the Apoſtate's Toleration, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to root out Chirſtianity; it's contrary to the Confeſſion of
Faith; and therefore to accept this Toleration, is inconſiſtent
with the Principles of the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>National and
Solemn Leagues and Covenants, and Solemn Acknowledgments
of Sins, and Engagements to Duties; in all which we are
bound to Extirpate Popery and Prelacy, as inconſiſtent with
the whole Tract of our former Contendings, and particularly
with the Teſtimony of the Synod of</hi> Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The worſt of all is, (<hi>ſays he</hi>) that it's further declared in
that Toleration, that nothing muſt be preached or taught,
which may any way tend to alienate the Hearts of the People
from the King or his Government: here is the Price at which
they ought to purchaſe their Freedom; a ſad Bargain to buy
Liberty and ſell Truth. But who can be faithful, but he
muſt think it his Duty to alienate the Hearts of the People
from ſuch an Enemy to Chriſt? What Watchman muſt not ſee
it his indiſpenſable Duty, to preach ſo that the People may
hate the Whore, and <hi>this Pimp</hi> of Hers: It cannot be but
very ſtumbling to ſee the Miniſters of <hi>Scotland</hi> purchaſing à

will be tempted to think, that they are not governed by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,

but their own Intereſt, and that it was not the late
overturning of Religion and Liberty that offended them; for
if that Arbitrary Power had been but exerted in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
tho' with the ſame prejudice to the Cauſe of Chriſt, they
would have complied with it, as they do now.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> in his late Book is highly offended with the

the Cauſe, the Betraying of the Church, the Detriment of
the Nation, and the expoſing themſelves to the Contempt of

it ſelf is of ſuch a dreſs, as makes the things addreſſed for

will be found Diſloyalty to Chriſt, in a ſinful and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

Practice, is a plain betraying of Religion and Liberty,

the other Party of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> ſays, <hi>I deny not but many of
them put force upon their Light.</hi> Again, <hi>p. 118. They did hear</hi>

            <p>There are ſome famous Authors more, that are fit to have
place here, becauſe in their Writings they diſcover the
true Spirit of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> New Goſpel, two of them
own themſelves to be preſent Pamphleteers for the Party,
pretending, forſooth, to anſwer Books too. The honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and trueſt <hi>Presbyterian</hi> of theſe two, ſhall have, as he

            <p>In the very firſt Page, he ſeems to be ſtruck with Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment

in its Conqueſts over the Nation,
and diſplayed its Banner not only againſt
Religion, but even Morality: Which the
Prelates, and their Adherents were ſo far
from oppoſing, that they indulged the
People, but eſpecially the Gentry, in their
Wickedneſs, as knowing that to be the only Method to
ſecure them on their ſide. Well, believe but this New
Goſpeller, and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentry, as well as Clergy, are
a rare ſort of Monſters, indeed; for the beſt Characters
and ſofteſt Words he beſtows upon them, are theſe,
They are Godleſs Miſcreants, of the true <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Brood,
infamous Parracides, Sorcerers, and inceſtuous Apoſtates,
infamous Varlets, infamous Villains, left to corrode
their own viprous Bowels with their Inhumane Fury;
the Devil's Inſtruments, fit onely to be Stallions and
Pimps to Bawdy-Houſes; the Epiſcopalian Hireling
Preachers, with their infernal Bawlings, the Scum and
Refuſe of the Nation, they bore the Characters of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
of their Foreheads, liker Pagans than Profeſſors,
Blood-hounds, Children of Hell, the Tyranno-papa-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical

Savage Beaſts in Humane Shape, a graceleſs untoward
Generation of Prelatiſts, who uſe nothing but Hectoring

Brutes, that reprobate Faction; that Limb of Antichriſt,

            <p>This is the way the <hi>Scotch Presbyterians</hi> uſe to argue
and anſwer Books; and theſe are the ſweeteſt Flowers of

            <p>Well, ſo much for <hi>Scotland,</hi> that's his own Country
perhaps our Author may be more courteous and civil to
Strangers. Next then let's ſee how he treats the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches: As for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
moſt furiouſly againſt her in many places, <hi>viz.
p</hi> 7. <q>She is the worſt conſtitute Church in the World;
Theſe Tantivees, let their Hyperbolical Pretenſions of
Zeal for Religion and Loyalty, be what they will, if
the King but put forth his hand to touch them, they
will curſe him to his face;<note n="*" place="margin">The Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians indeed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily prevent the King's put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth his hand againſt them, by aſſaulting him firſt.</note> and rather than part with
an Inch of Superſtition, or a Swiniſh Luſt, will, as the
Party have always done, lay a Confederacy with Hell
and <hi>Rome,</hi> as times paſt and preſent do evidence beyond
contradiction. I wonder he did not add, and times to
come;</q> for that would have been as true as the other.</p>
            <p>And again, <hi>p.</hi> 8. <q>For the new upſtart ſlaviſh Doctrine
of Paſſive Obedience, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> had the
Diſhonour to be the Mother of it, ſhe has alſo the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny
to be the Murderer, having baſely cut it's Throat,
as Harlots uſe to do ſometimes with their ſpurious
Brood.<note n="*" place="margin">The great deſign of the New Goſpel to decry Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62829:38"/>
do it,<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy, who ſcruple to Swear, ſhew, that they can patiently ſuffer, and therefore are not concerned at what <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> threaten; the Devil can go no farther than his Chain reaches.</note> than to Swear Allegiance to their
Soveraigns, it may arm the good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 28. <q>Is it not as lawful for the <hi>Scots Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
to pray againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hierarchy as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.
As for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy and Prelates too, to
Plot, drink and plead in their Seſſions at the Devil, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

pray againſt it alſo, but that they have not a Form for

Clergy was not encouraged by Authority, is Ignorance
and Sawcineſs; for it's plain, Authority in <hi>Scotland,</hi> has
done what was proper for a Civil Government to do, <hi>viz.</hi>
They have declared the Hierarchy Antihumane; that is,
contrary to the peoples Inclination<note n="*" place="margin">By the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Proteſtant Religion muſt be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tihumane in <hi>France, Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an too in all the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's vaſt Dominions.</note>: and, I ſuppoſe, are
ſo good natur'd, to wiſh their Neighbours were rid of it

it may perhaps, and let them blame themſelves for

Well, here's a ſevere and open threatning, <hi>England</hi> then
look to it. The <hi>Scots Presbyterians</hi> are ſworn in their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Covenant, to reform <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> (though it

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 29. <q>The Biſhops are generally found to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that which is for the Nations good, and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the <hi>late</hi> oppoſition which they made to the late
King may be magnified, they ſeem quickly to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62829:39"/>
of it. But ſuppoſing they had continued ſtedfaſt,
yet whatever good Nature might have done, I am ſure,
Juſtice would not have awarded them any thanks;
which will appear undeniably true, if we conſider (<hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many other things which he inſtances</hi>) how moſt of
the Biſhops oppoſed the reverſing of the Judgment of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
given againſt: Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> who did the Nation more
ſervice than Seven Idolized Stars, ſo many of whom
are now turned dark Lanthorns. Nor can it ever be
forgot, how many of the inferior Clergy, following
the Conduct of their Tripple-headed Guide, advanced
the Intereſt of the Tripple-Crown, and ſome of them
topping ones too, at the hour of death, grated with their
ſlaviſh nonſenſical Doctrine of Reſiſtance upon the
Conſciences of the Noble Hero's, and Darlings of the
People, the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> upon
the very <hi>Scaffolds;</hi> and if the contrary Doctrine be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
as they alledged, then I am ſure their Church hath
been guilty of damnable Practices ſince<note n="*" place="margin">Every thing that's not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the New Goſpel muſt be ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſical, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Charity that the New Goſpel Profeſſors
have to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

upon the account of their Government, Worſhip, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and Practice, which their Phanatical Neighbours
ſo maliciouſly cenſure and blaſpheme. <hi>Well, but</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>is ſtill labouring under much
Romiſh Superſtition and Idolatry; and which is worſe, ſhe is
Papaprelatical, nay, ſhe is Archipapaprelatical;</hi> and that's
Antihumane, in the New Goſpel phraſe. But I hope
they will be kind, at leaſt, to their Brethren of the
<hi>Presbyterian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Church beyond Sea. Are not the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>French, Presbyterians?</hi> Is not the Mother Church of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
throughly reformed? No, no, they have never ſet
up the Solemn League and Covenant for their Standard:
Or to ſpeak in the Authors own words, <hi>pag. 27. They are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62829:39"/>
ſtrangers to the power of Godlineſs, becauſe not knowing how
to pray, without they muſt have recourſe to a Form, which is
as unreaſonable and unnatural an impoſition upon the Strong,
eſpecially, on Miniſters, as would be the impoſing of Crutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
upon the adult and able part of Mankind, who can walk
better without them.</hi> Well, Chriſt preſcribed a Form of
Prayer to his Diſciples; the firſt, and all the ſucceeding
Ages of the Church thought it not only convenient, but
neceſſary to uſe Forms in Publick Worſhip; but, alas the
Diſciples themſelves, and all preceding Chriſtians, are
but weak, unable Infants, in reſpect of the adult, ſtrong
and covenanted Profeſſors of the new Goſpel in the <hi>Weſt</hi>
of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next famous Author is Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> who calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Doctor of Medicine (for they never pretended to
have any in Divinity) in his Second Vindication of the
Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he ſays, <hi>pag. 113. That it is an unfair,
injurious, and falſe Imputation, to charge the ſeverity of
the Stile of this Author upon the</hi> Presbyterians, who he
ſays, <hi>diſown that Stile, it being written by a</hi> Cameronian,
<hi>while they ſtood at a diſtance from the ſober</hi> Presbyterians;
however thoſe whom he calls <hi>Sober Presbyterians,</hi> have
never yet, by any publick deed, condemned that Book,
nor any other of the Barbarities of theſe <hi>unſober</hi> Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronian
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> but have, on the contrary, received
them into their Communion, without the leaſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of any ſuch Crimes; and Dr. <hi>Rule</hi> (that I may
not offend him) calls them the <hi>Zealous Party,</hi> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
them as pretty gentle, in that they made it <hi>their
work only to deprive, and not to Murther the Epiſcopal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi>
pag. 125. Altho' the Doctor knows, that Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
can be given of ſome Miniſters that were even Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by that Zealous Party, not long ago; and himſelf
owns, in the beginning of his <hi>Poſt-ſcript,</hi> that five Men

Ferguſon,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Kilpatrick;</hi> and becauſe he would
not alter his manner of Praying, and come out of his
Houſe, as they had charged him, they therefore <hi>invaded
his Houſe, tore off his Cloaths, and beat him on the Head
and Legs,</hi> which lookt but too like a deſign to Murther
him: Several other things of this Nature were ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that his ridiculous way of diſguiſing, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

truth of the Accounts that have been given by the
Eye-witneſſes and Sufferers in that Perſecution. Upon
which Conſideration, Mr. <hi>Pitcarne,</hi> a better Writer, and
as it appears, a much honeſter Man, declined the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of theſe late Proceedings of the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> not
that he did not like the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Cauſe, for he is
through-paced that way; but becauſe, after he had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the matters of Fact for ſeveral Months, as he had
been enjoyned by the Fraternity, he found it impoſſible to
ſpeak any thing in their Vindication, but what the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of <hi>Scotland</hi> would know to be notoriouſly falſe;
wherefore, as Dr. <hi>Rule</hi> himſelf informs us, <hi>Preface</hi> to his
<hi>Second Vindication, parag. 5, &amp;</hi> 7. in the end of the ſame
Book, <hi>Pag. 190. When this Affair was committed to him,
after many Months he returned the Papers to be anſwered,
without any Reply to them.</hi> But paſſing this, I wonder that
the Worthy Doctor ſhould, in his late Book (now cited)
exactly imitate that ſevere Stile, which he and his Sober
Party pretend to diſown; but, perhaps, he ſees not this
Beam in his own Eye, with which he muſt grant the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereſt
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> to be juſtly chargeable; becauſe, as
he himſelf is at great pains to inform the World, both in
the beginning and ending of his Book, <hi>the whole party com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
that truſt to him, when others had refuſed it:
Vid. Preface, parag.</hi> 5, and 7. <hi>pages,</hi> and <hi>Second Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
pag.</hi> 192.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:62829:40"/>
Upon which account, not only the Scurrilous Railing,
but all the Untruths, Contradictions, and Nonſence,
which abounds in every Page, is juſtly chargeable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole Party, of which I ſhall give the World
ſuch a taſt, as may be ſufficient to make them judge of
all the reſt, which would be too tedious and nauſeous
here to inſert. Firſt then, as to <hi>Scurrilous Railing Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,</hi>
in the very firſt page of his Preface, he calls Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts,
<hi>The Seed of the Serpent, whoſe Enmity againſt the
Seed of the Woman</hi> (that you muſt know, is <hi>Scots Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians)
as it began, ſo it muſt end with the World;</hi> and that
you may not miſtake him, he avers after in the ſame page,
<hi>That they uſe the old ſtratagems of Satan;</hi> and in the <hi>2d.</hi>
page he compares them to <hi>Heathens, Papiſts,</hi> yea, they
are <hi>Devils, both</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Syriack <hi>Devils;</hi> nay, they are
<hi>Jeſuites, Wo to Poſterity if they believe them,</hi> for then, to
be ſure, <hi>ſucceeding Ages will turn abſolute Scepticks:</hi> He
adds, <hi>It's evident, that many of them regarded not the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Authority of the Nation, and others, by their lewdneſs
of Converſation, made themſelves unworthy to be in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>
               <hi>And in the Book it ſelf,</hi> page 1. <hi>he charges the Authors
of our late Books, with</hi> Malice, Lies, Railing, and guilty
of the fowleſt and falſeſt Miſrepreſentations that the Minds
of Men can ſuggeſt, enraged by being deprived of the occaſion
they once had to perſecute their Neighbours, the end to

            <p>This is the Meek, Lowlie Strain of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
new Goſpel, whereby the ſobereſt of them, pretend to
vindicate their own proceedings, and refute the Writings
of other Men I leave the World to judge, by this way

indeed as black and foul-mouth'd, as the moſt rank and

no difference betwixt his Stile and theirs, except this
may paſs for one, that Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> ſeems to have learned
his Stile from the <hi>Coal-ſtealers</hi> in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> or at <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven,</hi>
of which Colledge only he ought to have been
Principal; whereas the <hi>Cameronians</hi> ſeem to have learned
their Stile from the Shepherds and Herring-fiſhers on the

have leſs Knavery than the former: If Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> ſhould
challenge me, as falling into the ſame fault for which I

apprehend to be in that Character I have given before of
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preachers and People, yet that is only
chargeable upon my ſingle perſon, and not upon others of
our Party, for I neither do, nor pretend to write by a
Commiſſion from them: And beſides, he himſelf hath
provided me with an Apologie, <hi>viz. Calling things by
their true names, is not to be reckoned inconſiſtent with

But paſſing thoſe Flowers of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Eloquence, let
us examine in the next place, if this Author makes any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for his Stile, by the Truth and Reaſon that he
writes; it would be tedious to trace him through every
Page, in which his Nonſence, Contradictions, and Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
abound, and therefore I ſhall here mention only
ſome generals.</p>
            <p>There is one Principle ſuitable to the Genius of the New
Goſpel only, upon which much of his Book is founded,
and it's this, <hi>Do as ye have been done by;</hi> by this he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
the greateſt Barbarities of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Rabble, and

               </note>; it's true in other places he condemns them, and
ſays, he will not defend them; but he ſeems not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhamefully to contradict himſelf at every turn: The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for whom he pleads are not ſo critical as to obſerve
that, and for others he ſays, that he deſpiſes and contemns
them: Sometimes, if you'l believe him, <hi>Cameronians are
zealous godly Men, eminent for their suffering for Chriſt;</hi>
by and by ſays he, <hi>They are a wild, ungovernable, deſperate
Rabble, render'd mad by Oppreſſion:</hi> the ſum of all is, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
is a true <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Vertue, and Contradiction
Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>'s beſt: way of Reaſoning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preface,</hi> par. 6. theſe are his words: <hi>I have treated the
Adverſaries I deal with as Brethren, deſiring rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeed,
than come ſhort in Civility, and fair dealing with them.</hi>
But at the ſame time he takes the liberty almoſt in every

Devils, habitual Drunkards and Swearers, Traitors that
deſerve to have their Necks ſtretched, prophane Perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

who beat their Wives, and in their Dealings are moſt injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Oppoſers of Chriſt, and his Inſtitution, and who harden and

Pages above cited, and many other of <hi>Rule</hi>'s exceeding
Civil Book, which being written by the Deſign of the

that this is the only way <hi>of Scots Presbyterian Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and fair Dealing.</hi> Again in the ſame <hi>Preface,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag.</hi>

which is the beſt Foundation of many of the Aſſertions of my

preceeding words, <hi>The truth of matters of fact aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Treatiſe, is not to be taken from me, but from them
who are my Informers, few of whom I pretend to any perſonal
knowledge of, therefore not my Veracity is pledged, but that of
others: if they have deceived, or been deceived, I am not to
anſwer for that.</hi> What can a Man believe of a Book that's
uſher'd in with ſuch a doubting and contradictory Preface;
if theſe were not Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>'s own expreſs Sayings, no body
could well believe, that the whole Faction could have ſingled
out ſuch a Writer to Vindicate them; but Falſhood it ſeems
has no Feet, and Lyars who have ſo little Wit and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
muſt needs be often intangled in their own Snares.</p>
            <p>Some of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have medled far beyond
their Line in our Affairs, tho' we be far from interpoſing in any
of theirs, <hi>p. 16. only upon occaſion we take the Chriſtian
Liberty that our Predeceſſors have always done, of calling
them</hi> Superſtitious, Popiſh, and Idolatrous in their Worſhip;
and in their Doctrine, ſcandalous for Arianiſm, Arminianiſm,
Socinianiſm, Popery, and that Turkiſh Bow-ſtring Doctrine of
Paſſive Obedience; <hi>and that in their</hi> Government <hi>they are</hi>
directly contrary to Chriſt's Inſtitution, to the deſign of the
Reformation, and to the Holy Covenant, <hi>being Tyrannical,
Prelatical, yea and Archi-papa-prelatical;</hi> What we are bound
to by the Covenant, <hi>ſays he again,</hi> is not to reform them, but
to concur with them, when lawfully called, to advance the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
<hi>that is, wholly to overturn their Church and
State, as we formerly did by our own glorious Goſpel-Methods
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62829:43"/>
of</hi> Fire and Sword, <hi>having a</hi> very lawful Call <hi>from
a godly Party, who invited us to</hi> fight the Battels of the
Lord againſt the Mighty, <hi>the King who oppoſed Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Work

our thoughts to go beyond that Boundary, in being concerned in
their Affairs, we wiſh their Reformation, but leave the manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it to themſelves; <hi>that is, till we find ſuch a bleſſed
Occaſion as</hi> thoſe Worthies of the Lord, the Reformers, did

            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 23. he ſays that King <hi>James abdicated the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that the Parliament called it ſo;</hi> if he knows any
thing of thoſe Affairs, he knows that the Parliament of
<hi>Scotland</hi> did nor give it that name, tho' that of <hi>England</hi>
did: However, if he did Abdicate, I would fain know how
this conſiſts with <hi>Rule</hi> his concluding juſt before, <hi>p. 22.
That his Royal Authority was taken away by the Nation;</hi> and
with what he ſays <hi>p. 100. The Nation laid him aſide, and
chuſed another;</hi> This is the conſtant Doctrine of <hi>Scotch Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi>
(and they practice accordingly,) That <hi>the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
can give and take away the Royal Authority, can lay aſide
and chuſe Kings at their pleaſure,</hi> vide <hi>Buchan. de Jur. Reg.
Jus Populi Vind. Lex. Rex,</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi>'s <hi>Vind.</hi> Now to uſe
Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>'s moderate Phraſe in that place, <hi>Some Mens necks
have been made to ſtretch for a leſs Crime;</hi> than to aſſert un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an Hereditary Monarchy, that Kings are or can be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
and it's certain they are as little Friends to their
preſent Majeſties, as to Monarchy, who would found their
Authority upon ſuch a tottering bottom: nay, Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>
in the name of the other <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> tells plainly that
they owe no Allegiance to King <hi>William,</hi> but in ſo far as
he ſupports <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and that it would overturn the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Foundations of his Authority to reſtore Epiſcopacy,
<hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it is declared againſt in, the Claim of Right,
as a Grievance, and therefore cannot be reſtored without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturniing

p. 90. parag.4. And again <hi>p. 152. parag. 2. The Convention
hath voted Epiſcopacy to be a Grievance to the Nation, and
in the Claim of Right, made it a</hi> Fundamental Article <hi>in the
Government, that it ſhould be aboliſhed.</hi> Now what's the
meaning of all this, but that the preſent Government of,
State muſt neceſſarily ſtand and fall with <hi>Presbytery?</hi> So
that all their great boaſts of Loyalty to the preſent King,
amounts to no more than this, No <hi>Presbytery,</hi> no King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam.</hi>

               <hi>Page 36. par.</hi> 11. he ſays, <hi>Moſt of the Epiſcopal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

for they deſerted their Charges without either Sentence
Threatning, or Compulſion.</hi> And yet before that <hi>Page</hi> 26,
<hi>Parag.</hi> 6. he owns that the <hi>Presbyterian Rabble did perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
and drive them away. But that this is no more imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Presbyterians, than the Drunkenneſs, Swearing,
Whoredoms, and Perſecutions,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">This is the Civil Style that he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in, <hi>Pref.</hi> par. 6.</note> 
               <hi>that we charge many of the
Prelatiſts with, are to be lookt on as the Crimes of all the, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopalians.</hi>
And farther he excuſes that Rabble, becauſe
as he there avers, <hi>They were under the higheſt Provocations
imaginable to do what they did; yea, to have proceeded to
farther Severities.</hi> And he adds out of the abundance of
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> ſence, <hi>that theſe things were done in an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum;</hi>
which by the bye, can never poſſibly fall out in
an Hereditary Kingdom<note n="*" place="margin">Where in the ſenſe of the Law the King never dies.</note>: And tho' he ſays we had then no
Church-Government, yet himſelf knows the contrary, and
that Prelacy ſtood then eſtabliſhed by many Laws made in

Here he leaves it to the Diſcretion of the Reader, to judge
whether this be a ſimple Affirmation only, or an Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Oath conjoyned; tho' the firſt may be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet the latter ſence ſeems moſt natural to the words,
and in any other ſence there is no truth in them: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Arguments by which their Preachers would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the People to this, are as ridiculous as the Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ſelf; for their ordinary Cant is, <hi>Beloved, we read in
the Word, that the Apoſtles went up together, one did not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the other; there was no Precedency amongſt them, Beloved;
and therefore it's clear, that there was no Prelacy in thoſe
days: And again we read, that honeſt</hi> Paul (they never call
him St. <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he never ſwore the Solemn League
and Covenant,) <hi>left his Cloak at</hi> Troas: <hi>Why, Sirs, you ſee
plainly from this Text, that</hi> Paul <hi>had not a Gown but a Cloak,
for ſays the Text, he left his Cloak, it does not ſay that he
left his Gown; never a Gown had that precious Man to leave,
Beloved, and therefore you may be ſure he was no Prelate;
for they, falſe Lowns, have no Cloaks but Gowns.</hi> From theſe

but the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> to be of Divine Inſtitution, and at

that all <hi>Rule</hi>'s Vain and Empty Boaſts of this Matter,

Biſhops, which were formerly in the Church, the Kirk
had new ſet up ſixty:</hi> But in this matter all his Quibles and
Sophiſms (and his beſt Arguments are no more) depend
upon this Suppoſition, <hi>That that Parliament was the Church,</hi>
(which is directly contrary to the Fundamental Principle
of a Spiritual Power inherent in the Kirk, altogether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
on the Parliament, which has no Power over
Chriſt's Office-bearers,) for it was that Parliament in which
there was not ſo much as one Clergy-man, that <hi>impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
theſe ſixty Presbyters to govern the Kirk, and reſtrained
all the reſt from that Priviledge;</hi> it was that Parliament
which took upon them <hi>to judge of the Hability of theſe ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and of the Inhability of other Presbyters to govern:</hi> well
then, according to his way of arguing here, <hi>it's the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

caſt upon us:</hi> The Moderation of any Party is beſt
known by their Practices when in power; now when the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> were laſt in power, all the Evidences of their
Moderation were, <hi>the reeking of Fields and Scaffolds with
the Blood of Princes, Prelates, Nobles, Gentry, and Commons;
the Cries and Tears of Widows and Orphans; the Groans of
Men Impriſoned, Baniſhed, Excommunicated, Sequeſtred; ſome
Cathedrals razed, and others converted to Garriſons and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and the leſſer Churches made Dens for Thieves,</hi> in the
moſt litteral ſence: and now that they are in power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
all the Evidences of their Moderation, are <hi>Rabbling,
Robbing, Beating, Wounding, Impriſoning, and Baniſhing of
Biſhops, Curates, Wives, and Children; the ſtigmatizing and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62829:45"/>
ſlandering innocent and good Men; invading the juſt Rights
of the King, and of his beſt Subjects; rendering whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
deſtitute of any Miniſtry, flying at every turn in the
face of Civil Authority; becoming falſe Accuſers and Informers,
and at the ſame time ſitting as judges of Men in Office, and
the next day intruding into their Places</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">As Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did.</note>: This <hi>Purging
Work</hi> as they call it, <hi>Kirk Moderation</hi> with a witneſs; and
to uſe Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>'s own words, it's even as <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>

<hi>Presbyters,</hi> againſt the King and the Acts of Parliament to
Aſſiſt and Deliver him, when perfidiouſly Impriſoned by
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels, he ſays it was <hi>no groſs nor ſcandalous
Crime, but only a ſpeculative Opinion in a controverted Point:</hi>
This ſhews what is the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> and of the
Party that imployed him; but how it conſiſts with his
telling the World ſo often in his two laſt Books, <hi>That Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
do not take upon them to meddle in matters of State,
nor to controul their Civil Governours;</hi> I leave him to ſhew
us in his next Vindication: In the ſame Page, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> vindicating the Proceedings of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Aſſembly in this matter, ſays, That <hi>the fatal Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
about Proteſtation and Remonſtrance, was</hi> through the
Mercy of GOD, <hi>not ſo much as mentioned among them;</hi>
and yet in the very next lines he ſays, <hi>That it was moved
that the old Sentence againſt the Remonſtrators ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked;
and the revoking of their Sentence was confirmed by
this Meeting:—That Mr.</hi> Pitcairn, <hi>one of the Reverend
Brethren, was diſſatisfied with the Determination of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that Affair, and was a little hot about it, and ſpoke of
entering a Proteſtation againſt it.</hi> Would any People but
<hi>Scotch Presbyterians</hi> have imployed ſuch a Scribler as dare
thus prophane the <hi>Mercies of GOD,</hi> to juſtifie his own
fooliſh and palpable Contradictions.</p>

               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:62829:46"/>
               <hi>Page</hi> 160. He grants that to make up their Meeting,
<hi>ſome Presbyteries ſent more than was cuſtomary or allowable,</hi>
and yet it was a Regular, Lawful, General Aſſembly; <hi>and
that they had none at all ſent from other parts;</hi> which parts
were more than one half of the Nation: And was not this
a pretty <hi>General</hi> indeed, that included only the leaſt part
of the <hi>Particulars</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Juſt like the Roman Catholick Church, an Vniverſal Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</note>? This is true <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Logic, and
the Author of it deſerves well to be Head of a Colledge.
In the ſame Page he denies confidently, that <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
were wont <hi>to appoint their Faſts on the Lord's Day;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he might have, with at leaſt as great ſhew of truth, deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that ever they faſted on any Day: But his two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for the General Aſſembly's appointing this Faſt on
the Lord's Day, will render this whole matter as plain as
a Pikeſtaff; Firſt, ſays he, <hi>It was the Harveſt time, and to
faſt then on a Week-day, would have been a high Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency;</hi>
Well, we godly <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that are the Children
of the Lord, may make bold with his Day, rather than
ſeem by Religious Exerciſes to incommode the People in
their Worldly intereſt. Secondly, <hi>Religious Joy and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Sorrow do very well agree:</hi> And even ſo Faſting and
Feaſting at the ſame time may be very religiouſly and well
obſerved by the Godly.</p>
            <p>They that write Contradictions muſt needs ſpeak ſome
Truths, and Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> ſtumbles upon one that's well known,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 161. where he ſays, <hi>We confeſs that planting work
went more ſlowly on than purging work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Divine, and he was all for <hi>planting
and healing;</hi> Dr. <hi>Rule</hi> calls himſelf a Phyſician, and he is
all for <hi>purging</hi> and <hi>launcing.</hi> The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are always
for <hi>purging work.</hi> Now they are for purging the Kirk: next
have at the <hi>King Council</hi> and <hi>Houſhold;</hi> there muſt be
ſome <hi>purging</hi> work there too. Again, There are many
<hi>malignant Members,</hi> which like ſo many ill humours cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the Body of the Parliament, therefore that muſt be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62829:46"/>
alſo purged: Then the filthineſs of the Army (by which Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Work
muſt be carried on) that muſt be likewiſe purged; and
then that all the Streams may be pure <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> the Fountains
muſt be cleanſed, the Univerſities muſt be purged from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of all ill-affected and ſuſpected perſons; and in a word, to
make a <hi>thorough Reformation</hi> in the Land, the whole Nation muſt be
<hi>ſoundly drenched,</hi> and <hi>purging work</hi> muſt go on in the Land after
the old <hi>Presbyterian</hi> manner, ſo long as there remains either Guts
or Brains in it. My Lord <hi>C—d who is deſervedly honoured by all the
party.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 167.</note> His Godly Parks and Orchards are well planted already,
and why then ſhould the General Aſſembly be any farther concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about <hi>planting work? Purging work</hi> is their <hi>Great Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another evident truth that Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> happens to Deviate
into <hi>Pag.</hi> 188. viz. <hi>The worſt of the Prela<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iſts would be readieſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
Repentance for conforming to Epiſcopacy, which they who acted from a
principle could not do.</hi> In this I heartily agree with him, and am ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſatisfied that that Epiſcopal Renegado, who profeſſed ſuch
a Repentance before their Aſſembly, neither acted from any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
nor can be ſuppoſed to have any Conſcience; and we bleſs
God that all the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> intereſt, art, and induſtry, now that
they have power, could not prevail with any but this one man, to
proſtitute his Conſcience to his intereſt, in ſuch a baſe and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
compliance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall end my reflections on this Author's ſayings, with ſome ſhort
Remarks upon the Witneſſes which he alledges to atteſt his aſſertions,
and firſt in general I ſay of them in his own words, <hi>Pag. 88. That
they are the ſworn Enemies of the Epiſcopal Church</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Witneſs their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note>, <hi>and in a combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not only to defame them,</hi> but to root them out, and cut them off
from the face of the earth; <hi>and we have from the Pamphlet now under
conſideration</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rule's 2d <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Kirk.</hi>
               </note>, <hi>a taſte of the veracity of the men with whom we have to
do: If his witneſſes make no more conſcience of ſpeaking truth, than he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
doth, then few thinking men will be moved with what they ſay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> Of the Witneſſes named by the Authors of our Books, he
ſays, <hi>they are moſtly</hi> teſte me ipſo, <hi>the Complainant is the witneſs, which is
not fair.</hi> Now <hi>all</hi> Rule <hi>his Evidences</hi> are by this exception to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
for he himſelf, and all others that know them, are fully ſatisfied
that thoſe very <hi>Cameronians,</hi> whom he names as the Evidences to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
and leſſen the atteſted matters of fact of our late Perſecution,
were themſelves the principal actors of that horrid Tragedy. Since
then <hi>it is not fair</hi> to admit parties to be witneſſes, why ſhould theſe
<hi>Cameronians</hi> be received as ſuch in this affair? Again he ſaith, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62829:47"/>
               <hi>Miniſters witneſſing for one another derogateth much from the Credibility of
their Teſtimonies;</hi> but what ſay you to <hi>Cameronian</hi> Presbyterians wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing
for one another? why, this derogates nothing from the <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility
of their Teſtimonoes,</hi> for they <hi>are not Miniſters,</hi> that's one evident
reaſon; and moreover they are all men of <hi>ſtrict Conſcience, a godly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and very faithful to their <hi>Solemn League, the Holy Scots Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
Upon theſe conſiderations M. <hi>Rule,</hi> Defender of the New Goſpel-Faith,
would have the world receive the teſtimony of that <hi>Cameroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Rabble, as infallible proofs of what he aſſerts in his ſecond vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Kirk. And yet Preface <hi>pag.</hi> 6. he ſays
of them, <hi>That he will not pledge his veracity for theirs, that he pretends to
no Perſonal knowledg of but a few of them; and that if they deceive, or
have been deceived, not he but they are to blame for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all this, if neither Biſhops nor other Miniſters, neither
Laick, Lords nor Gentry, both of the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation,
muſt be allowed to have any Credit, when they are brought by our
Authors to atteſt known Truths, and matters of Fact whereof they
were Eye Witneſſes; then I beſeech you, why ſhould men receive
that high Character and Teſtimony which Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> gives of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>pag.</hi> 169? when he ſays, <hi>He did not only practice Medicine, but
likewiſe took the Degree of Doctor in it, yet never giving over the Work
of preaching frequently:</hi> This is a terrible Man indeed, who, it
ſeems, can kill both Soul and Body: He is far ſtricter to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
Work, than his Brethren the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> for
they can upon occaſion, for Intereſt and other ſuch holy Purpoſes
unite and joyn with <hi>Independents,</hi> whereas he like a man of unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Conſcience, <hi>withſtood the temptation of having an Independent
Congregation at</hi> Aberdeen, <hi>when great offers of that Charge were made
to him there; and in</hi> Northumberland <hi>he ſuffered no ſmall loſs, becauſe
he would not fall in with that Independent way.</hi> Again, if you'll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
himſelf, <hi>he hat no want of Latin, and that he ſpeaks falſe Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
is falſe; he is ready (as he hath done) to give proof to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and to compete with all ſuch as pretend to it;</hi> but <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi>
we muſt not know, till <hi>Elias</hi> come. Nay, beſides all this, <hi>he hath an
excellent hand at Latin Prayers, which he can make longer or ſhorter,
as the occaſion requireth, but never ſo ſhort as ſome men alledge; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he uſe to pray VERY LONG in publick, even in</hi> Engliſh, and
that's more indeed than any other of his Fraternity can alledge for
themſelves: Long Prayers ſerve the Party for many great ends;
in them they can ſound the Alarms to Rebellion, commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
highly, defame the King, rail againſt and revile Malignants,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62829:47"/>
raiſe and inflame the Mob, vent falſe News and Stories, and many
other <hi>Hocus</hi> tricks their long <hi>ex Trumpry Prayers</hi> ſerve for: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> to ſhew his Parts, longs for an Adverſary like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>I wiſh,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a Scioliſt would make it appear by a Solid Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
what Ignorance I have diſcovered in my Writings, I am ready to
defend it</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Even tho' it be ſolidly refuted by a <hi>Scioliſt.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>with all the probability the ſubject matter is capable of: But
my miſtakes, if I be in any, muſt not paſs for proofs of my Ignorance:
If any Momus will make his cenſure on the Presbyterian Government, it's
like Mr.</hi> Rule, the great <hi>Atlas</hi> of the Cauſe, <hi>or ſome for him, will
give him a farther Anſwer:</hi> Juſt ſuch another as this <hi>exceeding civil
and fair Vindication:</hi> And then, to conclude his own Character, he
aſſures us, That <hi>he exceeds all other</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>both in his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the Epiſcopal party, and in his Argumentative way, rather than bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs;</hi>
of all which the new Goſpel Modeſty and Meekneſs, the
Candor, Ingenuity, and Argumentation that appears every where in
his late Books is a ſufficient evidence. Now for a man to ſay all
this of himſelf, becauſe no body elſe will, this ſure is <hi>teſte me ipſo</hi>
with a witneſs:, unleſs it ſhall be allowed, that <hi>Gilbert</hi> may witneſs

way of proving things by Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> anſwers our Books ſo throughly, that he imputes to the
Authors, as a fault in their Method, every little eſcape of the
Printers about wrong numbering the Pages<note n="*" place="margin">Vid <hi>Rules</hi> 2d. Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>pag.</hi> 88. &amp; 177.</note>, which is frequently
occaſioned by ſending one and the ſame Book to ſeveral Houſes for

Sheets, ordinarily ſerves to help the miſplaced Figures; but tho'
Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> be often dabling about the Preſs, yet it ſeems he either
does not, or he will not know this.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> at laſt, to confirm all the Contradictions and Falſhoods
of his Book, brings in Mr. <hi>Meldrum,</hi> one of his own Kidney, and
juſt ſuch another Scribler, as appears by his Letter, <hi>Page</hi> 195.
where he ſays. <hi>That the Prelatiſts way is to ſpread Reflective Pamphlets
in</hi> England, <hi>keeping them as ſecret as they can in</hi> Scotland, <hi>where the
falſhood of matters of Fact are not known, and they might ſoon have
their Shame and Lying diſcovered.</hi> None but a true <hi>Scots Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
could have aſſerted this, for he himſelf too well knows, that his
Party, which domineers now in <hi>Scotland,</hi> allows no Epiſcopal Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
to be brought into, or diſperſed in that Kingdom, and that
ſometime before the writing of his Letter, ſeveral hundreds of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62829:48"/>
theſe Pamphlets were, by the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party, ſeiz'd at <hi>Berwick,</hi>
to prevent their being diſperſed in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that contrary to
all the Rules of Juſtice, and Commerce betwixt the two Nations,
and to the great prejudice of the Bookſeller, theſe Books are by
the Arbitrary Power of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſtill kept up: But we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> to be more candid in this than in his former deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with us, if he will but now obtain to us, the common liberty
of the Preſs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then we promiſe that he ſhall have a
ſight of all our Pamphlets <hi>ſine praetio aut praece,</hi> which now he ſays
he cannot obtain by either of theſe means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 196<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> None but a <hi>Cameronian</hi> will aſſert, as Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi>
does, <hi>That the Covenant is a Sacred Oath;</hi> juſt as Sacred as that by
which the <hi>Jews</hi> bound themſelves to murther St. <hi>Paul:</hi> The World
is not now ignorant, how that Covenant was by Subjects, who had
no ſhadow or Authority, preſſed upon their Brethren in deſpite of
the King, at the expence of much Treaſure, and many thouſand
Lives and Perjuries. <hi>Page</hi> 197. he ſays, <hi>That the ſubmitting of ſome,
who had been ordained only by</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>to be re-ordained by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
is Scandalous:</hi> None but one of <hi>Rule</hi>'s Evidences would have
ſaid this; the Reformed <hi>French</hi> have been always juſtly reputed by
all other Proteſtants, for the great Learning and Piety of their
Miniſters, and yet the moſt Learned and Pious of their Miniſters,
at their coming into <hi>England,</hi> when they could have the advantage
of being Ordained by Biſhops, have chearfully not only ſubmitted
to it, but begged it of the Right Reverend Fathers of the Church:
Of which we have many late Inſtances.</p>
            <p>The account he gives of his ſhufling and ſhifting about the Oath
of Canonical Obedience is very Comical; for he owns, That <hi>he
Subſcribed a Paper whereof he did not ſeriouſly conſider either the words
or the matter,</hi> and he thinks himſelf ſufficiently abſolved from that,
becauſe, forſooth, <hi>he was not preſent when that paper was read in the
Church,</hi> and by telling the People next Lord's day, <hi>that he conceiv'd
he had yielded to nothing but what he firſt offered,</hi> which they that know
the matter of Fact call <hi>Canonical Obedience;</hi> for which, if you'll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, <hi>he lamented ſeveral years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after;</hi> all which time he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
both in his <hi>Lamentations and Canonical Obedience</hi> together;
and now he ſays <hi>he's obliged to thoſe he calls his Enemies, for giving
him the opportunity to tell the World, that he repents of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other matters narrated in that Letter, and in the Book to

               <hi>Epiſt. 3. To the Profeſſors of Chriſt in</hi> Ireland. It will be aſked at
every one of us, on what terms we here brook Chriſt, for we have
ſitten long Meal<note n="*" place="margin">Rent.</note> free: we found Chriſt without a wet Foot, and
he and his Goſpel came upon ſmall charges.to our Doors, but now
we muſt wet our Feet to ſeek him. <hi>Ibid.</hi> Chriſt will not bring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sun and Moon all the Infirmities of his Wife. It is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
of Marriage-Anger, or Husband-wrath, that our ſweet Lord

World hear what is betwixt him and us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>Epiſt. 5. To my Lady</hi> Kenmure. Madam, why ſhould I ſmother
Chriſt's honeſty? he looked<note n="*" place="margin">Strange.</note> framed and uncouth-like upon me when
I came firſt here, but I believe himſelf better than his looks, I ſhall
not again quarrel with Chriſt for a<note n="*" place="margin">Frown.</note> Gloom: now he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Mask off his Face, and ſaith, Kiſs thy fill. <hi>Ibid.</hi> It's little
to talk of Chriſt by the Book and Tongue, but to come nigh
Chriſt and hauſs<note n="*" place="margin">Hugg.</note> him, and embrace him is another thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epiſt. 11. To the Vicount of</hi> Kenmure. deſpair that ever I

plies in it; I wonder what he mean, to put ſuch a Slave at the
Board-head, at his own Elbow. Ah! that I ſhould lay my black
Mouth to ſuch a fair, fair, fair Face as Chriſt's; he got neither
bud nor hire of me, it coſt me nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epiſt. 12. To my Lady</hi> Kenmure. If there were buying, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

Free grace might go play it ſelf, and a Saviour might ſing dumb,

            <p>
               <hi>Epiſt. 14. To</hi> John Gordon <hi>of</hi> Gordneſs. Many a ſweet, ſweet,

they be that have returned to their old vomit (<hi>Prelacy</hi>) ſince my
departure, I bind upon their Back, in my Maſter's Name and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
the long, laſting, weighty Vengeance and Curſe of god;
in the Lord's Name I give them a doom of black and unmixed pure
Wrath, which my Maſter ſhall ratify, except they timeouſly repent
and turn to the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epiſt. 15. To my Lady</hi> Boyd. Chriſt delighteth to take up fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Bairns, and to mend broken Bones; he is content that ye lay
broken Arms and Legs on his Knee, that he may ſpelk them. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
I think ſhame of the Board-head, and firſt Meſs<note n="*" place="margin">Diſh.</note>, and the Royal
King's Dining-hall; and that my black hand ſhould come on ſuch

               <hi>Epiſt. 17 To my Lord</hi> Lowdon. You come out to the Streets

            <p>
               <hi>Epiſt. 19. To Mr.</hi> Huge M<hi rend="sup">c.</hi> Kel. O how many black Counts<note n="*" place="margin">Accounts.</note>
have Chriſt and I rounded over together? O how fat a Portion
hath he given to an hungry Soul? I had rather have Chriſt's four

            <p>
               <hi>Epiſt. 20. To my Lady</hi> Boyd. I ſee now a Sufferer for Chriſt will

            <p>

               <hi>Epiſt. 27. To Mr.</hi> Matthew Mowat. If I had Veſſels I might

I had not ſo much free Gear<note n="†" place="margin">Goods.</note> when I came to Chriſt's Camp

            <p>
               <hi>Epiſt. 27. To</hi> Earlſton Younger. I have ſeen the Devil as it were
dead and buried, and yet riſe again, and be a worſe Devil than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he was; therefore, Brother, beware of a green young Devil
that hath never been buried; the Devil in his Flower is much to

good Bairns go to Heaven with a broken Brow, and a crooked Leg.
<hi>Ibid.</hi> It's a hard matter for a poor hungry Man to win<note n="*" place="margin">Yearn.</note> his Meat
upon hidden Chriſt, for then the Key of his Pantry Door is a ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and cannot be had, but hunger muſt break through Iron-Locks:
I bemoan not them that can make a dinn<note n="*" place="margin">Noiſe</note> and all. the

dance to your daft Spring<note n="*" place="margin">Fooliſh Song.</note>. <hi>Ibid.</hi> At our firſt Converſion the
Lord putteth the Meat in young Bairns Mouths with his own hand.
We love always to have the Pap put in our Mouth. <hi>Ibid.</hi> If my
Creditor Chriſt would take from me what he hath lent, I would not

               <hi>Epiſt. 28. To</hi> Alexander Gordon <hi>of</hi> Knockraig. O if I could be

            <p>
               <hi>Epiſt. 35. To</hi> Marion Mac Naught. Chriſt, who is your Head,

Sometimes King Jeſus ſendeth me out a ſtanding-drink, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth

only Compaſs they would have Faith and Religion to ſail by, and to

they may thruſt in after them Antichriſt's legs, thighs, and his
belly, head and ſhoulders; and then cry down Chriſt and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
and up the Merchandize and Wares of the Great Whore.
<hi>Ibid.</hi> Chriſt ſhall never be content with this Land, neither ſhall his
hot fiery indignation be turned away, ſo long as the Prelate (the
man that lay in Antichriſt's foul womb, and the Antichriſt's Lord
Bailiff) ſhall ſit Lord Carver in the Lord Jeſus Courts. The Prelate
is both the Egg and the Neſt to cleck and bring forth Popery; plead

Principles and Opinions concerning Civil Government.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of late have talk'd much of their Loyalty, but
if they have any, it muſt be in contradiction to their Principles:
For proof of this I ſhall not trouble you with Citations from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

conſtant Doctrin as well as Practice of Reſiſtance; and ſome few
Inſtances I muſt not omit, taken from the Acts of their General
Aſſemblies, and thoſe Books which have the general Approbation
of the Party, in which they expreſs themſelves thus; <hi>Vnleſs Men
blot out of their Hearts, the Love of Religion, and Cauſe of God, and

            <p>AT firſt I begin with one I heard from <hi>Zetland,</hi> who Preaching
on <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah,</hi> he told the Hearers, <hi>Sirs, this</hi> David <hi>was
but a little manekine like my beddle</hi> Davie Gaddies there <hi>but Goliah was a
meckle ſtrong fellow, like the Laird of</hi> Quandal <hi>there; this</hi> David <hi>gets
a Scrippie and Baggie, that is, a Sling and a Stone in it; he ſlings a Stone
into</hi> Goliah' <hi>s Face, down falls</hi> Goliah <hi>and</hi> David <hi>above him: After
that</hi> David <hi>was made a King; he that was keeping Sheep before, in truth
he came very well too, Sirs: Well ſaid,</hi> Davie, <hi>ſee what comes of it,

            <p>Another preaching againſt Drunkenneſs, told the Hearers, <hi>There
were four ſorts of Drunkenneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1. <q>To be drunk like a Sow, tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

drunk like a Dog; the Dog fills the Stomach of him, and ſpues
all out again, and thou <hi>John Jamiſon</hi> was this way drunk the
other day. 3. There is to be drunk like a Gooſe: Of all Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs,
Sirs, beware of the Drunkenneſs of the Gooſe, for it
never reſts, but conſtantly dips the<note n="*" place="margin">Beke.</note> Gobb of it in the Water:
You are all drunk this way, Sirs, I need name none of you.
4. There is to be drunk like a Sheep; the ſilly Sheep ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
drinks, but ſometimes wets the Mouth of it in the Water, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62829:53"/>
riſes up as well as ever; and I my ſelf uſe to be, drunk this way, Sirs.
But now, I ſee (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) two Gentlemen in the Kirk, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
you are both Strangers to me, but I muſt vindicate my ſelf
at your hands; I have here the curſedeſt Pariſh that ever God put
Breath in, for all my preaching againſt Drunkenneſs, they will
go into a Change-houſe after Sermon, and the firſt thing they'll
get, is a meckle<note n="*" place="margin">Large diſh.</note> cup full of hot Ale, and they will ſay, <hi>I wiſh we

            <p>Mr. <hi>John Levingſtone</hi> in <hi>Ancrum,</hi> once giving the Sacrament of the

            <p>One <hi>John Simple,</hi> a very Zealous Preacher among them, uſed to
perſonate and act Sermons in the old Monkiſh Stile ſpoken of
<hi>Sect.</hi> 1. § 16. At a certain time he preached upon that Debate,
<hi>Whether a Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be Juſtified by Faith or by Works,</hi> and acted it after
this manner, <q>Sirs, this is a very great Debate, but who is that
looking in at the Door, with his red Cap? follow your look, Sir;
it is very ill manners to be looking in, but what's your name? <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Bellarmine: Bellarmine, ſaith he,</hi> Whether is a man justified by
Faith or by Works? He is juſtified by Works: Stand thou there
man. But what is he, that honeſt-like-man ſtanding in the Floor
with the long Beard, and <hi>Geneva</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Hood.</note> Coul? a very honeſt-like-man,
draw near; What's your name, Sir? My name is <hi>John Calvin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Calvin,</hi> honeſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> Whether is a man juſtified by Faith or by

Leg and we ſhall<note n="*" place="margin">Trip.</note> hough down <hi>Bellarmine</hi> even now.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another time Preaching on the day of Judgment, he told them, <q>Sirs, this will be a terrible day, we'll all be there, and in the
throng I <hi>John Simple</hi> will be, and all of you will ſtand at my back;
Chriſt will look to me, and he will ſay, Who is that ſtanding there?
I'll ſay again, yea even as ye<note n="*" place="margin">Knew not.</note> ken'd not Lord: he'll ſay, I know
thou's honeſt <hi>John Simple;</hi> draw near, <hi>John;</hi> now <hi>John,</hi> what good
ſervice have you done to me on Earth? I have brought hither a
company of Blew Bonnets for you, Lord: Blew Bonnets, <hi>John,</hi> what
is become of the brave Hats, the Silks, and the Satins, <hi>John?</hi> I'll
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62829:53"/>
tell, I know no Lord, they went a<note n="*" place="margin">A Courſe.</note> Gate of their own: Well,

            <p>This <hi>John</hi> was ordinarily called <hi>Fitch-cape</hi> and <hi>Claw-poll,</hi> becauſe
in the time of Preaching or Praying he uſed to claw his Head, and
rub his Callet. At a certain time he was called to preach in a
Neighbouring Church, and his Preface was in theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Sirs, I know what you will be ſaying among your ſelves the day,

<hi>Claw-poll, ſaid he again to me: ſo the foul thief and I</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pulled and haled.</note> tugg'd,
rugg'd, and riv'd at one another, and at laſt I got you out of his

                  </note> Clooks: Now here is the good that <hi>Fitch-cape</hi> hath done to you;
now that ye may be kept out of his Gripes, let us pray.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another, Lecturing on the firſt of <hi>Job,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Sirs, I will tell you
this Story very plainly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Devil comes to God one day, God ſaid, What now Deel, thou foul
thief, whither are you going? I am going up and down now, Lord you
have put me away from you now, I muſt even do for my ſelf now. Well,
well, Deel (<hi>ſays God</hi>) all the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> World kens that it is your fault; but do
not you know that I have an honeſt Servant they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> call <hi>Job?</hi> is not he an
honeſt Man, Deel? Sorrow to his thank, <hi>ſays the Deel,</hi> you make his
Cup ſtand full even, you make his Pot play well, but give him a<note n="*" place="margin">Sound bang.</note> cuff,
I'll hazard he'll be as ill as I am called. Go, Deel (<hi>ſays God</hi>) I'll yoke
his Honeſty with you: Fell<note n="*" place="margin">Kill.</note> his Cows, worry his Sheep, do all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
ye can, but for the very Saul of you, touch not a hair of his Tail.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Robert Blair,</hi> that famous <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Preacher at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
was very much thought of for his familiar way of Preaching. He
preached often againſt the obſervation of <hi>Chriſtmaſs;</hi> and once in
this <hi>Scotch</hi> jingle; <hi>You will ſay, Sirs, Good old</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs.</note> Youle-day; I'll tell
you, Good old Fool-day: You will ſay It is a brave Haly-day; I tell you,
it is a brave Belly-day; you will ſay, theſe are<note n="*" place="margin">Gay.</note> bonny Formalities;
but I tell you, they are bonny Fartalities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another enveighing againſt the Vanity and Gaddineſs of Women,
ſpake thus;</hi> Behold the Vanity of Women, look to them, you'll ſee, firſt
a Sattin Peticoat; lift that, there is a Tabby Petticoat; lift that, there
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62829:54"/>
is a Flanning Petticoat; lift that, there is a Holland<note n="†" place="margin">Smock.</note> Smarck; lift that
and there you will ſee what they ought not to be proud of, that's no very

but Fig-leaves.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Simple</hi> (whom I named before) told, <hi>That</hi> Samſon <hi>was the

            </p>
            <p>I have a Sermon of theirs, written from the Preachers Mouth by
one of their own Zealots, whereof this is one paſſage, <q>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to wreſtle with God, an able hand forſooth; I Sirs, but he had
a good Second, that was <hi>Faith; Faith</hi> and God gave two or three
touſles together; at laſt God<note n="*" place="margin">Beats.</note> Dings down Faith on its bottom;
<hi>Faith</hi> gets up to his Heels, and ſays, Well, God, is this your
Promiſe to me? I trow I have a Ticket in my Pocket here; <hi>Faith</hi>
brings out the Ticket, and ſtops it in God's hand, and ſaid, Now
God! is not this your own Write? deny your own Hand-write if
you dare? Are theſe the Promiſes? you gave me? Look how you
guide me when I come to you. God reads the Ticket, and ſaid,
Well, well, <hi>Faith,</hi> I remember I gave you ſuch a Promiſe, good
ſooth <hi>Faith,</hi> if you had been another, thou ſhould get all the Bones
in thy Skin broken.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Welſh,</hi> a Man of great eſteem among their Vulgar, once
preaching on theſe words of <hi>Joſhua, As for me and my Houſe we will
ſerve the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. had this Preface:</p>
            <p>
               <q>You think, Sirs, that I am come here to preach the old jock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trot
Faith and Repentance to you; not I, indeed: what think
you then I am come to preach? I come to preach a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Covenant, Who brake it? Even the Devils Lairds, his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and his Curates; and the Deel, Deel, will get them all
at laſt: I know ſome of you are come out of Curioſity to hear
what the Whigs will ſay. Who is a Whig, Sirs? One that will
not Swear, nor Curſe, nor Bann, there a Whig to you: But you
are welcome, Sirs, that come out of Curioſity; you may get go
e're ye good back again. I'll give you an Inſtance of it, There was
<hi>Zaccheus,</hi> a Man of a low ſtature; that is, a little<note n="*" place="margin">Dwarfie.</note> droichy body,
and a Publican; that is, he was one of the Exciſe-men; he
went out of Curioſity to ſee Chriſt, and becauſe he was little, he
went up a Tree: Do you think, Sirs, he went to<note n="*" place="margin">Rifle a Magpies-Nest.</note> harry a Pyet's
Neſt? No, he went to ſee Chriſt; Chriſt looks up, and ſays,
<hi>Zaccheus,</hi> thou'rt always proving pratticks, thou'rt no Bairn
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62829:54"/>
now; go home, go home, and make ready my Dinner; I'll be
with you this day at Noon. After that, Sirs, this little <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
began to ſay his Prayers Evening and Morning, as honeſt
old <hi>Joſhua</hi> did in my Text: <hi>As for me and my Houſe,</hi> &amp;c. as if he
had ſaid, Go you to the Devil and you will, and I and my Houſe
will ſay our Prayers, Sirs, as <hi>Zaccheus</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles
did.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another time preaching in <hi>Eaſt Lotham,</hi> he told them the great
danger of hearing the Curates, in theſe words;</p>
            <p>Sirs, if ever you hear theſe Rogues, you will cry out at the day of
Judgment, <hi>O</hi> Arthur-ſeat <hi>fall upon us, O</hi> Pentland. Hills <hi>fall upon
us:</hi> The Graſs and the Corn that you ſee growing there, will be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
againſt you; yea, and that Cows Horns Paſſing by, will be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
againſt you.</p>
            <p>Another Preaching about God's ſending <hi>Jonah</hi> to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> acted
it thus, did you never hear tell of a good God, and a<note n="*" place="margin">Pettiſh.</note> cappet
Prophet, <hi>Sirs?</hi> The good God ſaid, <hi>Jonah,</hi> now billy <hi>Jonah,</hi> wilt
thou go to <hi>Nineveh</hi> for<note n="†" place="margin">Old kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> ald lang ſyne; The Deel be on my feet
then ſaid <hi>Jonah:</hi> O <hi>Jonah</hi> ſaid the good God, be not ill natured, they
are my people. What care I for you or your people either, ſaid the
cappet Prophet; wherefore ſhall I go to be made a lyar in my face,
I know thou will have mercy on that people: Alas, alas, we<note n="†" place="margin">Wait not.</note> bide
not the tenth part of that bidding; yet when we come to you, I fear
we'l find you like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> a Cake unturn'd, that is, it's ſtonehard
on one ſide<note n="*" place="margin">Intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>, and<note n="‖" place="margin">Thin Dung of young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> skitter-raw on the other.</p>
            <p>Another Preaching in the Weſt, near a Mountain called <hi>Tineock,</hi>
cried out in a loud voice thus, What think you, <hi>Sirs,</hi> would the
Curates do with Chriſt if they had him? they would e'en take him
up to <hi>Tintock</hi> top, cut off his head, and hurle his head down the hill,
and laugh at it.</p>
            <p>Another in the South of <hi>Teviotdale</hi> in his Sermon ſaid, Our
Neighbour Nation will ſay of us, poor <hi>Scotland,</hi> beggarly <hi>Scotland,</hi>
ſcabbed <hi>Scotland,</hi> louſie <hi>Scotland,</hi> yea, but Covenanted <hi>Scotland,</hi> that
makes amends for all.</p>
            <p>One Preaching againſt Biſhops, expreſſed himſelf thus, <hi>Sirs,</hi> at the
day of Judgment Chriſt will call the Prelates, and he will call one of
the falſeſt Knaves firſt, and ſay, Come hither, Sirrah, he will not call
my Lord, do you remember how you put out<note n="†" place="margin">Such.</note> ſike a ſweet Saint of
mine upon ſuch and ſuch a day? Sirrah, do you mind how you perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one of my precious Saints that was Preaching my Word: Come,
come, Sirrah, ſtand there at my left hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou and the Devil ſhall
together even now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:62829:55"/>
There is nothing more ordinary among the Generality of their
Preachers, than to tell that Chriſt did not ſet his foot in <hi>Scotland</hi> this
eight and twenty years; or this, I brought a ſtranger to you now,
and a very great ſtranger indeed, this many a year; would you
know who it is; it is Chriſt, Sirs,<note n="†" place="margin">Hold.</note> hadd him faſt then, for if
once he get out of <hi>Scotland</hi> again, it's like he'l never return.</p>
            <p>It is very well known in <hi>Perthſhire,</hi> that one of their Rabbies
Preaching a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ye who is amongſt you the day? even the meikle horned Devil, tho
you cannot ſee him, yet I do: I ſee him, Sirs, by the eye of faith;
but you'l ſay, now that we have him here, what ſhall we do with him,
Sirs, (<hi>Humph</hi>) what way will ye deſtroy him, ſome of you will ſay we
will hang him; ha, ha, my beloved, there are not ſo many tows in all
the Pariſh as hung him; beſides, he's as light as a feather. What then
will ye do with him? for he will not hang. Then ſome of you
will ſay, we will drown him. (Humph) my beloved, there is too
much cork in his Arſe, he's as ſouple as an Eel, he will not ſink. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of you will ſay we will burn him, Na, na, Sirs, ye may ſcald
your ſelves, but ye cannot burn him, for all the fire in Hell could
never yet ſinge a hair on his tail. Now, Sirs, you cannot find a way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you all to kill him, but I will find it; what way will this be, Sirs?
we ſhall even ſhoot him. Wherewith ſhall we ſhoot him? We ſhall
ſhoot him with the Bible. Now, Sirs, I ſhall ſhoot him preſently, ſo
(preſenting the Bible as Soldiers do their Muſquet) he crys out, <hi>Touff,

here to day, I miſs Chriſt here the day, but he promiſed to be here
the day, I think he will be as good as his word: however I will go
out and ſee if he be coming; he at this went out of the Pulpit; and
ſtaying out ſome little time, he comes in and tells them, Now, Sirs,
Chriſt is coming, I ſaw him on his white Horſe coming to you:

In the <hi>Mers</hi> there was a Communion given lately, and as it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
there is a Diſcourſe for every Table, one of the Preachers
that's moſt cried up for his Eloquence, ſaid, You that are Wives ye
will be ſaying ordinarily when ye meet, Cummer, have ye ſpun your
Yarn yet? But alas, I fear there are few of you that have ſpun a
Wedding-garment for Chriſt the day. But Chriſt will be among
you and ſee who is his well busked Bride, he'l ſay to them that have

            <p>It is ordinary among ſome Plebeians in the South of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to

It is the Devil be in the houſe; that's the meaning of its <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Original.</p>
            <p>Another time he told his Hearers what an Idolatrous Church the

It tells how our bleſſed Saviour was reform'd like an Angel of Light, when
his Diſciples ſaw that Glorious ſight, they were all like a Country man that
had never taſted outlandiſh wine before, the wine runs up into his head, and
makes him dizzie; ſo the Diſciples were dizzie, the 17. v. <hi>They knew
not what they ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>t</hi> that is they were dizzie. From the words we learn
this note of Doctrine, That Chriſt he is lovely, O he is lovely, O he is
lovely. Firſt as he is the Son of God, 8. <hi>Prov.</hi> v. 15. <hi>By me Kings reign
and princes decree juſtice:</hi> That is lovely Chriſt hath authority over all
the Kings of the world: The Great <hi>Turk</hi> can do nothing without him. The
meikle Deel and the black Pape can do nothing without him. There were a
pack of Deels limbs a year or two ago here, and they thought forſooth all

is like to diſappoint them all, and who kens but they'l come begging Peaſe

            <p>Chriſt is lovely as he is Mediator, cut him all in pieces from head to

preached in the Pariſh of</hi> Smallum <hi>in</hi> Teviotdale,

no harm, <hi>ſaid,</hi> The Kings and the great folks, and the curſed Biſhops,
for ſooth were ſeeking to deſtroy God's own people, but as ſturk as they were, God
is ſtarker, and bad them bide back, bide back, (<hi>pointing with his finger</hi>)
this is my folk, they are none of your folks, and ſo God keeped his own poor
people, Sirs, except ſome few that were hanged; but Oh Sirs, it's a ſweet, ſweet
denth to go off the Gallows to God for the holy Covenant. But for theſe curſed
Biſhops and Curates, Sirs, that were leading many poor ſouls to Hell this long

            <p>Mr. <hi>Areskine</hi> in the <hi>Trone</hi>-Church propoſed in a Sermon, <hi>What is the

the new man.</hi> Mr. <hi>Kirton</hi> lately in the Church he poſſeſſes at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>

of Pulpit; but what if the Devil ſhould tuke many of you when ye utter ſuch
Language?</hi> Another time preaching againſt <hi>Cockupps,</hi> he told, <hi>I have

            <p>Another <hi>Sunday,</hi> before ſeveral Gentlemen, who told me the Story ſo

may have a good Stock, but he cannot get in out of his Friends hands

            <p>Once in the monthly Faſt-day, I heard him my ſelf diſcourſe to this

to theſe words, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I ſhall ſhew you five loſt Labours, three
Opportunities, three Fears, three Woes, three Lamentations, three

firſt is a great fear, and that is, leſt this King give us not all our Will.
The 2d. is a very great fear, and that is, if we ſhould get all our Will.
I fear we ſhould not make good uſe of it. The 3d fear is the greateſt
of all, but I muſt not tell you that fear, Sirs, for fear it ſhould fear
you all to hear it.</q> All the Town knows that this is true, and that he

you'll may be, ask me how <hi>Joſhua</hi> could make the Sun to ſtand ſtill? To that I
anſwer, it was by ſiſting of the motion of <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> commonly called the

            <p>Mr. <hi>Kirkton</hi> in October laſt, preaching on Hymns and Spiritual Songs,

Gillichrankie, <hi>and the King enjoys his own again;</hi> againſt which I have
not much to ſay. 3ly. Allowable Songs, like, <hi>Once I lay with another
man's Wife:</hi> Ye may be allowed, Sirs, to ſing this, but I do not ſay,
that ye are allowed to do this, for that's a great deal of danger indeed,
Laſtly, Spiritual Songs, which are the Pſalms of <hi>David;</hi> but the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

you may think it was a ſtrange thing, and ſo indeed it was, Sirs, but it was

there, and therefore, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> it does not belong to any Earthly
King, Prince, or Potentate to determine who ſhould be Officers in
God's Houſe, or to preſcribe Terms of Communion to his Kirk:</q> On
the 2d Verſe he ſaid, <q>That it was neceſſary for God's People to walk
uprightly; that is, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> never to betray the Cauſe of Chriſt's Kirk
for ſear of great Men: Our way is God's own way; and ſure to ſtand
ſtiff to that, is the beſt way to pleaſe God, and even great Men, at the
long run:</q> On the 3d Verſe he appealed to the Conſciences of his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<q>If <hi>Scots Presbyterians</hi> were not a holy, harmleſs, innocent, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
modeſt, and moderate People, and whatever is ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
but Lybels, Lies, and Slanders: On the 4th Verſe he ſaid,
That the Prelates, Curates, and Malignant Counſellors are the vile
perſons ſpoke of there, and whom all the fear God are bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
and deſpiſe; eſpecially (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) becauſe they have ſworn to
the hurt of the Kirk, in taking the Oaths of Allegiance and Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
the Teſt, and the Oath of Canonical Obedience, and now think
to expiate all this, by ſubſcribing a bare fooliſh <hi>Formula,</hi> becauſe King
<hi>William,</hi> forſooth, has ſent it to us; as if the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

the Dragon and his Angels:</hi> 
               <q>Michael <hi>and his Angels,</hi> why no good

Kirk; and by the <hi>Dragon and his Angels</hi> is plainly meant, the Prelates
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62829:60"/>
and Curates: You ſee from this then, Sirs, betwixt whom this War and this Fighting
was in Heaven; and ſince they fight in Heaven for this Cauſe of the Kirk, why ſhould
not we fight for it alſo upon Earth? What needs our Kirk be affraid of Kings, they are
but men? but we have Chriſt to fight for us, and we are his, his Angels, and muſt
fight with him till we deſtroy the Dragon Prelates,</q> and their Curate Angels.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah, Sirs, ye read (<hi>ſays he</hi>) that this Dragon's Tail ſwept down a third part of the

            <head>SECT. IV. Containing ſome few Expreſſions of the Presbyterian Prayers.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>James Kirkton</hi> ſaid once in his Prayers, <q>O Lord reſtore our baniſhed King,
Lord reſtore our baniſhed King; do not miſtake my meaning, Lord, it is not K.
<hi>James</hi> whom thou haſt rejected that we ſeek; it is King Chriſt, that has been a ſtranger
theſe many years in poor <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </q> It is reported of Mr. <hi>Robert Blair</hi> at St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
that he had this expreſſion in his Prayers, <q>Lord, thou art a good Gooſe, for
thou art ſtill dropping. And ſeverals in the Meeting-houſes, of late, have made uſe of
it;</q> to which they add, <q>Lord thou rains down<note n="*" place="margin">Dunghils.</note> middings of bleſſings upon us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> a Phanatick Preacher in <hi>Perthſhire,</hi> in a Prayer, ſaid, <q>Good Lord, it is
told us, That thou knows a proud man by his looks, as well as a malignant by his works;
but what tilt thou do with theſe malignants? I'll tell thee, Lord, what thou wilt do,
Even take them up by the heels and<note n="*" place="margin">Smoke.</note> reeſt them in the Chimney of Hell, and dry them
like Bervy Haddocks: Lord take the Piſtol of thy Vengeance, and the Mortar-piece of
thy Wrath, and make the<note n="*" place="margin">Brains.</note> hairns of theſe malignants a hodge podge, but for thy own
Bairns, Lord feed them with the<note n="*" place="margin">Pruins.</note> Plumdames and Raiſons of thy Promiſes, and e'en give
them the Spurs of Confidence, and Boots of Hope, that like new<note n="*" place="margin">Weaned.</note> ſpean'd fillies, they

            </p>
            <p>A learned Divine of that Sett, at <hi>Pitſligo,</hi> in his publick Prayer, this laſt Summer, ſaid,
<hi>O Lord, thou'rt like a</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>William Moncrif</hi> (whom I named before, <hi>pag.</hi>—.) after his Sermon is Summer
laſt, at <hi>Largo</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> in the Interceſſion of his Prayer, ſaid, <q>O God eſtabliſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
thy Church in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and defend her from her bloody and cruel Enemies Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and Prelacy; O Lord proſper thy reformed Churches of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi>

               </q> and ſweet, good Lord, finally begin and carry on a work in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Shields</hi> preaching near <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> in his Prayer for K <hi>William,</hi> ſaid, <q>Good Lord
bleſs him with a ſtated oppoſition in his Heart to the Antichriſtian Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and with Grace to deſtroy all the Idolatry and Superſtition of their fooliſh and foppiſh
Worſhip; and bleſs all the people of the Land with Strength, Zeal, and Courage through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to reform the State as well as the Church, in theſe Kingdoms; that they may be
untied in the Bond of the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> and purified according to that
pattern in the Mount,</q> which we and our Poſterity are all ſworn to.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Welſh</hi> pray'd. <q>Lord we are come hither, a pack of poor Beggers of us the
day, alms to the poor blind here, for God's ſake, that never ſaw the light of the
Goſpel; alms to the poor deaf here, that never heard the joyful ſound; to the poor
Cripples that have their Legs, the Covenant broken by the Biſhops. Lord pity thy
poor Kirk the day, poor Woman, ſad is ſhe; Lord lend her a lift, and God confound
that filthy bitch,</q> that Gumgal'd Whore, the Whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Mr. <hi>Huſtone</hi> ſaid, <q>Lord give us Grace, for if theu give us not Grace we ſhall not

               <q>Lord, when thou was electing to Eternity, grant, that we have not
got a wrong caſt of thy hand to our Souls.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another time praying at <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> he ſaid, <q>Lord confound the Tyrant of <hi>France,</hi>
God's Vengeance light on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Vengeance of God light on him, God's Vengeance
light on him: but if he be of the Election of Grace, Lord ſave him: Lord confound the

As for the crew of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that's gone in to fight againſt them, they are
as profane a crew as themſelves, Lord; but thou can make one man deſtroy another for
the Intereſt of the people of God, and to give Gods people Elbow-room in the Land.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One who is now a Head of a Colledge, and is look't upon by the party as their great
Advocate and Oracle, in a publick Congregation at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> 1690<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his Prayer had
theſe words, which one that heard them, and immediately committed them to Writing,
ſhewed to me; <q>O Lord give us, give us, good Lord; but Lord, you'll may be ſay to
us, Ye are always troubling me, what ſhall I give you now? but, Lord, whatever thou
ſays, we know that thou in thy hart likes ſuch trouble; and now I'll tell thee what
thou ſhould give us Lord, I'll not be greedy nor<note n="*" place="margin">Ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered.</note> miſleard now, Lord, then only give
us thy ſelf <hi>in earneſt of better things.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Good Lord, what have ye been doing all this time, where have you been this 30 year,
What good have ye done to your poor Kirk in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that has been ſo many years
ſpurgal'd with Antichriſt's riding her; ſhe has been long lying on her back, and ſadly
defiled; and many a good lift have we lent her; O, how often have we put our Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to Chriſts Cauſe, when his own<note n="*" place="margin">When he could not ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter.</note> back was at the Wall: to be free with you,
Lord, we have done many things for thee that never enter'd in thy noddle, and yet we
are content that thou take all the glory; is not that fair and kind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It's true, good Lord, you have done<note n="*" place="margin">Pretty.</note> gelly well for <hi>Scotland</hi> now at laſt, and we hope
that thou haſt begun, and will carry ony thy work in <hi>England,</hi> that ſtands<note n="*" place="margin">Much in need.</note> muckle in

(then pointing with his Finger to his Noſe, he ſaid) <q>I true, I have nickt you there, Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>O God, thou haſt bidden us pray for Kings, and yet they have been always very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
to thy Kirk, and very<note n="*" place="margin">Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</note> faſious Company; Lord, either make them good or
elſe make us quite of their Company: They ſay that this new King thou haſt ſent us,
takes the Sacrament kneeling, and from the hand of a Biſhop; ah, that's black, that's
fowl work; Lord deliver him from Papary and Prelacy, from a <hi>Dutch</hi> Conſcience, and
from the hardheartedneſs of the <hi>Stewarts,</hi> and let us never be<note n="*" place="margin">Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</note> 
                  <hi>tryſted</hi> again with the
bag and baggage of the Family, the black band of Biſhops to trouble and lord it over
thy Church and Heritage. Good Lord, ſend back our old King of poor <hi>Scotland,</hi> reſtore
him to his Throne and Dignity, to his abſolute Power and Superemacy, from which he
he hat been ſo long and ſo unjuſtly baniſhed: Lord, you ken what King I mean, I do
not mean K. <hi>James,</hi> na forſooth, I do no mean him, I mean, Lord, you ken well enough
wha I mean, I mean ſweet K. Jeſus, that's been long kept out of this his own Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Kingdom,</q> by the Biſhops and Godleſs Act of Supremacy.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Lord I have many more tales to tell you, and many ſad complaint to make of our
Governors and great men, and of the malignants and <hi>Dundee's</hi> men; and many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
to ask for a broken Covenant and a backſliding Miniſtry, but I muſt refer them
all till you and I be at more leiſure, and I will not end without that old muſty Prayer
that they now call our Lords.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Robert Kenedy,</hi> Brother to the very learned and moderate <hi>Hugh Kenedy,</hi> the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
of the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> once praying at a Conventicle at <hi>Chidſdale,</hi> ſaid, <q>Lord
grant that all the Kings in the World may fall down before thy Son, and kiſs his Soles

            <p>Mr. <hi>Boyd,</hi> the famous Preacher in <hi>Chidſdale,</hi> finding in the Forenoon, that ſeverals of his
Hearers went away after the Forenoon Sermon, had this expreſſion in his Afternoon
Prayers. <q>Now Lord, thou ſees that many People go away from hearing thy word, but
had we told them Stories of <hi>Robin Hood</hi> or <hi>Davie Lindſay,</hi> they had ſtay'd; and yet none
of theſe are near ſo good as thy Word that I Preach.</q> Another praying againſt Church
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62829:61"/>
Government by Biſhops and Curates, ſaid, <q>Lord, will thou take the Keys of thy own
Houſe out of the hand of thoſe thieves and hirelings, and make them play clitter clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon their Crowns till they cry <hi>Maw</hi> again—(<hi>he pronounced the word</hi> Maw <hi>like the
noiſe of a Cat</hi>) for thy locks have got many a wrong caſt ſince they had the Keys.</q>
            </p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>March</hi> 1689 one prayed for a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Election of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to the Parliament in the City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in theſe words: <q>Good God now when
Chriſt's back is at the wall, put it in the heart of the Townſmen to chuſe <hi>George Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
and <hi>Baillif Hall.</hi>
               </q> Another prayed, <q>Lord thou haſt ſaid, that he is worſe than an
Inſidel that provides not for his own Family; Give us not reaſon to ſay this of thee
Lord, for we are thine own family, and yet we have been but ſcurvily provided for of
a long time.</q> Another praying after the Baptiſm of a Child in the City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
ſaid, <q>Lord bleſs and preſerve this young Calf that he may grow an ox to draw in
Chriſt's Plough.</q> Mr. <hi>Areskine</hi> praying in the <hi>Tron</hi>-Church laſt year, ſaid, <q>Lord have
mercy on all Fools and Idiots,</q> and particularly on the Magiſtrates of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Imprecating (as is very ordinary with them to do) ſaid, <q>Lord give thy
enemies the Papiſts and the Prelates a full cup of thy fury to drink; and if they refuſe
to drink it off,</q> then good Lord give them<note n="*" place="margin">Another Cup full of it.</note> 
               <hi>Kelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Dickson</hi> praying for Grace, ſaid, <q>Lord dibble thou the kail-ſeed of
thy Grace in our hearts, and if we grow not up to good kail, Lord make us good
Sprouts, at leaſt.</q> Mr. <hi>Linning</hi> curſing the King or <hi>France</hi> in his Prayers, ſaid, <q>Lord,
curſe him, confound him, and damn him, dreſs him, and guide him as thou didſt
<hi>Pharaoh, Senacherib,</hi> and our late King <hi>James</hi> and his Father.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>Frazer</hi> a young Fellow Preaching in <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> after Sermon blaſphemouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the Bleſſing thus, <q>The Curſe of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of God the Father,
and the Holy Ghoſt be upon all them that hear the Word and profit not by it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Arskine</hi> in the <hi>Tron</hi>-Church prayed, <q>Lord be thou in <hi>Mons, Mons, Mons,</hi> be thou in
<hi>Mons,</hi> good Lord, meikle need has <hi>Mons</hi> of thee, Lord, for now they that be Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
we hope they may be made Covenanters. Bring the ſworn enemy of the Solemn
League the Tyrant of <hi>France</hi> to the place whence he came, and cauſe his Dragons
ſhoot him in his Retreat, that he may cry out with <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, <hi>Now Galilean
thou haſt overcome me.</hi>
               </q> One Mr. <hi>James Webſter</hi> was admired lately at my Lord <hi>Arbuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
his zealous Patron's Table for this Grace before Meat, <q>Out of the boundleſs, bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,

feaſted,</q> fatted, and half an hours Diſcourſe to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Kennedy</hi> before the late Aſſembly in which he had the name of Moderator; ſaid
in his Prayer, <q>Lord, Moderation is commended to us by the King, we all know it's a
Vertue thats ſometimes is uſeful. Lord, but I cannot ſay that that which they call Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration
is ſo convenient at this time for thy People and Cauſe, for even to be free
with you, Good Lord, I think it beſt to make a clean Houſe, by ſweeping them all
out at the door,</q> and caſting them out to the<note n="*" place="margin">Dunghill.</note> 
               <hi>Midden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their famous <hi>Scrib Rule</hi> in a Prayer, not at Sermon, but upon another occaſion as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
a little after the diſſolution of the General Aſſembly, expreſſed himſelf thus, <q>O
Lord thou knows that Chriſt's Court the General Aſſembly ought to proteſt againſt
Uſurpers upon Chriſts Kingdom, but if we had known that King <hi>William</hi> would have
been angry with us in earneſt, and if the Brethren would have followed my advice,
we ſhould have pleaſed the King for this time, and taken Chriſt in our own hand<note n="*" place="margin">Run a Tick with him.</note> till
ſome other opportunity.</q> The Moderator <hi>Chrighton</hi> immediately after the Aſſembly
was diſſolved, praying, (amongſt many other reflexions upon the King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors)
ſaid theſe words, <q>O Lord thou knows how great a Surprizal this is to us, we
lookt upon King <hi>William</hi> at his firſt coming among us to have been ſent in mercy for
deliverance to this poor Kirk, but now we ſee that our Deliverance muſt come from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
hand,</q> Good God grant that he be not ſent to be a plague and a curſe to thy Kirk.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hind let looſe by Mr.</hi> Shields, <hi>pag.</hi> 468. <q>I conclude this Head, <hi>ſays he,</hi> with that Form of
Prayer that I uſe for the King,</q> 
               <hi>
                  <q>O Lord to whom vengeance belongeth ſhew thy ſelf, lift up
thy ſelf thou Judge of the Earth, render a reward to the proud: Lord, how long ſhall the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62829:62"/>
wicked, how long ſhall the wicked triumph, ſhall the Throne of iniquity have fellowſhip with
thee, that frameth miſchief by a law, the mighty and terrible God deſtroy all Kings and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that put their hand to alter and deſtroy the Houſe of God; overturn, overturn, overturn this
Throne of Tyranny,</q> and let it be no more until he come whoſe right it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are but a few of many thouſand inſtances that might be given of that ridiculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
profanity and blaſphemy which the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterians daily uſe in their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Praying; and tho Strangers may think it incredible that men profeſſing Religion
or Reaſon, ſhould thus debaſe and proſtitute both, yet they who are unfortunately bound
to converſe with, and hear them frequently, cannot be but ſadly ſenſible that all that's
here charged upon them is but too true, and that many of the worſt expreſſions they
are daily guilty of, are purpoſely here omitted, leſt by ſuch obſcene, Godleſs, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſtuff, the ears and eyes of modeſt Readers ſhould be nauſeated and polluted; which
if theſe oppoſers of Truth and Religion ſhould deny, there are thouſands in <hi>Scotland</hi> of
the beſt quality and reputation ready to atteſt, by their Oaths and Subſcriptions, as ſhall
be made appear in a <hi>2d</hi> Edition of this Book, if the clamors of the Party extort it, and
very many are willing to join in this who were not long ago their great friends, and have
many of their Sermons and Prayers in writing, which they are now willing to expoſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fully diſcovered the vile hypocriſie and Pharaſaick profeſſions of that Faction; but
this trouble we can hardly ſuppoſe that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> will put us or themſelves to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it's not probable that they will deny what they ſo much glory in, <hi>viz.</hi> this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
way of Preaching and Praying, which they think an excellency and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and call it a holy familiarity with God, &amp; a peculiar priviledg of the moſt refined Saints.</p>
            <p>Some may perhaps think this Collection was publiſh'd meerly to render theſe Puritans
ridiculous; but it's plain enough to ſuch as know them, that we have not made but found
them ſo, we hope that our diſcovering their ſnares may prevent ſome mens being intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
with them, they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> compaſs Sea and Land, and are fully as zealous as their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours

Collectors of theſe Notes, was that they might ſtand like Beacons to fright unwary Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
from theſe Rocks upon which ſo many have formerly made ſhipwrack both of faith
