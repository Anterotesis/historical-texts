         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Calling I have entred into, and the capacity wherein I have the honor to serve your Lordship, wil (I fear) offend the weak ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of some, who think these deep searches into reason, mis-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Preacher of Faith, and the contemplation of the works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very impedimentall (if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive) to the work of Grace; And give them occasion to censure me for dealing so far with Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
<pb facs="tcp:113554:3"/>
Yet somewhat I have to plead in excuse of my self; supposing what I do, to be a crime: And more I have to plead in defence of my self, that what I do is no crime at all. The smallness of the work, together with its being written, before I put my hand to the plough, is enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me, and extenuare the crime; were it indeed, what it is onely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be. But seeing the fortress is defensible, it can be held for no less then cowardice to capitulate. It would not a little disparage a good cause to seek to excuse that, which may be justified; especially since it hath so learned and solid a Lawyer, as the Lord Chancellor <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> to plead in its behalfe. <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia Naturalis</hi> (saith that eloquent Wit) <hi>Post Uerbum Dei <note place="inline">Nov.

Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philosophy, next to Gods Word is the most Soueraign Antidote to expell the poison of Superstition; and not only so, but also the most approved food to nourish Faith. And therefore well may she be given to Religion as her most faithful handmaid: seeing the one shews us the Wil of God, and the other his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer Nor was he out that said, Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God: joyning these two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Instruction touching the Will, and Meditation on the Pow er, as inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, and equally necessary.</hi> Want

Yet because I find <hi>Natures su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perseription</hi> on many (if not most) of them, (though in <hi>some</hi> it be not so legible as in others) I hold it no <hi>impiety, or robbing God of his Glory,</hi>

            <p>Besides, it is apparent by severall passages in the Book of God, that many of the Secretaries of the Holy
<pb facs="tcp:113554:5"/>
Ghost (as <hi>Moses, David, Isaiah, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> &amp;c.) had either from their own parts &amp; industry, the acquired: of from their inspirer the infused knowledge of naturall things: which they were not ashamed to make use of, even when they were about Gods great work. Nor could the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Jobs</hi> miseries make him forget orlay by thoseMathematicks, <note place="inline">10.33.31.32</note> which he had learnt in the time of his prosperity. But the example of <hi>Solomon</hi> puts the matter out of all scruple, whose divine Pen (so often serviceable to the Spirit of God) did more then divert it self with Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, writing whole Volumes of the History of Nature. For we are told, that <hi>he spake</hi> (with the tongue of his Pen) <hi>of</hi>

               <hi>Trees, from the Cedar tree, that is in Lebanon, even unto the Hysop that springeth out of the Wall. As also of</hi>

               <hi>beasts, and of fowle, and of creeping things, and of fishes.</hi> And we are told it by him, who surely would not have commended it, had he disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it.</p>
            <p>Yet not but that (as want of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy nourisheth Superstition, so) a care should be taken on the other side, least the abuse of Philosophy cause Prophaneness and <note place="inline">Col. 2. 8.</note> Atheisme, which lyes as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, as Superstition doth for him.</p>
            <p>My Lord, though all this be truth, and nothing but reason, yet so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant is prejudice, that it will not passe for such, unless besides its dead Advocate to defend it, it also have a living Patron to afford it the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his countenance &amp; protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

they may read as <hi>strange</hi> things, (<hi>and</hi> yet <hi>true</hi>) as any of those reported, or written by <hi>Travellers;</hi> and <hi>reform</hi> their <hi>Judgements</hi> into so much <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as to think, that <hi>many Travellers do not make so much use of their Authority to lye, as they might.</hi> Not that <hi>I</hi> will <hi>undertake</hi> for <hi>the truth</hi> of all the <hi>Relations</hi> in <hi>Mandevile,</hi> and other <hi>credulous Writers;</hi> but so much may be said in their <hi>behalf,</hi> that all is not as the most is; that they have many <hi>Truths</hi> interserted with their <hi>fables</hi> and <hi>falshoods,</hi> and some of them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as <hi>improbable</hi> as <hi>they</hi> Here are no stories told you of what is to be <hi>seen</hi> at the <hi>other end of the world,</hi> but of things at <hi>home,</hi> in your own <hi>Native Countrey,</hi> at your own <hi>doors,</hi> easily examinable with <hi>little travel, lesscost,</hi> and <hi>very little hazard.</hi> This book doth not shew you a <hi>Telescope,</hi> but a <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> it goes not about to put a <hi>delightful</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:113554:8"/>
               <hi>cheat</hi> upon you, with <hi>objects</hi> at' a great <hi>distance,</hi> but shews you your <hi>selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next Iintend this <hi>Book</hi> for the <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of the <hi>Gentry,</hi> that they may see <hi>England</hi> is not void of those things which they <hi>admire</hi> abroad in their <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</hi> And that those ingenious <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> whose <hi>occasions</hi> carry them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several <hi>Counties,</hi> or who are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise disposed to see the <hi>sports</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> about them, may know by this Portable-book, in what <hi>parts</hi> of what <hi>Counties</hi> to find them. As <hi>Italy</hi> hath <hi>Virgils Grott,</hi> and the <hi>Sybils Cave</hi> by <hi>Puteoli,</hi> so <hi>England</hi> hath <hi>Okey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole</hi> by <hi>Wells.</hi> We have <hi>Baiae</hi> at <hi>Bath;</hi> the <hi>Alpes</hi> in <hi>North-Wales; Mount Baldus</hi> under the <hi>Picts Wall,</hi> the <hi>Spaw</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire; Euripus</hi> at <hi>Pool</hi> in <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setshire; Gabij</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire; As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaltites</hi> at <hi>Pitchford</hi> in <hi>Shropshire; Harpasa</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> the <hi>Pyramides</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:113554:9"/>
at <hi>Burrowbriggs,</hi> the <hi>Pearls</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi> on the <hi>shores</hi> of <hi>Westmorland;</hi> the <hi>Diamonds</hi> of <hi>India</hi> on <hi>St. Vincents Rock.</hi> And what is there <hi>worth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> abroad in the <hi>world,</hi> whereof <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> hath not written a <hi>Copy</hi> in our <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> I would have those that know <hi>other</hi> Countreys so well, not to be stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to <hi>their own,</hi> which is a <hi>compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of all others.</p>
            <p>Lastly and <hi>chiefly,</hi> My end is to serve the <hi>Commonwealth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which much wants such <hi>Histories</hi> as this to be written, and laid as a sure <hi>Foundation,</hi> whereon to build those <hi>Axiomes</hi> that make us <hi>true Schollars,</hi> and <hi>knowing men</hi> in <hi>Philosophy.</hi> I have as nearly (as I could) followed the <hi>Precepts</hi> of my <hi>Master,</hi> the <hi>Lord Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> and (by way of acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from whom I received my first <hi>light</hi> into this <hi>way</hi>) have given my Book the Title of <hi>BRITANNIA BACONICA;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:113554:9"/>
and the rather, because it will serve for a part of several Histories in his <hi>Lordships Catalogue,</hi> at the end of his <hi>Novum Organon.</hi> I have not at all m'dled with matter of <hi>Antiquity, Pedigrees,</hi> or the like, those being copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously handled by several of our <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen</hi> already; as the learned <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in his <hi>Britannia,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> in his Deseription of <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> Mr. <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>Vale Royal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> in his <hi>Perambulation,</hi> Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> in his <hi>Villare Cantianum,</hi> and others. Only I ventured at the description of the <hi>Caves in Wiltshire,</hi> because I find it mentioned by none of our <hi>Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> I have here and there attempted to give the Causes of the <hi>Raritie</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, having the example of my Lord <hi>B.</hi> for my authority, who in his <hi>Sylva Sylvarum</hi> hath the like excursions ever and anon into the <hi>AEtiology.</hi> And though I cannot but confess, that such
<pb facs="tcp:113554:10"/>
kind of writing is a little too bold yet, before the <hi>Histories</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> are compleatly done; yet possibly I may in some, hit upon the true Reason by chance; and unless men were more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (then I see they are yet) in colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting such <hi>Histories,</hi> these kinds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences must be dispensed with. Indeed, had those men that have spent so much time &amp; pains in writing voluminous Comments on <hi>Arist.</hi> but labored as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently in writing Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ments upon Nature, &amp; (with that self denial and indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which becoms ingenuity in the dark) in trying to render a reason of such and such odd appearances in things, though some of them had been but false Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; doubtless the Philosophical part of Learning would have been at a much better pass, and Inquisition a great deal more happy and thriving then it is at this day. The pest of Learning is, that men first fancy Opinions and Axiomes
<pb facs="tcp:113554:10"/>
to themselves, and then by the help and art of Distinguishing, wrest and fit particular Instances and Observations to them. And this was the first original of Distinctions in the Schools, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meerly invented (like the Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Hypotheses) to salve the Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena of <hi>Aristotles</hi> oversights. And hence likewise the impregnability of Sophistry, which with its flanking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions will repel the strongest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that would prove that snow is white.</p>
            <p>There are many of the other <hi>Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> whose causes I could make bold with, and purpose so to do, so soon as I receive the censure of the <hi>Learned,</hi> on what is already done; and as they shall encourage or discourage me, I shal <hi>proceed</hi> or desist. For though I have much more to say, yet any good and faithful advice shall perswade me to hold my peace. I purpose also (if God
<pb facs="tcp:113554:11"/>
grant me <hi>life, health, and leisure</hi> to publish the <hi>Philosophical Rarities of the World,</hi> so far as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us from <hi>Geographers</hi> and <hi>Travellers,</hi> having already made a considerableprogressin the work. Which I believe will go a greater way in the <hi>advancement</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> then is yet imagined, and enable us to write <hi>more confident Comments on Nature, and to draw up such Articlesagainst her, as if she be examined upon them, she will be forced to confess much more of her subtile wayes of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senage, then She hath yet told us of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to tell my tale as plainly as might be, both that I might be understood of all, and that I might not disfigure the face of Truth by dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it over with the paint of Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. <hi>Renatus des Cartes</hi> hath told us, not without reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how bardit is either to
<pb facs="tcp:113554:11"/>
tell what we have seen, or what we have heard, or to understand a related story exactly, according to the Relatours sence. So much difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween seeing and speaking, and between hearing and apprehending. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in those Rarities which I have not seen my self, I have followed my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors close at the heels(word for word) it may be (and I have cause to fear it) with so much rigidness &amp; nicety (with some triviall things here and there) in some places as will sound harsh andun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to the Readers ear: yet not with more rigidness then for the reason above given is necessary. For such ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as we are to examine nature upon, had need to be so punctually true, that they cannot be too true If there be but the least matter of doubt or uncertainly in them, she will easily evade them and fool us. And I am perswaded that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of those relations I have given
<pb facs="tcp:113554:12"/>
you from the Authors I speak of, though they sincerely intended them for truth (and I have as sincerely translated and transeribed them) yet they are not truth to us by reason of our misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing them: And that if the places and things themselves were visited. they would tell us as much, and appear different from what they are said to be And peradventure by examining the particulars of them, we should find some one that would discover, or give a light into the cause of them; whereas some relations not being particular enough, leave us much unsatisfied, and make us think the causes of them much more strange and darke then they are. This I speak to provoke young Gentlemen to look and search into these pleasant Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations morethen heretoforethey have done, andto visit each his neighbour cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities, and to bestow upon the Manes of this Lord <hi>VERULAM</hi> that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall

History of them, that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for his great work, The interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature.</p>
            <p>That I have one or two reflections on Astrology, I hope the Reader wil pardon me. I may say with the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Clarencieux</hi> that I have not been altogether unacquainted with those vanities. I cannot but profess, that I have an affection for the study; &amp; why I should not have so, I know not. The onely argument that I know against the lawfulness of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strology, is that it is not true. Were it rectified, it might easily be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now that is partly my aim in those reflections I mention: to lay a foundation for the rectifying it in the Doctrine of Ascendents, and for redeeming it from that obloquy which it hath for so many ages of the world been obnoxious to. That there is such a Science as Astrology,
<pb facs="tcp:113554:13"/>
there is no question to be made. The stars have an influence on us, and some small matter touching this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence Astrology knows; yet no more, and of no more use, then to assure her that she doth know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it. But her vanity is, she promiseth much more then she is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perform: and is led much more by fancy &amp; plausibilities, then found reason. I could wish, that to <hi>Multae praedicuntur, quae non eveniunt: multa eveniunt, quae non praedicuntur,</hi> she had some other answer then <hi>Pudet haec opprobria nobis, &amp;c.</hi> And to let her know I wish it hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, I shal make it part of my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to furnish her with an answer. There is much to be found out, if men did but well attend to obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and doubt even the very Principles of Astrology, til they had examined the truth of them. For the
<pb facs="tcp:113554:13"/>
most important maximes in the Art are many of them shrewdly to bee suspected, though there may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure an instance or two al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to their advantage, wherein they have hit passing well: because in Astrology (above most, if not all other pieces of learning) it is very easie to mistake a <hi>Non-cause</hi> for a true cause. and a <hi>Me ambulante coru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scavit,</hi> for a <hi>Sol oritur, ergo dies est.</hi> The way to go forward in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Art, is to look back and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the accidents of men and States, with the influences of heaven, and this wil not only try the truth of the old Principles, but adde new ones: such (it is very likely) as the sons of Art do not yet dream of. Which I have very great reason to say: and yet what that great reason is, I desire at present to be excused
<pb facs="tcp:113554:14"/>
from saying, because it cannot bee said without Ostentation.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude my complements to the Reader with two requests; one, that he will not make any hast to pass the sentence of condemnation against me for setting down severall idle, empty, and useless things (as he may possibly imagine them to be) till he hath read the sixth Aphorisme of the Lord <hi>Bacons Pa<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>asceue;</hi> The other, that if his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive County afford any other Rarity then what is related in this Book, he will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to communicate it for the sake of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, (For its possible, I have not made the Meshes of my net so narrow, but that some of the small try of curiosities have escaped me,) And in particular, if he be of <hi>Dorset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> that he would bestow upon us a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall account of that raining of blood at <hi>Pool</hi> with all its circumstances. And so I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to the Book it self, wishing him that satisfaction from it, which he expects, and bidding him heartily</p>
            <p>FAREWELL.</p>

            <head>An occasionall Advertisement to the READER.</head>
            <p>THe READER is desired to take notice, that while this Book was in the Press, on Thursday being All Saints day, <hi>November</hi> the first, 1660. between ten of the Clock that night, and five of the Clock the next morning happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an unusuall shifting of the Tides in the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> ebbing and flowing three times(as it is reported) in that space. Which how it agrees with the time of my conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture (not to say prediction) <hi>pag. 97.</hi> of this Book, I shall leave him to judge.</p>
            <p>Further, it happened upon a Northwest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly-wind, sometimes blowing pretty fresh, and sometimes remitting in a manner to a Calme (as my Diary of observations of the weather hath it for that day and night) and the Tides were at the Neapest; both which are according to my Hypothesis. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb facs="tcp:113554:15"/>
the Moon was not in Apogaeo but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the very place of her Perigaeum; Which makes me begin to think the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeosis is not altogether so necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the business, but that the Neapness of the Tides and the wind are able to do it of themselves (assisted I mean with a private cause) so the alternate intensions and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the wind bee but proportionably greater to supply the wantof the Apogaeosis. I know many will hardly believe that that sentence of my conjecture at the time of this supposed Prodigy came fairly into the Book, but that it was foisted in out of a design of the Authours to make himself talked of, (because it is the first prediction that was ever ventured at in this nature) But I can aflure them he is not so light a regarder of his reputation, as to endanger it by a forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easily to be detected. If this profession be not of power to perswade the Authours integrity, let doubters know, he can (if it be required of him) tell when the like prodigy will happen again; and give a pre-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of some other Prodigies shortly to come. But (as in duty bound) he confesses, that (<hi>Secundum Deum</hi>) he ows all this new knowledge to the Lord <hi>Bacon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some busie <hi>Scriptorculi</hi> may perhaps go
<pb facs="tcp:113554:15"/>
about to amuse the people with strange mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters portended in the State, by this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wonder; and the rather because it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened but the night before <hi>the arrivall of his Majesties Royall Mother at London.</hi> And it is probable (to affright you the more) they wil erect a figure for the beginning of it, and tell you that Saturn and Mars the two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolents with Sol and Mercury, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the fift house in Scorpio, the worst sign of the twelve, and the house of Mars; But that they hope Venus applying to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Jupiter in her own house in the 3 not far from an Angle, will much allay the venome of their influence. But I must tell them that this strange marvell, signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; and that whatever follows it, hath no relation to it. I believe had the thing fallen out about Midsummer last, the death of three English Dukes within less then three months space could not but have been thought the correspondent of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage: whereas now (it falling just after) we are to seek for a Portent to bewaile the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of so signall a mortality.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113554:17"/>
and the Miller, (a Lubber of twenty four years of age) upon the whole. And one <hi>John Romane</hi> a thick short fellow, would carry the whole Carcase of an Ox. There was also one <hi>Kiltor,</hi> who lying in <hi>Launceston</hi> Castle-green upon his back, threw a stone of some pounds weight over the top of one of the high Towers of that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. Which stoutness and goodly stature of these people, <hi>Cambden</hi> reflecting on, makes this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; That the Western people of most coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys are the tallest and stoutest. I know not whether it hold in all Countreys; but so much is true, that the <hi>Chineses,</hi> the Eastermost people of this Continent of the World, are the most esteminate and unwarlike in the World; for which we have not only the authority of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez Pinto,</hi> (who never told lye) but of many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Geographers. However I am rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to think, that it is the Rockiness of this County that gives the generality of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants these qualities: For it is as well observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that rocky and mountainous places breed stout, hardy, warlike, and tall people, as we see by the <hi>Highlanders</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Grisons;</hi> low and flat Countreys rather dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Natives to ingenuity, craft, invention and sedentary industry, as is manifest by the <hi>Chineses</hi> and the <hi>Dutch.</hi> And it may be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are not altogether <hi>Chine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in stature, sloath, and cowardize, is because they inhabit the West side of a Continent:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cornish</hi> men are very healthful and long livers, eighty or ninety years of age is ordinary

in every place, and in most persons accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an able use of the body and sences One <hi>Polzew</hi> lived 130 years; a Kinsman of his 112. one <hi>Beauchamp</hi> 106. and one <hi>Brawn</hi> a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar above 100. and in one Parish (in Qu. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's</hi> time) there died in 14. Weeks space four people, whose years added together, made 340. And (to urge no more examples) one Mr. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> who lived at <hi>Stratton</hi> in this County, was Uncle and Great-Uncle to (at least) 300. The cause of this healthfulness I conceive to be also the rockiness and dryness of the Countrey, which though it be for the most part invironed with the sea, yet it hath few Marishes or Ouzy shores, but most sandy; and withall, the air is cleansed by often winds, lying so open to the sea: So that by reason of the purity of the air, the plague is seldom among them; and it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that in <hi>Anno</hi> 1589. when our Fleet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the <hi>Portugal</hi> action, the Diseases which the Souldiers brought home with them; grew more grievous, as they carried them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Land, then it fell out at <hi>Plymouth</hi> where they landed; For there the Disease was though infectious, yet not so infectious; and though pestilential, yet not the Pestilence, as it after proved in other places. Yet the air of <hi>Cornwall</hi> is such, that it is apter to preserve, then recover health, especially in a stranger that is troubled with a lingering sickness.</p>
               <p>There was within these hundred years, one Mr. <hi>Alwel</hi> Parson of St. <hi>Tues</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> who withall practised Physick; but so strange was his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113554:18"/>
Method (not to say his Humor) that though now and then he used blood-letting, and did administer commonly <hi>Manus Christi,</hi> and the like Cordials; yet for all Diseases he did chiefly prescribe Milk, and very often Milk and Apples; by which means he did very many strange and desperate cures, and maintained his Reputation unimpaired, so that he had many Patients from the neighboringCounties. Butwhether it wereM. <hi>Atwels</hi> Physick, or the pure air of <hi>Cornwall</hi> that did the cures, is hard to say; or whether there may not be some peculiarMedicines appropriated by Nature to some particular Airs, as well as to some particular Diseases, and that that which will do in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> or the like air, will not else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>The Spring is later in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> then in the East parts of <hi>England;</hi> the Summer temperate, but Harvest late, especially in the middle of the Shire, where they seldom get in their Corn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> The Winter is milder then elsewhere; for the frost and snow come very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and never stay long when they do come. But this Countrey is much subject to storms, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as I said) so open to the sea. so that the Hedges are pared, and their Trees dwarf-grown, and the hard stones and iron bars of Windows are fretted with the Weather. One kind of these storms they call a Flaw; (and so indeed in some Counties they call any violent storm of Wind) which is a mighty Gale of Wind, passing sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to the shore with great violence.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113554:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornwall</hi> is hilly, (one cause of the temperate heat of the Summer, and the lateness of the Harvest, even as its Maritine scituation is the cause of the gentleness of the Winter:) hilly I say, parted with short and narrow Valleys. The earth is but shallow, underneath which is rocks and shelfs, so that it is hard to be tilled, and apt to be parched by a dry summer.</p>
               <p>The middle of the shire lieth open, the earth being of a blackish colour, and bears heath and spiry grass. There is but little Meadow-ground, but store of pasture for cattel and sheep, and plenty of Corn-ground.</p>
               <p>They have a stone here, called <hi>Moore-stone,</hi> found upon Moores and wast grounds, which serves them instead of Free-stone, for Windows, Doors and Chimneys. It is white with certain glimmering sparkles: They have a stone digged out of the sea-cliffs, of the colour of grey Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and another stone black as Jett; and out of the Inland Quarries they dig Free-stone. Nor must we forget to tell you (speaking here of stones) that the sea here works the pebbles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the shore, by the often rolling of the waves, to a kind of roundness.</p>
               <p>They have a slate of three sorts, blew, sage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf-coloured, and gray, which last is the worst; and all these slates are commonly found under another kind of slate, that they wall with, when the depth hath brought the Workmen to the Water. They also make Lime of a kind of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble stone, either by burning a great quantity together with Furze, or with stone-coal in smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113554:19"/>
Kills, which is the cheaper way; but the first Lime is the whiter.</p>
               <p>For Metals, they find Copper in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces here, and the Ore is sometimes ship'd to be refined in <hi>Wales.</hi> And though <hi>Cicero</hi> will have none in <hi>Britain,</hi> yet silver hath been found in this shire in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, and <hi>Edward</hi> the third, who reaped good profit by it. Nay, Tinners do find little quantities of Gold, and sometimesSilver among the Tin Ore, which they sell to the Gold-smiths. Also Diamonds are found in many places, cleaving to those Rocks out of which the Tin is digged: they are smooth, squared, and pointed by nature. Their quantity is from a Pease to a Wall-nut; but they are not so black and hard as the right ones. But the Metal which the Earth yields in greatest plenty, is Tin, in searching after which the Tinners do many times dig up whole and huge Timber-Trees, which they think were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, and have lien buried in the earth ever since the flood. And they hold, that the Tin lay couched at the first before <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, in certain strakes among the Rocks like a Tree; from the depth whereof the main Load spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out his branches till they approach the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen air; but the Flood (say they) carried with the Rocks and Earth so much of the load, as was enclosed therein, and at the drying up of the flood, left the same scattered here and there in Valleys and Rivers where it passed; whence it comes to pass, that they finde Tin sometimes upon the Moor-Lands. In their Tin-Works they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113554:19"/>
find daily among the Rubbish, Pick-Axes of Holm, Box, and Harts-Horn, and sometimes they find certain little Tool-Heads of Brass; and there was once found a Brass Coyn of the Emperor <hi>Dometians,</hi> in one of the Works; an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the <hi>Romans</hi> wrought in these Tin-Works in times past. They discover the Tin-Mines by certain Tin-stones, which are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what round and smooth, lying on the ground, which they call shoad. But (if we will believe stories) there is another way to discover them very easie, and that is by dreams; for so it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, some have found Works of great value. As in <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt his time a Gentlewoman (heir to one <hi>Tresculierd</hi>) dreamed, that a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some man told her, that in such a Tenement of her Land she should find so much Tin, as would enrich her self and her posterity. She told her husband of it, who upon trial found a Tin-work there, which in four years was worth to him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most 4000 pounds. It is said also, that one <hi>Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi> of the parish of S. <hi>Niot,</hi> by a dream of his daughters was wished to such a place, which he farmed of the Lord of the soil, and found a Tin-Work accordingly, which made him a rich man. On which stories we may bestow this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; That if they be true, they make much for the credit of Womens Dreams. For the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries touching the success of Dreams, are not to be rejected altogether as Fables, till they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and ventilated in their peculiar Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is the 51. History in the L. <hi>Veculams</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:113554:20"/>
Catalogue being there called, <hi>Historia Somni, &amp; Insomniorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the bottom of the Tin-Works, if they be of any depth, you shall see the stars at noon-day, in clear Weather. And the like may be done from the bottom of deep Wells (as they say) or any other deep pits. Nor is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the cause being so plain. It is reported that <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> in his Isle of <hi>Huena,</hi> shewed K. <hi>James</hi> the stars in the day-time) at what time he went into <hi>Denmark</hi>) from out of a Cave cut a good way into the side of a Hill for the purpose.</p>
               <p>If the load (as they call it) of the tin lye right down, the tinners follow it sometimes to the depth of 40. or 50. fathoms, and the deeper they sink, the greater they find the Load.</p>
               <p>The labour of the tinners is so hard and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, that they cannot work above four hours in a day. And as they dig their load sloapwise under the ground, the air at length will not yeild them breathing, till they sink a shaft, (as they call it, that is a hole) perpendicular down to that place from the top, or surface of the Earth. And though (when they have so done) the light be just over their heads, yet is the Pit still so dark, that they are fain to work most by Candle-light, of which the reason is plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. In their passage under ground, they meet sometimes with very loose Earth; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with extreme hard Rock, (where though commonly they make speedyway through with their Pickaxes, yet now and then they light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such an hard piece of Rock, that a good
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113554:20"/>
Work-man will scarce be able to hew above a foot in a Week) sometimes again they meet with great streams of Water; and sometimes with stinking damps that distemper their heads for the present; but there is no great danger in the consequence.</p>
               <p>The Tin Stone being brought above ground out of the Work, is broken in pieces with ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and then stamped at a Mill into smaller pieces (and if the Stone be moist, it is dryed by the fire in an iron Cradle) and then it is ground to a fine sand. Then this sand being laid in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that runs over it, hath all the earth washed from it, and then it is called black tin, which is carried to the blowing house, where it is melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Charcole Fire, blown by a great pair of Bellows moved by a Water-wheel (the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on which bellows may be known from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men by their faces tanned and discolour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with smoke) and then it is coined. Further it is to be noted, that there is hard Tin and soft Tin; but the soft Tin is the more worth of the two: A foot of black Tin is in measure two Gallons; but the weight of it is uncertain, and is according to the goodness of it. A foot of good Moor Tin (which is held the best) will weigh about 80. pound: A foot of the Mine Tin (which is meaner) 52. pound: of the worst 50. pounds. Two pounds of good black Tin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing melted, will yield one pound of white Tin. Tin also hath been made of that refuse that the Tinners formerly have rejected, and with good profit. And so much for the Tin-Works, and for Metals.</p>

               <p>In some places on the coast of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> there are Pearls found that breed in big Oysters and Muskles, yet though they are great, they are not good, being neither round nor Orient. Here are also Agates and white Coral, as they say. <hi>It may be this white Coral may be of the same kind with Isidis Plocamos, that grows about the Isle of Portland, of which more hereafter.</hi>

               <p>About two miles Eastward from St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Mount at a low Water, they cast aside the sand on the shore, and dig up turfs that are full of Root of trees, and on some of these they have found Nuts, which seems to argue some inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sea upon this shore: I have heard the like story of a place in <hi>Scotland:</hi> I shall not defend or impugne the truth of these stories; onely this is manifest in Nature, that the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of air from preying upon bodies, preserves them much longer from putrifaction.</p>
               <p>In the West part of <hi>Cornwall</hi> there are Bents growing on sandy fields, which are knit from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the head in narrow breadths after a strange fashion, of which they make mats.</p>
               <p>In this shire grows greater store of <hi>Samphire</hi> and <hi>Sea-holly,</hi> (whose Roots commonly called, <hi>Eringo-Roots,</hi> are a great rescaurative and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borative, being preserved in <hi>Syrup</hi>) then in any other part of <hi>England.</hi> Some of the gaully grounds do also yield plenty of <hi>Rosa Solis</hi> (more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Ros Solis,</hi> a Plant that grows indeed in boggy and quagmiry grounds) Upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffs in <hi>Cornwall</hi> grow wilde <hi>Hysope, Sage, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountain, Majoram, Rosmary,</hi> and other fragrant Herbs.</p>

               <p>The Husbandmen in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> about <hi>May,</hi> cut up all the grass of that ground, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to break up and till, into turfs, which they call Beating; and raise these turfs so, that the sun and wind may dry them the sooner; and after they are throughly dryed, they pile them in little heaps, and burn them to ashes. Then they bring in Sea-sand; &amp; a little before plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, they scatter abroad those ashes, &amp; the sand heaps upon the ground, &amp; plough it in, weh giveth heat to the root of the corn: This sand makes the ground rich; and if they strow it too thick, the ground will be too rank, and choak the Corn with weeds. VVhen the ground is thus sanded and ordered, the tiller can commonly take but two crops of wheat, and two of oats, and then is fain to give it at least 7. or 8. years layer, or fallow, and to till elsewhere. But the inland Countrey requires not so much sand as the places by the sea side. The tillable fields are in some places so hilly, that the Oxen can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take sure footing: in some places so tough, that the Plough can scarce cut them; and in some places so shelfy, that the Corn can hardly fasten its roots. They have two sorts of wheat, <hi>viz. French</hi> wheat, which is bearded, and requires the best soil, and brings the best crop; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wheat not bearded, which is sown in the worser Land, and yeildeth the less crop. In those grounds that will bear no wheat, they sow Rye; yet in the western parts of <hi>Cornwall</hi> they sow Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in the parts near the sea, which they carry to the Mill within eight or nine weeks after they sowed it.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:113554:22"/>
               <p>For fruits, they have a sort called <hi>Whurts,</hi> as also <hi>Chesnuts,</hi> (but whether they ripen there, or not, mine Author saith not) and <hi>Grapes.</hi> For though the Countrey be bleak, yet Vines pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per well, and their Grapes are pleasant of taste, as in most other Southern parts of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have little wood or timber, unless in the East quarters of the Shire, where there are some Coppice woods. And hereabouts (saith mine Author) the Countrey people have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Snakes by their breathing about a hazle-wand, do make a stone-ring of blew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, in which there appeareth the yellow fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a snake; and that Beasts which are stung being given to drink some of the water wherein this stone hath been soaked, will thereby reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>It is observed, that strangers at their first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> are much visited with Lice, and yet the cleanly Natives find no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>For Beasts, here are <hi>Marternes, Badgers, Otters,</hi> (some of which, though they are all of the same kind) live in the cliffs, and there breed, and feed on sea-fish; and others live in the fresh Rivers, which sometimes also feed on Lambs and Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; <hi>Foxes</hi> (who have their holes in abundance in the steep cliffs by the sea side) <hi>Goats, Rother</hi> Cattle, <hi>Horses,</hi> (but they are but small and low) but there are no red Deer at all.</p>
               <p>Their draught Oxen have each his Name, which he knows when he is at work. VVhen <hi>Cornwall</hi> lay wast and open for want of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113554:22"/>
the sheep had generally little badies, and course wool, so that it was called <hi>Cornish</hi> hair; but since it hath been manured, their sheepe are little inferior to the Eastern Flocks for big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, fineness of wool, often breeding, speedy fatting and price, and besides are sweeter Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and freer from the rot. Most of the <hi>Cornish</hi> sheep have no horns, and those that are so, have the finer wool, and those that are horned, have indeed more in quantity, yet courser; yet in some places of <hi>Cornwall</hi> the sheepe have four horns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornish</hi> Cattel are but small.</p>
               <p>For Birds and Fowl <hi>Cornwall</hi> hath these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>viz. Woodcocks,</hi> (in abundance) <hi>Sparhawks</hi> (the most useless of <hi>Hawks,</hi> serving to flye little above six weeks in the year, and that onely at the <hi>Partridge</hi>) &amp;c. but there are no <hi>Nightingales,</hi> at least very few: A thing not to be wondred at by reason of the great scarcity of woods, (as I said) the delight of that Bird: <hi>Furzes</hi> and <hi>Broom</hi> being all that looks like woods in this countrey; of the former of which they have great, and of the latter good quantity.</p>
               <p>In the West parts of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> during the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter swallows are found sitting in old deep Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and holes of the sea cliffs.</p>
               <p>In Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time a flock of Birds came into <hi>Cornwall</hi> about Harvest, a little bigger then a Sparrow, which had bils thwarted crosswise at the end, and with these they would cut an apple in two at one snap, eating onely the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; and they made a great spoil among the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113554:23"/>
These birds are common (saith mine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) in <hi>Gloucestershire</hi> and other apple coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys. The cause of these birds rambling so far into <hi>Cornwall</hi> that year, was, I conceive, the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fruit in the fruit countreys, as in <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire,</hi> &amp;c. and its taking in <hi>Cornwall</hi> and some other parts. (For we know that it often happens, that fruit fails in one countrey, and takes in another) Which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged these Birds to seeke for their peculiar food where it was to be had. We read in our Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that at the time when field Mice did so swarm in <hi>Denge Hundred</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> in the yeare 1580. that they eat up all the roots of the grass &amp;c. a great number of Owles, of strange and various colours, assembled and devoured them all; and after they had made an end of their prey, they took their flight back again, from whence they came. The reason of which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture to be the same with the former. For that which produced these Mice in that great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, was an extream dripping warm year, and a mild and moist winter, as countrey men assure us, &amp; <hi>Keppler</hi> himself belives is the constant cause of that Vermine. Now because (though God can, yet) nature cannot extend the same extremity of weather all over the world; but (as is most probable) when there is an extremity of warmth and moisture in one countrey, there is as great an extremity of cold and drought in another (even as we see that the reason why it it flows in one Port, is because it ebbs in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the reason, I say, or at leastthe <hi>cansafine qua</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:113554:23"/>
                  <hi>non</hi>) hence it follows, that the extremity of of warmth and moisture that we had then in <hi>England,</hi> could not have been without as great an extremity of cold and drought in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countreys, which (because an enemy to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, especially to that of this Vermine) made them fail most certainly in those other countreys, whose Nature and temper is apt to produce them more constantly and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and (it may be) almost alwayes. Whence these painted Owls (strangers to us, but not to those countreys, where the abundance and constancy of food makes them daily Guests) very likely were forced by hunger to seek out food, which provident Nature had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them in other places, where their stay was no longer then till they had spent their provision, and then <hi>ad pristina praesepia.</hi> All which these flying Pilgrims might very well do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great notice how and whence they came, and whither they went, because they are birds of night, and travel onely in the dark: And I conceive the reason of several birds lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us, and returning again at set times of the year, to be much like this; either they find that food that pleaseth them here among us at some times of the year, which we have not for them at others; or (which is probable in some birds) they delight in one certain degree of heat or cold; and as they find the constant temper of the season to grow hotter or colder, they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly take their flight more Northernly or Southerly; and if the winter prove very mild,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113554:24"/>
then the Winter birds (as <hi>Fieldfares,</hi> &amp;c.) come not quite home to us, finding their due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of warmth in countreys more Northerly then we; and if the Winter prove extreme sharp, then they flye beyond us to the south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; yet taking our climate by the way, at the beginning of the sharp weather, they give a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fage to countrey people of a hard Winter by their early appearing.</p>
               <p>Every Hill almost in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> sendeth out a spring whose waters are pleasant and wholsom. That the springs should be so frequent in a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren countrey, I do not wonder; for where the vegetables are but few and small, to spend the stock of rain that falls, there must needs be the more left to soak into the earth, and make springs.</p>
               <p>And that the waters of these springs (though strained through the Tin-Mines) should be all pleasant, wholesom, not Medicinal or purgative, I conceive the cause may be for that Tin is a fast metal, and not apt to dissolve and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate its self to the water, that passeth through it, as appears also by its slow rusting. Whereas iron, which is not so fast, but more apt to rust, easily gives a Tincture to springs, (as appears by <hi>Tunbridge</hi> wells) and makes them medicinal. For fishes, they have these kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Shoate</hi> (a fish proper to <hi>Devonshire</hi> and <hi>Cornwall;</hi> it is like a <hi>Trout,</hi> but lesser, and nothing near so good as a <hi>Trout</hi>) <hi>Peale, Trout,</hi> and <hi>Salmon,</hi> (which breed in fresh water, and live in salt.) The <hi>Trout &amp; Peale</hi> come from the sea between <hi>March &amp; Midsummer,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:113554:24"/>
into the rivers to shed their Spawn. The <hi>Salmons</hi> chief coming is between <hi>Michaelmas</hi> and <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi> for till then the rivers are too shallow for them. The <hi>Salmons</hi> are fattest when they come first from the Sea: they pass up as high as any water can carry them to Spawn the more safely, and to that end take advantage of the great rain floods. And after <hi>Christmas</hi> they return to the Sea, and as the spring comes on, the young fry follow; and it hath been observed, that the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Trout,</hi> and <hi>Peale</hi> haunt the same rivers where they first were bred. The nature of the <hi>Salmon</hi> is, that if in the night he see any light, as of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or of Lightning, he will come to the top of the water, and play in and out. The <hi>Cornish-men</hi> use to take <hi>Salmons</hi> and <hi>Trouts</hi> by tickling them under the bellies, and so throwing them on the land, <hi>Sharkes</hi> (in the rivers) <hi>Lobsters, Crabbs,</hi> (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Crabbs</hi> breeding in <hi>Cockle-shells,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Lobsters</hi> in <hi>Wrinckle-shells</hi> (as my selfe have seen, saith mine Author) and being grown they come forth, and live in holes of rocks, from whence at low water they are dragged out by a long crook of Iron.) <hi>Oysters</hi>) of wch they hold that there are male &amp; female <hi>Oysters</hi> the female <hi>Oysters</hi> about <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> have in them a milk, which they then shed and whereof the <hi>Oyster</hi> is ingendred; the little ones at first cleaye in great numbers to the mothers shel, &amp; waxing bigger toward <hi>Michaelmas</hi> they fall away, and fall asunder one from another: onely here and there some are fast knit together (two, three, or more in a cluster) that nothing but violence will severe them. Some people have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113554:25"/>
a conceit, that in Summer they are all sick, (as if the males did breed their wives children) and out of season; as indeed the milky are. But some Gentlemen (saith M. <hi>Carew</hi>) have found the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by experience eating of them at all times of the year without danger. <hi>Oysters</hi> have this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that though taken out of the water, they open against the flood time, and close upon the ebbe. Yet they will close before; if they chance to be touched; whence it once hapned (saith the same Gentleman) that an <hi>Oyster</hi> lying open did by his sudden shutting catch three young mice by the heads, that were going to eat him.) <hi>Soale</hi> and <hi>Playce</hi> (both which follow the tide into the fresh rivers) <hi>Eels</hi> some whereof are bred in fresh water, and are of the best tast.

               <p>On the North side of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and to the Westward of <hi>Foy,</hi> few or no <hi>Salmons</hi> are taken. The cause whereof I think is, because there both the Seas are too unquiet for them, as commonly they are about <hi>Promontories,</hi> and the mouths of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113554:26"/>
swift rivers, such as Seavern; and because there are no rivers of any competent bigness therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, fit for them to spawn in.</p>
               <p>There swims in the Sea upon this coast a round slimy substance, called a Blobber, which is thought to be noisome and hurtfull to the fish (which I suppose is that that is very frequent in the river of Medway by <hi>Rochester,</hi> and called there a Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall.)</p>
               <p>For Sea fowl, they have these following, <hi>viz. Gulls, Pewets,</hi> and other Sea fowls, (which breed in little Islands, laying their eggs in the grass, and not building any nests; and they have young ones about <hi>Whusuntide.</hi> And here mine Author relates, that an old <hi>Gull,</hi> was known for many years together to come, and feed young <hi>Gulls</hi> kept tame in a Gentlemans yard joining to his house that bordered upon a cliff of the Sea.) <hi>Puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins</hi> (a fowle which hatcheth in holes of the Sea cliffs, and whose flesh tasteth like fish) <hi>Burranets</hi> (a fowle that hatcheth also in holes of the Sea cliffs, and when her young ones are hatched, she leads them sometimes a mile or better into the land, where they are ordinarily taken and kept tame with Ducks.</p>
               <p>There are also <hi>Sprayes</hi> here, the same fowle, that <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Haliaetos,</hi> but it is not eatable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chough</hi> is a peculiar bird to this County, being found no where else in <hi>England;</hi> it haunts the Seas, but feeds not upon fish. His bill is sharp, long and red, his leggs red; and his feathers black. It is a very unlucky bird (and mischievous like the Pye) for he will hide mony,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113554:26"/>
and other little things, and will carry sticks of fire about, and set barns, stacks, &amp;c. on fire. He is frequent about the Alpes.</p>
               <p>There are many Lepers in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> who are thought to contract that disease from much eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fish, especially newly taken, and more especially from the eating of the Livers of such new fish; but some have it as an heriditary disease from their Ancestors.</p>
               <p>The ancient <hi>Cornish</hi> men were excellent archers, they would shoot an arrow 24 score: their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was a Cloath yard long, wherewith they would pierce any ordinary Armour: One Mr. <hi>Robert Arundel</hi> would shoot 12. score with his right hand, with his left hand, and behind his head; And one <hi>Robert Bone</hi> shot at a little Bird upon a Cows back, and killed the Bird without touching the Cow.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Cornwall</hi> they find that sea sand is more fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying and enriching then land sand, by reason of its saltness, as they think. And they further observe, that the Sand is the better, by how much the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther down in the sea it lyes. They use also ouzy mud to lay upon their land, but it is not altogether so good as the Sand. There is also a weed called <hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> whereof some grows upon Rocks under high-water mark, and some is broken from the bottom of the sea by rough weather, and cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the next shore by the wind and flood; and with these Weeds they compast their Barley Land. This floating <hi>Orewood</hi> that is cast a-shore by the flood, is now and then found naturally formed like ruffs and Combs.</p>

               <p>Upon the shore of this County, in many places are found shells of sundry fashions and colours, (as indeed there are upon many shores elsewhere) and in some places on the shore there are Nuts to be found like a sheeps kidney, but flatters with a hard brownish rind, and the kernell is without taste, and (as they say) good for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in travell.</p>

                  <hi>Edgecomb</hi> house by <hi>Plymouth</hi> is a very healthful dwelling, though near the Sea: <hi>The cause is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is hilly, rocky, and free from marishes. For which reason the Country about Dover in Kent is found to be healthfull too, though lying just upon the Sea.</hi> This house is famous for two things; first for the brave Eccho about it, and then for a sort of Stone, that they dig near it, which serves for building, lime, and marle, and all.</p>

               <p>At <hi>Trematon</hi> in <hi>Cornwall</hi> in the Parish Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, a Leaden Coffin was digged up, in which being opened was found the proportion of a very big mans body, but being touched it turned to dust. It was thought to be the body of Duke <hi>Orgarus,</hi> who, as <hi>Speed</hi> saith, married his daughter to King <hi>Edgar:</hi> for there was an inscription on the Coffin, that signified, it was the body of a Duke, whose heir was married to a Prince.</p>

               <p>The Town of <hi>Bodmin</hi> is held a very unhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full place, and the cause of it they say is, for that it hath one street (a mile in length) running due East and West, on the South side whereof it hath a great high hill that hides the Sun from it; and their Back-houses, as Kitchins, Stables, &amp;c. are climbed up to by steps and every great shower washeth the Sulledge of them through the houses into the streets; and (which is more) their Conduit water runs through the Church yard.</p>
               <p>It will not be a miss to add here out of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour an odde presage of the <hi>Cornish</hi> rebellion in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, which happened in this Town of <hi>Bodmin.</hi> About a year before that rebellion the Scholars of <hi>Bodmin</hi> School grew into two factions, the one (as they call it) for the old religion, the other for the new; and this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell was prosecuted with some eagerness sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113554:28"/>
times, till by an unhappy accident (no other then the killing of a Calfe during the beardless conflict) complaint was made to the Master, and so the play ended. Which presage is seconded with severall others of the like nature out of ancient &amp; modern history; but to impercinent to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and too tedious to be here related.</p>
               <p>In Saint <hi>Cleeres</hi> parish in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> there are upon a plain six or eight Stones, such as are upon <hi>Salsbury</hi> plain, which like them two will be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the telling; so that when they are told o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a gain, they will be found over or under the first number.

               <p>There is a story that passes concerning Saint <hi>Kaines</hi> well in this County; which is, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever drinks first of the water, be it husband or vvife, gets the mastery. A fit fable for the vulgar to believe.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Hall</hi> near <hi>Foy</hi> there is a Fagot vvhich is all one piece of vvood, naturally grovvn so, and it is wrapped about the middle vvith a bond, and parted at ends into four sticks, one of which sticks is subdivided into two others.

For his Estate (saith Mr. C.) is now come into the hands of four <hi>Cornish</hi> Gentlemen, one of whose Estates is likewise divided between two Heirs.</p>
               <p>An Earthen Pot was found many years ago near <hi>Foy,</hi> gilded and graved with Letters, in a great

               <p>By <hi>Helford</hi> is a great Rock lying upon the ground, and the top of it is hollow like the long half of an Egg. This they say holdeth water, which ebbeth and floweth with the Sea. And indeed (saith Mr. C.) when I came hither to see this curiosity, the Tide was half gone, and the Pit or hollowness half empty.</p>
               <p>There is a Rock in this shire called <hi>Mainamber,</hi> which is a very great one, and yet so laid upon les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Rocks, that the push of a finger will sensibly move it to and fro; but not all the strength which men can make, can remove it from the place.</p>

               <p>An exceeding big Carcass of a man was found by Tinners digging at a Village near the Lands end, called <hi>Trebegean.</hi> Hitherto I have borrowed all I have written (save onely my conjectures at the causes) out of Mr. <hi>Carew's</hi> ingenious Book, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Survey of Cornwall,</hi> published in the year 1602.</p>

               <p>What <hi>Cambden</hi> and others say over and above, is as followeth.</p>
               <p>The chief time of the swarming (as one would say) of <hi>Pilchards</hi> about the shores of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> is from <hi>July</hi> to <hi>November,</hi> at which time they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, garbaged, salted, and hanged in the smoak, laid up and pressed, and so carryed away, and sold in <hi>France</hi> and other Countreys.</p>
               <p>In the Rocks at the Lands end, at a low Water, are found Veins of white Lead, and brass.</p>
               <p>At St. <hi>Michael's</hi> Mount, at low ebbs, one may see Roots of mighty Trees in the Sands, which shews that there hath been overflowing of the sea upon this coast hereabout, as it appeareth also to have been about <hi>Plymouth</hi> Haven, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces adjoyning. And it is manifest that the sea hath devoured much Land upon the coast of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> towards <hi>Silley</hi> Islands. For between the Lands end and <hi>Silley,</hi> the sea is all of an equal depth of about 40. or 60. fathom, Water being about 30 Miles in length; onely in the mid way there lyes a Rock called the Gulf. The cause of the devouring of this Land by the sea, I conceive to be its being a Promontory lying open to the merciless stormes and weather, and withall, lying in a place where two currents meet and part; I mean the Tide as it comes in, and returns out of the Sleeve, or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas, and the <hi>Irish</hi> Seas, and <hi>Seavern;</hi> the rolling and force of the Sea being apt to carry before it all that stands in its vvay, according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that its own strength bears to the yeelding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the object. But the cause why the Gulf rock was not washed away with the rest, is because
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113554:29"/>
it was of too stubborn a matter, and too fast foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Earth. Nor can I think but that the <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> Islands were once all parts of the main Land of <hi>England,</hi> (and the like I conceive of <hi>Heysant</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> an Isle lying before the Promontory of <hi>Britain</hi>) but severed by degrees each from other, and all from the Continent by the means above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Stratton</hi> in <hi>Cornwall</hi> grows the best Garlick in all the Countrey. It may be old Mr. <hi>Chamond</hi> (before spoken of) owed part of the cause of his great age. to his living so near the best Garlick the Countrey man's Treacle.</p>
               <p>On the shore of this shire, about 30. or 40. years, ago, was a huge Mass of Ambergrise, found by a poor Fisherman; a story very famous, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the mouths of several persons of credit and quality.</p>

               <p>The air of <hi>Devonshire</hi> is sharp and wholesom: the soil hilly and woody; and here they use (as in <hi>Cornwall</hi>) sea-sand to mend and enrich their Land, which makes it very fat and battle.</p>

               <p>Of the hot Baths in this Shire (at the City of <hi>Bath) Johnson</hi> in his <hi>Mercurius Botanicus,</hi> gives us this description. <hi>Bath</hi> (saith he) lyes in a plain (not great) encompassed with Mountains almost of an equal height.

In these two Baths there is a Pump to pump Water upon the diseased, where strong Embrocations (as Phisicians speak) are required; for often times the matter of the Disease is so contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that simple bathing wil not remove it.

It hath not so many Springs as the Kings Bath, and hot bath have; and therefore is of a more

gentle heat. About 22. paces from the <hi>Cross Bath,</hi> is the <hi>Hot Bath,</hi> so called, because former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it was not so large as now it is, it was much hotter then the rest. But now it is only as hot as the <hi>King's Bath,</hi> or but little hotter. It is 27. foot long, &amp; 13, foot broad. The Water of all these <hi>Baths</hi> in a small quantity seems clear and pellucid; but if one look upon its surface in the <hi>Bath,</hi> it lookssomewhat green, (or of a blew or sea-colour, as <hi>Cambden</hi> saith) and it hath a <hi>Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous</hi> unsavoury smell, but almost no tast, at least it is hardly perceivable to the palate. Once a week the <hi>Baths</hi> are empited, and swept clean; onely the <hi>Cross Bath,</hi> because of its frequent use and its narrowness, is sometimes cleansed twice a week. For the nature of the water is, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 4. or 5. hours after the going out of the <hi>Baths,</hi> the water casts out a foamy scum or filth which swims on the top of it, and fouls it. The Minerals that are conceived by learned Writers to give these Waters their heat and Tincture, are <hi>Bitumen. Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Nitre;</hi> and there is <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen; Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Nitre</hi> being in less quantity: The Mineralness of these Waters appears also by a way that the people of <hi>Bath</hi> have to give Silver Money a Golden colour, which is done with a Composition made (as they say) of the mud of the <hi>Bath,</hi> and some of the <hi>Bath-Water</hi> and Urine mixed together, with which composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they rub the Money which they intend to gild; but the colour is but pale and faint, and will quickly wear off. Now that it is a <hi>Bituminous</hi> and <hi>Sulphury</hi> matter that gives this Water its
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113554:33"/>
heat and tincture; besides its Medicinal Vertues, as that it dryes, heats, dissolves, softens, opens, attracts, digests, cuts, and is abstersive, &amp;c. there is this manifest proof, that the Countrey herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts is full of Cole-Mines, especially about <hi>Bristol,</hi> and the southermost parts of <hi>Glocester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> as <hi>Mengerfield, Westerley,</hi> &amp;c. and so also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Mendip-Hills,</hi> that part of them that lyes towards <hi>Frome-Selwood.</hi> And all <hi>Naturallists</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree (as they have reason) that <hi>Coale</hi> is a <hi>Bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi> and <hi>sulphury</hi> matter; For that it is a <hi>Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> is manifest by its black pitchy viscosity, and its melting as it burns: And that there is a quantity of <hi>Sulphur</hi> in it, is as evident by the Brimstony smell the Embers of them give, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one may find that will but hold his head a while over a pan of them; as also by their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning blew many times, especially when they hurn eagerly, as in frosty Weather; whence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people reckon the fires burning blew, a slgne of frost and hard weather: And (which is yet a further argument, the Coale hereabouts hath abundance of Veins like Gold or Brass in it (as I have often observed my self, and it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served every day; for indeed there is nothing more common) a thing which I could never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in <hi>New-Castle</hi> Coal, though this Cake as that doth, and doth not burn all away to a white ashes, as the Coale which they dig about <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> and which I think they call <hi>Canell-Coale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) a kind of pit-coals digged near the River <hi>Frome,</hi> with which <hi>Smiths</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:113554:33"/>
use to soften Iron. These are the Coales I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, under <hi>Mendip Hills,</hi> toward <hi>Frome-Selwood:</hi> That they should soften Iron, is no wonder, since we see any Coal, or the like vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sire doth the same; but whether they have a singular power thatway above other coal, may be further enquired.</p>
               <p>It is reported that about <hi>Uphill</hi> (Parish by the sea-side not far from <hi>Axbridge</hi>) within these half hundred years, a parcel of Land swelled up like a hil, and on a sudden clave asunder, and fel down again into the Earth, and in the place of it remains a great Pool.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Keinsham</hi> in stone quarries, are found stones in the form of a Serpent, like the <hi>Whitbay</hi> stones (of which I shal speak more in <hi>Yorkshire</hi>) onely here is the difference between them; whereas those at <hi>Whitbay</hi> want heads, some of these have. Hereabouts also (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) grows <hi>Percepier,</hi> or <hi>Parsley-break stone,</hi> an Herb proper to <hi>England,</hi> bitter, hot, biting and sowre, without stalk, with herby Flowers, never above a span high: It grows naturally all the yeer long; it is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dieuretical, and very quick in operation, Yet however <hi>Cambden</hi> puts it down as a special rarity in this place; our modern <hi>Herbarists</hi> make no such rarity of it; for <hi>Mercurius Botanicus</hi> saith indefinitely, that it grows <hi>in Agris Siccioribus,</hi> that is, in dry grounds; and others say that it is commonly to be found in airable fields after Harvest.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bristol</hi> it flows a 11. or 12. Ells in height e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Tide; an extraordinary proportion in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113554:34"/>
comparison of most places on the <hi>English</hi> shore. The cause I suppose is, the extreme wide and direct mouth of <hi>Severn,</hi> lying open to the Vast <hi>Atlantick Sea,</hi> where the Tide comes rolling in a-main, and being contracted as it comes in higher into the River, and land-locked, and not being able to fall back again (til it ebb without in the Main) by reason of the continual succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Water, must needs swel to that height in the <hi>Severn,</hi> and by consequence very easily communicate part of his burden to the <hi>Avon</hi> of <hi>Bristol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not far from <hi>Bristol</hi> is the famous Rock cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led St. <hi>Vincents</hi> Rocks, ragged, and hanging over the bank of the River of <hi>Avon,</hi> where (saith <hi>Johnson</hi>) is a Well of warm Water, pleasing to the tast. It flows out of the Clest of a great Rock, &amp; is overflowed every Tide, and left open to the air at the ebb; for its spring breaks out at the Root of the Rocks; the Water is much commended for <hi>Ulcers,</hi> and calculous affections of the reins, being taken inwardly. It is also often applied outwardly to cure old sores with very good success (saith he) as I have heard those say that have tried. There is moreover in this place a Vein of Iron in the Bowels of the Earth (saith the same Author) whence the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gets its vertue, and a greater heat, which it loseth by running a great way before it can get out. But by my Authors leave, it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived how a vein of Iron should make water so hot, since we see that iron Mines in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces work no such effect upon those Waters that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113554:34"/>
run through them. I rather conceive there it is some other Vein of Metal, or rather Mineral there, that is the cause of the heat, and likely the same Mineral that causeth the heat of the <hi>Bath-Waters.</hi> Much more I could say, but I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to inlarge too far upon Plausibilities. Note that this hot Well is not above 12. miles from <hi>Bath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the upper side of these craggy Rocks of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> are digged out pellucid stones, sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular (or six cornered) and quadrangular, (or four cornered) which we call <hi>Diamonds.</hi> Some will have them to be Chrystal, but (saith Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi>) I think they are rather of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Fluores.</hi> For (saith he) I remember an Apothecary of <hi>Bristol</hi> told me, the Lord of the place would not have them taken out of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Mine, (which was the womb in which they were formed) because the greater quantity of them make the Metal the more fluid. and apt to melt. And <hi>Agricola</hi> tells us, that <hi>Fluores</hi> are very like <hi>Diamonds,</hi> but not so hard, and that they are used in the melting and trying of Metals, till they be throughly tried; for (saith he) they make the matter in the fire much more fluid. And <hi>Kentmannus</hi> in his Catalogue of <hi>Fossils,</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons <hi>Pellucid Fluores,</hi> sexangular, and like Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal. Of these St. <hi>Vincent Stones, Cambden</hi> speaks thus: They are (saith he) so plentiful there, that one may fill a bushel with them; and they are all either four cornered, or six cornered. And saith <hi>Speed,</hi> saving their hardness, they are as good as the <hi>Diamonds</hi> of <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:113554:35"/>
               <p>On another Rock more Western then <hi>St. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents</hi> Rock, there are found <hi>Diamonds</hi> enclosed in hollow and reddish Flints after a wonderful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the Earth it self is red there too.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Chedder</hi> near <hi>Axbridge,</hi> is a Spring so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of Water presently, that it drives twelve Mills within a quarrer of a mile of the head of it. The reason I suppose is, for that the head of it ariseth in a corner, been encompassed round with steep barren hills, (save onely that way which the stream runs) which pour out all that plenty of Water they contain in their bowels, into this head-spring, where it all meets as in a center, and there rusheth forth in a vast abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>In the Isle of <hi>Athelney</hi> in this shire, was in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time a Monastry, which was so contrived, that the whole Frame thereof hanged upon four main Posts made fast in the ground. So saith <hi>Cambden</hi> out of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is credibly reported (saith the same Author <hi>Cambden</hi>) that there was a Walnut-Tree in the holy Church-yard at <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> that did never put out leaf before St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> day, and upon that very day was very rank &amp; ful of leaves; but that is now gone, and a young Tree set in this place. Also that there is Hawthorn in <hi>Wirall</hi> Park hard by <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> that upon <hi>Christmas</hi> day sprouteth forth as if it were in <hi>May.</hi> This is reported (saith he) by very credible men that live thereabouts. <hi>But it is since (as credibly reported) that the malice and fury of the late wars, hath destroyed this Hawthorn too.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:113554:35"/>
               <p>There is at <hi>Bristow</hi> a Church, called the Temple, the Tower whereof shakes to and fro when the bells ring, so that it hath divided it self from the rest of the Building from the top to the bottom the breadth of three Fingers, and openeth and shutteth whensoever the bell is rung.</p>
               <p>`There is about a mile Eastward from <hi>Bath,</hi> a great hill, and on the top of it a very large bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Plain, called <hi>Landsdown,</hi> under which very probably, if search were made, would be found the Mineral or Furnace that heats the <hi>Bath-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> but no doubt it lies so deep, that it would not be worth the time, the pains, or the cost to search after it; it seems by the very sight of it to be pregnant of some such matter. <hi>These were my thoughts at first, touching the Bed of the Minerall that heats the Bath; but Dr.</hi> Meara <hi>of</hi> Bristow <hi>hath since taught me to lay down that conjecture, by shewing me the Copy of a Letter written by himself in Latine to Dr.</hi> Prujean <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>touching astrange thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in</hi> July 1659. <hi>at the Bath; the abstract of which I shall take the boldness to give the Reader in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors own words, as followeth.</hi>

                           <p>W. and H. Sir,</p>
                           <p>WHat I should have done long since, &amp;c. The Sacrifice I bring to your Altar, will not I conceive be ungratefull. It is the strange accidentall discovery of a noble Mistery touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause of the heat of the <hi>Baths</hi> here; the search into which hath long exercised the most famous Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, the manner of it was thus. The right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who continues still at the <hi>Bath</hi> with his Lady, riding abroad not far from this City two days ago, to take the air, by chance found a kind of Chalke as white as snow, working here and there out of the ground in little heaps, like earth cast up by Moles. A piece of this he brought home, and shewed me. It is a crumbling matter, and almost of its self turns to a small light dust: its tast is manifestly acide without astriction, but by little and little biting, and causing an extream hot strangulation in the mouth, so that I am perswaded it hath much Chalcanthus in it, and is not altogether without Arsenick. I put it into cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and presently it fell a boiling, and bubbling apace, just as if it had been quick Lime; and by degrees the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113554:37"/>
water grew so very hot that it would quickly have boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Egge. Now seeing that this Chalk is found near the <hi>Bath,</hi> I conoeive it not unlikely that it is this, that heats the <hi>Bath-water,</hi> I know very well that Authors generally attribute the heat of <hi>Baths</hi> to Sulphur or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen. Nevertheless, though it cannot be denyed that there is a great quantity of Bitumen and Sulphur found in these Springs, and the cure of Scabbiness, Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Trembling, the Palsey, and the like diseases doth evince that the <hi>Baths</hi> are plentifully impregnated with them; yet I doubt whether either of them hath any thing of a fermentative power in them to heat water, seeing both of them want acidity, the efficient cause of fermentation; and neither of them being put into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can produce any fermentation or heat. And since their consistance is clammy and viseid (especially that of Bitumen) that water cannot readily insinuate it self into the minute particles of them, they must needs be unfit for any such fermentation; The contrary of which will follow upon the crumbling and incoherent consistence of this Chalk. The place where this Fossile was found, is an earth porous like a spunge, so that it planly appears to be (as it were) the flos, or excri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence of fermenting Minerall, working up out of the Earth with those Spirits, that cause the fermentation. But what to determine, and say positively on this dark riddle, I know not; and therefore humbly submit it to your judgement; returning you most cordial thanks, &amp;c.</p>

There are men; they say, that go up and down upon the hils with forked hazle-wands in their hands near the places, where they suspect the Ore to be; And the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wands is, that when they pass over a place where Ore is, they bend and draw down to the Earth toward the Ore of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; and so they Ore is found. They say like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that any hazle wand wil not do it, but that these we speak of, are prepared after a secret manner, the mystery of which is kown but to some very few men there who make a living out of this Art of theirs, by finding out the Ore for the owners. This story is very strange, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to be true: nor could I have given any credit to it, had I not read in <hi>Sebastian Munsters Cosmography,</hi> that in the Silvermines in <hi>Germany</hi> the place where the Ore lies, and the veins run, is found by this very means of Hazle-wands. And in one of the figures of his Book he gives us the picture of a fellow going along upon the hills, with a forked wand, or stick in his hand, <hi>ad explorandum metallum.</hi> Besides this I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber very well that the <hi>Necromancers</hi> have a kind of rodds, called <hi>Mosaicall</hi> rodds (which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Hazle-wands, cut upon such a day of the week, under such a constellation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with abundance of ceremonies and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances

               <head>WILTSHIRE.</head>
               <p>IN the edge of this Shire between <hi>Luckinton,</hi> great <hi>Badminton</hi> (the seat of my noble Lord and Master, the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi>) is a place called the Caves; and by some the Giants caves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the language of ignorance, fear, and superstition. They are upon the top of a riling hill, a number about. 9. And some of them are (or were formerly) cemented with lime. Some of them are deeper and some shallower; some broader and longer then others. They lye altogether in a row. The manner of them is two long stones, set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sides, and broad stones upon the top to cover them. The least of these Caves is four foot broad, and some of them are nine or ten
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:113554:39"/>
foot long. This is, the account, which I have received from some neighbour Gentlemen touching them with which I was fain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self, because the Earth and Rubbish is now so fallen in, that (without digging) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almost can be seen, but the place where they are the cavities being all filled up, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes over growing them. I presume these causes are nothing else but the tombes of so many <hi>Saxon</hi> or <hi>Danish Heroes,</hi> (or it may be <hi>Romans</hi>) slain in a battle fought not far from the place. The curiosity of some ingenious men (as it is reported) within these 40 years, tempted them to dig into it, and make a search for some Antick remains, but they found nothing, but an old Spur, and some few other things not worth the mentioning. The broadness of the stones is not at all strange, since the whole Country hereabout is slatty, and in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces affords stones altogether as large as these.</p>
               <p>In this shire is a small Rill, called Deverill, which runneth a mile under ground, like as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so doth the little River Mole in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and the river <hi>Anas</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Niger in <hi>Africk:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Near <hi>Warmister</hi> (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) is a naturall round, and high copped hill called Clay Hill. Why <hi>Cambden</hi> should think this hill to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally so as it is, I know not: Sure I am, there is the like round and high copped hill about a mile Southward from <hi>Aubury</hi> in this shire, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Silbury-Hill,</hi> in the road from <hi>Bath</hi> to <hi>Marle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough;</hi> which seems not, for many reasons, to be natural, but to have been cast up by mens
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:113554:39"/>
hands, and it is not impossible that Clay Hill may have been made by the same means.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Juy-Church</hi> was in times past found a Corps 12 foot long, as the tradition ruuneth, and a Book of very thick Partchment, all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with great Roman Letters, but when the leaves were touched, the mouldred to dust.</p>
               <p>In the forrest of <hi>Savernac</hi> grows a kind of sweet Ferne.</p>
               <p>Sometimes there breaks out water in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a sudden land flood, out of certain stones (that are like rocks) standing aloft in open fields near the rising of the river Kenet in this shire, which is reputed by the common people a fore runner of death. That the sudden erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Springs in places, where they use not always to run, should be a sign of death, is no wonder. For these usuall eruptions (which in <hi>Kent</hi> we call Nailbourns) are caused by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream gluts of rain, or lasting wet weather, and never happen but in wet years (witness the year 1648. when there were many of them) In which years Wheat, and most other grain thrive not well (for a plain reason) and therefore a dearth succeeds the year following. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Proverb in <hi>Kent</hi> is, that drought never makes a dearth; Which was sufficiently verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the years 1654 and 1655. when (after that lasting drought that began in 1651, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till 1655.) the price of Wheat desceuded to 18d the bushell, and other grain proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably: And to our purpose, very remarkable it was in the year 1654, that severall springs, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:113554:40"/>
rivulets were quite dryed up by reason of the precedent drought, which raged most in 1651, 52, and 53. As the head of the stoure, that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth near <hi>Elham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and runs through <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> was dry for some miles space; and the like happened to the stream that crosseth the Road way between <hi>Sittingborn</hi> and <hi>Cantsrbury</hi> at <hi>Ospring</hi> near <hi>Feversham,</hi> which at other times ran with a plentifull current, but then wholly failed, like the Brooks in <hi>Israel</hi> in the days of <hi>Ahab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Stonehenge</hi> upon <hi>Salisbury</hi> plain in this shire, is counted the most admirable rarity, that our Island affords. It is in this manner. There are in a pit great stones standing upright. Some being 28 foot high, and 7 foot broad, in three ranks round like a Crown, and overthwart them are laid others with tenants and Mortises. Now the great wonder and question among the learned is, how these stones came hither. For say they, it is not likely that they were <hi>ab initio,</hi> placed here by the God of nature, because the whole Country round for some miles affords not a stone hardly, either great or smal. And they seem too vast to be brought hither by waggon or the like carriages The learned <hi>Cambden</hi> therefore thinks, that they were made there by art, of pure sand, and some unctuous cement, even as those also in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> because anciently there was such an art of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king stone. And <hi>Pliny</hi> saith that the dust of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teoli (Puzzele)</hi> being laid in water becometh stone presently, and that there were Cesterns at
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113554:40"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> made of digged sand, and lime, which were so firm and hard, that they seemed stone. But notwithstanding the authority of this great Scholar, Iam clearly of opinion that they are naturall stones, and placed there <hi>ab initio;</hi> Then which I think nothing is plainer. For up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Downs between <hi>Marleborough</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> not above 20 miles from <hi>Stonehenge,</hi> which Downs are but a continuation, or rather a part of <hi>Salisbury</hi> plain, differing nothing from it but in the un-evenness, are to be found abundance of great stones, commonly called by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try thereabout, the Gray Weathers; and at <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> in an Orchard there are halfe a dozen, or halfe a score stones little inferiour to the <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henge</hi> for hugeness, some standing upright like the <hi>Sonehenge,</hi> &amp; others lying flat on the ground. And the Country here, like that about the <hi>Stonehenge,</hi> affords not a stone beside. So that unless we wil have all these stones to be artificiall, wee must grant the <hi>Stonehenge</hi> to be natural. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this unstoniness of the Country about which we speak of, seems to some a strong objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the naturalness of the stones, it is on the contrary, if duly considered, a great argument for it. For what can be more probable, then that Nature could not provide her selfe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of Lapidifick matter enough to make these huge stones of, but by robbing the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent parts. The more of that matter here, the less hereabouts; because nature wanting timber, would fetch it nearest hand. I have no more to add touching the <hi>Stonehenge,</hi> but that near it mens bones are digged up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:113554:41"/>

               </p>
               <p>About <hi>Sapworth</hi> near <hi>Sharstan</hi> are found abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of stones somewhat like <hi>Cockles.</hi> yet so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently differing from their shape, that by the very sight of them one may plainly see that they never were true <hi>Cockles;</hi> as some do believe.

               <p>About the year 1348. (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) being presently after the <hi>Conjunction of Saturn &amp; Mars,</hi> in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> was a very great Plague over all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and then was <hi>Wallingford,</hi> (being a bigger and more confiderable Town then now it is) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most dis-peopled with it. The <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> that <hi>Cambden</hi> means, was 1342. &amp; 43. in <hi>February,</hi> and it happened in 25. <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Capricorn;</hi> but in my opinion, it ushered its pretended effect at too large a distance to enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it self the cause of it. Nor can I believe so small a cause could produce so great an effect; conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> happening constantly every two years, and sometimes
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113554:42"/>
(though very rarely) three of them happening in one year, (as in the year 1640. in the last face of <hi>Libra,</hi> and (if <hi>Pitatus</hi> have calculated right) in the yeare 1542. in the first face of the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sign <hi>Virgo</hi>) without any such extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effects succeeding them. And which is as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable as any thing, in the yeare 1578. was a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in 23. deg. of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> (but two degrees short of the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, 1342.) and yet the following years were not guilty of any extravagant Mortalities, Therefore I conceive it will not be amiss to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe rather this black effect to something near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er 1348. <hi>viz.</hi> to the conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in 1345. in 18. deg. of <hi>Libra</hi> (which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologers</hi> reckon the house of <hi>Saturn</hi>) a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of greater importance and influence, and so more likely to produce a greater effect. And yet I would not be too bold to fasten it upon this Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> neither (till further enquiry be made) because other Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Libra</hi> have passed over more lightly. Unless we wil say that there may be some particular venom about the 18th. degree of <hi>Libra</hi> which other degrees of <hi>Libra</hi> father off are not infected with. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the year 553. we are told by <hi>Alsted,</hi> that there raged so horrid a plague at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that there died 5000. in a day, and sometimes 10000. in a day. which was not above two years after a conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in 19. degrees of <hi>Libra,</hi> which happened 1551.</p>

               <p>The River <hi>Mole</hi> runs above a mile under ground and at the place where it falls into the ground groweth abundance of Box naturally.

               <p>The rising of a <hi>Bourn</hi> or stream near <hi>Croydon</hi> (as the common people hold) presageth death, as the Plague; and it hath been observed to fall out so. The rising of <hi>Bourns</hi> in places where they run not alwayes, we have before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be caused by great wet years, which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:113554:43"/>
to <hi>HYpocrates</hi> observation) are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the most sickly; and if they prove hot, as wel as wet, (because heat and moisture are the great disposers to putrifaction) they prove al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so malignant, and for the most part pestilential. And the reason why the using of this <hi>Bourn</hi> doth not always presage the Plague, is because all wet years do not presage hot.</p>
               <p>It is observed, that few or no Rivers do ebb and flow so far up from the Sea, as the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> which flows up as high as <hi>Richmond</hi> in this Shire: The reason of which is very plain, depending chiefly upon two very great causes. The first is the coming in of the flood, at both ends of this Island, that is, from the Westward by the Cape of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and from the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by the North end of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which (as our Books of Navigation tell us) meet at a Rock called the <hi>Galloper</hi> (which lyes right against the mouth of the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> between it and the coast of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> about the mid-way) with very great noise and rippling: Now the two floods (as I said) meeting here, must needs hinder the course of each other, and by consequence make the Sea swell much in this place, and so easily discharge it self by a strong flood into the neighboring River of <hi>Thames,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so conveniently for its reception. The other cause is the motion of the Earth from West to East, whibh carrying the banks of the <hi>Thames</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long towards the place where the mouth of it was but now, must needs (as it were) draw the Water into it, by leaving it behind. And perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113554:44"/>
upon enquiry, it will be found that the floods run more strongly (for this reason) up into those Rivers that discharge themselves into the sea on the East side of a great Iland or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, then those on the West side; and that where there are Currents or Streams that run thwart on upon a shore, they beat more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (in calm weather) upon Eastern, then Western shores. But whether this be the reason why on the East side of the Continents of <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> there be many more small Islands, then on the Western side of those Continents, (for so our Maps inform us, witness <hi>Japan,</hi> the <hi>Philippine</hi> Islands, the <hi>Moluccos,</hi> the <hi>Maldivae,</hi> the two <hi>Javas, Sumatra, Madagascar,</hi> &amp;c. on the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern side of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> and the great swarm of Islands, called, the <hi>Summer Islands,</hi> (to which we may ad those vast shoulds on the coast of <hi>Brasil,</hi> (on the Eastern side of <hi>America</hi>) or whether it be from the constant Intra-tropical Eastwind that galls the Lee-shores, and hath in long process of time carved them so curiously into Islands, is hard to say at present, but must be left to a more through disquisition.</p>
               <p>The Waters of <hi>Ebbesham</hi> in this shire are very famous, and much frequented for their Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal virtue, and purging by siege.

                  </gap> Chalk or Marle, the great shoots of rain have not power to moulder it so fast, and wash it away into the Valleys; so that being fat &amp; fertile at their first Creation, it is easie for them to continue so. It is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> (and it may be is as true in all Clayie Countreys) that the hills, and sides of hills are the most wet and clayie. The cause doubt less is the same with this, to wit, That the rains that fall, wash by degrees the uppermost mould down into the Valleys, because it is more loose and light; but leaves the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay behind, because more stiff and fast, and so very hardly to be tempted away. And this I suppose to be the reason why waters running over meer Clay, or issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, are hungry, and clear, as we find in our
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:113554:45"/>
land-springs about <hi>Badminton,</hi> because the Clay is unapt to mix with the water. And I suppose for the same reason, that if Downs consisting of light loose earth were ploughed, they would in process of time (by constant ploughing) lose much at theof unevenness, and becom plain, (I mean where there are no more enclosures to stop the concourse of the washed mould) whereas lying unploughed, they continue with very little alteration: But for the same reason Clayie Downs ploughed are not likely to suffer any great change.</p>

The hole left, (saith the story) is in compass 80. yeards about, and a Line of 50. sathom plummed into it, finds no bottom. Also,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the 18. 1596. A mile and half from <hi>Westram,</hi> Southward (which is not many miles from <hi>Motingham</hi>) two Closes lying together, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated with aihedge of hollow Ashes, there was found a part thereof 12. Perches long, to be sunk fix foot and a half deep; the next morning 15. foot more; the third morning 80. foot more at the least, &amp; so daily that great Trench of ground, containing in lenght about 80. Perches, and in breadth 28. began with the Trees and Hedges on it, to loose it self from the rest of the ground ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round about it, and withall, to move and shoot Southward day and night for eleven days. The ground of two Water-pits, the one six foot deep of Water, the other 12. at the least, and about
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:113554:47"/>
four Perches over in breadth, having sundry tuffs of <hi>Aldars</hi> and <hi>Ashes</hi> growing in the bottoms, with a great Rock of Stone under them, were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removed out of their places, and carried toward the South, at least four Perches a pieces; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, mounted aloft, and become hills, with their sedge. Flags, and black mud upon the tops of them, higher them the face of the Water (which they had for saken) by 9 foot, and in the place from which they are removed, other ground, which lay higher, is descended, receiving the Water which lyes upon it. Moreover in one pace of the plain field, there is a great hole made by sinking of the earth to the depth of 30. foot at the least, being in breath in some places two Pearches over, and in length five or six pearches. Also there is a hedge 30. pearches long, carryed Southward with his Trees seven pearches at the least. And sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinkings there be in diverse places, one of 60. foot, another of 47. and another of 34. foot. By means of which confusion it is come to pass, that where the highest Hills were, there be the deepest Dales, and the lowest Dales are become the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est grounds. The whole measure of breaking was at the least nine Acres, seven days works, and four Pearches, &amp;c. To this effect is this strange sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry related in our Chronicles, with the other of <hi>Motingham,</hi> both which we have no reason to doubt the truth, since of late years; namely <hi>Anno</hi> 1657. we have had a fresh example of an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinking at <hi>Bickley</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> of which we shall speak in its place, and which answers to that or <hi>Motingham.</hi> And our Chronicles afford us two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113554:48"/>
remarkable stories of Earth-removing, one in <hi>Herefordshire, 1571. Marcley-Hill,</hi> and another at <hi>Armitage in Dorsetshire,</hi> of which we have already spoken. Now for Earth sinking, I conceive I have found out the cause (in cafe the Countrey about <hi>Motingham</hi> and <hi>Bickley</hi> be loose and sandy) and I imagine it to be this: The Springs that run to and fro in the body of the earth, the deeper they run, the more they are encreased in quantity; and as they run thus, if the earth be loose or sandy, they must needs wash and carry away the sand or loose earth with them by degrees, and so make their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages bigger and bigger, both in breadth &amp; depth. For the earth being hollowed and vaulted by this means, the sieling (as I may call it) of this Vault, (being as we conceived sandy and loose) moulders and drops down by degrees into the stream under it, which as it falls, still clears it away; and thus at lenght it is not improbable, that it becomes a very spacious and deep hollowness. Now while this hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowness continues thus encreasing, sometimes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, sometimes much, according as the temper of the year augments, or diminishes the bulk &amp; force of the waters) there comes at length a great glnt of Rain, which exceedingly encreasing the waters, and by consequence the violence of these subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahian streams, they wash away now much more of the sides of the Vault (this little River over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing its ordinary banks) then at other times, and withall the weight of the incumbent earth; (that I mean which lyes right over this cavity) is much augmented by the extream wet. So that the weight being much more, and the strenght to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113554:48"/>
the mass of Earth much less, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what can follow hereupon, but a sinking of the incumbent Earth to the very bottom, how deep soever it be; Sometimes by degrees, and sometimes all at once, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>according to the nature of the Earth, which in some places I confess, though sandy, yet may not be meer sand; And it may be the air within the vault gives not place so quickly, as the earth hath a desire to descend, but must be squeezed out by little and little. Further I conceive, that after great wets, the strong tendency of the waters downward altogether, presseth in the air in the vault on all fides, and so begets a conflict between the water and the air, the air struggling outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to free it self, which conflict begets a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and this confusion must needs loosen the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent earth, and so much contribute also to its falling in, if it be loose and sandy. And I am of opinion, that whensoever the truth comes to be found out, it will appear, that this tumultuary tendency of waters downward (after great wets) pressing in the air (as I said) in hollow places of the Earth; begets a conflict, and that a concussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is that we call an Earthquake. For so much is truer then truth it self, that Earthquakes always succeed great wets, <hi>or a sudden glut, and tempest of rain in the time of a great drought,</hi> See 1 <hi>King.</hi> Which commonly falls all in one place, or Country, and none in another, and is for the most part much more large and pouring, then in dripping years for a plain reason; Witness that horrid thunder-shower, that poured down so
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113554:49"/>
much rain in so short a time and within so little compass of ground, and made so great a flood in the Parish of great <hi>Badminton</hi> in <hi>Glocestershire, June</hi> 1652. in the middle of the greatest drought, that our age hath known. Besides it is further to be considered, that sandy places doth more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let in the rain into the bowells of the Earth, so that it distills not down by drops, but presently, and almost altogether; nor can it mix with the sand to make dirt, and evaporate upward from whence it came (as rain doth in most forts of earth) but descends more entire, little or none of that wet that falls, returning, unless the Sun shine very forciblyout, immediately after the rain, and then it cannot draw much neither. And I partly believe, that those little sinkings of Earth in sandy ways in wet years (called Quicksands) such as I have seen one towards the upper end of <hi>Bocton</hi> streer, in the road between <hi>Sittingbourr.</hi> and <hi>Canterbury.</hi> and others in many other places) are but the effects of some of the smaller sorts of these causes; and the reason why they are rather in road-ways, then other places, is onely because of the great weight of carriages, that sends the pendulous earth going. Thus far I have ventured at the cause of earth sinking, and would attempt as much at earth removings, were I but sure, that <hi>Machley-hill</hi> in <hi>Herefordshire, Westram</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>Armitage</hi> in <hi>Dorsetshire</hi> were all of a fat and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my soile, and not very stiffe; (for then I think I have much to say to the cause of those too) but till I am sure, I shall be silent, though some of <hi>Herefordshire</hi> have told me, that <hi>Marcley-hil</hi> is such as I would have it to be.</p>

                  <hi>Cambden</hi> supposeth, that <hi>England</hi> hath formerly been united to the continent about <hi>Calais;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the middle between <hi>Calais</hi> and <hi>Dover</hi> the Sea is but 25 fathom deep (even as between <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> it is but 80 paces, which Island likewise hath anciently been thought to have been united to <hi>Italy</hi>) but on both sides of it the Sea is much deeper.

Likewise the clifts are alike high about <hi>Calais</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> and of the same matter and colour.

And to my best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance there are one or two places open upward in the roof of the passage. My opinion is, that the Chappel standing so in the middle, much conduceth to the conveighing of the sound so entirely, which is helped by the open places in the roof I speak of. For they seem to draw in the voice, wchelse would not so welenter into that narrow passage, but reverberate back into that broad open place, before the whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entry. And one thing which makes me think the Chappel doth a great part of the Work, is, for that we see in Viols. Lutes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Musical instruments, there are holes cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the belly of the instrument, just under the playing or striking place, which we find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience do much augment the noise of the notes, and make them more audible. But in this, and most other things, I say, I give but my poor judgement, submitting it to the censure of the learned.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Stroud</hi> (commonly called <hi>Stroud-water</hi>) they dye Scarlet; the Water there (as they say) having a peculiar property to give the right tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which other waters generally want. So much variety there is in Water, according to the several Earths that they pass through.</p>
               <p>No Snakes or Adders to be found about <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minton;</hi> I suppose the cause to be the barrenness and coldness of the Land the reabout; for Snakes are bred out of rich, fat, and hot mould, or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:113554:53"/>
mud (whence we find them commonly about ditches, and low, rich, shady grounds, lurking under long grass) of which this Countrey af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no great plenty. Besides being an open Countrey, it wants that shade and shelter that they delight in.</p>
               <p>In the fields about <hi>Badminton</hi> are found many times <hi>Cylindrical</hi> stones, long and round, like a mans finger. The inner part of them is like flint, somewhat pellucid, and of a sad brown colour, and it is enclosed round on the outside with a whitish <hi>Putamin,</hi> like Flint too.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Badminton</hi> also are several holes (called Swallow-holes) where the Waters (after any great shower of rain, or in Winter, when their Springs run) fall into the bowels of the earth, and are seen no more, nor is it known whether ever they rise again. The most remarkable of them are one or two, in the way between <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minton</hi> and <hi>Acton Farfeild.</hi> All that I can say to them yet, is, that in a Clayie and slatty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, if there be any inlets and passages into the Earth by reason of its discontinuity here and there, they are likely enough to be kept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, because such kind of earth is not apt to moulder with wet, and fall in, and so dam them up.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Alderley</hi> (saith <hi>Speed</hi>) a Countrey Parish 8. miles from the <hi>Severn,</hi> upon the hills, to this day are found Cockles, Periwinkles, and Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of solid stone. This place being but four or five miles from <hi>Badminton,</hi> the seat of that noble Family, that I have the honor to be a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:113554:53"/>
to, I have very diligently examined, and found it thus: The place where the stones are found, is partly a Sand, and partly a Clay; Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles I found, but neither Periwinkles nor Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: But though I found not them, yet instead of Periwinkles I found many Serpentine stones (or Snake stones, as they call them thereabout) flat, resembling the banner of <hi>Dan,</hi> as it's given in the Genealogies at the beginning of some of our <hi>English</hi> Bibles And instead of Oysters, I found <hi>Scallops,</hi> perfect fragments of them I mean (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the seeming contradiction) which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive had been broken with Ploughing: They were exactly ridged in rows at certain short di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, just like a <hi>Scallop-shell.</hi> Moreover, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest inhabitant of the parish bestowed upon me a whole <hi>Scallop,</hi> that is somewhat bigger then the ordinary size of <hi>Scallops,</hi> with a perfect shell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, ridged (as is before said) very naturally, and having an irregular piece of stone growing to it. No man that looks upon it, would at first sight imagine it to be other then a true Scallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell, so curiously it represents it in its colour, and onely exceeds it a little (as I said) in its dimension. Besides these, I found other figured stones, some resembling very much the Muscle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish; but they were somewhat bigger too, then what they were like; and others like the kernel of an <hi>Almond,</hi> long, and somewhat roundish, with two edges opposite to each other, and they were streaked and cranked like a Cockle-shell. Other little stones I found, somewhat bigger then a Hasel-Nut, and some much less, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:113554:54"/>
were cranked in like a Cockle-shell, but deeper, and not so thick together as a Cockle-shel: Some of them did resemble also the Cockle very near, others not so much; yet all did so sufficiently differ from the form of it, at the supposed open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place of the Cockle, that a man may easily judge that they never were Cockles; for there the two shels were bent up in the fashion almost of a blobber-lip. And that which is not unworthy our consideration, is, that they are few of them like one another; some being flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, others more round; some have the lip more turned up, others less. They have upon them a whitish shining shel, and within they are (for some I have broken) a mass of little particles, of a pellucid matter (somewhat like Alablaster) grown hard together. The Countrey hereabout for some miles round upon the hills, affords ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these last sort of stones; for I have found them in gravel that was digged in <hi>Badminton,</hi> and sometimes I have found of them growing to great irregular stones about the Countrey. I have been told that about <hi>Sapworth</hi> by <hi>Sharston,</hi> there are abundance of them to be found. I found one of them in <hi>Witney</hi> Town, seven Miles from <hi>Oxford,</hi> upon a paved Causey: How it came there, I know not, nor had I time to enquire whether the Countrey thereabout afford any store, or any more of them. The Snake-stones I spoke of, have a perfect <hi>spina</hi> running all along the back of them (as those also at <hi>Keynsham</hi> have; but those at <hi>Keynsham</hi> are much bigger then these at <hi>Alderley,</hi> and lye in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:113554:54"/>
with little ridges (like ribs) on both sides of them, all along from the head without, to the tail within, in the form almost of a <hi>Roman</hi> S. and in this they agree with those of <hi>Keinsham</hi> too. Further, the outer part of this snaky wreath is divisible, and may be knocked off from the inner part of the wreath to which it is joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, without taking from it, or losing to it; so that it is not one entire Stone throughout, but is within, as it seems without, separable with a little violence; and in this too they agree with the Snake-stones of <hi>Keinsham.</hi> Lastly, on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side they have a kind of skale, thin and shining, as if it were a little polished; in some whitish like <hi>Alablaster;</hi> in others brownish, of the colour of a dryed Eel-skin; and in others again of a dirty yellow colour, inclining something to red. My opinion of all these stones, for many reasons, is that they are not Shel-fish petrified (as some would have them to be, who think that upon the ebb of the deluge these fish were left upon the tops of hills, and turned to stone by degrees, wanting their former moisture to keepe them soft within, like other Shelfish.) For first, they are all solid within, without any cavity, even the Muscles, Cockles, and Scallops. Again, some of the Muscles, Cockles, and Scallops, are a great deal bigger then true ones. Thirdly, the Snake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones are without heads generally, if not all; for as for those appearances of heads which some fancy at the outer end of some of them, I take them rather for irregular pieces of stone, and as it were attempts of Nature to continue
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:113554:55"/>
the wreath further on; but as all works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are finite, she being here at her <hi>Ne-plus-ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> is not able to produce what she would, but doth what she can toward it, which is but an imperfect Lump, even as a weak Womb produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a Moon-Calf. Fourthly, some of these Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fishes have but half their shapes, the other part being an irregular and deformed Mass, Nature as it were failing in her Workmanship, for want of fit matter in that place. Nay one of the Snake-stones I gathered, hath a Segment (as I may call it) of another less Snake so joined to the side of it, that there can be no room for the other side of the Segment, but in the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bulk of the greater. And one of the Cockles I gathered (being indeed but halfe a Cockle, nothing but one Cockle-shel, with a lump of irregular stony matter in the cavity of it) hath within the hollow of the shel almost joining to it, another little Cockle-shel peeping (as it were) out of that irregular stony matter I speak of. Fifthly, these stones are not so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely like those creatures they would seem to represent petrified as they should be; for there is an apparent difference between the <hi>Muscle stone,</hi> and the true <hi>Muscle</hi> of the sea, both in the shape of the stones, and in the cranking of it; for it is cranked like a <hi>Cockleshel</hi> almost, which the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleshel</hi> of the sea is not, unless perhaps there be some such <hi>Muscle</hi> of the sea which I never saw. Again, the stone which I said was like the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of an <hi>Almond,</hi> I know not what fish or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to liken it to, unless it be a Snag without
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:113554:55"/>
shel (such as are in <hi>Peason,</hi> and in Gardens at time of year) when his horns are drawn in, and his body is shrunk up; and yet it doth not so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly resemble that neither, because this is cranked on the side, and that is not. And yet further, those other little stones which I said were less then <hi>Cockles,</hi> with a lip turned up, are neither exactly like <hi>Cockles,</hi> nor any other Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish that I have seen, but seem, rather to be as natural stones, as Flints or Pebbles. But that which wil put the matter quite out of doubt, is, that the <hi>Scallop</hi> which I said was given me, and which I have now by me, and intend to preserve for the satisfaction of the curious, is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly different from the true Shel-fish of the Name; for whereas the true <hi>Scallop</hi> hath one shel concave, and the other flat, both the pretended shels of this <hi>Scallop-stone</hi> are concave. So that unless there be a kind of <hi>Scallop</hi> which I never saw yet, this one stone is able to convince any man that these stones are not petrificatious. Natural there is no doubt they are, and such as now they are from the Creation; but how they came to put on such strange and imitating figures, is a secret we dare not meddle with, til we have satisfied Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Bacons</hi> mind, by writing a compleat History of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Art.</hi> I onely forget to tel you, that all these stones are found near the surface of the Earth; and if you dig any depth, you find no more of them; and that they are also to be found upon the Hil hetween <hi>Hilsley</hi> and <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> (about a mile from <hi>Alderley</hi> Southward) in the horse-way.</p>

               <p>In the Parish of <hi>Great Badminton,</hi> in a Field there, called, <hi>Twelve Acres,</hi> the Husbandmen do often times plough up, and find iron Bullets as big as Pistol bullets, and some almost as big as Musket bullets.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Tormanton,</hi> (commonly called <hi>Tormarton</hi>) by <hi>Sodbury</hi> is a Quarry of Free-stone, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others there are about the Countrey. All kinds of stone are not to be found in one kind of earth, but several soils afford several kinds of stone. Chalky Countreys afford Flint; Sandy (if they find any) a great rough stone, generally (I think always) of the colour of the Sand where it is; <hi>Loamy,</hi> a kind of lightish red bastard Flint, such as is to be found in many places in the road way between <hi>Rochester</hi> and the top of <hi>Boxley-hill;</hi> Gravelly Pebbles, and clayie Countreys, in some places afford hard, rough, whitish stone, and in other places Free-stone, according to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Clay. It seems every soil is most apt to afford that stone that is most of kin, and nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of nature to it. And therefore it may be, it is the less wonder that Chalky ground should afford Flint, because Flint (like all pellucid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances) being pulverized, becomes almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly white like Chalk. I have no more to add of the Free-stone of <hi>Tormarton,</hi> but that if it be nearly viewed with a diligent eye, it seems to be nothing but an infinite number of little Grains of Gravel cemented together into a Mass, which I think will be found true of all Free-stone</p>

               <p>At <hi>Lassington</hi> a village about a mile and a halfe from <hi>Gloucester</hi> West or Northwest, on the fide of a hill, a little below the brow of it, in the high way are to be found little Star-stones, the Greeks call them Astroites. They are thin (about the thickness of a halfe-Crown,) flat and five pointed like a Star or Mullet in Heraldry, onely the points of them are not sharp, but a little roundish, and most of them are not so big as a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle halfe penny, though some are very near as big. Further they are of a grayish colour, and on both sides curiously graved (as it were by art with a fine graving instrument, &amp; a neat hand) as if there were a little Mullet within the great. You shall find many of them joined together (flat fide to flat side) in little Columnes, or Prismes an inch long or more, halfe a score or more of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and so fast, that you cannot sever them without breaking; though they are distinguished with a perfect line. I believe they were all knit together in such Columnes at first, (even those which are found single) and that they were severed by frost, or some such piercing cause. Being told of these Rarities so nigh me, I took a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to see the place, and gathered many of the stones, and found them such as I have told you. Being put into Vinegar they have a motion, as other Astroites have, though not so lively; I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose because of the shortness, and roundishness of their points, in the form of which I conceive lyes a great part of the cause of their motion. Some of these stones (like the stones at <hi>Alderly</hi>) are deficient in their figure, and have the defect sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:113554:57"/>
               <p>(or rather Super-supplied) with a rugged formless matter, hard like it self. I observed that the ground is a miry deep rotten Clay, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream bad way in Winter, and (which I wondred most of all at) there were here and there great Pebbles as big as a mans fist, or thereabout, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with this rotten earth, and by enquiry I found that this mixture of Pebbles was not from any mending of the high way, but the meer originall nature of the Earth, for I found these Pebbles in the fields as well as in the high ways. So that since this thwarts, what we said but now of Pebbles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the naturall companions of gravelly land, we are willing to grant, that (as in Grammar, so) in naturall philosophy there is no general rule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an exception. Query, Whether in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where the Star-stones are found, as about <hi>Shugbury</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> and <hi>Belvoir</hi> Castle in <hi>Leicestershire,</hi> the earth be so rotten, deep and miry, and withall whether there be any such great Pebbles mixed with it, as here, and in particular enquire.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Purton</hi> passage over the River of <hi>Seavern,</hi> where the shore as it is reported, yieldeth these Star-stones also, but they are bigger, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes of them longer then at <hi>Lassington.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed accordingly it is delivered to me, as a miry ousy shore in some places, and a quicksand in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, very dangerous for horse and man at low water, and one of the worst passages, over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at those times.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Puckle</hi> Church (about 6 miles from <hi>Bristol</hi>) they dig a kind of Stone that is hard, blewish,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113554:57"/>
broad and about halfe a foot thick, and so even, and the sides so parallel to each other, as if nature had intended it for Tombestones. The stones are many of them of a very great breadth, and lye some six or seven of them one under another in bed, and of about the same thickness all of them; and then they come to a light blewish Clay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowwhich is no more of this stone to be found. The uppermost bed of the stone lyes very near to the surface of the earth, so that in one place near the Town in the high way, a man rides for ten peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or more, as if he rode upon a pavement of broad stone; or rather upon one entire stone.</p>

               <p>In the year 1399, just before the warrs brake out between the two illustrious Roses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> on New years day, the deep River that passeth between <hi>Suelstone</hi> and <hi>Harwood</hi> (two vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages not far from <hi>Bedford</hi> Town) called <hi>Ouse,</hi> sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ceased its course, and stood still; so that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men passed three miles together on foot in the very depth of the Channell, and backward the waters swelled up to a great height, which some judicious men observing, conceived was an ill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that division, which followed shortly after between K. <hi>Richard</hi> the second, and his people. I dare not be surety for the truth of every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this story, yet I believe the main of it may be true. But I cannot conceive how so strange a thing should come about, unless it were by a sudden frost (the time of the year being season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for it) which might congeal those waters that fed the stream, at their first issuing out of the earth at the head of the River, the rest of the water
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113554:59"/>
in the mean time passing away down, because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in motion they were not so capable of conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

But <hi>Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders well</hi> is far better of the two. An ancient man (saith the same Author) in <hi>London</hi> whensoever he was sick, would drink plentifully of this <hi>Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders well water,</hi> and was presently made well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and whensoever he was overcome of drink he would drink of this water, which would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently make him sober again.</p>
               <p>The Stews by the Bank-side (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) in <hi>Southwarke</hi> were made to feed Pikes &amp; Tenches sat, and to scour them from their muddy Fennish tast. I have seen (saith he) Pikes panches opened with

a knife to shew their fatness, and presently the wounds have come together again by the touch of tenches, and by the help of their glewy slime been perfectly healed up.</p>
               <p>The shore of this Shire is washed by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly River of <hi>Thames,</hi> which glidts along with a much more clear and gentle stream then the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Severn.</hi> The cause of the clearness of the Water, is its running in a gravelly Valley, and over a clear ground, Gravel being unapt to mix with Water, when it is stirred, and too heavy to swim very far along with it. The River of <hi>Severn</hi> (as also the River of <hi>Avon</hi> that runs from the <hi>Bath,</hi> and by <hi>Bristol</hi>) is on the contrary a very muddy troubled Water, because it washes a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ouzy shore almost all along. For the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness of the Current in the <hi>Thames,</hi> we are to know there are two principal causes of it, the great winding of the River, which locks in the Water that it cannot make that haste down to sea, that it would; and the low lying of the head Springs of it, from whence there is but an easie descent to the sea. And I think it is not amiss to note here, that this easie descent of the Waters to the sea-ward, is another reason why the tide flows up so high into the heart of this River. For who sees not, that the more steep the River, the less way is the Tide able to force its way up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it? Swift Rivers have alwayes their Heads lying high, or their course direct, or both. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in case swift Rivers do, or did at first run winding to, and again; yet if their Springs lye high, they will in process of time by their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:113554:61"/>
pare away the Promontories of their banks, (unless they be rocky and stubborn) and make their way straighter.</p>
               <p>There are in the <hi>Thames</hi> three other things worth observation, to wit, its Spring-Tides, its overflowing its banks, and its strange shifting of Tides at some times; touching all which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it falls not unhandsomely into this place) I shal deliver my conceptions, in regard I have (I think) something to say to them, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet read, And first, for the Spring-Tides in the <hi>Thames</hi> and other Rivers (which are higher Tides then ordinary, that happen about every ful and change of the <hi>Moon</hi>) the great <hi>French</hi> Philosopher <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> endeavours in his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipia Philosophiae,</hi> to give us the reason of them, by framing a most ingenious <hi>Hypothesis</hi> (too long here to set down) and telling us from the Theorique of the Moon, that the Moon moves so in her <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> or Oval-fashioned Orb about the Earth, that at her ful and change she comes nearer the earth, and in each Quarter goes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from it; whence (according to his <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>) greater Tides must be at ful and change, and neap or low Tides at the Quarters. All which is for the most part true indeed; and without doubt the Moon her nearness at the Ful and Change, is the cause of the Spring-Tides then, even as the Moon's being further off at the Quarters, makes the neap-tides then; but there is another thing considerable in the business, which <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> never considered, and which I fear he never knew; that is, that the spring-tides
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:113554:61"/>
come not just upon the day of the Full and Change, but follow two or three days after (and so do the Neaps too after the Quarters) which is against him, and seems to shake his <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> I mentioned, that makes the Spring-tides and Neaps to fall just on thedays of the Change, Ful and Quarters. To untye this knot, then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the cause why the Spring-tides are at the highest two or three days after the Ful and Change, and not on the very day, &amp;c. is the same with that why the sharpest pinching time of Winter comes not just at the shortest day, when the Sun is at the lowest, but in <hi>January,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Month or five Weeks after: Why also the coldest time of the night is not at mid-night, but about break of day: Why the hottest time of Summer is in <hi>July,</hi> a Month or five Weeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the solstice; and why the hottest time of the day is not just at noon, but about two or three a Clock in the afternoon. To illustrate the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which, let us suppose a large Cistern which hath a Cock towards, or at the bottom of it, that constantly lets out six. Gal. of water (if there be so much in the Cistern) in a certain space of time; and over the Cistern suppose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Cock that conveys Water from some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place into this Cistern, and which runs at first but very slowly, but after by degrees faster and faster, til at length it let in eight Gallons of water in the same space of time that the <hi>cock</hi> below (as we said) lets out six Gallons: And further, let us suppose that the <hi>cock</hi> above, after it hath continued running for some small time
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:113554:62"/>
after the rate of eight Gallons doth decrease, by the same degrees (that befote it encreased by) to seven Gallons, and so to six, five, four, and so less and less, til at length it quite give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver running. There is no man, I think, but wil say, that this Cistern wil be fuller of Water when it hath decreased from eight Gallons, in a space to seven Gallons, and yet fuller when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased to six Gallons and a half, then when it was at seven; and fullest of all just before it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased to six Gallons in a space, because til that time there comes more Water into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern at the one Cock, then there goes out at the other. Even so. though the heat of the Sun sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply considered in its self, be not so great about the middle of <hi>July,</hi> as at the solstice in <hi>June,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is descended lower; yet because the heat that the Sun pours in the air every day, is greater then the cold which his absence causeth by night, nothing can follow thereupon, but an encrease of the heat. And the like may be said of afternoon heats; <hi>January</hi> after-Winters, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning colds, and spring-tides coming behind the Fulls and Changes.</p>
               <p>In the next place, the <hi>Thames</hi> overflowing its banks proceeds from several causes, as from great rains, whereby the fresh Waters encrease up the River, and going down to sea-ward, are encountred by the Flood, whence they must needs swel above their usual height; of which there was a notable example in the year 1555. when by reason of excessive rains that had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, all St. <hi>Georges</hi> Fields in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:113554:62"/>
were overflown. Again, inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Thames</hi> may be caused by boistrous North-west Winds, which cause generally very great Tides, not onely in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and at the mouth of it, but on the coast of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Flanders, Picardy,</hi> and the shores of <hi>England</hi> opposite to them. And this is, because that wind doth with equal force blow in the Tide of flood at both the ends of this Island, Westward and Northward, as is partly touched before. But thirdly, there may be peradventure another cause of great Tides and inundations in the <hi>Thames,</hi> which is not yet commonly taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; and that is, the Moons being in the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeon</hi> of her Eccentrick, or in that part of her Orb which is nearest to the earth. For if (as we said before) the Moons coming nearer the earth at her Ful and Change, make the Spring-Tides, and her withdrawing her self farther from the Earth at her Quarters, make the neap-tides, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it should follow (but I would have it obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved further) that if to the proximiority which the Moon hath to the earth by moving in her <hi>Ellepsis,</hi> there be added that proxiomiority which she hath in her Eccentrick (the Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers call it sometimes her <hi>Opposite Auge</hi>) she should operate so much the more extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily upon the Sea, and make the higher Spring-Tides at such Ful or Change; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that when she is estranged from us by a double elongation, to wit, of the Quarter in her <hi>Ellepsis,</hi> and of her <hi>Auge</hi> in her Eccentrick, she should operate so much the more weakly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:113554:63"/>
then ordinary, and at that quarter make a slack Neap. I have observed it somewhat my self, and found it hit, so far as I was able to judge; but I dare not trust my own single observation, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially because I observed it not long, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could so constantly as I should. There rests onely one doubt in this matter, which I profess I know not what to say to it; and that is, that the Moon comes down lower to the earth in herEc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick, then in her Ellepsis (pardon the odd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the expression, for I confess her Ellipsis is her Eccentrick) and yet her less approxima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at the Ful and Change, make the great Tides, whereas her great Eccentrick approx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imations make less alterations in them without doubt, and (it may be) no alterations at all.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in the <hi>Thames</hi> there happens at some times strange shifting of the Tides, which is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly reckoned a great <hi>Prodigy,</hi> because it happens but seldom; and yet I believe it hath a natural cause, as wel as other common effects, and would be as common as they, if its cause were as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Now for the finding out the cause wee speak of, we shal give you a Catalogue and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of several of these shiftings that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, according to the relation of our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles.</p>

The Historian was onely out in the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1564. <hi>January</hi> the 26. being <hi>Friday</hi> at night were two Tides in two hours, at London-Bridge. The next day were likewise two in the morning, and two at night. On <hi>Sunday January</hi> the 28. were two Tides in the morning, and at night but one (as it used to be) and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1574. <hi>November</hi> the 6. in the morning, there happened two great Tides at <hi>London</hi> in the <hi>Thames;</hi> the first by course, the other within an hour after, which overflowed the Marshes, with many Vaults and Sellers near adjoining.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1608, and 609. <hi>February</hi> the 19. being <hi>Sunday,</hi> it should have been dead low Water at <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> but then it was high Water, and presently it ebbed almost half an hour to a foot depth, and then suddenly it flowed again almost two foot higher then it did before, and then eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed again til it came near the right course; so that the next flood began in a manner as it should, and so continued. All his (saith the <hi>Chronicler</hi>) happened before 12. of the clock at noon, the Weather being in different calm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1609, &amp; 10. <hi>February</hi> the 6. was strange shifting of the Tides in the <hi>Thames</hi> again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1622. &amp; 23. <hi>January</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> being <hi>Friday</hi> in the morning, the <hi>Thames</hi> shifted four Tides within five hours, <hi>viz.</hi> Two Floods, and two Ebbs, and then <hi>kept</hi> its right course. Thus farout of our Chronicles; to which I shal add two other instances that happened of late years. <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:113554:64"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. &amp; 4. on <hi>Candlemas</hi> day the <hi>Thames</hi> ebbed and flowed thrice in six hours; and the like shifting of the Tides was observed in the Maritine places of <hi>Kent</hi> at the same time, as I was assured by many Sea-men.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>Anno</hi> 1656. <hi>Octob.</hi> 3. the River of <hi>Thames</hi> ebbed and flowed twice in three hours. For this we are beholding to C. <hi>Wharton's Gesta Britanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> in his Almanack.</p>
               <p>Which instances if we particularly examine, we shall find, that in all of them the tides were very slack, and in a manner at the very neapest; and (which is not inconsiderable) that in all of them (except two, <hi>viz.</hi> 1574 and 1656. the Moon was in <hi>Apogaeo</hi> about three or four days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the shifting, to make them (if possible) the more neap and slack. And in my Diary of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations for 1654. (in whichyear I was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act observer of the Wind and Weather) I find against the second of <hi>February,</hi> and the days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after it, 1653. &amp; 54. that the Wind blew hard at Northwest. In all the other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples above-named, I cannot inform my self how the Wind was, no not in 1622. &amp; 23. though <hi>Kepler</hi> hath set down the Weather for that year, because he hath said nothing at all of the wind. And in 1656. though I was an observer that year too; yet being in <hi>October</hi> afflicted with a fierce <hi>Quartan,</hi> which had siezed me the <hi>August</hi> before, my observations for that Month are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfect, both as to Wind and Weather too, so that I am at a loss how the Winde was then. Nevertheless, by that little light we have from
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:113554:64"/>
the example mentioned in 1653. &amp; 54. I cannot but think that the cause of the shifting of the Tides is onely the overbearing of their course when they are at their slackest, by a North-west Wind, which is the most powerful Adversarie they can have upon our coasts, as is said before. For if a slow ebb be encountered ful in the teeth with a hard storm, what can follow but a return of the Tide back again? And if the North-west Wind either abate its fierceness, or shift into some other quarters, as the South-west, or North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east for some short time, and then either return to its former place, or resume its former force, and do thus once, twice, and again, (which we know is not inconsistent with the nature and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of the wind off at sea; though at Land its wanderings are not altogether so sensible) we shall easily believe (seeing so plain a reason for it) that there wil be a playing of the Tide to and fro, and several floods and ebbs succeeding one another in a few hours space. And it may be this shifting of the Tides is the more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the <hi>Thames,</hi> because of its gentle ebb to Sea-ward, which is the more easily turned; whereas a swift Current in a River would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over these irregularities. But let further observation be made, how the Wind is disposed at the next shifting of the tides that happens, which (forsome private reasons) I conceive will be in the next year, 1661. if not this Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 1660.</p>
               <p>I forgot to say in its due place, that several great inundations speak in favour of my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:113554:65"/>

                  <hi>Ralph Coggeshall</hi> (an old Author) reports, that near <hi>Oxford,</hi> about the year 1187. a fish in all parts like a man, was taken and kept 6 months in the Castle there, whence he escaped again to sea. Story saith he was taken in a Fisher-mans Net. A story much like this we have in the life of Periskius, written by the learned <hi>Gassendus,</hi> which compared with this, makes me give a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle credit to that which Pliny reports, that a <hi>Triton</hi> or Man-fish was taken on the shore of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and that another was caught in the streights of Gibraltar.

               <p>THis County hath a sharp air, especially in in the <hi>Champian,</hi> and near the Sea, and the Spring and Harvest are late. The soil is in many places good, but it is generally Olayie, or a fat Chalk. And though it be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in some places, yet by compasture of sheep the heaths are made mighty rich for Corn; and when they are laid again from bearing of Corn, they yeild a sweeter and more plentiful feed for sheep. This County also yeilds good store of Honey and Saffron; but the best Saffron is about <hi>Walsingham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inhabitants of this Countrey (as <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> relates) are observed to be naturally very capable of the niceties and quirks of the Law; and those of them that bend their studies that way, prove generally the best Lawyers. They are also (he saith) of a passing good complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>
               <p>In the shore of this County every <hi>September</hi> is a great fishing for Herings, it being the nature of that Fish in great shoals to dance out once a year about our Island, and keep its duetime &amp; season upon the same shores (unless its course
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:113554:68"/>
be a little retarded by storms and foul weather) coming from the Sea into our narrow Seas by the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and going out again by the Lands end of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and taking this shore in its way in <hi>September.</hi> It is reported, that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings are no where more plentiful then on the coast of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The River <hi>Bure</hi> in this shire is incredibly full of fish. For the finding out the cause of this, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry should be made what kind of soil the head springs issue from, and what kind of shore it wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes. Generally the slowest Rivers (<hi>caeteris pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>) are fullest of fish. And this I take to be one reason why the <hi>Thames</hi> is more pisculent, or ful of fish then the <hi>Severn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The River <hi>Yare</hi> by <hi>Norwich</hi> is very full of a kind of fish called Ruffes, which (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) have a body all over rough with sharp &amp; pricky fins. It delights in sandy places like the <hi>Perch,</hi> and is as big; in colour brown and duskish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, but of a palish yellow beneath: it is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the chaws with a double course of half circles; the eye for the upper half of it is of a dark brown; for the nether part of it somewhat yellowish, the ball of it black; and there is a line goes along the back, which is fastened to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as it were with an overthwart thred; it is all spotted over the tail and fins with black spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles; when the fish is angry, the finnes stand up stiff; and after its anger is over, they fall flat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. It is a very wholesom Fish, and eats tender and short, and tastes like a Perch. One cause of its tenderness I conceive to be its roughness
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:113554:68"/>
without, and the sharp prickliness of its finnes. Even as it is probable that the tenderness of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison is caused by the seperation of so great a quantity of hard matter, as the hornes of the beast consist of, from the Mass of the body. This <hi>Ruffe</hi> is a very rare fish to be found in other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Query, whether the banks of Rivers that produce peculiar fish, do not produce peculiar plants, because the peculiarity of the fish seems to proceed from a peculiar tincture of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which it cannot have but from the earth.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Bennets</hi> in the <hi>Holm</hi> hath such fenny and rotten ground about it, that (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) if a man cut up the Roots or Strings of Trees, &amp;c. it floteth aloft on the Water, and follows one whithersoever he pleases. Hereabouts also are Cockles and Periwinkles sometimes digged up out of the earth, which makes some think that formerly it was overflowed with the sea.</p>

The <hi>Italians</hi> make a delicate dish of them, taking a <hi>Lamprey,</hi> and killing it in <hi>Malmesey:</hi> they close the mouth with a Nutmeg, and fill all the holes with as many cloves: then they roll it up, and put <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>-Nut-kernels stamped, crums of bread, oyle, Malmesey, and Spices to it, and so they boile it with great care, and then turn it over a soft gentle fire of Coals in a frying pan. <hi>The reason why Seavern affords Lampreys I conceive is its muddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Lamprey being a kind of Eele, that breeds and delights in mire.

               <p>At <hi>Droitwich</hi> are three Fountains of Salt water divided by a little Brook of fresh water passing between; by the boiling of which Salt water they make pure white Salt. <hi>Gervase</hi> of <hi>Tilbury</hi> (an Historian not rashly to be credited) saith, that these salt Springs are most salt between Christmas and Midsummer; and that the rest of the year they are somewhat fresh, and not so good to make
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:113554:74"/>
Salt of; and that when the Salt water is run suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for the use of the Country, the Springs do scarce overflow to any wast; and that at the greatestSaltness of it, it is not allayed by the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the fresh water to it; and lastly, that it is found no where near the Sea, <hi>Cambden</hi> doubts the truth of some of these affirmations, but of which he saith not: Onely he saith, that the Salt is made from Midsummer to Midwinter, which is quite contrary to <hi>Gervase.</hi> Indeed if there be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the saltness of these waters in severall times of the year, they should I think, be fresher from Christmas to Midsummer; because that half year all Springs (but land Springs) are highest, &amp; run most plentifully, by reason of the great wet season immediately foregoing, which must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more dilute the salt. And on the contrary the Springs between Midsummer and Christmas must be the lower, because of the drought just prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I have heard Masons in <hi>Kent,</hi> that used to dig wells, say, that the Springs that feed their wells, are lowest about <hi>Alhollantide,</hi> and highest between Easter and Whitsuntide, for the very same reason I could wish some ingenuous native would bestow upon us, the perfect History of these Salt Springs in <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> and <hi>Cheshire.</hi> Some Philosophers trouble themselvs much about the cause of the Saltness of the Sea. I think it needs not so much puzzle and ado. If there bee salt Springs that run continually into the Sea, and no part of the saltness of the water (but that which is meer fresh) ascend in vapour at the Suns call, why should not the Sea be, and continue salt.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:113554:74"/>
There would rather be more fear, lest the Sea should grow salter and salter, by these Springs continually running into it, but that the <hi>Salinae</hi> on severall shores of the world do rob it every day, besides other losses it sustains, and escapes that it makes through private passages in the earth.</p>

And Fish, whereof the River of <hi>Trent</hi> is full. The meadows of this shire are so moistned withstreams and rivers runningby them, that they look green in the middle of winter.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Pensneth Chase</hi> is a Coal-Pit, which (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) was set on fire by a Candle through the negligence of a digger, the smoak of it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly seen, and sometimes the flame.</p>

               <p>In this shire there runs a hill a long, and so through the middle of <hi>England</hi> as far as <hi>Scotland,</hi> like the <hi>Apennine</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>

               <p>The people about <hi>Wotton</hi> by <hi>Wolverhil</hi> in <hi>Moreland</hi> observe, that when the wind sets West, it always produces rain; but the East and South wind, which elsewhere brew and bring rain, here bring fair weather; unless the wind turn from the West into the South; and this they ascribe to the nearness of the Irish Seas. This observation I fear is somewhat imperfect, and should be driven a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further by men able to make observation.</p>
               <p>If the River <hi>Dove</hi> overflow its banks, and run into the adjoyning meadows in <hi>Aprill,</hi> it makes them extream fruitfull. The reason of this is plain enough without further enquiry. Indeed some Rivers overflowing their banks enrich more, and others less, according to the fatness or hungryness of their water.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Dove</hi> uses to rise extreamly within twelve hours space, but it will within the space of twelve hours return again within its banks: but <hi>Trent</hi> being once up, and over its banks, flows o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the fields four or five days together, ere the supersluous waters can get away. Of this wee have given an account already, speaking of the <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Seavern.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gervase</hi> of <hi>Tilbury</hi> tells us of another Lake in this shire, called <hi>Mahall,</hi> near a village called <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalea,</hi> which if hunters when they and their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are tired do drink of, and give their horses of it, though it be in the hottest, and most scorching weather; they both become presently as fresh, as if they had not run at all. Likely to be as true as the former.</p>

               <p>IN this Shire upon the East and South parts the air is thick and foggy because of the <hi>Fennes,</hi> &amp;c. yet very moderate and mild; and the winds, that come from the raging Seas disperse those vapours, that they cannot much hurt.

Here are also many quicksands, which have a wonderfull force both to draw to them, and to hold fast that which they have drawn. Moreover the people here have no fresh water, but only rain water, and that in pits. Which if they be deep; becomes brackish presently; And if they be shallow they dry up as soon.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Barton</hi> upon <hi>Humber</hi> are abundance of <hi>Pewits, Godwits, Knots,</hi> (which are so called from <hi>Cnule</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> and are thought to have flown hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>Denmark</hi>) and <hi>Dottrells,</hi> a sim ple kind of bird, much given to imitating. These <hi>Dottrells</hi> are caught by Candle light in this manner. The Fowler stands before the bird, and if hee put out an arm, the bird stretcheth out a wing: If hee holds out his head, or set forward his leg, the bird

doth the like, and imitates the Fowlers gesture so long, till the Fowler drawing nearer and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by degrees, at length throws his net over him, and takes him.</p>

               <p>In the year 1551. <hi>Aprill</hi> the 15. the English sweating sickness brake forth first at <hi>Shresbury,</hi> and so dispersed it self over the whole land, and killed abundance, especially middle-aged people. The first time of this sweating sickness was in the year 1485, saith <hi>Cambden,</hi> a little after a great <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the Superiour Planets in <hi>Scropio.</hi> The second time (but more mildly, yet the Plague ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied it) was <hi>Anno</hi> 1518, being 33 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, upon a great <hi>Opposition</hi> of the same Planets in <hi>Scorpio</hi> and <hi>Taurus,</hi> when it also plagued the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> and high <hi>Germany</hi> too. And the 3 time was 33 years after that again, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1551. the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:113554:77"/>
year now spoken of, when another <hi>Conjunction</hi> of those Planets in <hi>Scorpio</hi> took its effects, but we must crave leave to tell <hi>Cambden,</hi> that his pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of 33 years is not so; for the middle sweat was not in 1518, as he affirms it, but in 1517 as both <hi>Godwin</hi> and <hi>Stow</hi> tell us; though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, the Plague was in 1518. So that then there will be instead of 33 and 33, 32 and 34. And that which will do this revolution more mischief is, that there was a fourth sweat between the years 1517 and 1551, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1528, which <hi>Cambden</hi> never mentions; besides another fift sweat, that (if I be not mistaken) happened before 1517. Moreover whereas <hi>Cambden</hi> saith, that the sweat 1485 was a little after a great <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the superiour Planets in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> if by the superiour Planets he mean all the three, <hi>Saturn, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> that was not so. For neither did <hi>Saturn Jupiter Mars</hi> meet in the same degree of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> nor were all the three <hi>Conjunctions,</hi> which these three Planets made at that turn in <hi>Scorpio.</hi> It is true indeed the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> of <hi>Saturn, &amp; Mars,</hi> was in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> about the <hi>12th</hi> degree; but it was in <hi>November</hi> 1483, almost 2 years before that sweat which began in <hi>September</hi> 1485; And the <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of <hi>Saturn, &amp; Jupiter</hi> was in <hi>Scorpio</hi> too, about the <hi>20th</hi> degree, but that was almost a year before the sweat too, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>Alhollanday</hi> 1484: But as for the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> of <hi>Saturn, &amp; Mars,</hi> that fell not in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> but about the 25 degree of <hi>Libra,</hi> and about <hi>Alhollandtide</hi> 1483, not far distant from the time of the <hi>Conjunct.</hi> of <hi>Saturn, &amp; Mars;</hi> so that the sweat was neither after a <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:113554:78"/>
Planets in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> nor a little after any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of them. Again, neither was the sweat 1517. upon a great <hi>Opposition</hi> of the same Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in <hi>Scorpio</hi> and <hi>Taurus,</hi> for the opposition of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which happened in <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Scorpio,</hi> were all three of them in 1513. and 1514. and so was the opposition of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Scorp.</hi> in <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1513. about the first degree of those two signs. And for the opposition of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> and conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> which we grant happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in one year, and during <hi>Saturn</hi> his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in <hi>Scorp.</hi> too, they both fell in 1513. the one in <hi>March,</hi> and the other in <hi>December</hi> following. Nor let it startle any one that a conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and opposition of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> should happen both, during <hi>Saturn</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Scorpio;</hi> for those that know any thing in <hi>Astronomy,</hi> must needs know that <hi>Saturn</hi> never passeth through any sign (no not <hi>Gemini</hi> where he moveth swistest, because in <hi>Perihelio</hi>) but <hi>Mars</hi> gives him a conjunction and opposition constantly, before he can get out of it; nay sometimes he gives him two conjunctions, and sometimes three, beside the opposition, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he be near his <hi>Aphelium,</hi> as he is in <hi>Scorpio;</hi> and yet now he did not. Nor lastly, let any man start at the three oppositions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that happened in 1513. and 1514. for all <hi>Astronomers</hi> know, that it is a very rare thing (or rather impossible) for an opposition of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> to happen single, they happening constantly every twenty years, and as constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:113554:78"/>
by threes, of which the reason is plain to any versed in Calculations. So that it remains, that the Sweat 1517. neither followed upon such an opposition of the Planets, nor near it. Lastly, whereas he sayes, that the Sweat 1551. was when another conjunction of those Planets in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> took its effects, this is wider from the truth then all the rest; for there was no conjunction of the Superiors within six years of this Sweat: For example, the conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> in 28. of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> happened in <hi>September</hi> 1544 and the conjunction of <hi>Jupiter &amp; Mars,</hi> happened in the 27. deg. of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1543. and 44. And for conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> there happened none that year, (for the conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> that was, fell in the beginning of <hi>Sagitarius</hi>) though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess there fell (to admiration) three conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> in the yeare 1542. (A very rare thing indeed, such a triple conjunction of those planets having never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened since till the year 1640.) But how Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions should work seven or nine years after their celebration, and not before, is a secret in <hi>Astrology</hi> that I yet understand not. In the year 1632. was indeed a very great opposition of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Scorpio,</hi> the two Malevolents in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> opposing <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Taurus,</hi> the conjunction and two oppositions happening very near together; yet there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the years following, no such sweat as is pretended to be the effect of such conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and oppositions; so that the Astrological
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:113554:79"/>
cause of those contagious sweats lyes yet in the darke. I would adventure something toward it here, but that it requires a distinct Treatise by it self. <hi>Fracastorius</hi> attributes this sweating sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Plaistriness of the soil here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (and yet it is so but in few places) and to the moistness of the weather in those years; but why it doth not reign constantly in such kind of soil in wet years, he saith not. <hi>Cambden</hi> thinkes that this contagion hath been long before 1485 as rife in <hi>England</hi> as since, although it be not mentioned by Historians; that is not impossible indeed, for for that last Age wherein <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> did use to meet in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> our Chronicles are very empty and uncertain.</p>
               <p>Eclipses of the <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>Aries</hi> (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) have been most dangerous to <hi>Oswestry;</hi> for in the year 1542, and 1567. when the Eclipses of the <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>Aries,</hi> wrought their effects, it suffered great loss by fire; but most of all after this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eclips; for there were then about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred houses burnt. A good observation indeed, but our Author observed not all; for that which is most remarkable is, that those two Eclipses happened within two degrees one of the other; so that it may be the <hi>Ascendent</hi> of <hi>Oswestry</hi> (as <hi>Astrologers</hi> speak) is about the 27. deg. of <hi>Aries.</hi> And peradventure the reason why the late E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse of the <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>Aries, viz. 1652. March 29.</hi> had no influence upon <hi>Oswestry,</hi> was because it happened in the 19. deg. of <hi>Aries,</hi> 8. deg. distant from its <hi>Ascendent.</hi> This is further observable, (and it looks as if there were something in it)
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:113554:79"/>
that in 1567. when <hi>Oswestry</hi> was burnt, <hi>Milnall</hi> in <hi>Suffolk</hi> was burnt too; and that though the Eclips in <hi>Aries</hi> 1652. had nothing to do with them (perhaps for the reason above given) yet within the time (that <hi>Astrologers</hi> limit the effects of Eclipses) two Towns in the same Shires, <hi>viz. Bungay</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Drayton</hi> in <hi>Shropshire,</hi> were burnt; as if there were a way to trace <hi>Ascendents</hi> from one Town to another, and as if the <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> of near places were not far asunder. But <hi>nihil temere statuendum de paucis;</hi> enquire farther, and see what I have written in my <hi>Syzygiasticon Instauratum,</hi> (published <hi>Anno</hi> 1653.) where I have treated of the <hi>Ascendents</hi> of Towns in general, and of the <hi>Ascendent</hi> of <hi>Teverton</hi> in <hi>Devonshire</hi> in particular. Query also, whether in <hi>February,</hi> 1655.56. any thing extraordinary happened to the Town of <hi>Oswestry,</hi> upon the conjunction of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> in 25. degrees of <hi>Aries.</hi>

               <p>THe air of this Shire is so healthful, that the Inhabitants generally live very long. And the warm vapors rising from the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> Seas, do sooner melt the snow and ice in this County, then in places further off. The soil is very rich, yet observed to be more kindly and natural for Cheese, then Corn; and it is thought that it is the soil, and not the skill of the Dairy-Woman, that makes the Cheese so excellent, the best in <hi>Europe.</hi> Both men and women here, have a general commendation for beauty and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some proportion. This shire (saith <hi>Speed</hi>) yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Salt, Metals, Mines, and Meres.</p>
               <p>In the River <hi>Dee</hi> is great plenty of Salmons. <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis,</hi> who lived about the yeare 1200, saith, that this River foreshewed a sure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Victory to the inhabitants living upon it, when they were in open hostility one shore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other, according as it inclined more to this side, or to that, after it had left the Channel. And the relator doth in some sort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and so may any one else if he please.</p>
               <p>This River <hi>Dee</hi> upon the fall of much Rain riseth but little; but as often as the south-wind
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:113554:80"/>
beats long upon it, it swells and overflows the grounds adjoining extremely. This River is a very streight and broad river to sea-ward, so that what rain falls, hath an easie and quick passage out. But if the South-wind blow long, the River must needs swell much, because no wind hath so much power on the <hi>Irish</hi> seas, as that, because it blows right in upon it between the coasts of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and must needs swell and roll it so much the more, for that it brings the sea still in, which having not so free a passage quite through by reason of the narrow streight between <hi>Scotland</hi> and the North of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> still returns back, where it meets with a fresh supply of Waters continually coming in: Now the <hi>Irish</hi> sea thus swelling, will have easie and ready admission into a streight River.</p>
               <p>In the low places on the south side of <hi>Cheshire,</hi> by the River <hi>Wever,</hi> Trees are oftentimes found by digging under ground; which people think have lien buried there ever since <hi>Noah's</hi> Flood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nantwich, Northwich,</hi> and <hi>Middlewich,</hi> are the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Salt pits of this Shire, being 5. or 6. miles asunder. The whitest Salt is made at <hi>Nantwich,</hi> which (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) hath but one Pit about some 14. foot from the River, out of which they conveigh Salt-Water by troughs of Wood into the Houses adjoining, where there stand little Barrels pitched fast in the ground; which they fill with the Water, and then make fire under the Leads, whereof they have six in a house, and in them they seeth the Water. Then with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:113554:81"/>
little wooden rakes they fetch up the Salt from the botom, and put it in baskets, out of which the Liquor runs, and the pure salt remains. The Salt pit at <hi>Northwich</hi> is very near the brink of the River <hi>Dan,</hi> being a very deep and plentiful pit. Quaere, whether the Rivers <hi>Wever</hi> and <hi>Dan</hi> be themselves salt at these two places. The two salt Wells at <hi>Middlewich,</hi> are parted one from the other by a small brook of fresh Water.</p>
               <p>It is reported, that there are Trees that flote in <hi>Bagmere,</hi> (a Mere so called, near the seat of the Family of the <hi>Breretons</hi>) against the death of any of the heirs of the <hi>Breretons;</hi> and after the heir is dead, they sink, and are never seen more till the next occasion. <hi>Cambden</hi> saith, that this story is verified upon the credit of many credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persons; and that these bodies of trees swim for certain dayes together, and may be seen of any body: And he seconds it with another sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this purpose. <hi>Leonardus Vairus</hi> (saith he) reports from the testimony of Cardinal <hi>Gravel,</hi> that near the Abbey of St. <hi>Maurice</hi> in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> is a Fish-pond, into which are fishes put accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of the <hi>Monks</hi> of that place, and if any one of them happen to be sick, there is a fish seen also to flote and swim above the water half dead: And if the <hi>Monk</hi> shall dye, the said fish will dye too, some few days before him. Thus <hi>Cambden:</hi> who gives so much credit to these stories, that he thinks they are the Works of Angels. But so doth not <hi>Speed,</hi> who thinks it to be but a conceit, and a fable; as he doth also the prophesie of <hi>Leyland</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:113554:81"/>
                  <hi>Beeston</hi> Castle mounted upon a steep hill; The Castle being ruinated, <hi>Leyland</hi> prophesied of it in his time, (thus) that it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>The day shall come when it again shall mount his head aloft;</l>
                  <l>If I a Prophet may be heard, from Seers that say so oft.</l>
               </lg>

                  <hi>July</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> being <hi>Wednesday</hi> 1657. about three of the clock, in the parish of <hi>Bickley,</hi> was heard a very great noise like Thunder afar off, which was much wondred at, because the skye was clear, and no appearance of a Cloud. Shortly after (saith the Author of this relation) a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:113554:82"/>
comes to me, and told me I should see a very strange thing, if I would go with him. So coming into a field called the <hi>Layfeild,</hi> we found a very great bank of earth which had many tall Oakes growing on it, quite sunk under the ground, Trees and all. At first we durst not go near it, because the earth for near twenty yards round about, is exceeding much rent, and seems ready to fall in; but sinee that time my self and some others by Ropes have ventured to see the bottom, I mean, to go to the brink, so as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the visible bottom, which is Water, and conceived to be about 30. yards from us, under which is sunk all the earth about it for sixteen yards round at least, three tall Oaks, a very tall Awber, and certain other small Trees, and not a sprig of them to be seen above water. Four or five Oaks more are expected to fall every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a great quantity of Land is like to fall, indeed never ceasing more or less; and when any considerable clod falls, it is much like the report of a Canon. We can discern the ground hollow above the Water a very great depth; but how far hollow, or how deep, is not to be found out by man: Of this we have said somewhat in <hi>Kent.</hi> Some of the water, (as I have been told) was drawn out of this pit with a bucket, and they found it to be as salt as sea-water; whence some imagine, that there are certain large pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages there, into which the sea flows under ground; but I rather think, that this salt water is no more but that which issues from those salt springs about <hi>Nantwitch,</hi> and other places in this
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:113554:82"/>
shire. Query, whether those Trees that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said to be digged up in some places herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, were not buried in the earth by some such sinking as this. I am told, that about <hi>Bickley</hi> the soil is a very soul miry clay, that there is hardly any travelling that way in the winter time. If so, I conceive then, that under this upper Clay lyes a mouldring washy Clay, or Sand, which is carried away by degrees by the course of Springs (as we said before of <hi>Motingham</hi>) and that this <hi>July</hi> being the dryest part of Summer, and this Summer 1657. being an extream hot and dry Summer, (the hottest and dryest I ever knew) this Clayie ground did chap (as it is the nature of Clay to do in dry hot weather, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the most rotten and miry Clay, as we see in Marshes) and divide it self from the rest of the ground near it, to which, and to its fall, the hollowness underueath, and the weight of the tall Oaks above did much contribute.</p>

               <p>In the year 1571. <hi>Marcley hill</hi> in the East part of the shire, with a roaring noise removed it self from the place where it stood, and for three days together travelled from its old seat.

cotes, hedge-rows, and Trees, whereof some were overturned, and some that stood upon the plain, are firmly growing upon the hill. Those that were East, were turned West, and those in the West were set in the East. In this remove it overthrew <hi>Kinnaston</hi> Chappel, and turned two High-wayes near a hundred yards from their old pathes The ground that thus removed was about 26. acres, which opening it selfe with Rocks and all, bore the earth before it for four hundred yards space, without any stay, leaving Pasturage in place of the Tillage, and the Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage overspread with Pasturage.

They say likewise that at the end of Winter, when after a long frost the ice of this lake breaks, it makes a fearful noise like thunder.

               <p>In the Rocks in this shire there breeds a rare kind of <hi>Falcon,</hi> which is thus described. The head is flat and low, the feathers laid in rows. the legs pale and wan, the claws slender, and wide spread, and the bill soaked round.</p>
               <p>About 300 years ago it is reported, that for 5 generations the Father of the Family in the Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Pembroke</hi> (their name was <hi>Hastings</hi>) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw his son.</p>
               <p>At the time when <hi>Henry</hi> the second made his abode in <hi>Ireland</hi> were extraodinary violent, and lasting storms of wind and weather, so that the sandy shore on the coast of this shire was laid bare to the very hard ground, which had lien hid for many ages. And by further search the people found great Trunks of Trees, which when they had digged up, they were apparently lopped, so
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:113554:87"/>
that one might see the stroaks of the Axe upon them, as if they had been given but the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The earth looked very black, and the wood of these Trunks was altogether like <hi>Ebony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the first discovery made by these storms, the Trees (we speak of) lay so thick, that the whole shore seemed nothing but a lopped grove. Whence may be gathered; that the Sea hath overflowed much land on this coast; Asit hath indeed on the shores of many Countries bordering upon the Sea; which is to be chiefly imputed to the ignorance of the <hi>Britans</hi> and other barbarous Nations, who were long without the knowledge of Arts, and understood not those ways to repress the fury of the Sea, which now we do. For without doubt since the knowing age of the World the Sea hath not gained upon the land one quarter of that it did before.</p>

The <hi>Salmon</hi> coveteth to get into fresh water Rivers to spawn; and when he comes to places where the water falls down right from some high places (and some such places there be in many Rivers) he useth this policy. He bends himself backward, and takes his tail in his mouth, and with all his force unloosing his circle on a sudden (like a lath let go) he mounteth up before the fall of the stream. And therefore these downright falls (or little Catarracts) of water are called the <hi>Salmons</hi> Leap.</p>

               <p>THe air of this shire is sharp and piercing Here are extraordinary high hills (the highest in all <hi>Wales</hi>) on some of which the Snow lyes long, and on others it lyes all the year long hard crusted together. A thing not at all to be wondred at, since on the Alps, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Mountains much more southerly then our Island, it doth the like. The consideration of which hath bred an opinion in me, that the Globe of the Earth and Sea is of an Elliptick, or Oval form; that is, like an Egg. And my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is this: I suppose that every yeare under both the Poles, there falls a quantity of snow, (either little or much, in the time of the suns being at the contrary Tropick, and likely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at other times of the year too) which the Sun when he hath greatest power upon it, cannot melt all. And this is more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because not only in <hi>Greenland,</hi> but also here in this shire,and (if we wil believe <hi>Munster</hi>) on the top of the Alps too, there are Mountainous Crusts of frozen snow that never were melted. So that now after so many years lapse it cannot be, I think, but that the Diameter of the earth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:113554:90"/>
from pole to pole, from the top of the snow at one end of the earth, to the top of it at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, is much longer then in any part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Equator, though at the Creation it were (as I believe) made spherical. And so I suppose in longer process of time it will grow more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. And as it so increaseth in length, so I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the sea will decrease in depth, (tho gh both very insensibly) because snow must consist of something, and that something can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a watry vapour condensed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, &amp;c. And this watry vapour must be drawn out of the sea, or out of that part of the earth which once (sooner or later) received it from the sea: And this snow being thrown down at the Poles, and not melting, that so it may return from whence it came, and re-fil that which is emptied, must needs caufe a decrease in the sea. Now that which tempts me to embrace this Paradox the more affectionately, is, for that it serves excellently well to solve a great doubt, which troubled <hi>Tycho</hi> and <hi>Keppler,</hi> about centrel Eclipses of the Moon, that happen near the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, such as that was which <hi>Tycho</hi> observed in the year 1588. and that which <hi>Keppler</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the yeare 1624. concerning which hee speaks to this purpose. <hi>Notandum est hanc Lunae Eclipsin (instar illius, quam</hi> Tycho, <hi>anno</hi> 1588. <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servavit, totalem, &amp; proximam centrali) egregie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum fefellisse. Nam non solum mora totius Lunae in tenebris brevis fuit, sed &amp; duratio reliqua multo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis. Perinde quasi Tellus Elliptica esset, dimetientem breviorem habens sub AEquatore longiorem à Polo uno

ad alterum:</hi> that is, We must note that this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse of the Moon (<hi>viz.</hi> that on the 26. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, stylo Novo,</hi> 1624. like that which <hi>Tycho</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the year 1588. being a total, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most centrel one, did notoriously deceive my calculation; for not onely the duration of the total obscurity was short, but also the rest of the duration before and after the total obscurity much shorter; as if (saith he) the Earth were El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liptical, having a shorter Diameter under the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, then from one Pole to another. And yet I am not so devoted to my own fancies, but that one solid reason shall prevail with me to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the dearest of them, though for the present I see abundance of reason for what I think.</p>
               <p>In some places of this shire are bred certain Shel-fish, which being produced (saith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) by an heavenly dew, bring forth Pearls.</p>
               <p>In the Pool called <hi>Lin-paris,</hi> there is (as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) a kind of fish called <hi>Torcoch,</hi> having a red belly, which is no where else to be seen but here.</p>
               <p>It is said also, that on the high hills of this shire are two Meres, one of which produceth fish that have but one eye; and in the other is a moveable and floting Island, which as soon as a man treads on, it presently flotes a great way off.

they are so coated with that snowy crust that lyes on them, that if a man do but lightly set his foot any where on the top ofthe Mountains, he shal perceive the earth to stir the length of a stones cast from him; which I suppose might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion the fable of the Floting Island mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but now.</p>

To this doth that of <hi>St. Ambrose</hi> agree, where he saith, that Fishes in infinite numbers swim together, and make towards the blasts of the North wind, and by a certain instinct of nature hasten into the Sea of the North parts; And thus (saith he) they swim through <hi>Propontis</hi> into <hi>Pontus Euxinus.</hi>

               <p>At <hi>Skengrave</hi> a little Village in <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> in the Northriding of the shire, about the year 1535. a Triton or Manfish was taken, as it is reported, that for certain days together fed upon raw fish, but espying his opportunity he got away to Sea again, ans was seen no more.</p>
               <p>Upon this shore by <hi>Skengrave,</hi> whensoever it is calme, and the Sea (as it were) levell, there is heard many times on a sudden an horrible and fearfull groaning, as it were a great way off, at which time the fishermen dare not lanch out into the deep.</p>
               <p>Near unto <hi>Hunt-cliffe</hi> upon the same shore (and not far from the shore) there appear certain Rocks, about which the Seal-fishes meet together to sleep and Sun themselves. And upon that Rock that is next the shore, one of the Seals lyes to keep Centinell; and as any man approacheth, he either throws down a big stone, or tumble himselfe into the water with a great noise, as a signall to the rest to awake, and get into the water. They are not afraid of women, but onely of men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that will catch them, put on womens apparell. When they are chased by men, if they be destitute of water, they will with their hinder feet fling backward a cloud of sand and gravell in the faces and eyes of their pursuers; Yea, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:113554:96"/>
many times drive them away, making them weary of their design by this means.</p>
               <p>Upon the same shore are found stones, some yellow, some reddish, some with a rough cast crust over them of a Salt matter; which by their smell and tast make shew of Copperas, Nitre and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. Here are also great store of Marcasites in colour resembling brass.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Huntly Nab</hi> at the roots of the craggy Rocks, that are there upon the shore, there lye stonesskatt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering here and there, of diverse bignesses, so arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially (and yet naturally) round, that one would think they had been turned for shot for great Ordnance. In which, if you break them, you shall find stony Serpents wrapped round (that is, just in the forme of the <hi>Aderley</hi> and <hi>Keynsham</hi> snakes) but most of them are headless. The way to break them is by heating them red hot in the fire, and then quenching them in cold water; for by that means they will fall asunder of themselves. These stones (if that which I have be of this sort, and he that gave it me assured me it was) are within of a pellucid whitish matter like Alabaster, though not so white, and are on the out side cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with a coat so absolutely like brass, that I think they cannot be distinguished. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form of them is just like the <hi>Glocestershire</hi> stones, with a spine and ribbs. The stone that I have is about an inch in Diameter, but I have seen two or three more, that were near two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Diameter. I have another stone somewhat like this I speak of, but it is not above a Barley corn in Diameter. It hath a brassy coat, and is
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:113554:97"/>
wreathed snake-like, as the other: But it is not pellucid within, nor so light coloured; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it hath no Spine, but instead of it four rows of prickles very curiously wrought; and it is much bigger toward the head, and lesser at the taile, then the other. Whether it were found at the same. place with the other I know not, neither did the giver tell me. There is a place in Provence in <hi>France,</hi> near the mouth of the Rhosne, called the Stone field where several acres are covered with such stones exactly round, (&amp; the like is in the Island <hi>Cuba</hi> in <hi>America</hi>) but whether there be Serpents in them or no, I never heard nor read.</p>

               <p>The East part of the County yields a great plenty of Coale, and yet where it hath plenty of it, it is likewise fruitfull and good land.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Egleston</hi> is a Marble quarry.</p>
               <p>Near <hi>Darlington,</hi> whose waters are warm (hot
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:113554:98"/>
saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) and by an Antiperistasis, or rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration of the cold air) are three pits wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deep, called Hell kettles. These are thought to come of an earthquake, that happened <hi>Anno</hi> 1179. For on Christmas day (say our Chronicles) at <hi>Oxenhall</hi> (which is this place) the ground hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved up alost like a Tower, and so continued all that day as it were immovable till evening, and then fell in with a very horrible noise, and the earth swallowed it up, and made in the same place three deep pits.</p>
               <p>It is reported that Bishop <hi>Tunstall</hi> put a Goose into one of those pits, having first given her a mark; and the same Goose was found in the River <hi>Tees,</hi> so that it seems these Kettles have passages under ground.</p>

               <p>THe air of this County is thin and piercing, not troubled with gross mists or fogs. And the people are very comly, healthfull and long lived, and not subject to strange diseases. The soile is not very fruitfull, yet it breeds great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Cattle, that are of huge proportion, and have goodly heads and large spread horns. Here is also fish and fowle on the Sea coasts in good plenty, and in other places of the shire the like store of Coals, and a competent increase of flax. Where the ground is plain, it is good for wheat, and barley; that which lyes at the bottome of hils is better for oats.</p>
               <p>Along the Sea side in many places lye heaps of Sand, upon which the people pour water till it contract a saltish humour from the sand; and thus they boile with turfs, till it become white salt.</p>
               <p>This shire in divers places suffereth much by the flowing fury of the Sea, as in <hi>Fourness,</hi> much of which the Sea hath eaten away by little and little. The cause is plain. For who can expect less, where a shore full of quicksands (as this is) is washed, and beaten upon by a Sea, hardly ever quiet, such
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:113554:99"/>
as every one knows the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea is, unless it be sometimes in Summer.</p>
               <p>Not far from <hi>Fourness Felles</hi> lyes the greatest standing Water of <hi>England,</hi> called <hi>Winander Meere,</hi> which is wonderfull deep, and ten miles over, and all paved (as it were) in the bottome. <hi>There are many such places in England, that are naturally paved. When I went to</hi> Keynsham (<hi>by</hi> Bristol), <hi>to search for the snake-stones, there I found the Lane (where they are) as it were all paved with broad hard stones, and the fnakes lying upon the middle of the surface of the stones. We have also in some places of</hi> Kent <hi>such natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pavements; And such I take stone-streets by</hi> Hithe <hi>to be if it were not a work of the Romans.</hi>

               <p>The Mosses in this shire are very unwholesome places to live in. If the upper coat of this mossie earth be pared away, it yields fat turfes for fewel, and sometimes trees, that have lien long under ground as it is thought; unless they grew there, which is unlikely. In diverse places also these mosses underneath afford abundance of Marle to enrich land with.</p>
               <p>On the banks of the River <hi>Irwell</hi> is a kind of red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish stone.</p>

               <p>By <hi>Chatmoss</hi> in this shire is a low mossey ground, very large, a great part of which (saith <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>) not long ago, the Brooks swelling high, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quite away with them, whereby the Rivers
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:113554:100"/>
were corrupted, and a number of fresh fish perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In which place now lyes a low vale watered with a little Brook, where trees have been digged up, lying along, which are supposed by some to have come thus. The channels of the Brooks being not scoured, the Brooks have risen, and made all the land moorish; that lay lower then others. Whereby the roots of the trees being loosened by reason of the bogginess of the ground, or by the water finding a passage under ground, the trees have either by their own weight, or by some storm being blown down, and so sunk into that soft earth, and been swallowed up. For it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, that trees are no where digged out of the earth, but where the earth is boggy; And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon hils, such moorish and moist grounds are commonly found. The wood of these trees burns very bright and clear like torchwood (which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is by reason of the Bitumenous earth, in which they have been so long) so that some think them to be Firre Trees, but it is not so saith <hi>Cambden.</hi> Such mighty trees are often found in <hi>Holland,</hi> which are thought to be undermined by the waves working into the shire, or by winds dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forward, and brought to those lower places, where they settled and sunk. But Querie (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) whether they be not subterraneous Trees, growing under ground, as well as plants, and other creatures.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Ferneby</hi> the people use Turfs for fire and candle both. And when they dig them, they find under them a certain dead &amp; blackish water, upon which swimms a kind of fat oily matter, and in it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:113554:100"/>
there are little flshes, which the diggers take. And just in the same manner (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) fishes are digged out of the earth at <hi>Heraclea,</hi> and <hi>Tios</hi> in <hi>Pontus.</hi> But that which is much stranger, is, that in <hi>Paphlagonia</hi> many, and those very good fishes are gotten by digging in places nothing waterish; but (saith he) this is a secret in nature.</p>
               <p>On the very top of <hi>Pendle-hill</hi> grows a peculiar plant, called <hi>Cloudesberry,</hi> as though it came out of the clouds. This hill (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) lately did the country much harm near it, by reason of an extraordinary deal of water gushing out of it.

               <p>In the Province of <hi>Coile</hi> (saith <hi>Ortelius</hi>) about ten Miles from <hi>Aire,</hi> is a stone hardly twelve
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:113554:104"/>
foot high, and 33. cubits thick, called the <hi>Deaf Rock</hi> on the one side of which, though you make never so great a noise, nay if you shoot off a piece of Ordinance, it shall hardly be heard on the other side, except you be a good way off from it, and then the sound may easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Buqhan</hi> Rats are never seen: And if any be brought in thither, they wil not live:</p>
               <p>This Country of <hi>Buqhan</hi> yeilds the finest Wool in all <hi>Scotland:</hi> And <hi>Lorn</hi> the best barley.</p>
               <p>The Rivers of the coast of <hi>Buqhan</hi> are wel sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Salmon,</hi> and yet they never enter into the River <hi>Ratra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the banks of this River <hi>Ratra,</hi> in <hi>Buqhan,</hi> is a Cave near unto <hi>Stanys Castle,</hi> in which is Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which dropping out of a natural Vault, presently turneth into Pyramidal stones, of a middle nature, between ice and hard stone. It is brittle and crumbling, and never cometh to the hardness of Marble: And if the Cave were not rid of these stones, as they fall, the whole Cave would shortly be filled.</p>
               <p>The Water of the River <hi>Nessa,</hi> and of the <hi>Lough-Nessa,</hi> is alwayes warm, and never free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lough-Lomund</hi> is about 20. or 24. miles long, and eight miles broad. It is wel stored with fish, and particularly with one kind of fish, very wholesome and good, called a <hi>Pollac,</hi> which is no where else to be found. <hi>Necham</hi> saith, that this <hi>Lough</hi> turneth sticks into stones. In this <hi>Lough</hi> (saith <hi>Ortelius</hi>) are thirty Islands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:113554:105"/>
divers have Villages inhabited, and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and one of them, which is very good for feeding of Cattel, flotes up and down in the Lake, as it is carried by the Wind: Not unlike those Islands reported by <hi>Pliny</hi> to be in the Lake, <hi>Vadimon,</hi> which are ful of Grass, and covered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with rushes and reeds, and swim up and down in the Lake. There are the like also near St. <hi>Omars</hi> by <hi>Calais.</hi> In the <hi>Lough Lomund</hi> also are fishes without finns. Further, it is the nature of this <hi>Lough</hi> to rage, and rise in waves most of all in the fairest and calmest weather, so that boats are often cast away.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Douglass</hi> hath a black greenish Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>In the Wood <hi>Caledonia</hi> in old time, were white Bulls, wild, and very fierce, whose manes were like Lyons, thick and curled: And so hateful they were to mankinde, that they abhorred whatsoever was handled, or breathed upon by men. And <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> speak of bears here,</p>
               <p>In <hi>Sutherland</hi> (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) there are whole Hills of white Marble.</p>
               <p>Towards the North of <hi>Scotland</hi> (saith <hi>Speed</hi>) there be Mountains all of <hi>Alablaster,</hi> and some all of <hi>Marble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fife</hi> is wel stored with Pit-Coals; and the shores of it are as largely stored with Oysters, and other Shel-fish.</p>
               <p>In the Rivers <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Done</hi> is great store of <hi>Salmon,</hi> and a shel-fish called the <hi>Horse-Muskle,</hi> in which there grow Pearls, as Orient as the best.</p>

               <p>Near <hi>Falkirk</hi> (saith <hi>Lythgow</hi>) remain the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines and marks of a Town, &amp;c. swallowed up into the Earth by an Earth-quake, and the void place is filled with water.</p>
               <p>It is credibly reported (saith <hi>Ortelius</hi>) that in <hi>Argile</hi> there is a kind of stone to be found, which if it be covered but a while with straw or flax, it wil set it on fire.</p>
               <p>The same Author saith, That in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Carict</hi> are very great Oxen, whose flesh is very tender, and of a very pleasant and delicate taste, and the fat never waxes hard, but is thin, like liquid Oyle; and that the sea also on this coast affords great store of Oysters, Cockles, Congers, Herrings (at time of year) &amp;c. Also he saith, That</p>
               <p>At the mouth of the River <hi>Frith,</hi> in the main Sea, is a very high Rock, out of whose top a spring of fresh water runs abundantly.</p>
               <p>The snow lies all the year long upon the hills in <hi>Ross.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A huge piece of Amber (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) as big as an Horse, was not long since cast upon the shore of <hi>Buqhan.</hi> Note that this shore lies almost over-against the mouth of the <hi>Baltick</hi> sea, in which sea upon the shores of <hi>Prussia</hi> and <hi>Pomer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> both Jeat and Amber are often found, as <hi>Geographers</hi> generally assure us. <hi>Serapio,</hi> and the Modern <hi>Philosophers</hi> say, that Amber is a clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Bituminous Earth, lying under the sea, and by the sea side, of which tempests cast part up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:113554:106"/>
the shore, and fishes devour the reit.</p>
               <p>Near a place called <hi>Disert</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> which stands by the sea side, is a Heath, where there is great plenty of an Earthy Bitumen, and it partly burneth.</p>
               <p>In the Countrey of <hi>Argile</hi> (saith <hi>Cambden</hi>) at this day there are Kine and red Deer ranging wild upon the hills.</p>
               <p>In the Countrey of <hi>Murray</hi> is a Meer that breeds and maintains a great abundance of Swans, by the help of the herb, called <hi>Olorina,</hi> which grows very plentifully in it, saith <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The River of <hi>Aberden</hi> breeds great store of <hi>Salmon.</hi>

And if any Ship, Boat, or <hi>Bark,</hi> come within the sphere of its activity, (as it may be called) they must quickly throw over some thing into it, as a barrel, a piece of timber, or such like, or else the Vessel wil ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably be swallowed up.

            <p>In the year 1653. I published a little Pamphlet (or Almanack) entituled, <hi>SyzygiasticonInstauratum,</hi> wherein I desired those that were Astronomically addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to take notice of a little long black Cloud, lying cross the milky way, between the two Constellations of Cygnus and Cepheus, and neither increasing nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, nor moving from the place it first appeared in. I conceived then it was some new apparition, but finding it ever since in the same place where it was, and not perceiving it to alter in any respect, I began to think, that it hath been always there, and will be so to the end; And that, though it be obvious to every vulgar eye, yet it might lye hid till our age, through the inobvertency of the greater part of Astronomers. Besides this,</p>
            <p>There is another thing, which I must needs recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the observation of Mathematicall men. Which is, that in <hi>February,</hi> and for a little before, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after that month (as I have observed several years together) about six in the evening, when the Twilight hath almost deserted the <hi>Horizon,</hi> you shal see a plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discernable way of the Twilight striking up toward the <hi>Pleiades</hi> or seven Starrs, and seeming almost to touch them. It is to be observed any clear night, but it is best <hi>illuc nocte.</hi> There is no such way to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

at any other time of the year, (that I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) nor any other way at that time to be perceived darting up elsewhere. And I believe it hath been, and will be constantly visible at that time of the year. But what the cause of it in nature should be, I cannot yet imagine, but leave it to further euquiry.</p>
            <p>There have been lately three sorts of Telescopes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by this Author, of two whereof triall hath been made, by M. <hi>Reeves</hi> living over-against the foot and leg in <hi>Long-Acre:</hi> And the Author makes no doubt at all of the third.</p>
