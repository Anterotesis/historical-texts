            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And if I may ſpeak plainly my apprehenſions, the well-being and ſafety, not only of this City, but even of our <hi>fair England,</hi> claimeth and loudly cals for of you, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, wiſe, and faithfull execution of your Major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty this very year: all mens expectations being erect, ſome with hope, and ſome with fear, according to their ſeverall intereſts. But with what minds ſoever, and for what ends, Men made choice of you at this time; this we are ſure of, That Jeſus Chriſt the Lord of heaven and earth, who hath all power in his hands, as <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> who raiſeth up, and throweth down again, hath in his wiſdome called you to this place at this time, to do his will, and not your own. And therefore, in this high and important office, and this juncture of time, what need have you of another heart, and another ſpirit then your own, (it being dangerous, eſpecially in ſteep and ſlippery places, to be led by Mens ſpirits) and of new princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from heaven to be put into you (as we read of <hi>Saul,</hi> who had <hi>another heart</hi> given unto him, ſo as he was turned into another man, ſo ſoon as he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed <note place="margin">1 Sam. 6. 9.</note> King) and all to furniſh you with ſuch quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of wiſdome, underſtanding, and the fear of God, as may in the due execution and faithfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of your office, declare to all the world, that your main aimes and ends are more for Gods glory then your own, and more for the publike good, then
<pb facs="tcp:113854:3"/>
for your own private; and more to gratifie good men, then others, though never ſo high or great, and whoſe deſigns drive at nothing more then ruine &amp; confuſion. For we are not ignorant what diabolical plots are on foot, and how ripe for execution, and what kind of Counſellers and active Spirits, your Chair, and Table, yea and Bedchamber too will be haunted withall, if experience deceive us not. And you ſhall find their ordinary counſels to drive at two main things (yet both reduced under one head, to wit, Tyranny) the one, Tyranny over our Bodies, Eſtates, Freeholds, Liberties, Lawes and Birth-rights of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Subjects; the other, Tyranny over our Soules and Conſciences, which are CHRIST's peculiar freeholds and purchaſe, and ſubject to no other Law, Lordſhip or Kingdome, but Chriſts alone.</p>
            <p>And in truth (my Lord) in this reſpect, you are in a hard condition, in caſe you ſhould by any importunity be perſwaded to interpoſe as a Judge in the matter of Religion, and eſpecially in the point of Church-Government, the main controverſie of theſe times, as wherein you have been little verſed, conſidering how few there be that come to preach before you, who ſet themſelves to open unto you this great myſterie of Chriſts Kingly office, and government, over Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Churches: But on the contrary, ſuch as Ignorants moſt admire and adore as gods upon earth, do withhold this truth of God concerning his Sons Kingly government from you; nay (though under other terms) do publikely in your ſolemn aſſemblies exclaim againſt it, ſhut it out of their churches, will not ſuffer others to preach, or print it, with their good wils, but do exaſperate and incenſe you againſt all
<pb facs="tcp:113854:4"/>
thoſe that hold forth this truth in the glory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of it: this being that very Kingdom, of which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Woe be to you Soribes and Phariſees, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> 
               <hi>for ye ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt men, for ye neither go in your ſelves, nor ſuffer ye them that are entring, to go in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, my Lord, you are a lover of Peace; as that part of your Speech upon your Election, in the Hall, declared, and we all believe it: when you ſaid, That you would endeavour to have Vnity; for which you propounded two wayes, either by Intreaty, or by Force. Indeed, in ſuch a caſe, and for your place, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty is very commendable: but if you think by Force to compoſe the differences, that will prove none of Gods wayes, nor to lie within your ſphere; as I dare ſay, you abhorre to be a perſecutor of thoſe that are the promoters of Chriſts honour. And being a thing not pertaining to the office, eſpecially of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate; I need not tell you what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell <hi>Vzzah,</hi> for ſtretching out his hand to ſtay the trembling Ark. <note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And now that I have been thus far bold with your Lordſhip, (which hath proceeded meerly from a hearty deſire, that you may not be carried with the ſtrong tide of the times by any malignant ſpirit filling your ſailes, through many under-water Rocks and Shelves, endangering not only the ſplitting of your own Veſſel, but the total ſhip wrack of this floating State:) Give me leave further to beſeech you, that (as you love your own ſelf, and ſoul, and family, and poſterity, your native Country, the Honour of this City and Nation you would improve the whole power of your Office (among other evils) for the not
<pb facs="tcp:113854:4"/>
only ſuppreſſing, but utter obliterating out of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of memory, or mention, that late <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> which like the Trojan horſe is ſtuffed with ſuch matter, as, if the importunity of ſome might have its deſire, would unavoidably hale in ruine both to City and Country.</p>
            <p>Nor doth any thing more clearly demonſtrate that ſpiritual Judgement of blindneſſe, and hardneſſe of heart to be upon all thoſe who have their heads and hands in that <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> and wilfully ſtill perſiſt in the proſecution of it now in cold blood: Than the unnaturall hating, and hunting after the deſtruction of thoſe very men, as our mortal enemies, who have with the extreme hazard of their lives, been honoured of God to be the Preſervers both of Them, our City and Country, and on the other ſide, the high eſteem and honouring of thoſe, as our faithfulleſt friends, who are part-takers with Murtherers, with Rebels, with Traitors, Incendiaries, Underminers of our Parliaments, and conſequently of the State of the Kingdom, Dividers between the Parliament and City, that themſelves may reigne, whoſe violent and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent practiſes proclaim them to be not friends, but ſuch, as in whom to put the leaſt confidence, is to truſt in the Reed of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereon if a man lean, it will pierce him through. And therefore, for theſe many and weighty conſiderations, both in a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to your Lordſhip, and hearty zeal for the honour and ſafety both of Parliament, City, Kingdome; fuller of dangers and enemies at this day, then (by reaſon of that ſpirit of blindneſſe, and deep ſleep, wherein our City hath of late been ſweetly lulled by the ſtrong charms of fair falſe friends flatteries) we are

               <p>Is it therefore true, becauſe the world ſaith it? So <hi>Ahab</hi> called the Prophet <hi>Eliah,</hi> the <hi>Troubler of Iſrael:</hi> ſo the Jewes ſaid of Chriſt, that he was a <hi>perverter, and ſtirrer up of the</hi>

                  <hi>people.</hi> So when this Lambe of God, the King of the Jewes was born, <hi>Herod,</hi> and all Jeruſſilem were troubled at it. Why ſo? Was it this King that troubled them, or their own guilty conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in uſurping this Kingdom? Alas! Sir this is no news, that where ever the fame of this King and of his kingdom commeth, in the powerfull preaching of the Goſpel of the kingdom, it brings with it trouble and terrom to the world, or to any State. And as it was with <hi>Herod</hi> and the Prieſts at Jeruſalem at the birth of this King, ſo at his death: they could not endure to hear of this King of the Jews. So the Heathen Emperour <hi>Domitian,</hi> out of jealouſie of his Empire, ſought to root out the whole <note place="margin">

conſcience as well as you? ſhould I therefore be an enemy to Conſcience? But indeed, I confeſſe my conſcience is not ſo ſtrict, or ſtrait-laced, or ſelf-willed, as obſtinately to ſtand upon mine own ſingular opinion, in oppoſition to the generall judgement of moſt meh, and thoſe not only learned, but pious too, ſo far as I can judge.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Conſc.</speaker>
               <p>It ſeems then that every conſcience by your verdict, muſt be ſtrait-laced, and ſelf-willed, that will not follow the multitude, ſeeing you ground your conſcience upon men for their number, learning, piety, making them the rule of your conſcience, and not Gods Word alone.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
               <p>Sir I hold this the ſafeſt way: for I may miſunderſtand the Scripture, which many learned cannot ſo eaſily do.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Conſc.</speaker>
               <p>This indeed is a good plea for Popery, who boaſt of their Univerſality, Learning, Councels, &amp; Synods, and therefore (beſides the <hi>Popes</hi> infallible Oracle) not eaſily ſubject to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand the Scriptures. Or you are like thoſe Jewes, who would not believe in Chriſt, unleſſe the <hi>Rulers did know indeed that he was the very Chriſt.</hi> Or as the Phariſees ſaid, <hi>Have any</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 7. 26. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees believed on him?</hi> Thus, do you not pin your faith, and ſo your ſouls upon mens ſleeves, when you will believe as moſt believe, or as the Church or Nation believes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
               <p>But ſir, I put a great difference between a Councel of learned Papiſts, or a Synedrion of Jewiſh Prieſts, and a Synod of learned Proteſtants.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Conſc.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed the very names of Papiſt and Proteſtant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no ſmall difference; although a Papiſt and a Proteſtant at large are at no great odds in matter of Faith, Conſcience, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; only ſuch a Proteſtant is apter to turn Papiſt, then a Papiſt, Proteſtant. And take your Proteſtants at the beſt, call a Synod of the learned eſt, and higheſt eſteem in the world, yet even ſuch a Synod may in ſome things and thoſe fundamentall too, poſſibly run into, and wrap themſelves in foul errours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
               <p>How ſir? ſhew me any one inſtance hereof, that ever any learned Proteſtant Counſel or Synod hath erred in any fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall of faith, or much leſſe hath maintained ſuch an Error or Hereſie, and I will not henceforth be ſo confident in depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <speaker>Conſc.</speaker>
               <p>Seeing you thus put me to it, what think ye of Jeſus Chriſt? Is not he a prime fundamentall?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt, for he is the only foundation: <hi>For other foundation can no man lay.</hi>

               <p>Is not Chriſt then as well in his three Offices (as he is King, Prieſt and Prophet) as in his two natures united in one Perſon of the Eternal Son of God, a fundamentall of faith, ſo as, as well he that denieth any one of his three Offices, as <note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 3.</note> he that denieth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and grand Heretick, as overthrowing a principall founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I conceive this cannot well be denyed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Conſc.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, of neceſſity it muſt be believed. For the Papiſts in joyning their Traditions with the Scripture, deny Chriſts Propheticall office; and in equalling their Satisfactions with Chriſts merits, they deny his Prieſtly Office; and in exalting their Hierarchy (call it Papall, or Prelaticall, or Sacerdotall) <note n="*" place="margin">Theſſ. 2. 4.</note> over the Temple of God, mens conſciences, they deny Chriſts Kingly Office: All which Offices together, or any one of them being denied; is, <note n="*" place="margin">John 2. 22.</note> with Antichriſt, to deny, that Jeſus is the Chriſt; ſeeing <hi>the Chriſt</hi> is he, that is anointed <hi>King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> of which to deny any one, is to deny <hi>that Jeſus is the Chriſt.</hi> Do ye not believe this, Mr. <hi>Conformity?</hi>

               <p>I confeſſe there appears to me a truth to be in all this. But yet, Mr. <hi>Conſcience,</hi> I hope you do not go about to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare me with mine own confeſſions.</p>

               <speaker>Conſc.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay then, that to deny any one of Chriſts Offices (as afore) is to overthrow a Foundation of faith.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Conf.</speaker>

               <speaker>Conſc.</speaker>
               <p>Hereupon I inferre, that it is poſſible for a learned Synod of Proteſtant Divines to deny one of theſe three Offices, and ſo to overthrow a foundation of faith.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
               <p>Though it be poſſible, yet it is not probable. But ſir, remember what ye undertook, namely, to prove by inſtance, that a Proteſtant Synod of Orthodox Divines hath thus erred.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Conſc.</speaker>
               <p>Nay ſtay, Mr. <hi>Conformity,</hi> remember your ſelf well: Did I ſay, a Proteſtant Synod of Orthodox Divines? For how Orthodox, if they overthrow a foundation of faith? then they ceaſe to be Orthodox.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
               <p>Well, however, yet they might in other fundamentals be Orthodox.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Conſc.</speaker>
               <p>But in any one fundamentall to be Heterodox, is to ceaſe to be Orthodox, and, obſtinately perſiſting, is hereticall.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſſe, that any one Hereſie maintained, makes a man a Heretick, hold he otherwiſe never ſo many truths, and ſo he overthrows the faith, as thoſe did who <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> denyed the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, though all other truths they held.

               <p>We do not require ſo much of you, but to ſhew us one only place of Scripture for you, which you cannot do. And for us, though we do not give you ſuch a model, as you deſire, or rather dream of (for no ſuch model is left in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as was given to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in the Old; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted altogether of externall things, being ſhadows of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall now under the Goſpel, the pattern whereof was Chriſt.

For (becauſe you thus urge me) ſhew us, if you can, in all the New Teſtament, any one Nationall Chriſtian Church. Or ſhew us any one ground for either Nationall or Parochiall Chriſtian Churches, or yet any Church fixed to a place, ſo that all people ſucceſſively comming to dwell there, be they what they will, godly or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, Proteſtants or Papiſts, becauſe inhabitants there, muſt therefore make up the Church there, whether Nationall or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall.

Or ſhew us in Scripture either rule or example for a Claſſicall Presbytery. Or ſhew us in the whole Scripture a State church government allowed of God. Or ſhew us out of the Word, that the Apoſtles conſtituted no Churches without leave obtained from the civill State. Or whether thoſe Chriſtian Jews that conſtrained the <hi>Galatians</hi> to be circumciſed, for the avoiding of perſecution, did well or no, ſo to conſtrain, and that only to avoid perſecution: or whether this example will warrant you to conſtrain all to conform to you; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

conformity is free from perſecution, or becauſe all muſt be perſecuted, that conform not. Or laſtly, ſhew us, what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rule or example the Scripture affords, for wreſting from the Magiſtrate through the force of importunity by men both many and mighty, ſtirred up and egged on by a Colledge of Prieſts, to reject Chriſt and his government, and deliver him up to their wils to be crucified, then that Colledge of Prieſts in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, who ſo incenſed the people againſt Chriſt, that nothing would ſatisfie them, but he muſt be crucified; ſo as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is neceſſitated even againſt his conſcience, what through fear of <hi>Caeſar</hi> on the one ſide, and what for favour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the other, to gratifie them with a <hi>Barabbas</hi> in ſtead of Chriſt.

               <p>Sir, I only urge this for the preſent, that though the Scripture hath not expreſſed a power given to men by Chriſt, yet we finde examples of it in the Old Teſtament, as <hi>Jehoſaphat, Ezekiah, Ioſiah, Aſa,</hi> Kings of Judah, who reformed Religion, and are commended for it as good Kings for their labour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Conſc.</speaker>
               <p>They did not ſet up any new forms of Religion of their own head, but they commanded the Prieſts and Levites to reſtore and repair Religion in all things according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, and preciſe pattern given by God himſelf. And note withall, that the kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> or of <hi>David,</hi> was a type of Chriſts ſpiritual kingdom, and all the Kings of Judah were types of Chriſt. So as no other Kings or States are to be paralleld with them. But yet (I ſay) for all that, they went not beyond the preciſe rule of Gods law, as you may ſee by all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples you alledge. For Chriſt gave thoſe Kings, though types of himſelf, no ſuch power, as you pretend. Yea, the Scripture every where, in both the Teſtaments, hath punctually preſerved inviolate and entire, that Kingly prerogative of Chriſt, as being as incapable of being communicable to any humane power, as his omnipotency is, or his other offices, as High Prieſt and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. For proof hereof: <hi>Moſes</hi> for all his wiſdom, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and piety, though he were a great Prophet, and a type of Chriſt, yet had not this power granted unto him, to frame the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> with all things pertaining thereunto, as himſelf pleaſed; but a ſtrict charge God gave unto him, ſaying, <hi>See</hi>

                  <hi>things according to the patterne ſhewed thee in the Mount.</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> though a King, and a man after Gods own heart, yet was not entruſted for the framing of the pattern of the Temple for his ſon <hi>Solomon,</hi> but <note n="*" place="margin">1 Chro. 28. 12, 19.</note> God gave him the <hi>pattern</hi> thereof both by the Spirit, and in writing (ſo carefull was God, leſt <hi>David</hi> ſhould forget any thing) which he delivers to his ſon <hi>Solomon</hi> to do in all things accordingly. So in <hi>Ezekial</hi> we reade, <note place="margin">Chap. 43. 10.</note> where the reformation of the Church under the Goſpel is typed, there is a <hi>pattern</hi> to be meaſured, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 5. to which, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 1. a place worthy our beſt obſervation, as pertinent to theſe times of Reformation, which muſt be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the golden reed of the Word of God. And for any the leaſt dominion over the conſcience by any humane binding law in matters of faith, Chriſt would no more entruſt the Apoſtles themſelves, then he did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 24.</note>

               <p>Although the preſent State be Proteſtant, yet you are not ſure it will be alwayes ſo. What if a <hi>Marian</hi> reign come about again with a Popiſh <hi>Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Convocation?</hi> And if it be true, that Chriſt hath left ſuch a power to any State (as afore) without limitation, then it is left as well to a <hi>Popiſh State,</hi> as to a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> In this reſpect there is no difference. And then it muſt follow, that a Popiſh power, making a law for the ſetting up of the Maſſe (as Qu. <hi>Mary</hi> with her Parliament and Clergy did) and for which they want not pretext of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>Iure Divino</hi> (if bold words, and falſe gloſſes will do it) then al the ſubjects of England muſt either conforme, or elſe to the ſtake. So as the very admitting and crying up of ſuch a power left to men, as it is moſt falſe and groundleſſe; and (as before) a Grandmother <hi>Horeſic,</hi> and introducer of the moſt direfull tyranny over ſoul and all, (ſo far is it from ever proving to be <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> as being <hi>Ludibrium Synodorum)</hi> ſo it is the next way (and much more in this preſent juncture of time, as things now ſtand) to make us as miſerable a Nation, as both the ten Tribes, and the Jews. And (as we touched before) if the wiſdom of God would not entruſt his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113854:12"/>
                  <hi>David,</hi> nor the Apoſtles, with a power in ſetting up what forms of worſhip &amp; frames of government they pleaſed, though they were both wiſe and faithfull, and free from all private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, in ſeeking themſelves, to become Lords Paramount: Car we finde in any age of the world, trow you, either a Parliament or Synod, whereof all the Members, yea, or the greater part, are ſuch as <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> and the Apoſtles were, ſo as to be entruſted with ſuch a power? And in caſe this State ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to it ſelf ſuch a power (as we ſpeak of) ſo as to enact a law to binde all to conformity; either you muſt produce ſome Scripture authority for it, that the Parliament may be ſatisfied <hi>quo jure,</hi> and that it is <hi>Iure Divino</hi> as they require of you, and which you have promiſed, but have not performed it: Or in the mean time give me leave to put it unto you, or to the ſoundeſt judgements, how you can clear your ſelf from falling under that marvellous judgement of God, which we finde in <hi>Eſay</hi> 29. The matter was v. 13. <hi>That their fear towards God was taught by the precept of men.</hi> They had ſet up a worſhip of God according to the <hi>precept of men.</hi> This was all. And is this, in your judgement, nothing? But what They, were they, that did this? Surely, the <hi>Prophets, Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Seers.</hi> What? the Guides and Leaders of the People? How came it to paſſe? The Lord ſaith there (as a matter of wonder, and to be proclaimed by a lowd cry) <hi>that they were drunken, but not with wine, and ſtaggered, but not with ſtrong drink;</hi> and that the Lord <hi>had cloſed their eyes, and poured upon them the ſpirit of deep ſleep. v.</hi> 9, 10. So as, neither the learned nor unlearned, could underſtand the viſion, v. 11, 12. And all their religion is turned into <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> v. 23. Foraſmuch, <hi>as their fear towards God was taught by the precept of men.</hi> For a religion of humane inſtitution is hypocriſie; while pretending to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and fear God, they fear and worſhip men, which is both hypocriſie and idolatry. And what's the iſſue of all this? v. 14. <hi>Therefore behold, ſaith the Lord, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: For the wiſdom of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their prudent men ſhall be hid.</hi>

So ſtrong is the poyſon of this one ſin, hypocriſie, and Idolatry, in teaching and ſetting up a <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>worſhip</hi> towards <hi>God by the precept of men;</hi> which, as it is a <hi>removing of the heart from God,</hi> ſo it cauſeth him to remove his Spirit from us, and to give us up to ſuch a fearfull <note n="*" place="margin">Quos perdere vult Deus, hos prius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentat.</note> dementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is the forerunner of deſtruction.

Certainly, the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Doctrine of Chriſt produceth no ſuch fruits as thoſe fore-mentioned are: as Treaſon againſt the State, unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards our native countrey, unthankfulneſſe towards our beſt deſerving friends, our Benefactors, our Preſervers: yea, injuſtice and cruelty towards them, factious plottings and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminings, hatred of thoſe that be good, enmity againſt thoſe that are the friends of Chriſt, and ſo perſecution of the way of Chriſt, deſtroying of Chriſts kingdom, by ſetting up a worldly kingdom of men, <note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5.</note> having <hi>a form of godlineſſe, but denying the power thereof;</hi> yea, and ſeeking to overtop the Supream Power.

And ſo much the rather, when we read and conſider their own publique and authentique Books of their Kirk government, Orders, Diſcipline, Confeſſion of faith, &amp;c. wherein they give to their General or National Aſſembly ſupreme power, not only over their Parochial, Claſſical, and Provincial aſſemblies, but even over the Parliament it ſelf. For not only they take the power to appoint both <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> for the convening of their Eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies (as 2. <hi>Book of Diſcipline, chap.</hi> 7.) But they ſay moreover in the ſame chap. <q>For this Orders cauſe, they may make certain Rules and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, appertaining to the good behaviour of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Kirk in their vocation.</q> And this they do without the Civil Magiſtrate.

So alſo what bonds and bounds their own conſcience, and the terror of the great Judge, and their ſacred oath and ſolemn covenant and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation with the people, and not only Gods law, but the civil lawes of the kingdome, do put upon them, you cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>

againſt the law of God, and the liberty of a Chriſtian, who is the ſubject of Chriſts kingdom? For here we are to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſubject of Chriſts ſpiritual kingdom, and a meer ſubject of the civil State. He that is a meer ſubject of the civil ſtate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging no ſuperior power above it, his conſcience (though blind) bids and binds him to obey: but he that is a true ſubject of Chriſts kingdom, being alſo a ſubject of the civil State, owes a twofold obedience, one to the Civil State, &amp; another to Chriſt. According to that of Chriſt. <hi>Render unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and unto God the things that are Gods.</hi> Nor doth the order or diſorder in churches (as churches) put any difference between the having, or not having of a civil power. In the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick churches there were both hereſies and ſchiſmes, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18, 19. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19.) whith the civil power took no cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of: Nay, it was, and may be as apt to perſecute the truth, as to cenſure or reſtrain either hereſie, or ſchiſme, or apoſtacie. And Chriſts government is ſufficient in all Church-caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>

               <p>But, who in a Chriſtian civil State do not acknowledge Chriſt as ſuperior?</p>

               <speaker>Conſc.</speaker>
               <p>This is ſufficiently reſolved before. Such as conform to a State religion, or a State church-government, make that the ſupreme law and lord over their conſcience, and ſo exclude Chriſts ſupremacie. Enough is ſaid of that. But you cut me off from what I was about to adde. Mans nature is too prone to idolize the Power ſo, as to make it as the <hi>ſhadow of the bramble,</hi> in <hi>Jothams</hi> parable, under which to eaſe themſelves of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <note place="margin">

Thus it was enough for the Phariſees to ſay, <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 19. 7</note> 
                  <hi>We have a law, and by that law Chriſt ought to dye.</hi> Thus Chriſt muſt not be God, becauſe the Roman Senate, according to their law formerly made, had not firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd it, or paſſed their vote for it, before <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> had
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113854:17"/>
commended it to them, namely to admit of Chriſt into their <hi>Pantheon,</hi> to take place among their gods. And is it not even ſo with us? Muſt not Chriſt be King of the Jews, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by an act of State (as before) they will not have <hi>this man</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 19. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>to reign over them.</hi> And Chriſt muſt not be God, becauſe the Roman Senate had not pre-reſolved it. And ſo Chriſt muſt not be ſole Lord over the conſcience, nor ſole Law giver of his Church, nor his Word the ſole rule of worſhip &amp; of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly government of his ſpiritual kingdom in the conſcience, and Churches of the Saints, nor indeed Chriſts kingdom ſpiritual; becauſe the Sate hath made a law which muſt rule the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in point of forms of worſhip and of Church-government, that Chriſts kingdom muſt be worldly, perpetually entaild to a whole Nation, making up one Nationall Church, the form whereof worldly, and the materials worldly, as either no Saints at all, or elſe all Saints, becauſe all nominall Chriſtians; and all this and much more, becauſe the civill State, by the inſtigation of men Eccleſiaſticall or Civill, domeſticall or forein, hath ſo ordaind it.</p>

Firſt, I would have thee know, that ſpeaking ſo freely to thee, I was not ſo ſimple, as not to imagine thou wouldſt divulge all; nay in truth, I have ſpoken all this to thee to that very purpoſe, that thou ſhouldſt communicate it (if poſſible) ſo far as the Sun ſhines; but firſt to thine at home, as thou ſayeſt. But thus much let me intreat of thee. 1. That thou wouldſt not do any thing this way in malice, leſt thou adde to thy ſin Secondly, that thou wouldſt ſpeak nothing but truth, and the whole truth and that without aggravations whereof there is no need eſpecially when thou ſpeakeſt to thy friends of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and much more of things of this nature, too harſh for delicate ears. And third<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, aſſure them from <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that what I have here ſpoken to

thee, it is out of pure zeale for the honour of Chriſt, out of pure charity to the perſons concerned, out of pure piety to ſee my native country in ſuch a periſhing eſtate, and the honour of <hi>England</hi> to lie in the duſt; out of pure hatred of hypocriſie, idolatry, pride, covetouſnes, ambition, treachery and treaſon, walking up and down in long robes: And in a word, to deliver (if no more, yet) mine own ſoul, in diſcharge of my duty to God and my country, as a poor Miniſter of Chriſt, by witneſſing the truth, and convincing error. And for a cloſe of all <hi>(Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity)</hi> If thou deſireſt Peace with Truth (as we all ſhould do) If thou wouldeſt have me to hold correſpondence with thee, and to give thee the right hand of fellowſhip; If thou deſireſt that deſirable reconciliation of our differences: Firſt renounce thy name of <hi>Conformity,</hi> in thy ſenſe, and <hi>conform not to this world,</hi> but to <hi>Gods word,</hi> let that be the Cynoſure or Pole-ſtar <note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> of that <hi>

But this I ſay, and urge, as being the main Fundamental and Eſſential of a true &amp; right viſible church of Chriſt: If thou confeſſeſt Chriſt in all that he is; If thou giveſt him his due honour, in ſubmitting thy conſcience only and wholly to him, with profeſſion thereof, and not to any humane power, and as to the only Lawgiver of his church and kingdom, to <hi>order and eſtabliſh it with judgement and juſtice for ever:</hi> and to his Word, as the only law and rule <note place="margin">Eſa. 9. 7.</note> of the government of that kingdom, and the only Judge to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale unto in all doubts and controverſies of faith: And if thou ſhalt confeſſe every church and congregation of Chriſt to be

only and immediately under Chriſts juriſdiction, and not ſubject to any other church or churches, which are ſo many Siſters, not Miſtreſſes; leſt otherwiſe we ſet up the Spouſe above, or in ſtead of her husband Chriſt. If (I ſay) thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and hold forth this in thy publike profeſſion, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and practice of it: Then, though thy Churches have many other defects, yet if they have the beeing and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of true churches of Chriſt, for matter and form, I ſhall not ſcruple to hold communion with thee.
