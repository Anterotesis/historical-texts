            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AD this Letter of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Carier</hi>
beene imparted, or the drift of it
onely reached to your <hi>Maiestie,</hi> it
would haue deserued none other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
then your <hi>Maiesties</hi> priuate
censure; and might well haue beene buried in silence
with the Author of it: But now that it not only aymes
in particular at all the members of the bodie Politike,
First the Nobles, then the Commons, and lastly the
Clergie; but withall is published to the view of the
World, and spread through all the quarters of your
Land, for the better effecting of that it aymes vnto;
and is not a little magnified by the Romish faction:
It must needs argue in vs, either want of wisedome
in preuenting a mischiefe, or of power in prouiding
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3770:3"/>
for our owne safetie, or of zeale and sinceritie in our
loue to the Trueth, if it should passe without some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery,
aswell of the malicious scope to which it tends,
as the weakenesse of the arguments by which it ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
to perswade.</p>
            <p>The maine end which it driues at, is either a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
reconcilement to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or if that
cannot be, a partiall toleration of the <hi>Romish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>The generall meanes by which it striues to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
this end, are first by working a destraction euen
amongst those your Subiects, who euery way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
themselues aswell to the doctrine, as the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> established by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
allowance, in making some <hi>Puritanes,</hi> and some
<hi>Protestants,</hi> who in his language<note n="1" place="margin">Cap. 2. Sect. 41.</note> 
               <hi>can endure the
state of the Church of</hi> England <hi>as it is, but could
be content it were as it was:</hi> (implying thereby
the rest to be <hi>Puritanes</hi>) some <hi>Caluinists</hi> and some
<hi>temperate men,</hi>
               <note n="2" place="margin">Cap. 2. Sect. 45.</note> 
               <hi>who cannot but in iudgment
approue the trueth of that Religion which he
calles Catholike,</hi> (thereby implying the rest to bee
<hi>Caluinists</hi>) the one he termes <hi>the greatest enemies
of the Clergie,</hi> the other <hi>his honest and louing
brethren, wherof he professeth he knew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and himselfe to be one:</hi> whereas in trueth if
any such there be, the difference should rather haue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3770:3"/>
beene made betwixt <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
and <hi>Romish</hi> Catholikes, since they who could
be content <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>were as it was</hi>
before the Reformation, can in my iudgement bee
none other then <hi>Papists;</hi> and those that in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
approue the doctrine of the pretended Catholike
Religion, can (as farre as I apprehend it) been none
other then <hi>Romish Catholikes.</hi> Thus those whom
we call <hi>Papists,</hi> he calles <hi>Temperate Protestants,</hi>
and those whom we call <hi>Protestants,</hi> he calles <hi>State
Puritanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second generall meanes for the compassing of
his desired end, is an indeuour to worke an vtter se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
betwixt our Church and other reformed
Churches, specially those of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands;</hi>
whom therefore in contempt hee calls <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi>
and <hi>Geux,</hi> and their doctrine <hi>Caluinisme;</hi>
intending thereby, (as I conceiue) either to weaken
our strength, by leauing vs to stand single, or, which
is worse, to inforce vs at length to relapse vpon
<hi>Rome:</hi> And to this purpose is hee bold to affirme,
that their doctrine makes as much against the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of <hi>England,</hi> as that of <hi>Rome;</hi> whereas the

            <p>For your <hi>Maiesty,</hi> there is (God be thanked) no

so many and so strong, and withall his motiues for
inducement to the contrary, so weake; dealing with
your <hi>Maiesty</hi> as the deuill did with our Sauiour, who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3770:5"/>
being beaten from Scripture, fell to the promising
of the glory of kingdomes, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

            <p>Now because the Letter, (though not without
some marke of presumption) is by the Author, not onely
dedicated, but throughout directed to your <hi>Maiesty,</hi>
(<hi>as if he meant to fight, neither with small nor

more fauourable, in as much, as I haue made bold to
borrow the greatest part of my weapons, both offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
and defensiue, from the rich armourie of your
<hi>Maiesties</hi> writings, wherin already, though seuered,
as <hi>in the tower of DAVID, built for defence,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3770:5"/>
hang a thousand shields and all the targets of

            <p>My wish and hearty prayer to God is, and I think
not mine alone, but of all good men, neither would
I account my life deare to be spent in the furtherance
of it, that the miserable rent, and wide woundes,
which at this day wee see in the Christian world, in
matter of Religion, might by some good meanes be
closed vp, for the sparing of the effusion of so much
Christian blood, the securing of the Crownes of
Christian Princes, the setling of so great distraction
in Christian mindes, the wiping away of the scandall
of diuision, from the Christian profession, and lastly
resisting with vnited forces, the common enemie of
the blessed and glorious name of Iesus Christ: But as
long as the<note n="9" place="margin">See the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the state of religion in these Westerne parts which it were much to be wished, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himselfe would perfect and publish.</note> Bishop of

arguments neuer so cleare and stronge; I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
otherwise of such a wish then of an honest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
but without any apparent hope of successe. For
if diuine authoritie doe concurre with them in all
their ordinances, if Gods Spirit infallibly assist them
in all their decisions, what remaines there, but only
that they teach, wee beleeue, they command, and
the world obey? Indeed in humane gouernments
where reason is shut out, there tyrannie is thrust in;
but where God commandeth, to aske a reason, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
to disobey, rebellion: to this miserable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
haue their assertions tied them which they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3770:9"/>
haue laid for their eternall foundation; miserable to
themselues, and miserable to the whole world; nay,
in so many conferences as haue beene held in this age
for pacification, it hath beene truely obserued, that
ere they parted, they plainely discouered, they came
not with any such intent, as to yeeld any thing for
<hi>Peace,</hi> much lesse for <hi>Trueths</hi> sake, but onely to assay
either by perswasion to reduce, or otherwise by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to intrap and disgrace their aduersaries; and if
some one of them haue shewed himselfe more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
at any time, it hath beene his vtter disgrace with
his owne partie for euer after. Now for the manner
of mine answering, I haue set downe his text at large
in his owne words, without altering or adding so
much as a sillable (except it were to make sense where
I found none) imputing the errour thereof to the

An easie matter it is to promise great matters, but not
so easie to performe them being promised: For mine
owne part, I must confesse, I haue made a larger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
then either the treatise answered deserued, or
the state of my bodie, and my leisure (being to make
so often returnes from a remote part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

or indeed my selfe at first proiected; but I haue
now found it true in mine owne experience, which I
haue often heard obserued by others, to fall out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times in writing, as it doth in building: many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations

It gathers strength in going, as in eating a man some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

with an expectation, that either some more able pen
would haue vndertaken this encounter, or some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

himselfe, and <hi>Pelitier,</hi> would ere this haue beene pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished

as if hee were still aliue, it is to bee ascribed to
himselfe, who in the conclusion of his Letter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth

it is (I hope) sufficient that I neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
thereby to wrong the dead, or deceiue the

            <p>Neither let it bee thought blameable, that being
by profession a diuine, I haue medled so much in
matters of state; it was rather out of the necessitie
of the arguments to bee replied vnto, then any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

ours of the contrary; of which I may truely say
that (in the termes it now stands) it doth not so much

Lastly, for that <hi>vniforme and setled consent of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

grounded reasons</hi> of the Author which the Prefacer
pretends; it will easily appeare at first view, that the
former appeares not in this Treatise: and for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they may appeare to the vnlearned and vnstable,
who like children are <hi>carried</hi> about with euery blast
of vaine doctrine; but to such as are sound <hi>in the faith
which was once deliuered to the Saints,</hi> and grounded
in the principles of Christian religion, I am sure his
reasons can neither appeare <hi>sound nor grounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those foure quotations of Scripture which are set
by the Prefacer in his margin (being more by foure
then are to be found in the Treatise it selfe) the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my marginall notes inforced me to omit; and
yet if I had figured them as I finde them there, the
Reader in searching would haue missed them, the 11.

my selfe, rather worse then better then I was before, and
therefore I resolued with my selfe that it was high time for

the <hi>Spaw</hi> waters, which I graunt, you might vse by

as much as being (you say) <hi>suspected &amp; condemned as a
common enemy, and hauing no way to auoid your griefe, nor
meanes to endure it, you desired to withdraw your selfe from

being (you say) vpon the way at <hi>Colin,</hi> you found your

dissolution of your body; then to fixe your thoughts
vpon God, when you perceiued you could not long
remaine in the world; which as it is lesse acceptable
to God, then for a man to consecrate the flowre and
strength of his age to him, so is it in the doctrine of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> lesse meritorious in it selfe, and in
reason not so exemplar to draw others: Had you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to forsake a falshod, and imbrace a trueth
for the meere loue of truth without worldly respects,
men would rather haue inclined to thinke that true
which you had imbraced; had you hoped to rise

hope of honor deare; in regard of that future life and
glory which you hoped for by the change of your

follow your steps: but for a man so ambitious as your

out of hope of rising higher; but almost out of breath
to, and all hope of liuing much longer, to seeke that

                  <p>You told vs before, <hi>that your care was, assoone as you came to
yeeres of discretion, by all meanes you could to enforme your selfe,
whether the religion of</hi> England <hi>were indeed the very same which
being prefigured and prophecied in the olde Testament, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by our blessed Sauiour, and deliuered to his Apostles and
disciples:</hi> and here you tell vs, that <hi>when you came to more iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the better informing your selfe herein, you read ouer the
Chronicles of England:</hi> a proper course indeede, as if a man
should reade ouer the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to search, whether
the practise of our Architects in building agree with <hi>Vitruuius</hi>
his precepts, or of our husbandmen in manuring their grounds
with <hi>Columellaes</hi> rules. For mine owne part, I should rather
haue thought, that the readiest way to informe your selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
had been to compare the religion of <hi>England</hi> with the
doctrine of the Gospels, Epistles, Actes of the Apostles, and
Church history, the ende of a <hi>Chronicle</hi> being not to shew e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
alteration in religion, specially where it is made peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale,
insensibly, and by degrees, of which a man may say that
hee sees it is changed, though he sawe not the changing, as he
sees the grasse hath growen though he saw it nor growing, and
the shadow in a diall to haue mooued, though not moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,

                     <hi>The enuious man sowed his tares in the night, so that
men discouered it then when they sprang vp in the morning.</hi>]
but the sowing of them they could not obserue, because it was
done cunningly in the night when all men slept, and for a
time, they lay hid vnder the earth. And yet are not our <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi>
so silent, but that they euery where lay open the iust

say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>you found the religion of England a plaine change, and change
vpon change:</hi> But our constant answere is, (that which you
professe you <hi>hoped</hi> to finde) that the change was in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> our change being nothing else but the scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3770:21"/>
off of that rust, or the repairing of those ruines which we
found had insensibly growen vpon it. For to suppose that
tract of time cannot drawe a corruption vpon religion, aswell
as vpon ciuil affaires, is as if a man should imagine that Castles
indeede are subiect to reparations, but not Churches: and for
your pretended <hi>change vpon change,</hi> wee may boldly say, that
our Common prayer booke hath not receiued so many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as your Breuiaries, your Portesses, your Legends, your
Martyrologies, your Pontificals, your Ceremonials, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
your Missals haue done, and that since our reformation;
nay, since the framing and publishing of our Common prayer
bookes in the beginning of the reigne of <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. wee
find no <hi>change</hi> in any materiall point at all, saue that in their
Letanie they prayed to be deliuered by name from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
and malice of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which for any thing I know, might
as iustly, and vpon as good reason haue been retained by vs,
as it was by them put in.</p>
                  <p>H Now why <hi>Henrie the</hi> VIII. <hi>should cause the first change in
religion out of a desire to change his bed-fellow,</hi> I see not, except
you esteeme a restraining of the <hi>Popes</hi> vnlimited power in
dispensations to be a <hi>change in religion,</hi> and indeed it may well
be, since now the world is come to that passe, that the <hi>Popes</hi>
authority, and <hi>religion</hi> are in a manner as reciprocall, as the
definition and the thing defined. And for the <hi>change of his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow,</hi>
it is well knowen to those that haue read ouer our
Chronicles with obseruation (as your selfe pretend you haue)
that he being married to her at the age of 10. <hi>yeeres</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
protested against it when he came to 14. in the presence

was carnally knowen of Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> whereof the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions
were great. The one was, that Prince <hi>Henry</hi> was

space of sixe moneths after <hi>Arthurs</hi> decease, vpon a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> might be by him conceiued with

and peraduenture carnally knowen, which <hi>Bull</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

was from the report of <hi>Prince Arthurs</hi> Chamberlaine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
certaine words spoken by the <hi>Prince</hi> the first morning that
he rose from his bed. A fourth was the relation of the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours
of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> her father king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> being sent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purposely to see the mariage consummated, who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their knowledge of their mutuall coniunction by the
markes, and that nothing was left vnperformed of any nuptiall
right: And surely they being both of yeeres able enough to
accomplish the acte, he aboue 15. and she aboue 17. laid both
in one bed almost fiue moneths together, doe assure vs the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety
of that which in this businesse is made the greatest
scruple. These were the reasons which in appearance moued

                     <hi>Henry the</hi> VIII. to the <hi>remouing of his bed-fellow,</hi> not those
which you as fondly imagine, as you suggest malitiously.
I doe not take vpon me the clearing of this king from all the
blame that is cast vpon him: yet I may truely say that stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
haue bene more fauourable vnto him, then our owne
countrey-men, he being deepely and bitterly taxed not onely
by <hi>Saunders</hi> (from whom nothing but such slanders could be
expected) but by a later writer, professing himselfe of our
owne Church, to the great content of the Romish faction,
whose obligation notwithstanding to the daughter in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of wise men might deseruedly haue purchased some more
respectiue termes of the Father: whereas <hi>Thuanus</hi> the most
vnpartiall and iudicious Historiographer of our age giues this
testimonie of him, that [<q>he was a Prince of singular naturall
indowments, and such a one in whom (had hee not too much
loosed the reines to this pleasure) you could hardly find wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any perfection. Nay after his diuorce from his Queene,
and from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Bishops which hee named
(sayth hee) were honest men and good Schollers, being euer
himselfe a great Patron of learning</q>] which testimonie I the
rather alledge, because the <hi>Spanish expurgatorie index</hi> hath

to hold no point of doctrine expresly contrary to Antiquitie,

for the doctrine of <hi rend="sup">I</hi> Predestination, Sacraments, Grace, Freewill,
Sinne, the new Catechisme and Sermons of those Preachers did run
wholly against the Common prayer booke, and Catechisme therein,
and did make as little account of the doctrine established by law, as
they did of the discipline: but in the one they found opposition by those

them into two, therein following (two of the Fathers at most
excepted) all Antiquitie. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

C H R I S T is to be iterated: The Common prayer Booke of

hee is a full perfect and sufficient Sacrifice for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whole world, which also meeteth with the Romish satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Veniall sinnes, as they call them, and temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
dew to Mortall. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, that
the outward Sacrament of Water sufficeth to saue Infants:
The Common prayer Booke of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the
administration of publike Baptisme, that the working of the
holy Ghost is to be ioyned thereunto. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
teacheth, that Laijks and Women may in some cases lawfully
Baptise: The Common prayer Booke of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in the administration of priuate Baptisme, that none may
doe it lawfully but the lawfull Minister. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
teacheth, that children may bee confirmed before they come
to yeres of discretion, and are able to yeeld an account of their
Faith: The Common prayer Booke of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in the order set downe for Confirmation, teacheth and
commandeth the contrarie. More might bee sayed to this
point, but this shall suffice to shew that if <hi>the Common prayer
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3770:25"/>
Booke of the Church of England be in no point of doctrine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to Antiquitie</hi> (as M<hi rend="sup">•.</hi> Doctor affirmeth) then must Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
needs bee contrarie to the doctrine of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in as much as the doctrine thereof, and our Common
prayer Booke are contrarie each to other.</p>
                  <p>But you further adde that <hi>though it containe no point contrarie
to Antiquitie, yet is it verie defectiue, and containeth not enough.</hi>
Indeed we confesse y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we goe not so far as the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
but so far as we haue warrant. We pray to God in the Name of
CHRIST, they to God &amp; to Saints. We pray for the liuing, they
for the liuing and the dead. We acknowledge 2. Sacraments,
they to those two adde fiue more. We make the Communion
of the Eucharist properly a Sacrament, they a Sacrament and
a sacrifice, and that propitiatorie. We hope to be saued by the
merits of Christ, they by his merits and their owne: the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
ground of all these additions is, that we make Scripture
the onely rule of faith, they both Scripture and traditions:
and by mingling the water of their owne inuentions with the
wine of the Gospel, they haue made the Law of Christ of none
effect. And surely if defect may iustly bee imputed to vs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
may much rather to them, who in their <hi>Pontificall</hi> spend
seuen leaues in the largest fol. onely about the benediction of

themselues cannot but laugh at, and yet dare not speake
against, and good men pitie, though they cannot remedy.</p>
                  <p>I I marueile what <hi>doctrine of predestination, grace, free-will,
or sinne you finde in the Common Prayer booke, or Catechisme
therein;</hi> the end of the one being not to set downe doctrinall
positions, but the exercise of religious actes, and of the other,
as briefly as may bee, to instruct children in the principles of
Christian religion, not men of riper age in the controuersies.</p>
                  <p>K It is to me strange, that you dare write thus to his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,</hi>
who made it knowen to the world by his pen (when other
Christian Princes and Churches were silent) that hee thought
himselfe hurt by the pestilent subtilties of <hi>Vorstius,</hi> howbeit
he were not vnder his dominions, &amp; by <hi>Legate</hi> his own subiect,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3770:26"/>
who was burnt at London for Arianisme some few yeeres
since. But surely I am clearely of opinion that his Holinesse
would take it much more to heart, and <hi>thinke himselfe more
hurt,</hi> if a Frier should preach against his power in deposing
Kings, and disposing of kingdomes, then if he denied the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

or the procession of the third from the other two.</p>

by nation a <hi>Netherlander,</hi> one of the best <hi>Popes</hi> of latter dayes,
acknowledged to be the chiefe cause of so much scandall in

the making of images, either for publike decoration, or mens

vnto, or any holinesse attributed vnto them, was neuer
knowen of the ancients: and the Scriptures are so directly,
vehemently, and punctually against it, as I wonder what
braine of man, or suggestion of Sathan, durst offer it to
Christians: and all must be salued with nice Philosophicall
distinctions: as, <hi>Idolum nihil est,</hi> and they worship forsooth
the Images of things in being, and the Image of the true
God, but the Scripture forbiddeth to worship the image of
any thing that God created: It was not a <hi>nihil</hi> then that
God forbade onely should bee worshipped, neither was the
<hi>Brasen serpent,</hi> nor <hi>the body of Moses</hi> a <hi>nihil,</hi> and yet
the one was destroyed, and the other hidden, for eschewing
of Idolatrie: yea, the image of God himselfe is not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
forbidden to be worshipped, but euen to be made. The
reason is giuen, that no eye euer saw God: and how can wee
paint his face, when <hi>Moses,</hi> the man that euer was most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar

hee cannot bee drawen to the view, it is a thankelesse labour
to marre it with a false representation; which no Prince,
nor scarce any other man would be contented with, in their

I am sure Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> (on whom you so much relie) is so

them, be rightly <hi>Ordered,</hi> and if hee be, whether hee
pronounce them with the intent that the Church intends, they
may iustly make a doubt, and consequently a question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their worship bee idolatrous or no: for in such cases by

bread: for our parts, wee constantly beleeue him to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,

they are no way sufferable to remaine in this Kingdome.
Their point of Doctrine is, that arrogant and ambitious Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
of their he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ciuill power ouer all Kings and Emperours, dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and decrowning Princes with his foot as pleaseth him,
and dispensing and disposing of all Kingdomes and Empires
at his appetite. The other point which they obserue in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
practise is, the Assassinates and Murders of Kings,
thinking it no sinne; but rather a matter of saluation to
doe all actions of rebellion and hostilitie against their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lord, if he be once our sed, his Subiects discharged of

of such new and grosse corruptions of theirs, as themselues
cannot maintaine nor denie to be worthy of reformation, <hi>he

for I could not permit the increase and growing of
their Religion, without first betraying of my selfe and mine
owne Conscience, secondly, this whole Isle, aswell the part I
am come from, as the part I remaine in, in betraying their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and reducing them to the former slauish yoke, which
both had casten off, before I came amongst them: and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the libertie of the Crowne in my posteritie, which I should
leaue againe vnder a new slauerie, hauing found it left free
to mee by my Predecessours, and therefore would I wish all
good Subiects, that are deceiued with that corruption: First,
if they find any beginning of instinction in themselues of
knowledge and loue to the Trueth, to foster the same by all
lawfull meanes, and to beware of quenching the spirit that
worketh within them; and if they can find as yet no moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
tending that way, to bee studious to reade and conferre

MAIESTIE shewed mee a booke sent
him from <hi>Carier,</hi> wherein certaine
strange things are reported of me. I thinke his
MAIESTIE hath shewed them vnto your
Grace. I hope I haue by the grace of GOD so
liued, both before I came into this Kingdome,
and since I came into England, that I ought
not to care what a forlorne Apostate pratleth,
or writeth of me. It appeares he is very angry
with me for a letter I wrote him, to reclaime
him from that mad course: thereupon he goes
about to traduce me to the KINGS MAIESTY
and your Grace. But I hope better both of that
most wise KING, and of you most renowned
Prelate. Vnto whom if I thought there were
need of Apologie, I would, laying all other
things aside, in person purge my selfe vnto
your Grace. But my case, I trust, is not so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
that the slanders of a lewd Apostate
should be of any force with you against my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
If you command, I will forthwith
repaire vnto you, and satisfie your Grace vnto

it was folly, or rather frensie to hope for any
good from the <hi>Romish Phalaris,</hi> (for that very
terme I vsed) who laughs at our euils, if there
be any amongst vs. I laid before his eyes how
auerse the Peeres of the Romish Church are
from all equitie: specially <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> of whose
impiety I wrote at large vnto him. I set before
his eyes with how great danger to himselfe he
seemed to become the <hi>Popes</hi> Patron. I alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
testimonies of <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> of the great
misery of England when it was vnder the

that being commanded by the KING to say

some animaduersions set in the margent of the
booke. After which, what became of <hi>Carier,</hi>
I know not. This I thought good to signifie
vnto your Grace: but I expected vntill you

true,</hi> it is manifest, that there is not any mention at all of any
<hi>oath</hi> in that Statute: but it is true indeede, that in the 28. <hi>of
Henry</hi> VIII. <hi>chap.</hi> 10. there is an <hi>oath of Supremacie</hi> ordeined,
the refusall whereof by some certaine persons enioyned by
that Act to take it, was made high Treason. And herein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
is the Doctour deceiued, nay which is worse seeketh to
deceiue others; for onely some certaine persons were bound
by that Statute to take the <hi>oath,</hi> and not <hi>all the Subiects of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as he falsely surmiseth. <hi>Anno 35. Henry</hi> VIII. <hi>cap. 1.</hi> the
oath of Supremacie ordeined by 28. was repealed, and a new
forme of oath prescribed and extended to more persons, but
neuer <hi>to all</hi> in generall. The same Parliament Cap. 3. enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that the stile of Supreme head be receiued and vsed, and
this was all that was done by <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. in the point of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
by way of Statute: So that to say as Master Doctor
doth, that <hi>all the Subiects in</hi> England <hi>are bound vpon paine of
death to beleeue the Supremacie,</hi> is a malicious fiction in two
respects: First touching the persons enioyned to take the
oath, and lyable to the punishment; and then againe as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the offence, for that <hi>beliefe</hi> alone, which is a secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the minde knowne onely to God, the searcher of
the heart, and not issuable nor tryable by any Law humane,
should be made an offence punishable by death; is in it selfe so
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3770:41"/>
absurde, as it cannot but appeare to bee a false imputation to
charge our Law-makers therewithall. Lastly, whereas hee
sayes that <hi>Henry the</hi> VIII. <hi>would neuer haue made that Statute, if
he could haue gotten the Pope to haue diuorced Queene</hi> Katherine
<hi>that he might haue married</hi> Anne Boleine it is cleare, and all the
world may know, that if King <hi>Henry</hi> would haue ioyned with
<hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King in the warre of <hi>Naples</hi> against <hi>Charles</hi>
the Emperour, the <hi>Pope</hi> would not haue stucke to haue giuen

(and so foorth) <hi>shall be traitours, and the person willingly absolued,

<hi>withdrawing</hi> of the Subiect from their naturall obedience, or
<hi>for that intent,</hi> from the religion established, is the offence made
<hi>treason,</hi> and not simple <hi>exhorting to the Romish religion,</hi> as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged:
And yet to speake a trueth, I see not how any <hi>exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
to an absolute submission of the vnderstanding and the
will to the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> Iurisdiction, which now is made
the onely essentiall forme of that religion, can well be seuered
from such an intent. But <hi>Rome</hi> (you say) <hi>is the mother Church,
and no man in</hi> England <hi>can bee saued, that continues wilfully out of
the visible vnitie of that Church.</hi> Where if you terme it <hi>the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Church</hi> in that sense that his MAIESTIE doeth, wee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it; but if your meaning bee, that shee is <hi>our mother,</hi> either
in regard that wee receiued the first life, or still should receiue
the nourishment of religion from her, wee denie it; our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

who intombed the Corps of our Sauiour, and lieth

Church, and not of the Westerne, at the comming of <hi>Austin.</hi>
I may very well coniecture that our first conuersion to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

that I might be graft in, well: through infidelity they are broken off,
and thou standest by faith: be not high minded, but feare. For if
God spared not the naturall branches, take heed lest he spare not thee.
Behold therefore the goodnesse and seuerity of God: toward them
which haue fallen, seueritie; but towards thee goodnesse, if thou
continue in his goodnesse; otherwise thou also shalt bee cut off.</hi>]
Now whether the Apostle spake generally to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and
inclusiuely to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> or namely to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and
proportionably to the rest, it is all one to vs, one of the twaine
he must needs. <hi>Origen</hi> saith vpon these words of <hi>Paul, [I say
to you Gentiles.] Now hee plainely turneth his speach to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
but chiefly to those of the citie of Rome that beleeued S. Paul.]</hi>
speaking then to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> no man may except the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and they being included, his admonition to them, if there
could bee no danger in them of swaruing from the faith, was
vtterly superfluous, and the condition implied ridic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the commination odious, and the reason friuolous. Now that
which <hi>S. Paul</hi> there threatned, we find come to passe; so that
we cannot, we dare not ioyne hands with her; nay wee are so
farre from beleeuing, that <hi>none can bee saued, that continues
out of the visible vnitie of that Church:</hi> that on the other side,
we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly beleeue, that the means to be saued, is to separate
our selues <hi>from the vnity of that Church,</hi> till she separate her
selfe from her errors, specially since in your vnderstanding, <hi>the
continuing in the visible vnity of that Church,</hi> is in a manner
nothing else, but the acknowledging of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
to bee the visible head of it: and if <hi>none can bee saued without

when wee shall see it published, I doubt not but a Confutation
will be found as particular and plaine, and more true, then your

why would his holinesse permit the exercise of ours with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,

fault in their vsage, it is, that they find too much mercie, their

himselfe (as being his last refuge) to the shewing of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes

too, in the disposing of those kingdoms, and the glory of them

So that their king domes being <hi>not by Gods donation,</hi> they might
lie loose, and by occasion fall as it were by excheate to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
gift. Your reasons of <hi>the largenesse and long continuance
of the Turkish</hi> Empire are as farre from the purpose, as your
whole discourse is from any sound Diuinitie: for not to stand
vpon the sifting of the trueth of them, which in some of them
may not vniustly be questioned, your inference is that <hi>such
principles are of great importance to increase and maintaine a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
estate:</hi> But the point is, whether any can be of sufficient
importance to vphold any estate, when God for the dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his CHRIST is purposed to ruine it, and as the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
speakes <hi>[of a fruitfull land to make it barren for the iniquity of
the people that dwell therein]</hi> before you speake of a <hi>Supernaturall</hi>
iudgement of God in destruction, and here of a <hi>Naturall</hi> and
humane inuention for preseruation, which can hold no more
proportion with the former, then a <hi>Venice</hi> glasse with an yron

should meane that are <hi>willing to become Turkish,</hi> I know not;
but what they are that inioy their estates <hi>in capite Ecclesiae ad

content to admit the toleration of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> too, in
their Dominions, rather then of Christians, your selfe when
you wrote this could not bee ignorant. Nay, some of the
<hi>Popes</hi> themselues, as namely <hi>Alexander the</hi> VI. and <hi>Paulus
the</hi> III. if we may credite <hi>Thuanus,</hi> had secret commerce with
the <hi>great Turke</hi> against the Christian Princes, and the former
of them, if <hi>Iouius,</hi> and <hi>Guicciardin</hi> mistake not, tooke vnder

to kill his brother <hi>Gemen.</hi> And <hi>Alexander</hi> the III. wrote to the

his <hi>Maiesties</hi> sonne in law is most bound to thanke you, and it
seemes you conceiued so much by intending your <hi>iourney to

considering you make both him and all the rest of the Kings
and Princes of Christendome that haue forsaken Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to bee <hi>both base and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall:</hi>
wheras I may be bold to say it, that at this day there are
none more moderate in their gouernments, then those whom
you call <hi>Schismatikes,</hi> and of them the greatest part were neuer
so flourishing, as since they renounced societie with that
Church, specially the <hi>Heluetians</hi> and <hi>Belgians,</hi> in whom you
instance, being growen more rich, more powerfull and
politike in their affaires, then euer before: And for <hi>popularity</hi>
the <hi>Heluetians</hi> had it long before any change of religion, and
those very <hi>Cantons</hi> which call themselues <hi>Catholike,</hi> retaine
that forme and none other vnto this day: And for the <hi>Belgians</hi>
it appeares by the <hi>Prince of Orenge</hi> his Apollogie, that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
challenged their freedome as due by the Capitulations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them and their gouernours the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
and now at last after so much Christian blood spilt (as all the

the <hi>King of Spaine</hi> and them, they are declared a free State.

of God,</hi> let their published Confessions which testifie, and

hee that compares their practise with that of the <hi>Italians,</hi> may

for <hi>his Saints</hi> they all agree (I speake for the maine body of

tell vs <hi>that you take the reason of all this to bee, because the rules of
Catholike religion are eternall, vniuersall and constant to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;</hi>
I graunt there is and ought to be a mutuall dependance
betwixt religion and ciuill policie, the one both giuing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
life and strength vnto, and from the other: yet true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
medleth not so much with the temporal state, as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or further the proceedings of it, otherwise then by the
force of the word and the power of Ecclesiasticall censures:
but that which you call <hi>the Catholike religion,</hi> hath (like the
Iuie that growes into the wall) so incorporated and intwisted
it selfe into the bowels of those States where it is setled, that it
can hardly bee rooted out, or remooued without endangering
the bodies of the States themselues, which cannot but giue vs
iust occasion to suspect, that it is for the most part in the points
controuersed betweene vs, nothing else but a policie inuented
of men, to serue their owne turnes. And consequently accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your owne rule set downe in the <hi>second Section</hi> of your

wee shall come to examine the rules of that Church, wee shall
finde that they are not so consonant to the Maiestie and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of temporall Princes, as you pretend, but rather tend to
the trampling of their Maiestie vnder foote, and laying their
honour in the dust, and to the aduancing and raising of the

(who withstood the bringing in of the Spanish Inquisition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

are more able vpon all occasions to second his <hi>Maiestie,</hi>
specially vpon the Seas, then any other State in <hi>Christendome.</hi>
What seruice they did vs in the yeere 1588. by keeping the
<hi>Prince of Parma</hi> from ioyning with the <hi>Spanish</hi> fleete, which
had swallowed vs vp in conceit, it is well knowen, and no
doubt but being confederates and friendly vsed, they would
be readie vpon like occasion to performe the like friendly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
And for those whom you call <hi>Catholikes,</hi> I would know
how many of them labor to <hi>aduance</hi> their confederates farther
then it stands with their owne aduantage or reputation.</p>
                  <p>In matter of Religion the <hi>Netherlander, Heluetian,</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> differ not at all: and from some States of the <hi>higher

from the Romish and Spanish, in as much as the latter admit
of the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> the former not so: and againe, (which
is another notable and maine point of difference) the former
submit the <hi>Pope</hi> to a generall Councell, the latter not, but as
they haue made him transcendent ouer Kings; so haue they
ouer Bishops too, not onely single, but assembled in Synode.
So that vpon the matter they were as good keepe themselues
at home, and saue so much trauell and charge: But to graunt
those (whom notwithstanding you call <hi>Caluinists</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
or distinction) were <hi>not agreed of their owne religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
yet to say that <hi>the rules of particular and transitorie honour
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3770:63"/>
depend vpon the principles of vniuersall and eternall truth,</hi> it can by
no meanes be admitted as a true principle, since those rules by
reason may be, and by practise are as certaine and constant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Infidels as Christians. No people were euer more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
and precise in termes of honour then the ancient <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Romanes,</hi> yet were they we know without God in the
world, without the knowledge of <hi>vniuersall and eternall truth.</hi>
And the same may be iustified of many of the Easterne princes
at this day: but I cannot but meruaile at your folly (specially
taking vpon you to play the Statesman) in telling his <hi>Maiestie</hi>
that <hi>the Caluinists will neuer agree together in making any one
king ouer them all,</hi> as if any Prince in Christendome were so
sencelesse as to expect it, or they so mad as to offer it, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
they are all either vnder the obedience of other Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes,
or free Estates of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: And yet no doubt but as
great <hi>securitie</hi> may be expected from them, as from your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
though his <hi>Maiestie</hi> were <hi>vnited to them in Religion,</hi> in
as much as they maintaine not the lawfulnesse of aequiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor acknowledge any superiour power able to assoile
them from the obligation of their oathes, and solemne promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
What reason hath <hi>his Maiestie</hi> (if hee were as firmely <hi>ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to them in the vnitie of their Religion,</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe
could desire) to expect greater <hi>securitie</hi> from them then his
Predecessors found at the hands of their Ancestors, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vpon occasion and opportunitie finde at the hands each
of other? Nay if they find no <hi>securitie</hi> many times from the
<hi>Popes</hi> themselues, who are the pretended heads of that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with what assurance can they expect it one from another,
being thereby onely linked together as members vnto that
head? It hath beene sayd of some of them, how iustly I leaue
to those who haue made triall, that they neither sing as they
pricke, nor pronounce as they write<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor speake as they thinke:
the latter of which (if we may credit <hi>Comines</hi>) might iustly be
verified of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. of <hi>France,</hi> who made shew of deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>the vnity of that religion,</hi> no man more, in so much that he

Catholike by your Popes and Cardinals, surely we haue as litle
reason to entertaine your doctrine, as wee haue good reason e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to be iealous of your practise. Your doctrine is, That the
<hi>Pope,</hi> if hee thinke good, may excommunicate and depose
kings, and dispose of their kingdomes, by absoluing their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
from their allegeance, and setting forraine princes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade

it be to the indangering of your Soueraigns person, &amp; the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of the whole body of the State. Your doctrine is, That
as many Churchmen as are in the Kingdom (which in most is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3770:65"/>
a third part, in some more) they are all exempted from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion
of the ciuill Magistrate, being for punishment, whether

courts, which haue both dependance vpon the <hi>Popes</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
and direction from his Canon Law. Your doctrine
is, That as many Bishops and Arch-Bishops as are any where
consecrated, ought to take their oath to bee true and loyall to
their good Lord and holy Father of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the vtmost to
execute and further his Commaunds, without any limitation

                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:3770:66"/>No meruaile then that <hi>Henry the eight</hi> when he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the forme of this Oath to bee publikely reade in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
complained to the Speaker <hi>Sir Tho. Audely</hi> and some

the Clergie of his Realme had bene his Subiects wholly, <hi>[but

is, that the Christians in the Primatiue Church abstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from taking armes, not so much for conscience sake, as
because they wanted strength: which must needs open a wide
gappe to the people, vpon any humorous discontent, when
they once feele their owne strength, like an vntamed horse to
cast their rider if they may; and that I may speake in your own
phrase, to make no bones of violating the Maiestie of the king
and his children, and is this <hi>a Religion fit to keepe Subiects in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to their Soueraignes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas our doctrine on the other side is, That the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of princes are sacred, and by Gods ordinance priuiledged
from all violence: and for their actions, that they are onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable
to God, their Crownes and Scepters not dispose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by any; but by him who set the one vpon their heads, and
the other in their hands, who hath the name written on his
thigh, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> (who as <hi>Iob</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth)
[<note n="*" place="margin">Iob. 12. 19. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>leadeth Princes away spoiled, and ouerthroweth the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and againe he powreth contempt vpon Princes, and weakeneth
the strength of the mightie.</hi>] Lastly, our doctrine is, that the
Subiects duetie is not by any dispensable, but by him alone,
who by his diuine prouidence subiected them to that power.
Now whether of these doctrines, ours or yours is most likely
<hi>to keepe men in obedience,</hi> euen our enemies shall bee our
Iudges: Yet this to bee your doctrine your bookes witnesse,
and no man of learning and ingenuitie among you will denie.</p>
                  <p>But for our doctrine you pretend the opinions of <hi>Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>

in <hi>their liues</hi> and <hi>practises?</hi> If there bee none, how
comes it to passe that there are so many of that profession by
whose deedes a man may safely guesse, they say in their hearts
there is no God? If there be any, why doe you so pathetically
exclaime against <hi>Caluinists,</hi> as if they stood single in this bill of

he is to some a rocke of offence, or his precious Word, because
to some it prooues a sauour of death vnto death? and if wee
must acquit him, and lay the fault where it is, on them who
draw poison to hurt themselues out of the sweetest flowers,

                     <hi>he boweth and bendeth them by working inuisibly in them,

<hi>of his Suruay,</hi> the same man maketh <hi>Caluin</hi> to teach that God
is the onely sinner, in as much as hee doubteth not to say, that
the will of God is the necessitie of things, whereas indeede
they are <hi>S. Augustines</hi> words, <hi>de Gen. ad lit. lib. 6. cap. 15.</hi> and so
rightly quoted by <hi>Caluin,</hi> though <hi>Kellison</hi> professe <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
haue no such thing in the place by him alleaged. So that
if they had the charitie to interpret the speaches of our men
as gently and fauourably as they doe their owne, there would
appeare little difference, or none at all, and I will vndertake to
shewe, if I bee put to it, that many speaches and passages goe
for currant and Catholike doctrine among them, which if they
should bee alleaged out of <hi>Caluin,</hi> would be censured as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie:
but it seemeth the ground of the song which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor
here descanteth on, was taken out of <hi>Kellison</hi> in the forenamed

who there in affirmeth no more, nor so much as they doe.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, what wee maintaine in this poynt touching
the will or cooperation of God in sinne or with sinners, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many others fully and cleerely deliuered by the pens of
the most Reuerend father in God <hi>the Lord Archbishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury
his Grace, now being, in the last of his sixe solemne Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi>
read in the Vniuersitie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> for his degree of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorship,
of Doctor <hi>Abbot</hi> now L. Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> in his
answere to Doctor <hi>Bishops</hi> preface to his second part, of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Morton</hi> Deane of <hi>Winchester</hi> in the first Booke and 25.
Chap. of his Cath. Apologie, of Doctor <hi>Feild</hi> Deane of
<hi>Glocester in his third Booke and 23. Chapter of the Church,</hi> and
lastly of my late worthy Colleague Doctor <hi>White, in the 41.
Digression, and 50. Paragraph</hi> of <hi>The way to the Church.</hi> The
summe of all is this, that about and concerning sin God doth
three things; first as a cause vniuersall hee sustaineth and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
the beeing and moouing, both of the nature and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whether good or bad of all mankind: Secondly, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
his grace which should lighten the vnderstandings
and soften and mollifie the hearts of men: Thirdly by giuing
way to Satan, to worke vpon them, and no way either streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
them against him, or weakning his force: Fourthly, by
ordinating sinne, which is nothing else but the disposing and
directing of it in such maner and measure, as to him seemeth
best, that it stretcheth it selfe no further or otherwise, either
for time or place, or persons, then his good pleasure willeth:
sometimes he turneth it to another end <hi>then the person</hi> doing it
thought of, somtimes he maketh way for it by shutting vp and
stopping all other passages by which it might breake foorth,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3770:68"/>
sometimes hee punisheth one sinne with another, as pride is
punished with enuie, he being not the author of enuie, as it is
sinfull, but as is it carries a sting with it, implying a contrariety
betweene it and the soule of man, which maketh it bitter and
afflictiue. Fiftly and lastly, by occasioning sinne accidentally,
as when God doeth that which in it selfe is good, and yet
knoweth through the euill disposition which is in men, it will
giue occasion to increase their wickednesse, and make it grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then it was before. This I take to be the substance and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of that wee hold touching this point, and I doubt not but
the vndertaking of my deceased fellow Chaplaine may bee
made good, in shewing euery parcell of this doctrine in the
writings of those, who either liue or died in profession, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> To conclude then, <hi>God prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinateth
no man to bee a Traitour or a Theefe,</hi> but foreseeing
hee will bee so, hee determineth to make vse of their theft or
treason for the aduancement of his owne glory, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of his Church and children, hee being in himselfe so
good as hee would suffer none euill in the world, were hee not
withall so powerfull, as out of euery euill to draw some good,
as by the same power hee brought light out of darkenesse and
caused water abundantly to flowe out of the hard and drie
rocke.</p>

more narrowly into the particular veines and bowels of the

sensible of the horrour of it, in regard of their owne danger.

appeared by his commending the destruction of <hi>Mirandol</hi> and

repented himselfe of the fact, and gaue charge to <hi>Henry</hi> his
sonne, to doe iustice vpon the murtherers: <hi>Henry</hi> the III. they
forsooke not to the last being persecuted, and at last murdered
by the leaguers: and as for <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. surnamed the great,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3770:71"/>
they not onely stucke close to him in all his distresses, when
his Romish Catholike subiects banded themselues against
him, but when hee had quitted his owne and their religion,
and of their champion became a great patron and benefactour
of the Iesuits, their most malitious opposites; yet did they not
cease to honour him still as much as any his most loyall and
louing subiects, both liuing, by their pennes and tongues,
and persons, and states, and beeing dead with their teares,
and desire of search to be made, and iustice to bee done vpon
such as should bee found to haue any finger in his death: Or
if you were ignorant of these forraine examples, yet could
you not but remember that here at home <hi>Edward the sixt,</hi>
and <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory, and <hi>our present
gracious Soueraigne,</hi> receiued as much honour from those
whome you call <hi>Caluinists,</hi> as euer any prince in the world,
from his pretended Catholike subiects, and that not so much
for the <hi>seruing of their owne turnes,</hi> as for conscience sake, and
the performance of their dueties. What <hi>turne</hi> can they
now expect to be serued from <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> being gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to her fathers, yet doth her name remaine alwayes honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
among them, and the memoriall of her pretious, as the
remembrance of Iosias, [<note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 49. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>like the composition of the perfume that
is made by the art of the Apothecary, sweet as hony to all mouthes,
and as musicke at a banquet of wine.</hi>] wheras many of her Romish
Catholike subiects endeuoured what they could to haue taken
her heart blood from her beeing liuing, and still indeuour
what they can to take her good name from her beeing dead.
At his <hi>Maiesties</hi> entrance some of them pretended to honour
him, none more, but it was <hi>for the seruing of their owne
turnes,</hi> in hope of a toleration: for when once they sawe
the constancie of his MAIESTIES minde, and the vanity of
their owne hope, they hoped to haue serued him and his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
such <hi>a turne,</hi> as should haue sounded through the Christian
world, and haue made the eares of him to tingle, that should
haue heard it: whereas they who receiued not that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
at the conference of Hampton Court, which
they desired, and hoped for, continue notwithstanding faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3770:71"/>
and loyall Subiects to their <hi>Soueraigne.</hi> Lastly for <hi>Queene
Mary</hi> though they could expect no good turne from her in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their profession, but rather all the shrewd turnes that
her misguided zeale, and the malice of others could heape vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, yet the <hi>Norfolke</hi> and <hi>Suffolke</hi> Protestants, were her
strongest furtherance to attaine the Crowne, and afterward
the rest as well as they, ceased not to honour her as farre foorth
as the honor due to God would giue them leaue, except some
few, who opposed themselues not so much against her Person
or Gouernment, as against the mariage with a forreiner, whose
power they feared would bee preiudiciall to the Realme, and
yet was not this attempt neither seconded or approued by the
maine bodie of that profession: [But <hi>all other Caluinists</hi> (you
say) <hi>doe ouerthrow their Kings and Princes wheresoeuer they can
preuaile,</hi>] in which passage can none other bee intended but
the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> of whom touching this point, I will say no
more, that they are now after the wasting of so much treasure,
and the shedding of so much Christian blood, declared a free
estate by him, whose Regall right you pretend they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, those whom you call <hi>Caluinists, either denie, or call
into question as few principles of Religion or Articles of Faith,</hi> as
any <hi>Romish</hi> Catholike: nay, I will be bold to say it, and readie
to make it good, that the former maintaine some of them
strongly, which the latter ouerthrow, if not in plaine termes
and directly, yet at least indirectly and by consequence, by
establishing their owne Articles: Vnknowne to the Apostles
and the Primitiue Church, they make the Articles of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Creede of none effect; and for exposition which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
not points in difference betweene vs, and the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> if I can iudge any thing, your Writers differ more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselues, and assume to themselues a greater libertie
in expounding then ours: and if they be restrained of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoricall,
Tropologicall, and Anagogicall interpretations,
(as impertinent many times to the point in hand as wide from
the scope of the Text) they will presently cry out that wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the authoritie of the Church, when it may be they haue
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3770:72"/>

be to God or to Kings for Gods sake in such Religion?</p>

Christian kingdomes doe professe to be if the reines of Religion bee
let loose, the sword commonly is too weake, and comes to late, and is
like enough to giue the day to the Rebell. And seeing the last and
strongest bond of iustice is an Oath, which is a principall act of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and were but a mockerie if it were not for the punishment of
Hell, and the reward of Heauen; it is vnpossible to execute iustice
without the helpe of Religion, and therefore the neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

fresh with a solemne discourse of <hi>the necessitie of Religion</hi> for a
well ordered Common-wealth, vnder colour of meeting with
an obiection of States-men, that <hi>it matters not what opinions
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3770:72"/>
men hold in matters of Religion, so they bee kept in awe by iustice,
and by the sword:</hi> But these Statesmen I take to be <hi>of Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels</hi>
sect, who, of what nation he was by birth, and of what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
by profession, wee are not ignorant. The ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
indeed being themselues. Lords of the world, became
vassals to the Idoles of all nations, by admitting the free vse of
their diuerse Religions of them all, holding that (as it seemeth)
the most perfect Religion, which refused none as false: neither
is the <hi>Turke</hi> much different from that opinion, howbeit hee
preferre his owne Religion before all others: but all other
States-men who are so conuersant in affaires of State, as
they neglect not Christanitie, can not but hold the Christian
religion alone, admittable in Christian Common-wealthes.
Now as we grant in all States some Religion necessary, and in
Christian States onely the Christian admittable: So with all
we confesse an Oath to bee a principall acte of that Religion:
But how it is abused by <hi>Romish</hi> Catholikes for <hi>seruing their
owne turnes,</hi> by Dispensations, by aequiuocations, and Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Reseruations, both Histories witnesse, and wee haue had
too great experience: By which meanes that which indeede
should be the surest and strongest band of truth &amp; iustice, and
as the Apostle speakes, [<note n="*" place="margin">Ebr. 6. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>an end of all strife,</hi>] is become the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of quarrell, and a meere visard for iniustice and falshood to
maske vnder: and by the same meanes, as the <hi>Romish</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is growen odious to vs; so for their sakes, both ours and
theirs, (going both vnder the common name of Christians) is
in that respect growen odious to the very <hi>Turkes,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
an oath made by the name of their <hi>Mahomet</hi> more inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably,
then wee by the Name of CHRIST one to another; as
well appeared by our King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who being a
great exactor vpon the poore Commons, as euer was any king
before him, or since, and thinking thereby to winne the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
sooner to his deuotion, most faithfully promised them
once or twice, and thereunto bound himselfe with a solemne
oath, both before the Clergie and Laitie, to graunt vnto
them the old liberties and Customes of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and
<hi>Charta de Foresta,</hi> perpetually to bee obserued, whereupon
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3770:73"/>
a <hi>Quindecim</hi> was granted to the King: but after the payment
was sure, the King trusting the <hi>Popes</hi> dispensation for a
little money to be discharged of his oath and couenant, went
from that he had promised, and solemnely sworne before. In
like manner the sayd King at another time being in neede of
money, signed himselfe with the crosse, pretending and swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
deepely in the face of the whole Parliament, that hee
himselfe would goe in person against the <hi>Saracens:</hi> but as
soone as the money was fingred, small care was taken for the
performance of the oath, being so put in head by certaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, that hee needed not to passe of that periurie, for
so much as the <hi>Pope</hi> for an hundred pounds or two, would
quickly discharge him thereof, as <hi>Matthew Parris</hi> reports
it, who liued at the same time, <hi>and was often in Court with him,</hi>
this was then the account (which by reason of the Popes ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
dispensations) Kings made of their oathes to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
                  <p>The like account by the same meanes did <hi>Charles the</hi> 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.
<hi>of France</hi> and <hi>the Queene his mother</hi> make of their oath taken
to <hi>the King of Nauarre, the Prince of Condie,</hi> the Admirall,
and the rest of the Protestant profession, at what time his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
marriage was made more red with their blood then his
wine; but this blood crying for vengeance, himself at his death
issued blood at all the passages of his bodie: Neither did Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
make any other reckoning of their oathes, taken to their
Kings, if they had the like dispensations, or Kings to Kings, or
Subiects to subiects: And if this be not to make a meere moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery
of oathes (which should be made<note n="*" place="margin">Iere. 4. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>in trueth, in iudgment
and in iustice,</hi>) and consequently of religion, as if indeede
there were no punishment of Hell, no reward of heauen, I
conceiue not what is: and by your owne rule this contempt
of religion cannot but in time drawe on the destruction of
those States, which thus vnder pretence of religion and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to their holy Father, neglect and contemne it. Lastly,
if they esteeme so little of oathes made one to another, what
should we expect at their hands, to whom they hold Faith is

of those three they breake the first and second, in worshipping

which the more it is pressed downe, the more it spreadeth.

motions to gather strength and fortifie themselues in going.
And for that great <hi>roaring of the waters</hi> which you pretend,
though it be <hi>a noise</hi> fearefull to you, yet to vs is it acceptable,
as being occasioned not so much from the <hi>shallownesse</hi> of the

will not denie it:</hi> Wherein if we be more charitable to you,
then you are to vs, in passing censures of damnation, it should
in my iudgement rather argue the goodnesse of that Religion
from whence such charity flowes towards mens persons, then
be vrged as a proofe for the approbation of that erronious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which in it selfe it condemns. The <hi>Turke</hi> is too liberall
in admitting all Religions to the hope of saluation, and on the
other side you are too niggardly and sparing in shutting out
all from the hope thereof, which receiue not the marke of the
beast in their foreheads or hands. We desiring to runne a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
course betwixt both extremes, as we shut out all such who
directly deny the merits of CHRIST: so doe wee passe a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
censure on those who deny him not of malice, but of
ignorance, and that not directly but by consequence. It is
true that S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath in the fifth to the <hi>Galatians, [<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>If yee be

(though with <hi>Christ</hi>) in the matter of iustification, he is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished

but yet our assurance is, that many of them when they
come to make their last account betwixt God and their owne

<hi>Caluin</hi> to haue beene an excellent instrument of God, in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing
and suppressing of Poperie, and the clearing and

may either stand single and be encountred alone, or returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to our old bias, and relaps vpon <hi>Rome,</hi> and so through
<hi>Caluins</hi> sides you strike at the throat and heart of our Religion:
For our parts, we all wish with the Reuerend &amp; learned<note n="1" place="margin">My Lord of Ely.</note> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
of our owne Church, that you were no more <hi>Papists</hi> then
wee <hi>Caluinists,</hi> no more pind on the <hi>Popes</hi> sleeue, then we on
<hi>Caluins,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we esteeme as a worthy man, but a man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
subiect to humane error, and frailtie. We maintaine
nothing with him because he affirmes it, but because from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
grounds he proues it; whereas the <hi>Popes</hi> bare assertion
with you is proofe sufficient. You are so sworne to his words,
that they are of equal or higher authoritie with you then <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
his precepts with his Schollers, <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> is enough for

authors not diuine, <hi>vsque ad aras,</hi> so farre foorth as with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

<hi>Caluin:</hi> but to say that the doctrine which he maintaines, is as

<hi>Rome,</hi> is a desperate assertion, and such as can neuer be made
good, did all our fugitiues lay their heads together, and were
all their wits turned into one. And I much meruaile what you
meant, pretending so much tendernesse of conscience, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in search of the trueth, to suffer your malice so farre to

present it to the scanning of so learned a Prince, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it to the view and censure of the world: For if <hi>Caluins</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

must it needs follow that either ours and the <hi>Romish</hi> agree in

                  <p>Among many other testimonies I will onely instance in

knot of friendship, and the mutual consent betweene</hi> England
<hi>and</hi> Suisserland <hi>in matter of Religion, howbeit they were remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

who in defence of his <hi>Maiesties</hi> Booke against <hi>Coffeteau</hi>
acknowledgeth that <hi>wee had enough sufficient men of our owne to
defend the Cause, but that hee vndertooke the worke to let the
world knowe, that the same Confession which his</hi> Maiestie <hi>had

in his Person and Writings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what neede I stand vpon the particular testimonies of
priuate men, since the Confessions of our Churches are extant
to be compared, as well in the Booke, intituled, <hi>The Harmony,</hi>
as in that other termed <hi>The bodie of Confessions?</hi> In the meane

the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in points of difference

on the other, that so wee may make some estimate whether

that of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now for the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
I will not extend it so wide as to the Bookes and Lectures of
our Bishops, and publique professours, the lights and guides
of our Church and Vniuersities, nor yet contract and confine
it, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor doeth, within the narrow compasse of the

of theirs in the yeeres of our Lord 1562, and againe 1604,
and lately againe confirmed by two seuerall <hi>Canons,</hi> the 5, and

and miraculous deliuerances of them at sundry times, hath in
some fort testified to the world: Howbeit as a worthy Knight
hath well obserued, [the Friars would make their followers
beleeue, that it is aboue all other places a professed retreat and
sanctuarie of Roguerie, giuing harbour to all the runnagates,
traytors, rebels, and wicked persons of all other Countries; by

of their picking and loose Friars, hearing <hi>Geneua</hi> to bee a

plaied with their owne ere they came thither, to finde the

their Church-plate, and other repositaries, and brought away
the bootie in triumph to <hi>Geneua,</hi> vnder the colour of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

for <hi>Maldonate</hi> and <hi>Iansenius,</hi> though they colour the matter
more cunningly in the change of words, yet are they nothing

a great part whereof is spent in wiping off that asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and therefore <hi>Caluin</hi> may beare it at your hands with the
greater patience. Against <hi>the state of Bishops,</hi> if he any where
write otherwise then becomes him, we may well impute it to
his zeale against the great abuse of that order in the <hi>Romane</hi>
hierarchie, and his desire of establishing his owne discipline,
which though he did well to erect at <hi>Geneua</hi> (as being a kinde
of gouernment most fit for that city;) yet to shew that wee
make him no god, we professe he did ill in imposing it as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
on all other Churches. What friend hee was <hi>to Kings,</hi>
beside infinite other passages through his voluminous wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
his onely Epistle to <hi>Francis</hi> the French king, prefixed to
his Institutions, doth sufficiently declare, which (as <hi>Beza</hi> not

would haue occasioned the giuing of some deepe wound to
the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> hee being not of the humour of those
kings that followed after him in the kingdome, but a sharpe
censurer, of a deepe iudgement, a great patrone of learning,
and of himselfe not auerse from that side, and though in his

The aduice of an old man is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly best, but the execution

doth profit rather in the powers of vnderstanding, then in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues

which shewes it selfe in this, that before his comming thither,

but to draw neerer to the purpose: <hi>Caluin,</hi> how rare and

they were so tempered and seasoned with modestie, that

submitted himselfe to the disposition of the Presbiterie and

the seeds of it were sowen, and the foundation layed before
his comming thither. Now let the Reader iudge of the truth
of that which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctour hath published, namely <hi>that Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin
thought good vpon the opportunitie to giue the venture, and to

in that Citie,</hi> which (as <hi>Beza</hi> truely witnesseth of it,)
is and hath beene <hi>Paupertatis officina,</hi> the shop of pouertie, in
so much that when hee dyed, his whole estate (together with
his studie of bookes sold at a deare rate, could hardly be valued

of the trueth of his proceedings at his first comming to
<hi>Geneua,</hi> I will hereunto adde the relation of one, who profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
wrote against the necessitie of imposing that discipline
on other Churches, which he there erected, and therefore may

forsaken, being of likelihood frighted with the peoples
sudden attempt for the abolishment of Popish Religion: the
euent of which enterprise they thought not safe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to waite for in that place. At the comming of <hi>Caluin</hi>
thither the forme of their ciuill regiment was popular, as it
continueth at this day: Neither King, nor Duke, nor Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
of any authoritie or power ouer them, but Officers
chosen by the people, yeerely out of themselues, to order
all things with publike consent: For Spirituall gouernement
they had no Lawes at all agreed vpon, but did what the
Pastours of their Soules by perswation could winne them
vnto. <hi>Caluin</hi> being admitted one of their preachers, and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie
Reader amongst them, considered how dangerous it
was that the whole estate of that Church should still hang on
so slender a threed, as the liking of an ignorant multitude is, if
it haue power to change whatsoeuer it listeth: wherefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vnto him two of the other Ministers for more counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the action (albeit the rest were all against it) they
mooued and in the end perswaded with much adoe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to binde themselues by solemne oath, first, neuer to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Papacie amongst them againe, and secondly, to liue
in obedience vnto such orders concerning the exercise of their
Religion, and the former Eccesiasticall gouernment, as those
their true and faithfull Ministers of Gods word had agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to Scripture set down for that end and purpose.] Whence
wee may obserue, first, that <hi>Caluin was no founder of a new
State amongst them</hi> (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor would beare vs in hand)
but as hee found it popular at his entrance, so at his death hee
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3770:101"/>
left it: Secondly, the citizens <hi>swore not that all Popery was false,</hi>
as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor assures, but bound themselues with an oath,
neuer to admit of the <hi>Papacie</hi> (that is as I take the <hi>Popes</hi> vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
authoritie) amongst them againe, and for his <hi>Catechisme</hi>
one hee wrote which <hi>Beza</hi> calles <hi>opus admirandum,</hi> an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

hauing first written it in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
at the request of strangers translated into <hi>High Dutch,

                  <p>You goe forward, and tell vs that from <hi>hence it is come to

as a ragge of Popery, and</hi> Caluins <hi>Institutions cried vp by voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Court and Countrey, in hope it may one day serue the like

<hi>Caluin</hi> compiled his <hi>Institutions,</hi> or as if we knew not that
<hi>Caluins Institutions</hi> make nothing against the gouernment of
lawfull Magistrates; or if it bee a booke so dangerous as you
would make it, a wonder it is to mee, that neither your selfe

subuersion of the state, or presently <hi>contemne the doctrine of the
Church of England?</hi> Your olde Master, Archbishop <hi>Whitegift</hi>
was of another minde, who maintained to his vtmost the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of England,</hi> and yet gaue he <hi>Caluin</hi> his due
also, labouring alwayes where any occasion was offered, to
countenance his writings with <hi>Caluins</hi> authority, and specially
out of that booke which you most mislike, yeelding him the
title of a famous and learned man: Nay, euen in the vse of
things indifferent, hee giues this testimonie of his iudgement
and moderation. [<note n="1" place="margin">Tract. 2 cap. 4.</note> If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Caluin</hi> were aliue, saith he, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnderstood the state of our Church and Controuersie, truly
I verely beleeue that hee would condemne your doing, and I
am the rather induced to thinke so, because I vnderstand him
to haue allowed many things in the <hi>English</hi> Church, being at
<hi>Geneua,</hi> which you altogether mislike.] To this Archbishops
testimonie, I could adde the opinion of his predecessours,
<hi>Cranmer Grindal,</hi> and <hi>Parker,</hi> gathered out of their seuerall
Epistles to <hi>Caluin</hi> and other writings; but I will content my
selfe with that of Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> who was so far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neglecting
or <hi>contemning the doctrine of the Church of England, as a relique
or ragge of Poperie,</hi> as that the Confession extant in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
for our Church, is registred as the authenticall <hi>doctrine</hi> of
our Church, as well in the body, as in the harmony of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions:
But Archbishop<note n="2" place="margin">Tract. 8. cap. 3. diuis. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>Whitegift</hi> goeth farther, making
both his Apology &amp; the defence therof, to be the <hi>doctrine of the
Church of England:</hi> And by this Archbishops authority was it
ordered, that those his bookes should be bought of euery Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and chained in their Churches to be read of the people at
vacant times: Yet this worthy Bishop in the defence of his
Apologie,<note n="3" place="margin">Cap. 7 diuis. 4.</note> termeth <hi>Caluin a reuerend Father, and worthy orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church of God.</hi> Now touching his booke of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<hi>Institution</hi> in particular, M. <hi>Hooker</hi> (who is well knowne
not to haue <hi>contemned the doctrine of the Church of England, as a

things whatsoeuer they were that afterward bestowed their
labour, he gained the aduantage of preiudice against them, if
they gaine-sayed, and of glory aboue them, if they consented:
Then which I cannot imagine what could bee vttered more
effectually. Thus malice would not suffer you to see that
worth in <hi>Caluin</hi> and his Writings, which these Worthies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
and published, who were notwithstanding more earnest
and zealous Patrones of the <hi>doctrine of the Church of England,</hi>
then your selfe: But it may be you thought it would bee credit

dishonouring the names of famous men, was held by S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
and is accounted by all good and wise men, but a tricke
of vaine and childish arrogancie, there being lesse comparison
betwixt <hi>Carier</hi> and <hi>Caluin,</hi> then <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Stapleton,</hi> whom

they turned Statists, &amp; in stead of gaining soules, cast about for

the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the rule of Controuersies of the Church, of

which is now publikely taught and professed with vs. If by
<hi>the Church of Rome,</hi> we will vnderstand her chiefe Prelates, not

then her Church; from whence then arose this <hi>confusion of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
which followed after, but onely from that <hi>corruption of
State</hi> which went before? and yet it cannot but bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that as our bodies first warme our clothes, and then
our clothes serue to keepe warme our bodies: so the <hi>corruption

                  <p>Neither is it true, <hi>that Henry tooke this Title to himselfe:</hi> it was
giuen him by the <hi>Parliament</hi> of his Lords, and Commons, and
<hi>Conuocation</hi> of his Clergie, not as a new thing but as renewed.
And if he were desirous <hi>to change his bedfellow in hope of heires
male,</hi> as you tell vs before, it was not <hi>to giue way to the lust of
Anne Bulleine,</hi> as here you affirme; and if hee might haue had
his will in being dispensed with by yeelding to the <hi>Popes</hi> will,
in ioyning with <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, against the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Charles</hi> as before it is proued, then did he not <hi>exclude the
Pope, &amp; take that Title to dispence with himselfe,</hi> especially being
mooued with the approbation of so many Vniuersities and
learned men: But if thereby he made himselfe a way for <hi>the
supply of his excesse with the spoyle of the Church,</hi> wee haue not
wherein so iustly to excuse him, howbeit hee conuerted much
of it to good vses, namely to the erecting of sixe Bishoprickes,
to wit, <hi>Westminster, Chester, Peterborough, Oxford, Bristol</hi> and
<hi>Gloucester,</hi> whereof the fiue last are yet in being; at which time
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3770:108"/>
hee also erected at <hi>Canterbury</hi> a Deane with 12. Prebends, at
<hi>Winchester</hi> another with 12. more, at <hi>Worcester</hi> another with
ten, at <hi>Chester</hi> another with sixe, at <hi>Peterborough</hi> another with

at <hi>Rochester</hi> another with sixe, and lastly, at <hi>Norwich</hi> another
with sixe;<note n="5" place="margin">Besides all this hee bestowed the reuenues of the <hi>Gray Friars</hi> in <hi>London</hi> vpon the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> toward the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of their poore, making of the Friery a Parish Church, whereunto hee gaue 500. marks yeerely of lands for euer: one thousand marks also he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be giuen to the poore, and to twelue poore Knights at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore,</hi> each of them twelue pence a day for euer.</note> so that wee haue good reason to thinke he returned
againe to the Church much out of the Abbey lands: and if,
notwithstanding all this, <hi>God blessed him not in his thriuing,</hi> wee
haue nothing else to answere but that of <hi>Salomon, [It is a snare
to the man who deuoureth that which is holy, and after vowes to
make inquiry]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>in his wiuing</hi> hee so <hi>blessed</hi> him, (though in this too hee
shewed himselfe a man, and consequently subiect to humane
passion, and frailty) that three of his children successiuely wore
the Crown after him, of which the first was renowmed for his
vertue beyond his age, and the last beyond her Sexe; of the
one, and his mother it was written,
<q>
                        <l>Phoenix Ianaiacet, nato Phoenice; dolendum</l>
                        <l>Saecula Phoenices nullatulisse duas.</l>
                     </q>
And to the other might bee applied,
<q>
                        <l>Non decor effecit fragilem, non sceptra superbam,</l>
                        <l>Sola potens humilis, sola pudica decens.</l>
                     </q>
And though they all died without issue, yet doth his honour
still liue in theirs. <hi>Henry</hi> the II. of <hi>France</hi> died in the vnitie of
the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet three of his sonnes reigning after him
left the Crown to a neighbour Prince, as the children of <hi>Henry</hi>
the VIII heere with vs did, yet none that I haue met with
hold him in that regard <hi>accursed of God,</hi> and if in that respect
<hi>God cursed Henry,</hi> because hee renounced the pretended au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then should hee by vertue
of that reason haue blessed <hi>Henries eldest daughter</hi> with issue,
who with great submission and deuotion reconciled her selfe
to that Church, and married to the most Catholike King; and
though the world were for a while so borne in hand; yet in the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3770:109"/>
end the great and solemne expectation thereof vanished into
smoake.</p>
                  <p>Now that <hi>Henrie was wearie of his title of Supremacie before
he died,</hi> it appeares not, and that <hi>hee wished to bee reconciled to
the Pope,</hi> which you call, <hi>being in the Church againe,</hi> is as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
since no doubt is to bee made, but vpon notice giuen of
his Contrition, and desire of Satisfaction, hee might as easily
haue beene absolued as wished it: But certaine it is, that hee
wished it not, if we may make coniecture of his wishes from
those speeches, which a little before his death hee deliuered to
<hi>Mounsieur de Hannibault,</hi> Lord Admirall of <hi>France,</hi> and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
to the <hi>French king,</hi> being then at <hi>Hampton Court</hi> in
the moneth of <hi>August,</hi> and in the yeere 1546. in the hearing
of <hi>Cranmer</hi> Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the reformation of Religion, and afterwards more neere
his death, and more openly to <hi>Bruno</hi> Ambassador of <hi>Iohn Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derike</hi>
Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> vnto whom the King gaue this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
in the hearing of these foure sufficient witnesses, <hi>the
Lord Seymer, Earle of Hartford, Lord Lisley, then Admirall,</hi>
the <hi>Earle of Bedford, Lord Priuie Seale,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Paget,</hi>
[That if the quarrell of the Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi>
were nothing else against the <hi>Emperour,</hi> but
for matter of Religion, he should stand to it
strongly, and hee would take his part, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him not to doubt nor feare,] and with this
answere dismissed him. Besides the manner of his sonne and
heire Apparent, Prince <hi>Edwards</hi> education, the qualitie and
disposition of those persons whom he named as the principall
ouerseers of his Will, (from which number hee excluded the
Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> the most busie and forward instrument
in those times, for the maintenance of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion,
though hee had once admitted him, and was earnestly solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some of his bed chamber to readmit him) are to mee so
many euident demonstrations, that hee was so farre from <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiug
reconciliation with the Church of Rome,</hi> that hee rather
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3770:109"/>
desired and intended, if God had spared him life a while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
some more full and perfect reformation of Religon: But
the secret working of Gods holy prouidence which disposeth
all things after his owne wisedome and purpose, thought it
good, rather by taking that King away, to reserue the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment

the worst compiler of the Historie of our Countrey, hee was
with great solemnitie buried at <hi>Windsor,</hi> vnder a most costly

was, in whose braue spirit a man might obserue, blended and
tempered together, by a rare kinde of mixture, great vertues,
and no lessevices.] But had he honoured the See Apostolike,
as much at last, as hee did at first, his vices had beene buried in
silence, and his vertues highly extolled: whereas now by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
himselfe against it, his vertues are suppressed, and his

from his mother, and his grandmother; so may we by the same
reason, from the faith, which dwelt in the mother of Queene

[<hi>to leaue lopping at the branches, and strike at the roote,</hi>] will put
it out of doubt; and doubtlesse as in that regard shee suffered
much hardenesse, during the raigne of her sister, so had shee
not suruiued to haue worne the Crowne, had not God in his
prouidence mooued the heart of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to preserue her

ruefull estate, as out of reason of state, lest she being taken out
of the way, and her sister dying (as she did) without issue, the

be vnited and annexed to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> by meanes

                  <p>Besides all this, being as she was the miracle of her sexe and
ranke, for wit and learning, it is not improbable that, as the
knowledge of the Arts and Languages, and the light of the
Gospell brake forth both together; so in her person the one
might haue prepared, and as it were beaten out a way for the
entrance of the other, though neither her Mother had beene
that way affected, nor her Father made any breach, as wee see
his <hi>Maiestie</hi> that now is, to the glory of God and our great

his Mother liued and died in that Religion, in which shee was

discouered the trueth, but chosen and professed it being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,
and with his Penne maintained and defended that
which he professeth. True indeede it is, that <hi>Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
during the raigne of her sister, tender both by sexe and
age, and wrought by the frownes and threates of <hi>Cardinall
Poole,</hi> then Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> Legate, and
in <hi>England</hi> the principall <hi>Proctor</hi> and Champion, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing
of his authority, was once brought to acknowledge
that shee was a <hi>Romane Catholike,</hi> but herein she did no more
then S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> did (whose successour the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth

though after ward being at liberty they reimbraced their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

who being terrified with her Fathers displeasure, wrote him a

the case is very much altered: for your <hi>Maiestie</hi> hath no need of

your Title with the diuorce of one wife, and the marrying of fiue
more, neither your mother, nor your selfe should euer haue made
Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> afraid with your Right to the Crowne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>

that Parenthesis of State is at an end, there is no reason but that the
old sentence may returne againe, and bee continued in that sense,
as if the Parenthesis had been cleane left out, and that God had of

and by all his best endeuours promote the <hi>Catholike cause,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which by a solemne and sacred Oath, hee should religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
subscribe after the death of that <hi>miserable woman</hi>] (for so it
pleased his <hi>Holinesse</hi> to terme <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that most great and
happie Queene;) By vertue of which <hi>Bulles,</hi> (if vertue may be
in any such vicious libels) the Iesuites disswaded the <hi>Romish</hi>
minded Subiects, from yeelding in any wise obedience vnto
our most gracious Soueraigne now being. But this not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to their wished effect, and hee now solemnely proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with an vniuersall applause, loue, and peace, their hopes
beganne to wither and growe colde; and no succours from
<hi>Spaine</hi> being now to bee expected, <hi>Garnet the Superiour</hi> for
the auoyding farther dangers, sacrificed these starued <hi>Buls</hi> to
the God of fire. Moreouer, in the yeere 1588. when his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse</hi>
blessed that inuincible <hi>Spanish</hi> Nauie, was it to settle the
Crowne vpon his <hi>Maiestie</hi> after Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should be
deposed? Surely his <hi>Maiestie</hi> both rightly conceiued, and
freely expressed the contrary to <hi>Sir Robert Sidney,</hi> at that time
sent into <hi>Scotland</hi> from Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> affirming <hi>that hee
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3770:117"/>
expected none other good turne at the Spaniards hands, but that
which</hi> Polyphemus <hi>promised to</hi> Vlisses, <hi>that others being first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
himselfe should haue the fauour to bee swallowed last:</hi> And
did not the greatest part of <hi>Pius</hi> his <hi>Bull,</hi> aiming principally at
her, through her sides also strike his <hi>Maiestie?</hi> And did not
one <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> who sate at the helme in <hi>Rome,</hi> write a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Booke of <hi>Titles,</hi> intituled <hi>Doleman,</hi> wherein he excludes
his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> and prefers the <hi>Infant a of Spaines</hi> right before
all other pretenders to the Crowne? but when hee once saw
his <hi>Maiestie</hi> setled beyond all hope and expectation, he made
as you doe, and the rest at that time did, a vertue of necessitie,
acknowledging his vndoubted and lawfull Claime, in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to his <hi>Triple conuersion,</hi> whereof for mine owne part I can
giue none other reason then that which you adde to another
purpose, <hi>the case is altered:</hi> Whiles his <hi>Maiestie</hi> was onely in
hope you shewed your selues in your owne colours: being
now quiet in possession, you plucke in your hornes, yeelde
to the times, and are content to bee carried with the streame.</p>
                  <p>And though the personall case bee altered in regard of his
<hi>Maiestie,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. yet if his <hi>Maiesty</hi> either needed
the like dispensations, or had the like will to pull down Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
I make no question but his <hi>Holinesse</hi> would without any
great difficulty giue way to both, conditionally that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but vsurped authority might be restored: But as he is
a publique person, and represents the body of the State, the
case is no way different, which is the freeing of it from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
and vniust vsurpation: And for Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> I will
be bold to say it, that at her comming to the Crowne, she was
not so farre ingaged for the defence of that religion, which she
constantly maintained to her dying day, as his <hi>Maiesty</hi> hath by
manifold obligations bound himselfe to the maintenance and
continuance of that which she at her death left, and hee at his
entrance found established amongst vs. For testimonies wee
neede goe no farther then his frequent and solemne protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
aswell by his penne, as by word of mouth, and that not
onely before, but since his comming to the Crowne; to which
if we adde the carefull education of his Sonne, the most noble
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3770:117"/>
and hopefull Prince, euen in that respect, the bestowing of his
onely <hi>daughter</hi> that most sweet and vertuous Lady vpon the
<hi>Prince Palatine,</hi> not onely a Protestant, but as you terme them,
a <hi>Caluinist,</hi> the honourable entertainement of <hi>Isaac Casaubon,</hi>
and <hi>Peter Moulin,</hi> the liberty giuen to the <hi>French</hi> &amp; <hi>Dutch,</hi> for
the free and publike exercise of their religion in diuers parts of
his <hi>Maiesties</hi> Dominions; and lastly his constant refusall of so
much as the <hi>Toleration</hi> of any other religion, notwithstanding
the importunitie of suits and supplications for it; the matter as
I suppose will be cleane out of doubt. And as <hi>Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
was prouoked by <hi>Pius</hi> V. so was his <hi>Maiesty</hi> by <hi>Paulus</hi> V.
in a degree very little different; the one absoluing her subiects
from their oath of Allegeance, and the other forbidding his
to take such an oath: So that though the <hi>Parenthesis in regard
of personall succession bee ended,</hi> yet in respect of profession
(which of the two is the more to bee regarded) <hi>the sentence as
yet runnes on,</hi> and as we hope will haue no <hi>period,</hi> but with the
worlds end. But the more to exasperate his <hi>Maiesty</hi> against
King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. and his daughter Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> you
tell him that <hi>if the Schisme could haue preuented his title, neither
his Mother, nor himselfe should euer haue made Queene</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
<hi>afraid with their right to the Crowne of England.</hi> For the
iustnesse of the diuorce I haue already deliuered mine opinion
at large; and yet if any desire farther satisfaction, let him reade
the first dialogue of <hi>Antisanderus,</hi> who both strongly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
the equity of the Kings proceedings in that businesse,
and clearely confutes the slanders of that base fugitiue; and
for <hi>his wiues,</hi> had the way bene fairely made vnto them, no iust
exception could be taken to the number. <hi>Philip</hi> the II. of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> besides his <hi>Mistresses,</hi> had successiuely<note n="3" place="margin">From <hi>England.</hi> From <hi>Portugale.</hi> From <hi>France.</hi> From <hi>Austria.</hi>
                     </note> foure <hi>wiues,</hi>
whereof the first was <hi>his fathers Cousin germane,</hi> and the last his
<hi>owne:</hi> For the compassing of which, what strange courses he
tooke, I list not to relate, but referre the reader to the Prince
of <hi>Aurange</hi> his Apologie; yet none that I know hath taxed
him for his multitude of <hi>wiues,</hi> in as much as he liued and died
a <hi>Romane</hi> Catholike. Did not <hi>Henry</hi> the last of <hi>France</hi> diuorce
his first wife, after they had bene almost as long married, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3770:118"/>
vpon lesse shew of iust reason, then <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. but the
one made semblance at last of subiecting himselfe to the See
Apostolike, which the other by no meanes could bee brought
vnto, as he did at first, this alone beeing it that varied the case,
and that which he did herein, may well be interpreted to haue
sprong from a desire of setling the Crowne in his owne poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
rather then of <hi>preiudicing the title of Scotland;</hi> For though
during his reigne, some discontentments there were between
the two nations, yet not long before his death hee concluded
a match betwixt his sonne <hi>Prince Edward,</hi> and <hi>Queene Mary of
Scotland,</hi> that as his father had vnited the white and the redde
<hi>Roses</hi> in the royall branches of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> so his sonne
might vnite the <hi>Lions passant and rampant,</hi> in the armes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> but it so pleased God, that that match vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion fell asunder, and that happy vnion was reserued to
our times.</p>
                  <p>Now for <hi>Queene Elizabeths feare,</hi> those of her Sexe indeed

of diuine prouidence, as some wise men haue obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
most clearely shine, in as much as those things which
both <hi>Q. Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; <hi>Q. Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> chiefly
desired, and shot at in all their consultations, were by this
meanes effected: The latter (as at her death she witnessed) wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
nothing more earnestly, then that the two diuided
Realmes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> might bee vnited in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of her dearest sonne: The former, that true Religion, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the safetie and securitie of the Kingdome might bee
preserued entire; and that God was pleased to grant both their
wishes, to our comfort, wee feele, and can not but most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
acknowledge: And for <hi>his Maiestie;</hi> he both signified to
<hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> by Sir <hi>Francis Walsinghame,</hi> in the yeere
1583. (almost foure yeeres before his mothers death,) that he
would most constantly maintaine the same Religion which
was then publikely receiued, and againe, sent her the same
message by Sir <hi>Robert Sidney</hi> about two yeeres after; So that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3770:119"/>
she needed not to feare his right in that regarde, and for his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
otherwise, hee both testified it before her death in the
Preface to his <hi>Basilicon Doron,</hi> where he thus speakes, <hi>[In Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
reignes a lawfull Queene, who hath so long, with so great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and felicitie gouerned her kingdomes, as I must in true since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
confesse, that the like hath not beene read or heard of, either in
our time, or since the dayes of the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperour</hi> Augustus.]
And since her death, hee hath yeelded the like testimonies of
her, aswell in his <hi>Apologie,</hi> as also in his <hi>Premonition,</hi> where he
remembers, that being chosen to be his Godmother, shee sent
into <hi>Scotland</hi> the Font wherein he was baptized: So that (if by
outward actions and speeches, we may make coniecture of the
inward thoughts and Passions of the minde) shee was so farre
from <hi>fearing his Maiesties right to the Crowne,</hi> as she endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
rather by all conuenient meanes to aduance it: neither
doe I find it recorded by her friends, or obiected by her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that, during all her reigne vpon any occasion, shee euer
conceiued a thought, or cast out a word toward the setting vp
of any other Successour, or <hi>the preiudicing of his right;</hi> Nay in
the yeere 1587. she sent the Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> gouernour of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wike</hi>
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to giue him notice that the <hi>Iesuiticall faction</hi>
euen while his mother liued, proiected, how they both might
be put by their right, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> brought in: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
was presented him an instrument, subscribed by the Iudges
of <hi>England,</hi> assuring him that the sentence passed vpon his
mother, could no way bee preiudiciall in law to the right of
his title.</p>
                  <p>But it will be sayd shee discouered <hi>her feare</hi> in stopping any
declaration of the heire apparent, specially being vrged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by the three estates assembled in <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the yeere,
1566. whereas in trueth she in reading might haue obserued,
that few or no Successors in collaterall line had beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ten
prooued dangerous to name a successour, not only to the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessours,
but sometimes to the Successours themselues: as it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3770:120"/>
did to <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> designed heire to the
Crowne by <hi>Richard the second,</hi> his sonne <hi>Edmund</hi> being helde
in prison, and there pining away vpon none other reason. The
like befell <hi>Iohn de la Poole,</hi> designed by <hi>Richard</hi> the third (after
the death of his owne sonne) to bee his Successour, himselfe
being alwayes euen in that respect suspected of <hi>Henry</hi> the VII.
till at last he was slaine, and his brother vnder <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII.
beheaded. These reasons might mooue her <hi>Maiestie</hi> for the
stopping of that declaration, <hi>not the feare of his Maiesties right,</hi>
but the care of preseruing it, being sufficiently proclaimed in
his blood and discent. Whatsoeuer it were, since <hi>his Maiestie</hi>
who had the neerest interest in that errand, hath bene content
thus graciously to passe it ouer, it cannot but argue want both
of wisdome and charitie in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor, thus vnseasonably, and
maliciously to reuiue it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, God of purpose no doubt raised vp <hi>his Maiestie,</hi> to
crosse the worldly and diuelish pretence of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate
the life of that Religion which you call <hi>Schisme,</hi> and I
make no doubt but if King <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. had found it left by
his predecessor in the state, that <hi>his Maiestie</hi> did, hee would in
his wisedome haue left it to his Successor, as hee is like to doe,
and I am the rather induced to thinke so; because in the first
yeere of his raigne, the <hi>Pope</hi> hauing excommunicated all such
persons as had bought allome of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> by his permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
if not command, it was resolued by all the Iudges of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that the <hi>Popes</hi> Excommunication ought not to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or to bee put in Execution within the Realme of <hi>England:</hi>
and in the same yeere hee suffered sharpe lawes to be made by
the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to which himselfe gaue, being by his Royall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
for the reformation of his Clergie, then growen very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute:
and in the <hi>eleuenth</hi> yere of his raigne, a Statute was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
that [though by the Ecclesiasticall Lawes allowed
within this Realme, a Priest cannot haue two Benefices, nor a

cannot be denied, but some of his <hi>Maiesties</hi> ancestours, partly
through the insensible incrochment of some ambitious <hi>Popes,</hi>
and partly through the neglect of some weake kings, did part
indeed with some of their authority, to bestow it vpon that
Church, to which you intitle Christ: yet that they reserued to
themselues a power euen in Ecclesiasticall causes, I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
made sufficiently to appeare in mine answere to the 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

the same was also maintained by a publike law. By these

of any thing due vnto him, or to assume vnto my selfe any

<hi>Popes</hi> owne priuiledges, formerly granted.</p>
                  <p>To like purpose is that which I finde in a Manuscript of
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hales,</hi> a man renowned in his time, aswell for his learning
as his honestie; his words are these, speaking of the cunning
fetches of the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the enriching of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
and their Clergie, to the impouerishing of the King
and the State.</p>
                  <p>First (saith hee) they exempted the Clergy, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
the Secular as the regular, from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> whereby
they neither would obey the Prince, but
when and wherin it pleased them, nor albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
they had the greater part of the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and profits of the Realme, they would
be contributory to the charges of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
thereof, but when it listed them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they reserued to themselues the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
generally &amp; specially of all Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks,
Bishopricks, Abbies, Priories, &amp;
all other dignities and benefices in <hi>England,</hi>
which many times they gaue to aliants, that
neuer dwelt in <hi>England,</hi> nor euer came into
<hi>England.</hi> So the reuenues thereof were not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3770:126"/>
spent in the Realme, but caried out of the
same, &amp; when they gaue them to any of the
Realme, they made them pay exceeding
summes of money for Palls, Annats, First
fruits, Tenths, and such like, whereby the
Realme from time to time was very much
impouerished.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they vsed to dispence, not onely with
their owne Lawes and Canons, but also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times with Gods word in matters of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
and otherwise, whereby they suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
no litle treasure out of the Realme.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in causes testamentary, in causes of
Matrimony, and diuorces, right of tithes,
oblations, and obuentions, they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
that men might appeale from any
Court within this Realme to the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> whereby the people of this nation
was very much troubled, by reason it was so
farre distant from this Realme, and when
they came thither, they could not in long
time haue redresse, but with long delayes
were constrained to spend whatsoeuer they
had.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, with dispensations for eating flesh, and
white meates, for pardons and redemption
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3770:127"/>
of soules out of Purgatory, for dispensations
with vowes, and such like beggery, they
scraped together infinite summes of money:
and because no fish should escape for lacke
of bait, they had their Dataries and Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
continually gaping for the prey, resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
here in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, the Clergie of this Realme being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by the authority of the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> the Arch-bishops, Bishops, and such
as had Spirituall Iurisdiction within this
Realme, not onely vnreasonably troubled,
and vexed the people of this realme in their
Courts, but also exceedingly pilled, polled
and robbed them vnder colour of Fees and
duties. The Parsons and Vicars were not
content with the moderate Mortuaries and
Corse-presents, but also daily increased the
same, and would haue what it pleased them,
without any consideration of the misery
and pouerty of the widow and children li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
yea, and many times where the dead
had but a bare vse, and no property in the
goods and chattels, they were found in his
possession, and in many places they would
neither baptize nor marry, nor bury, but
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3770:127"/>
they would haue some extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
&amp; the common sort of Priests would
not depart with any their Masses or praiers,
vnlesse they were sure to haue money.</p>
                  <p>Of these and the like most vnsufferable vexations, <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risbury</hi>
in his 6. booke, and 24. chapter <hi>De nugis Curalium,</hi>

their hands who vpon al occasions at the <hi>Popes</hi> command were
ready to vse it as a weapon against himselfe, and in defence of
their holy Father, and conferd it vpon those who therewith
were to serue both himselfe and the State in peace at home,
and in wars abroad. As the Church prayes for the ciuill state;
so is it to shield the Church: and better it were the Church
should quit a part of her maintenance, then that the whole
should lie obnoxious to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>acrilegious hands of forreine v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation:
If in performance hereof, that which should haue
bene ordained to publike, or sacred, was by some ill disposed
persons, or the king himselfe, turned to priuate and prophane
vses; or if that which inseperably belongs to the maintenance
of Ecclesiasticall persons, were put into the possession of those
who serued not at the altar, this manner of proceeding might
so staine and vitiate the whole action, as it might carry a secret
curse with it vpon the authours and actours of it. No doubt
but a good cause, and in it selfe most iust both may bee and oft
is marred in the handling: and being handled neuer so well, yet
in the issue it may miscarry, Gods iudgements being alwayes
in themselues most iust, but many times their causes hidden
from vs. I vndertake not the defence of <hi>Henry,</hi> or any other
Prince or person in robbing the Church, but to his vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
euents, we may oppose the happy successe of Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
his daughter, and successour both in gouernment and
in opposition to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> She maintained long
and chargeable wars, in diuers kingdomes abroad, against <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak</hi>
and <hi>Balaam, Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> to the infinite expense of her
treasure, and yet at her death she left more in her coffers then
her <hi>Romish</hi> Catholike sister, and immediate predecessour, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
her peace abroad, her mariage with the Lord of

also what a cloud of witnesses there is, both of ancients, and
euen of late <hi>Popish</hi> Writers, yea diuers Cardinals, that doe
all agree, that both these speeches vsed to <hi>Peter</hi> were meant
to all the Apostles represented in his person, otherwise how
could Paul direct the Church of Corinth to excommunicate
the Incestuous person <hi>Cum Spiritu suo,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 4.</note> whereas he should
then haue sayed <hi>Cum Spiritu Petri?</hi> and how could all
the Apostles haue otherwise vsed all their censures only in
Christs Name, and neuer a word of his Vicars? <hi>Peter</hi> we
read did in all the Apostles meetings sit among them as one
of their number,<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 15.</note> and when chosen men were sent to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochia</hi>
from that Apostolike Councell at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the

the whole Church to send chosen men, but no mention made
of the head thereof; and so in their Letters no mention is
made of <hi>Peter,</hi> but onely of the Apostles, Elders, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
And it is a wonder why <hi>Paul</hi> rebuketh the Church
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> for making exception of persons,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 11.</note> because
some followed <hi>Paul,</hi> some <hi>Apollos,</hi> some <hi>Cephas;</hi> if <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

But how they are now come to bee Christs Vicars, Gods on

                  <p>This Councell was called about 327. yeeres after <hi>Christ,</hi>

                  <p>The second generall Councell was helde at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
against <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who denyed the Diuinitie of the holy

thereof: all which acts flowing from the prerogatiue of his

any way to belong to Emperours, or Christian Princes:
besides this, the Councell it selfe layed a foundation for that

the sixt Councill of <hi>Carthage</hi> (in which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> was a
member) to the vniust claime of three succeeding <hi>Popes, Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimus,
Boniface</hi> and <hi>Celestine,</hi> in the high businesse of Appeales;
hee might in good discretion haue forborne to presse his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie</hi>
to <hi>the triall of the most ancient Fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now touching <hi>the question of Antichrist,</hi> it is not discussed
by his <hi>Maiestie</hi> as an <hi>hypotheticall proposition,</hi> but as his opinion,
his <hi>Maiesties</hi> words are these, <hi>[As for the definition of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
I will not vrge so obscure a point as a matter of faith to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
beleeued of all Christians, but what I thinke herein I will
simply declare.] Cardinall Peron</hi> indeed makes the proposition
of deposing Kings, to bee problematicall, and yet withall a
part of the Catholike faith; but his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> though he make
his opinion of <hi>Antichrist</hi> no part of his faith, yet beeing his
opinion, in regard of his apprehension, you cannot make it
<hi>hypotheticall,</hi> which hee also declared to bee his iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his comming to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> by his <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
on certaine verses of the</hi> 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Chapter of the Reuelation of
S. Iohn,</hi> neither is his <hi>Maiestie</hi> the onely King that hath been
of that opinion. You may remember not long since one of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3770:134"/>
the <hi>French,</hi> who stamped on his coyne, <hi>Perdam Babylonem;</hi>
vntill then, his <hi>Maiesties</hi> substantiall and weighty reasons tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that point, bee disprooued, I see no reason hee hath to
<hi>recall what hee hath written;</hi> in the meane time his <hi>Maiestie</hi>
may more iustly take vp that, then the Author of it, [<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn 19. 22.</note> what
I haue written, I haue written] lest hee should incurre the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of [<note n="*" place="margin">Ecclus. 27. 11.</note> changing as the Moone.]</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for <hi>the example of Henry the</hi> VIII. it is both false
and impertinent, false, in that you say he <hi>contradicted his booke,</hi>
whereas his booke (as I haue already shewed) is onely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the seuen Sacraments, which he held to his dying day:
impertinent, in that you take it as granted that his <hi>Maiesty</hi> by
recalling himselfe should <hi>alter from lesse good to much better,</hi>
which is the thing alwayes by vs denied, but neuer was or euer
can be proued by you. Indeed we find that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> made
his <hi>Retractations</hi> from naught or lesse good to better, and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
in his <hi>Recognitions</hi> from bad to worse, and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Carier</hi> to
haue fallen from a formall Protestant, to a professed Papist: and
as our Sauiour speakes to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> thou being conuerted,
strengthen thy brethren; So hee contrariwise being himselfe
peruerted, labours to weaken his <hi>Maiesties</hi> faith, but it is
grounded on that Rocke, against which the gates of hell with
their power, much lesse the instruments of <hi>Rome</hi> with their
foisting and cogging shall neuer be able to preuaile.</p>

therefore bee of good courage, knowing

The other after due triall, seuerity of punishment vpon those that

This was the height of <hi>his anger,</hi> any more then this he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not, and lesse then this well he could not. But, <hi>before this</hi>
(you say in the entrance of this Section, stil harping vpon your

<hi>Scotland</hi> was extraordinarily wrought by God: And <hi>before
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3770:141"/>
the Powder treason,</hi> he makes him so farre from <hi>indifferencie,</hi> as
he faines the seuerity of his lawes against Romane Catholikes,
to haue giuen occasion to that foule conspiracy, and to the
conspirators (being then without all hope) of entring into so
desperate a course. And sure it seemes the <hi>Powder-traytours</hi>
themselues held him not <hi>indifferent;</hi> for they discouered grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
anger towards him in the proiecting of that bloody trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
then he toward them or their associates, after the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
of it, which notwithstanding it seemes by <hi>Watsons</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
(not long before his execution) the Iesuites were hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before his (vndertaken for religion too) was detected; not
full three moneths after his <hi>Maiesties</hi> right to the Crowne
before it was setled, or so much as set on his head: nay <hi>Garnet</hi>
himselfe, their Arch-Priest being sollicited, not long before
the <hi>Queenes</hi> death, by a gentleman of a noble family (but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly
affected) that when time serued hee would set forward
the kings title among Catholikes, returned this answere [that
he had nothing to doe with the kings right, or the promoting
it, in as much, as he was so hardened in a religion contrary to
his, that now there was no hope of his conuersion left.]</p>
                  <p>Thus we see that neither <hi>the Powder-traitours themselues,</hi> nor
<hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clerke</hi> Priests, nor the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> nor the <hi>Arch-Priest,</hi>
nor the <hi>Cardinall held him indifferent before the Powder-treason,</hi>
yet M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor is of a contrary opinion to them all, perswaded
(it may be) by his <hi>Maiesties</hi> Letters, pretended to be addressed
before his entrance into this kingdome, in the yeere 1598. to
Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII, <hi>Cardinall Aldobrandin,</hi> and <hi>Cardinall

then the Secretary of State, shufled in those letters among
others, when his <hi>Maiesty</hi> was ready to take horse, and so by
cunning got them to be subscribed; and partly vpon the <hi>Popes</hi>
proceedings after the receit of them, which was the shewing
of them to such as came thither of the Scottish nation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
whether they thought the subscription to bee his
<hi>Maiesties</hi> owne hand, &amp; suffering some to take copies of them;
besides he neither answered the Letters, nor granted the suite
contained in them, and some yeeres after writing to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty</hi>
by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iames Lindsey,</hi> he neither mentioned those letters,

all this, sent his two <hi>Breues</hi> to the <hi>Romane</hi> Catholikes here in
<hi>England,</hi> for the excluding of him from the Crowne. And thus
haue we now not onely the traitours, the secular Priests, the

making against this vaine supposition of his <hi>Maiesties indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie</hi>

                  <p>To conclude this Section then, and therewithall my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to such pretended motiues, as might incline his <hi>Maiestie</hi>

seperation with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Henry</hi> had to
make it, and <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> to maintaine it, and that it
doth increase his lawfull authoritie, both ouer more persons,
and in more causes, if it may serue for the better inriching of
his coffers, an vnion with that Church, can not but bring
both his honour and wisedome into question, being so farre

prouoked without iust occasion giuen, or any satisfaction hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
made; and hauing so deepely ingaged himselfe in the

which otherwise he might expect, and hitherto hath felt from

to maintaine the doctrine of diuision, but I thinke there are very

                     </p>
                     <p>1 The state of the Crowne of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
cannot be well susteined to gouerne and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3770:145"/>
rule with honour, if such possessions be taken
from it: for at this day the greatest part of the
possessions of the Crowne consisteth of such
lands and possessions.</p>
                     <p>2 Very many men haue with their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes
bought and purchased great portions of
those lands from the most Excellent Kings,
<hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. and <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. who by
their Letters Patents haue warranted the same,
of which landes and possessions, if the owners
should now be dispossessed, the King should
be bound to repay vnto them all their money,
which would arise to such a huge masse, that it
would be a hard matter for the Crowne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
it.</p>
                     <p>3 The Nobles and Gentry of this realme,
most of whom haue sold and aliened their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
inheritances, to buy these new, cannot
liue according to their degrees, if these posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
should be taken from them.</p>
                     <p>4 The purchasers or owners of such lands
and possessions, in as much as they came to
them by iust title, according to the ordinance
of the Kings of this kingdome, haue held and
doe still hold a good and iustifyable course in
obteining them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:3770:146"/>5 The enioying of such landes and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
is so common vnto euery State and
condition of men, Cities, Colledges, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporations,
that if the same bee taken from
them, there will necessarily follow thereupon
throughout the whole Kingdome a suddaine
change and confusion of all Orders and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                     <p>6 Seeing that the goods and possessions of
the Church, euen by the authority of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
may bee aliened for the redemption of
captiues, and that the same may bee done by
that Church onely, to whom such possessions
doe belong: It is fit and reasonable that such
dispensations should bee granted for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of possession already gotten, for so great a
good of publike concord and vnity of the
Church, and preseruation of this State, as well
in body as in soule.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Those possessions indeed in many places (I speake special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Tenths</hi>) which by reason of Popish dispensations were

that <hi>the most part of them who now enioy them, haue payed well for
them;</hi> in asmuch as the first owners were enforced, or their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie
within a generation or two, to sell that which others
purchased. Now this curse of God I can impute to none other
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3770:146"/>
thing then to the alienation of <hi>Tenths</hi> from their proper vse, to
which they were, and still should be ordained, or at leastwise
the bare and scant allowance which is made to the Minister of
the greatest part of the fattest <hi>Impropriations;</hi> so that commonly
no Parishes are worse prouided for, then those that pay most,
the redresse wherof, if it should please God to put into his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties</hi>
heart, and the assembly of the Estates in parliament, it
would bee a worke no doubt honourable in it selfe, acceptable
to CHRIST, and beneficiall to his Church, for which he would
the rather blesse their other proceedings: I speake not for the
restoring of <hi>Impropriations,</hi> (though that were rather to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
then hoped, their value being little or nothing inferiour
to the Benefices) but the making of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent allowance out
of them, for the maintenance of a preaching Minister, and I am
sory to heare that some of them should be so backward in the
former, who most vrge the later, the rather for that I would not
haue it thought our Religion cannot stand, but by the spoyle
of the Church liuings, though the <hi>Pope</hi> (as it seemes by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
Doctor) cares not who loseth so that himselfe may winne.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>vertue of the Sacraments</hi> expressed in holy Scripture
wee <hi>preach not against,</hi> but as for <hi>merit of workes,</hi> and <hi>inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

reigne to this present time, then in the space of any three score
yeeres successiuely taken since the Conquest, which I speake
not to boast of the fruits of our Religion, but to giue God the
honour; and as for <hi>the Hugonotes of France</hi> (as you are pleased
to terme them) if they bee guilty of <hi>pulling downe Churches,</hi>
wee neither incourage them to it, nor defend them in it, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>Lastly, because you addresse your discourse in particular
to <hi>the Nobles</hi> in this Section, I craue leaue to put them in mind
of a peece of a letter written by their predecessors to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

                     </gap>e of <hi>Henrie</hi> the III. I will recite
it in the words of <hi>Matthew Parris</hi> translated. <hi>[The great ones</hi>
(sayth hee) <hi>by writing to the Pope, complained of the scandals
bred out of the rapine and auarice of</hi> Rome, <hi>and spread not onely in</hi>
England, <hi>but through the Christian world, that themselues would
not endure that their countrey from thencefoorth should bee so rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled, no though the King himselfe should winke at it, and
vnlesse</hi> (say they) <hi>these matters bee speedily redressed by you, let
your Holinesse know for certaine, that it may not vniustly bee feared
that such a danger is likely thereby to ensue, both to the Church of</hi>
Rome, <hi>and to our Lord the King, that no remedie will easily bee
found for it.]</hi> My hope then is, that our <hi>Nobles</hi> being now far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enlightned by the beames of the Gospell, and the cleare
discouery of the trueth in the writings of learned men, then
their predecessours, who liued in those times of darkenesse,
will, like the <hi>Noble Theophilus,</hi> (to whom <hi>S. Luke</hi> dedicates <hi>his

maintenance to the Commons</hi> can be of no force, till the owners
of those reuenues be either forced by lawe, or perswaded by

argument, if it make <hi>for the poore Gentleman and Yeoman,</hi> it

that whiles the monasteries stood, they were not so much
eased by them of the burden of their children, as burthened
with the keeping of Concubines for the Monkes and Abbots

were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ased of one child by the Monastery, they were oftener
burdened with two or three from the Monasterie, and for their
daughters, as by vailing them, and thrusting them into a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery,
they disburdened their hands of them, so by the same
meanes were they often burdened to the shame and griefe of
their Parents, and dishonour of their profession; and yet such
bribes and pensions were there payed for their admission, as
many times they might haue maintained them at home with
lesse charge and more honesty, or if their daughters escaped
free, their sonnes (which was worse) supplied their sisters

                  <p>Now for the Common wealth, as their <hi>exoneration</hi> might
bring some benefit vnto it, so their exemption from the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
courts of iustice, from the iurisdiction of Bishops, and from
all maner of publique seruice in defence of the State, aswell in
regard of their goods as their persons, could not be but excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
preiudiciall: for by that meanes it must needes in time
haue come to passe, that the richest and fattest, nay greatest

ready.</p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>Farmer and Husband man remember,</hi> that, as <hi>better
penny-worthes</hi> were to bee had in those dayes, so his vexations
by Excommunications, Interdictions, and Appeales to <hi>Rome</hi>
were more insufferable, his restraints from labour, whereby he
maintained himselfe and his poore familie by meanes of many
blind holy dayes, now stricken out of the Calender, more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;
and lastly his payments greater for Peterpence, for Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilees,
for oblations, for dispensations, for obits, for touching
of reliques, for <hi>Agnus-deis,</hi> for hallowing of beads and graines,
for holy water, for masses, for trentals, for dirges, for pardons,
for indulgences, for crusadoes, and a thousand such petty char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
seruing onely as fewell, aswell to maintaine the luxury of
Monkes and Friars, as to keepe in the fire of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which
if it were not by the people conceiued to bee very hote, that in
the Popes and Monkes kitchin would quickly bee very colde:
But to come neere to the point, as <hi>better penny-worthes,</hi> so in
those times lesse money was also to bee had, all things being
cheaper where is lesse money, and dearer where is more, so that
if the same Monasteries had stood and the same Abbots had
liued in our dayes, I doubt not but they would haue raised
there rents, as our Collegiate Societies haue beene inforced to
doe, or else they must haue pared away somewhat of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie
of their dishes, which would haue troubled their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
more; as well appeared by them who made a lamentable
complaint to the King for want of meate, when three dishes of
thirteene were withdrawen, and of him who hauing his bellie
full stuffed with eating after a great feast, cried out [<hi>Quanta
patimur pro amore</hi> CHRISTI] And sure it is to me a wonder that
those who both can and often will tell the most merrie iests

who by their owne report, to excuse their acquaintance in
matters criminall, haue wilfully periured themselues in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
onely presuming of this present and easie remedie in
Confession; and others of more ordinary note amongst them,
when the time of confessing was at hand, would then venture
vpon those actions which before they trembled at, as presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to surfet and surcharge their stomacks by reason of the
neighbourhood of the phisitian, which phisitian also himselfe
is perhaps more apparently infected with the noysome disease
his patient discloseth, then the patient, who is not any way
bettered by the counsell which the Phisitian giueth: but this
must be granted to bee the fault of the people, yet a generall
fault it is, and current without controllement, howbeit the
Priests are no more excusable on their parts, then the people,
telling the penitent that God is mercifull, and whatsoeuer
sinnes he committeth, so long as hee doth penance, and is no
Lutherane, there is good remedy for him, and for their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
it consisteth ordinarily but in <hi>Aue Maries</hi> and <hi>Pater
nosters,</hi> with Almes deedes, by those that are able, and fastings
by them that are willing; yea, I haue knowen when the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for horrible and open blasphemy, besides much other
lewdnesse, hath bene none other then saying of their Beades
thrice ouer, a matter of some houres muttering, and which in
<hi>Italy</hi> they dispatch also as they goe in the streets, or ride on the

the <hi>Popes plenary pardons</hi> sweepe all away at a blow.</p>
                  <p>Now whether <hi>seruants</hi> be not with them vnfaithfull to their

is impossible to vse the thing it selfe, <hi>wee hold it being rightly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
a lawfull, yet an humane constitution, as neither in

that will not forbeare in conscience and common honesty to

for feare of punishment; and sure I am of opinion, better no</hi>

[<note n="7" place="margin">Cap. 17.</note> The realme of <hi>England</hi> was first inhabited by the <hi>Britanes;</hi> next
after them the <hi>Romanes</hi> had the rule of the land; and then againe
the <hi>Britanes</hi> possessed it; after whom the <hi>Saxons</hi> inuaded it, and
changing the name thereof, did for <hi>Britaine</hi> call it <hi>England;</hi> after
them for a certaine time the <hi>Danes</hi> had the dominion of the realme,
and then the <hi>Saxons</hi> againe; but last of all the <hi>Normans</hi> subdued
it, whose descent continueth in the gouernment of the Kingdome at
this present; and in all the times of these seueral Nations and of their
Kings, this realme was still ruled with the selfe same customes that
now it is, which if they had not bene right good, some of those Kings,
mooued either with pride, or with reason, or affection, would haue
changed them, or altogether abolished them, and specially the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
who did iudge all the rest of the world by their owne Lawes;
likewise would other of the foresayed Kings haue done, who by the
sword only possessing the realme of <hi>England,</hi> might with the same
power haue extinguished the Lawes thereof; and touching the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie
of thesame, neither are the <hi>Romane</hi> ciuil Lawes, by so long
continuance of ancient times confirmed, nor yet the Lawes of the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> which aboue all other are reported to be of most antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
for as much as there Iland in the beginning of the <hi>Britanes</hi> was
not then inhabited, as <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe was then also vnbuilded; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are the Lawes of any which worshipped God so ancient; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the contrary is not to bee sayd nor thought, but that the <hi>English</hi>
Customes are very good, yea of all other the very best] <hi>neither can
I conceiue any other reason M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor hath, thus bitterly to
enuie against our Lawes, as if they came from</hi> the Court infidel,
<hi>and were a burthen to the Common wealth, but because some

Common Law so fauourable and aduantageous in extending
the Prerogatiue of the King, as his</hi> Maiestie <hi>professeth,</hi> [For
a King of <hi>England</hi> to despise the Common lawe, is to neglect his

                     <hi>Caluins</hi> somewhat more then you make it,
in as much as thereby the fauour of God is not onely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
but sealed vnto the heart; whereas your <hi>faith</hi> is of
that nature, as it neither hath any sound foundation to build
vpon, neither is a man certaine when he hath it; neither if hee
haue it, how long hee shall keepe it; neither if hee keepe it,
whether at last it will serue for his iustification in the sight of

which <hi>Caluin</hi> defines.</p>
                  <p>The fourth point which you call <hi>Caluinisme</hi> is, that [<hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments

faith]</hi> whereas<note n="8" place="margin">See the 4. booke 14. chap. of his Institut.</note> 
                     <hi>Caluin</hi> in many places, and expresse tearmes,

they beeing in his <hi>doctrine,</hi> not onely <hi>signes</hi> to represent that
which they are ordained to signifie, but seales to confirme
that which they represent, and withall, pipes to conuey, or

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:3770:164"/>
which they represent to the sence: much lesse then doe
either hee or wee make <hi>the Sacraments signes onely of that grace
which the receiuer hath by couenant of his parents faith,</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

are, or died Infidels, though themselues bee conuerted to

which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, it argues

                  <p>The fift point which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor calls <hi>Caluinisme</hi> is, that
<hi>[Priesthood can doe nothing but preach the word,</hi> (as they call it)
<hi>which Lay-men must iudge of, and may preach too, if they will, where
occasion serues]</hi> as if hee were ignorant, that both by <hi>Caluin,</hi>
and by vs, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>blike prayer, in the name, and for the good of the
people, is specially committed to the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and to it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is the power of binding and loosing, and of administring

not onely to Lay-men, but to women, in some cases:

                  <p>The sixth and last point which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor calls <hi>Caluinisme</hi>

diuine rather, what that meanes, hee shall bee as farre to seeke
of his <hi>securitie</hi> as euer: Hee hath alreadie declared by his
<hi>Breues,</hi> that the taking of the <hi>Oath of Allegeance,</hi> cannot stand
with the safety of Catholike Religion, so that if hee will <hi>secure
his Maiestie,</hi> hee must not only condemne those Authors, and
damne that Doctrine, which teaches his power in deposing
Kings, and disposing of Kingdomes, but hee must either recall
that declaration, made as hee pretendeth, vpon long and
weightie deliberation, (which it may bee to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:3770:168"/>
Maiestie,</hi> except hee may bee said to <hi>secure,</hi> who cuts off all
meanes of <hi>his securitie,</hi> an oath being among all <hi>Christians,</hi>
and <hi>Heathens,</hi> if they bee but morally honest (as the Apostle
speakes) <hi>an end of all strife.</hi> It is the last resolution in the search
of truth, and in the body politique, the strongest sinew, next
the bound of nature and conscience, wherby the members are
tyed to the head, and the head againe to the members, and the
members knit among themselues: for the <hi>Pope</hi> then <hi>to promise
his Maiesty security,</hi> and yet by this meanes to withdraw the
hearts of his Subiects from their naturall allegeance, is, as if a
man should promise <hi>secure passage</hi> ouer a Riuer, and yet pull
downe the bridge, or take away the boats which serue for that
passage. His <hi>Maiestie</hi> on the other side, hath declared the <hi>Pope</hi>
to be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> in his opinion, and can hee expect <hi>honour or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie</hi>
from <hi>Antichrist,</hi> who hath hitherto depended on none
but CHRIST? he may also be pleased to remember what <hi>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi>
the two last <hi>Henries</hi> of <hi>France</hi> receiued from him: Lastly
if the <hi>Powder-treason</hi> were vndertaken without the <hi>Popes</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie,
how can hee <hi>secure</hi> his <hi>Maiestie</hi> from the like? except hee
can diue into the secrets of mens harts, or haue the art to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
things to come, or to charme the deuils in hell: God defend
vs from such <hi>securitie,</hi> which hath the face of a man, but the
teeth of a Lyon, which first lulles vs asleepe, and then driues a
naile into our heads.</p>
                  <p>My conclusion of this point shall bee, that common
speech of the <hi>Italians</hi> themselues, <hi>[Acibo bis cocto, a medico

It ought not so to haue beene called, in as much as it
is not truely the bodie of CHRIST, which shall not euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly
bee with him] nay, not onely <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi>
deceiue vs, but <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the fourth to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> the
fifteenth and sixteenth verses: and againe in the fift Chapter
of the same Epistle, the 25. and 26. verses: but for the better
clearing of this point, wee must conceiue, that the Elect, or
<hi>Predestinate</hi> of God, are of two sorts, some elect onely, and
not yet called, some both elect and called: of the latter
there is no question, but they are the principall parts of the
Church of God; and touching the former, they are not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the Church, but onely potentially in Gods <hi>prescience</hi>
and <hi>predestination,</hi> who hath purposed that they shall bee,
and knoweth that they will bee: when wee say then, that
none but the Elect of God are of the Church of God, wee
meane not, that others are not at all, nor in any sort of the
Church, but that they are not fully and finally of the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
number of them, who pertake of the most perfect worke,
force, and vertue of that sauing grace, whereof that Church is
the onely dispenser.</p>
                  <p>Neither can this Church serue a <hi>Turkes turne aswell as a
Christians,</hi> for <hi>whom he did predestinate, them also hee called;
and whom hee called, them also hee iustified; and whom hee iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
them also hee glorified;</hi> since then hee neither calls, nor
iustifies <hi>Turkes,</hi> wee are sure they cannot be of the company
of the predestinate: But his <hi>Maiestie</hi> himselfe (I now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
well concluded this point, at the conference at <hi>Hampton
Court,</hi> and therefore wee neede not feare his being deceiued
in iudgement; his determination is, that <hi>[wee should iudge of
our Predestination, not so much</hi> descendendo, <hi>by prying into Gods
secret counsell, as</hi> ascendendo <hi>by searching our owne hearts; the
sincerity of our owne hearts, being as it were, the counterpane of Gods
eternall decree, locked vp in the Cabinet of his counsell;]</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle in <hi>the 2. to Tim. and the 2.</hi> ioynes them both
together: <hi>The foundation of God</hi> (saith hee) <hi>remaineth sure, and
hath this seale, The Lord knoweth who are his:</hi> there is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3770:170"/>
sealed on Gods part; the Counterpane on ours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
followes: and <hi>[let euery one that calleth on the Name of</hi>
CHRIST, <hi>depart from iniquitie.]</hi> So that the way to assure our
selues that wee are in the number of those that are sealed to
life, is to call on the name of CHRIST, in our profession, and
depart from iniquitie, in our conuersation; the one is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in our life, and the other in our beliefe.</p>
                  <p>Neither is <hi>the faith of such beleeuers, an opinion, or fancie,</hi>
but the ground of things which are hoped for, and the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of things which are not seene, and a shield to quench
all such fiery and venemous dartes; nor is <hi>their hope, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption;</hi>
but a sure anchor against despaire, nor <hi>their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
lust;</hi> but the loue of their neighbours, as of themselues;
nor their <hi>God, an idole;</hi> but that Lord, who hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himselfe vnto vs in his word; whereas on the other side,
we may iustly say, that the <hi>Popes Ecclesia malignantium,</hi> may
more easily <hi>serue a Turke,</hi> her Religion being rebellion, &amp; her
practice, murthering of soules and bodies, (as it acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

                  </gap>ght. Not a booke of <hi>Moses,</hi> and scarce a Prophet
but hee either quotes some passages from him, or at least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes
to some in him, specially that of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> and the
Prophet <hi>Esay.</hi> Nay, in the 24. of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Luke,</hi> it is said, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
his passion and resurrection from <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
Though it were hee that spake to the Patriarches, in
dreames, and visions, and Reuelations, yet hee mentions none
of them for proofe, and except they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, much lesse

and <hi>search the Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>yee erre not knowing the Scriptures,</hi>
and for <hi>traditions</hi> he names them not but to reiect them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is acknowledged by the greatest Clerks, and
chiefest pillars of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Euangelists in
writing their Gospels, and the Apostles their Epistles, were
none other but the <hi>pens of a ready Writer,</hi> the <hi>Secretaries</hi> of
their Lord and Master: now that which the Secretarie writes
according to the direction and inditing of his Lord, more
commonly is, &amp; more iustly ought to be called the writing of
the Lord then the Secretarie; it is S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Augustines</hi> reason in the
last Chapter of his first booke of the consent of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists.
<hi>Cum Euangelistae</hi> (saith hee) <hi>&amp; Apostoli scripserunt quae
Deus ostendit &amp; dixit, nequaquam dicendum est quod ipse non scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serit;
quicquid enim ille de suis factis &amp; dictis nos legere voluit,
hoc scribendum illis tanquam suis manibus imperauit.</hi> In as much
as the Euangelists and Apostles wrote that which God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
and spake, it cannot be said that himselfe wrote not; for
whatsoeuer his pleasure was wee should reade, touching his
workes and words, that he gaue them in charge to write, as it
had beene with his owne fingers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is reported by <hi>Eusebius, lib. 1. cap. 13.</hi> that <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
left in writing</hi> a letter to <hi>Abgarus</hi> King of <hi>Edessa,</hi> the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
whereof he there setteth downe at large, affirming the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
to haue bene kept among the publique Records of that
Citie: but for mine owne part I must needs say, that if it bee
not fained, I can not conceiue why it should not be receiued

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:3770:175"/>
Fourthly and lastly, it may very well bee, that our <hi>Sauiour</hi>
wrote nothing himselfe, in as much as those things which were
to bee written, were testimonies concerning himselfe: for
though it be true, in regard of his diuine authoritie, which hee

that he had beene instructed in the doctrine of Religion,
yet hee thought to write vnto him <hi>from point to point, that hee
might haue the certainety of those things,</hi> so that though hee had

the meanes to beget certainety: so saith <hi>Dauid, This shall bee

               <p>This Proposition supposeth the number of the Apostles to
haue bene but twelue; whereas <hi>Matthias</hi> made the thirteenth,
and <hi>Paul</hi> the fourteenth, who proclaimes it in the front of the
greatest part of his fourteene seuerall Epistles <hi>Paul an Apostle:</hi>
But it may be M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor will not vouchsafe him that name,
because he wrote more then any of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the fifteenth of the <hi>Actes,</hi> wee reade, that the
Apostles met together in Councill, wrote Letters, the very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
whereof there appeares; neither can it be otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
but that the whole number of them, or at leastwise the
greatest part was there assembled: So that to say, that <hi>seuen of
them left nothing in writing,</hi> is both derogatorie from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of Scripture, and in it selfe vniustifiable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly it may very wel be, that <hi>seuen of them left nothing</hi> els
but that Letter in writing; not because they held it sufficient to
teach only by word of mouth (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor would imply)
but because sixe of them had written, which how needfull it
was they should performe, appeareth aswell by Saint<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 3. 1.</note>

which is the true Church of <hi>CHRIST; now to knowe the

this word doth signifie diuerse things, sometimes the</hi> House of
Gods seruice, <hi>sometimes the</hi> Congregation of all those that
are Baptized, <hi>and sometimes the</hi> Clergie or Spiritualtie; <hi>and in</hi>
this sence alone our Sauiour founded a Church when hee did call
and send his Apostles, and gaue them the same power, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
as man had receiued of his Father. <hi>Then to know which
is the true Church (saith he)</hi> we must inquire which is the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
that was founded by <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and continueth in the Vnitie of
the Church by perpetuall Succession from the Apostles, and so
from <hi>CHRIST</hi> himselfe: <hi>And for certaine resolution thereof,

<hi>whereof the first is,</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> report of Chronicles and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
<hi>The second is,</hi> The Vniuersalitie, Antiquitie, and consent

and repugnancie taught in Schisme: <hi>And</hi> herein you may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<hi>(saith hee) of the</hi> most learned and most honest to informe
you: <hi>The thirde is,</hi> The testimonie of Scriptures of the olde and
new Testament.</p>
               <p>For answere to this inference, I would willingly learne
where M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctour learned those acceptions of the Church;
once I am sure he taketh it otherwise then it is taken in holy
Scripture; and againe in holy Scriptures it is taken otherwise
then he taketh it: Neither are his two former meanes for the
finding out of the Church more iustifiable, then his acceptions
of the Church; whereof the first is <hi>the report of Chronicles;</hi> but
to grant that all Chronicles spake as the <hi>Pope</hi> would haue
them, yet were all this but <hi>humane testimony,</hi> a sufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
to moue, but no sufficient ground for the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to build vpon. For the proofe of his second reason he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers

himselfe read, and in detestation of such blasphemie, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
protested against it; as not long since <hi>Beza</hi> did, being
handled in like maner: But returne wee vnto <hi>Cochlaeus:</hi> First,
where he sayth, that <hi>the supper before hee died hee was in perfect
health,</hi> they who knew him better, tell vs, that before he came
to <hi>Islib,</hi> (whither hee was sent for by the Earles of <hi>Mansfield,</hi>
to compose a controuersie betweene them) hee was very
sickly, and that hee had a long time been troubled with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of humors in the orifice of his stomacke. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
where hee sayth, that <hi>hee supped delicately and pleasantly, and
delighted all his company with merrie conceits;</hi> surely they that
were present testifie, that his merry conceits were but holy and
religious discourses; for being demaunded at supper time,
<hi>Whether in that eternall life wee should know one another,</hi> hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>affirmatiuely,</hi> and confirmed the same by testimonie of
Scripture: according as<note n="e" place="margin">Lib. 2. 15 46.</note> 
               <hi>Thuanus</hi> also, a Papist by profession,
but of more authoritie then an hundred <hi>Cochlaeusses,</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.
Lastly, where hee sayth, that <hi>hee died suddenly the same
night:</hi> neither died he <hi>the same night,</hi> but the next day betwixt
8. and 9. of the clocke, nor yet <hi>suddenly,</hi> for perceiuing his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to grow vpon him, and feeling within him the summons
of death, hee gaue many sweete and comfortable exhortations
to them that were about him, and commended himselfe vnto
God in a most heauenly and effectuall prayer, and so quietly,
and by little and little died. And these things are testified by
<hi>Iustus Ionas,</hi> who attended him euen vnto the last gaspe, and by
<hi>Melancthon,</hi> and others of his best acquaintance: Whereunto I
adde out of<note n="f" place="margin">Loco supra ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato.</note> 
               <hi>Thuanus,</hi> that <hi>as in his life time hee was dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
so in his death could they not be drawen from his loue: For they
of</hi> Mansfield <hi>were earnest, that his bodie might be buried amongst
them, in as much as there he was borne: but</hi> Io. Frederick <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
so farre by his authoritie, that his bodie was caried backe to</hi>
Wittenberg, <hi>and there honourably interred:</hi> So that though
Papists burst for spight and enuie, it could not be without the
finger of God, that so meane a man as <hi>Luther,</hi> so boldly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3770:181"/>
himselfe against the <hi>Pope,</hi> (whom Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
at that time durst not without great danger resist) yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
so long, died so peaceablie, and was buried so honourably.</p>
            <p>The next is <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> who as the Doctor, out of the same
<hi>Cochlaeus</hi> saith, <hi>was slaine in warre, which he made against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes.</hi>
Indeede that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was slaine in the fielde, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, nor can bee denied: but I would faine learne why so
to die should be counted an <hi>vnhappie ende,</hi> or why that, which
as seemes to mee, is an argument of his courage and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie,
should bee esteemed an argument of heresie.<note n="g" place="margin">Apol. p. 3. c. 9.</note> If you
say hee was slaine fighting against <hi>Catholikes:</hi> so haue many

<hi>He, with other Priests aided the armie in those things which

according to the laudable custome of that countrey, went as
a Preacher with the armie, <hi>Quid hic mali?</hi> What euill is

traitour and rebell fighting against his Prince and Countrey,
perished miserably: but <hi>Zuinglius</hi> like a good Patriot, figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in defence of his Countrey, died valiantly: Of whose
innocencie therein, God himselfe, as to mee it seemes, hath
giuen this testimonie, that when his enemies hauing found his

that in the meane season hee often exhorted them that were about
him to prayer, and to die constantly for the Name of <hi>CHRIST,</hi>
professing that hee went cheerefully to the Tribunall of <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
The last night of his life, demaunding of a friend that came to visite

him, what newes? and he answering, None, Then <hi>(quoth he)</hi> can I

one asking whether the light did not trouble him? Here, quoth
he laying his hand on his breast, is store of light: After this, as well as
his tongue could vtter it, he repeated that excellent praier of <hi>Dauid</hi>
for Remission of sinnes, and that entirely from the beginning vnto
the end, fetching withall many deepe grones from the bottome of his
heart: Then pawsing a while he said, <hi>CHRIST IESV</hi> saue mee,
which was his very last speech: And so hee died with much peace
and tranquilitie of mind: <hi>Thus farre</hi> Grynaeus.</p>
            <p>The fourth is <hi>Carolostadius,</hi> whom, saith the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of <hi>Bazil write to haue beene killed of a Diuell, in their Epistle
of the death of</hi> Carolostadius. It cannot be denyed but that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolostadius</hi>
was a man ful of many imperfections, and suspected
to incline too much vnto <hi>Anabaptisme:</hi> yet is this report a meere
fiction, and the <hi>Epistle</hi> out of which it is vouched, a very coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
as diuers haue written, which <hi>Fr. Iunius</hi> saith, he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by sufficient men, who were present at his death.</p>
            <p>The last is <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> who (saith the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.) was eaten and
consumed with wormes, and dyed as did <hi>Antiochus, Hunery,
Maximinus,</hi> &amp;c. as witnesseth <hi>Hieron. Bolseck</hi> in his life; who
also addeth that <hi>he died blaspheming, cursing, &amp; inuocating diuels.</hi>
A feareful and vnhappy end indeed, if it were true, and worthy
of an <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h-heretike;</hi> but if false (as I am perswaded, euen to
the <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conscience it was, when they so
wrote) a most hellish slander. <hi>Thuanus</hi> a man of their owne
side reiects it as a meere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>able; for hee<note n="k" place="margin">Lib. 35. 1564.</note> reports, that hauing
for the space of full seauen yeeres fought with diuers diseases
and griefes, yet was he therefore neuer a whit lesse diligent in
his function, nor absteined from continuall writing, and at
length died of the disease called <hi>the difficulty of breathing.</hi>
Nay <hi>Genebrard</hi> though farre from the ingenuitie of <hi>Thuanus,</hi>
and one that raileth most impotently vpon <hi>Caluin,</hi> yet durst
not charge him herewith, and was ashamed to defile his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
with such an impudent lie. <hi>Fr. Iunius</hi> saith, that hee was
at <hi>Geneua</hi> then wen <hi>Caluin</hi> dyed, yet neither <hi>saw nor heard, nor
knew, nor perceiued any such thing, nor so much as euer dreamed of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3770:182"/>
any such matter:</hi> In a word, he was visited in his sickenesse by
sundrie excellent personages, by the <hi>Syndicks</hi> of the Citie, by
the <hi>Ministers,</hi> by others, all which are witnesses of the sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
whereof hee dyed. And<note n="l" place="margin">In vita Cal.</note> 
               <hi>Theod. Beza,</hi> who faithfully
wrote his life and death, whereof (as he saith) <hi>hee had beene a
spectator sixteene yeeres together, testifieth that in him was proposed
vnto all, a most excellent patterne of Christian both life and death,
which</hi> (saith he) <hi>is as easie to calumniate, as it is hard to imitate.</hi>
These things considered, I referre mee now vnto the Readers
indifferencie, whether is more worthy of credite, the whole
Citie of <hi>Geneua,</hi> and so many notable men present at his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and death, and testifying of his peaceable, holy, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
departure: or one <hi>Hieron. Bolseck,</hi> a Knight of the poste,
twice banished, thrice a runagate, who of a <hi>Carmelite,</hi> became
a <hi>Physitian,</hi> or rather <hi>a Quacksaluer,</hi> a sworne enemie to <hi>Caluin,</hi>
one that had beene from <hi>Geneua</hi> more then ten yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and had sold his pen vnto his <hi>Lords and friends</hi> to defame
<hi>Caluin.</hi> And thus much in defence of those men whom the
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. termeth the <hi>Monsters of our age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now although the vnhappy end of some particular men be
no demonstratiue proofe, and scarce a coniecturall signe of the
falshood of that religion which they professe, and that Church
in which they make their last end: yet that it may appeare in
requital of the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. or rather the Cardinal, how vnhappily some
zealous persecutors of such, as haue forsaken fellowship with
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> haue ended their liues, I could referre the
Reader to a large Discourse touching that point toward the
end of the second part of the <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi> and also in
<hi>Hassenmullerus,</hi> in the conclusion of his booke. Neither can
the like iust exception bee taken against their euidences, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

with the testimonie of <hi>Thuanus,</hi> a professed member of that
Church which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor cals Catholike; yet such a one as
besides his great paines and diligence in the search of trueth,

ignominiously, within these fewe dayes shall hee lie along,
which soone after came to passe: for being miserably slaine,
his dead body was in the open sight of all laide along in the

the prosperitie of kingdomes. Philip the faire reigned in
peace and prosperity, notwithstanding his attempts vpon the Papall

Sea. King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth defeated in battell the troupes of Pope
<hi>Iuly</hi> the second, and his alies, declared him falne from the Papacie,
and caused Crowns to be stamped, wherin <hi>Rome</hi> is called <hi>Babylon;</hi>
yet neuerthelesse was loued and honoured of his subiects, who gaue
him the title of Father of the people. Neuer did <hi>Great Britaine</hi>
euer receiue so great blessings of God, nor enioyed so much peace
and plentie, as since the time that Popes haue no more but the looking
on and sent no more their Legats to gather the tribute of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
and that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> doe no longer homage vnto the
Pope for their Crowne, and are no more lashed by Monkes.
What was <hi>Holland, Zeland,</hi> and <hi>Frizeland,</hi> before that God ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among them the torch of the Gospell, in comparison of the riches,
and prosperitie wherein God hath aduanced them? The Common
wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> doeth it enioy lesse peace and prosperity then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
since they haue taken from the <hi>Pope</hi> one of his swords, and
haue shaken off his temporall power? On the contrary side, the
Kings of <hi>France,</hi> after they had giuen vnto the <hi>Popes</hi> all what
they held in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Countie of <hi>Auinion,</hi> haue againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
of them but course entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. <hi>Popes</hi> haue forged a dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Constantine,</hi> to the end to deface the memory of the donation
of <hi>Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charlemaine:</hi> They haue troubled the State, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselues for the sons of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Courteous, against their
owne father, whose life was an example of innocence: They haue
skimmed the Realme of Money by infinite pillages, wherewith the
Kings of <hi>France</hi> haue endeuoured to meete, by their pragmaticall
sanction: They haue oftentimes interdicted the Realme, degraded
their Kings, sollicited their neighbours to inuade the kingdome,
stirred vp the people against the King, whence many troubles and
parricides haue ensued. <hi>Rauilliac</hi> rendred this reason of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
because, said hee, the King would make warre against God,
inasmuch as hee would make warre against the <hi>Pope,</hi> and that the
<hi>Pope</hi> was God: Which maketh mee to maruell how the Cardinall

               </gap>s, during which <hi>France</hi>
fell foule with the <hi>Pope,</hi> seeing that the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe raised vp
those troubles. If the Kings or people of <hi>France,</hi> hauing offended
the <hi>Pope,</hi> God had otherwayes sent among them som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3770:185"/>
of the iniurie done vnto his Vicar; but seeing the <hi>Pope</hi>
himselfe hath caused these euils, it is not God who punisheth the
iniuries done vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> but the <hi>Pope</hi> who reuengeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and which is worse, without receiuing any wrong: <hi>Whence</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>areth, that to exhort the Kingdome to maintaine vnion with
the <hi>Pope,</hi> by the remembrance of the calamities past, is not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
them to loue the Pope, but to call to minde the euils which he
hath caused, and to tremble at his thundrings, and conspiracies,
which hurt those onely that feare them, and which haue drawen
vpon my kingdome many blessings. Now if <hi>France</hi> haue had any
prosperitie during the time that it well accorded with the Pope, this
hath been because the <hi>Pope</hi> seeketh the amitie of those Princes
that are in prosperitie, and which haue meanes to annoy him:
Kings are not therefore in prosperitie because the Pope is vnited
with them, but the Pope is vnited with them because they are in
prosperitie: Euen as swallowes arriue in the spring, but make not
the spring, so the <hi>Pope</hi> ioyneth himselfe to the prosperitie of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
but maketh not their prosperitie. But if there happen any
disaster in a Kingdome, or any ciuill warre, which putteth an
Estate in danger, the Pope vnder a shadow of hauing care of the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of soules, thrusteth himselfe into the quarrell, and runneth
vnto the wracke to reape his profit thereby: And if a State change
its Master, hee will that the new possessour, vnto whom hee hath
giuen aide, hold the kingdome of his liberalitie; but if the ancient
possessour conquer his enemies, notwithstanding the <hi>Popes</hi> thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings,
then his <hi>Holinesse</hi> offers him all sorts of Indulgences, and
out of his compassion receiueth him againe, whom hee was not able to
destroy. <hi>Hitherto his</hi> Maiestie, <hi>then which nothing can bee
spoken more fully and effectually to this purpose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For surely (not to speake of the prosperitie of forraine
countries, who haue broken off communion with the <hi>Roman</hi>
Synagogue) he is more then blind that cannot see, and too too
enuious, that seeing will not acknowledge, how extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God hath blessed this our Realme with all kind of benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
more then in former times, since it held the <hi>Pope</hi> to bee
