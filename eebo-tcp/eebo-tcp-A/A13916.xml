            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

A briefe Treatiſe of the <hi>vertue of the Croſſe, and</hi> the manner how to <hi>worſhip it.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I conſider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which at this daye are in the Chriſtian church, the conference which our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt had with the woman Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, in the 4. of S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> ver. 22. may very well be called to remembrance. <hi>You</hi> (ſaid he to the Samaritaine) <hi>worſhip yee know not what: we Iewes worſhip that which we know.</hi> So that ſeeing on the one ſide, the iuſtice of God diſcouers it ſelfe in ſuch as loue ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes better then trueth, haue plunged themſelues of long time, and yet wade fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more and more in ignorance: and on
<pb facs="tcp:3426:6"/>
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie part, his mercie ſhines on ſuch, whoſe eyes it pleaſeth him to vnſeale, that they may behold the ſtrength of truth made manifeſt, we may be good reaſon reioyce in our ſelues, and ſay, that being of this latter number, we worſhip what we know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God himſelfe ſpeaking to vs in his word, makes vs therby to haue knowledge of him.</p>
            <p>Nowe on the contrarie ſide, whereas they of the Romiſh Church erroniouſly led, or perhaps by ſimplicitie, confirmed therin through ignorance, and carried onely with ſelf-wild obſtinacie, worſhippe that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they but preſume, and haue (indeed) no knowledge of at all. For ſeeing that in the moſt part of their ſeruice, there is nothing elſe contained but humaine traditions, it is moſt euident, that there can likewiſe bee nothing beſide but opinion: that is to ſay, wauering and doubtfull thoughts, tending either to good or euill, &amp; vnconſonant or diſagreeable to God. And ſince it is ſo, that where there is no faith, there can be no certainetie: it muſt needes follow, that in whatſoeuer they introduce, there can be no aſſurance, conſidering therein is no faith
<pb facs="tcp:3426:6"/>
contained. But let vs go a litle further, thoſe things which haue nether faith nor certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, muſt needs bee matters much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, becauſe what ſoeuer is done without faith, is ſinne. Yet notwithſtanding ſeeing it hath pleaſed God to giue vs ſuch grace, as to hold his worde in price and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtymation, addicting our ſelues wholly to the ſeruice thereof, as neither ſpeaking or thinking any thing, but what is therein vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and preſcribed to vs, that wee might embrace the verie leaſt particle therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, wee may ſay and ſpeake it by good right, that we knowe, namely by a knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge more firme, then are all the ſciences and demonſtrations induced by humaine ſence or diſcourſe. For our ſaith beeing grounded on the woorde of God, holdeth more ſtrictly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all elſe in the world beſide can do: it is firme and ſtable, ſubiect to no kinde of alteration whatſoeuer. Following then the contents of this word, we beleeue in our hearts, &amp; confeſle with our mouths, that God only is to be ſerued &amp; honored, &amp; that the ſeruice due to his Maieſtie, ought to be giuen according to his good pleaſure &amp; ordenance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3426:7"/>
Now the manifeſt will of God concerning this point, is, that wee ſhould worſhip and ſerue him in ſpirit and trueth, according to <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the 4. ver. 24. and therefore not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ought we to reiect the auncient iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ceremonies, but all other beſide, that offer themſelues ouer and aboue the worde of God in the Chriſtian Church, for it were no point of reaſon, to forſake thoſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies inſtituted by God: neuertheleſſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde they were to endure but for a certaine time onely, and then afterward grew faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the manners of men, and were accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or neglected after their opinions. Such (for the moſt parte are thoſe, which the Romaine Church practiſeth in inuocation on deceaſed Saintes, the Images of God and of thoſe Saintes, the adoration of the Croſſe, and ſuch like: which haue no other foundation, but onely mens vanitie and no veritie, Now we intend not at this preſent to ſpeake of other points, for they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ſhall be (God willing) handled elſe where in ample manner: but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant occaſion impoſeth a needefull taske, to ſpeake of inſupportable abuſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, concerning the Croſſe, to the
<pb facs="tcp:3426:7"/>
ende all men may learne how to furniſhe them ſelues againſt the poyſon of idolatric, which the deuill comes to vomite foorth againe in this time of neere neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, furthering his purpoſe with the iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of diuers his inſtruments, who by wordes and writing, labour to rebuilde vp idolatrie againe, as the walles of <hi>Iericho,</hi> which notwithſtanding, by the ſound of Gods trumpets are fallen, and that by good numbers in theſe quarters.</p>
            <p>We conſider, that they who brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; diuulged thoſe two writings, which they ſend flying abroad in forme of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards, doubted not to greeue &amp; make many good Chriſtians among vs ſhed teares: for whatis he, who beholding the follies, abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and idolatries in them contained, that can refraine from lamenting, ſeeing the ſonne of God diſhonored, a number of ſoules withdrawne from true chriſtianitie, &amp; an infinite multitude to fortifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in ignorance and falſhood? Yet this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation marcheth not alone, for we acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany it with our daily ſighes and prayers, drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the entire depth &amp; bottom of our harts, to the onely true God, by the interceſſion
<pb facs="tcp:3426:8"/>
of him that was crucified, dyed for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our iuſtification: that hee will confirme in his trueth, ſuch as it pleaſed him alreadie to call thereto, and withdrawe from errour, thoſe whome the falſe preachers of idolatrie labour to blinde therewith.</p>
            <p>Firſt then it is to be noted, that the word Croſſe ſignifieth ſometime a kinde of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, which in elder times they vſed for the greateſt and moſt infamous malefactours. Sometime it ſignifieth the puniſhment, which thoſe offendours were to endure. In the hiſtorie of our redemption, theſe two ſignifications are oftentimes found. For, when it is ſaid, that Chriſt caried the croſſe, and was faſtened thereon: it is eaſie to be gathered, that it was the Croſſe of wood he bare, and that thereto hee was nayled and faſtened. In like manner, when it is ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Coloſ. 1. ver. 20. That by the blood of the Croſſe of Chriſt, our peace is made:</hi> it cannot bee doubted, but that theſe wordes haue refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to thoſe ſufferings, which it pleaſed the ſonne of God to endure for vs. This diſtinction being well obſerued, wee ſhall the more eaſilie and Chriſtianlie deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,

the matter handled in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards. For if by the word Croſſe, the death and paſſion of Chriſt is vnderſtood: it will follow by the confeſſion of all true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that the vertue of that Croſſe is ſuch, as is no way to bee comprehended by the vnderſtanding of men nor Angels. For it is the Croſſe and death of Chriſt Ieſus, that witneſſeth the loue which God beares to his elect, which <hi>Loue paſſeth all vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paule, Philipi. 4. ver. 7.</hi> In this Croſſe is our life, light, health, defence, ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> joy, perfection, and our all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: for there is no good or hope for vs elſewhere, but in the Croſſe of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Heereof may wee ſaye with S. <hi>Paule, Galat, 6. ver. 14. God forbid wee ſhould glorie in any thing, but in the Croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whereby the worlde is crucified to vs, and we to the world,</hi> wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>1. Cor. 1. ver. 25. That he deſired to know nothing but Chriſt Ieſus, and him crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if by the worde Croſſe, we vnderſtand the wood or libbit, whereon the ſonne of God was hanged for the ſinnes of the elect, we may boldly ſay, that wee finde no teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
<pb facs="tcp:3426:9"/>
in the word of God, written by the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, nor any examples or practiſe of theirs, that either may or ought induce vs, to attribute any vertue to the wood it ſelfe. For albeit wee doubt not of Gods omnipotencie, to whom nothing is impoſſible: yet ought wee to conceiue of this almightineſſe, by that which appeares to vs of his owne will, according to that in the 115. Pſalme. <hi>God hath done all whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him pleaſed.</hi> Then ſafely may wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God had no will ſuch vertue ſhould be adherent to the wood or croſſe of h<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s ſonne: for then hee woulde doubtleſſe haue witneſſed the ſame by his word. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong true Chriſtians, whatſoeuer is not written in the worde of God, is helde as a matter of no eſtate or beeing, as wee may gather from the 7. to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> verſe 3. where it is ſaid, <hi>That Melchiſedech was without father, without mother, &amp;c.</hi> for this only reaſon, becauſe the ſcripture no where at all ſpeaketh of his father or mother: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be moſt certaine, that he had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; mother like to other men. Of the Croſſe we read, that Ieſus Chriſt carried it, ſo likewiſe did <hi>Simon</hi> the father of <hi>Rufus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3426:9"/>
beare it: that Ieſus went out ofthe cittle of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> bearing it, that it was brought to the mount of <hi>Caluarie,</hi> where it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, Ieſus nayledthereon, and likewiſe the inſcription, <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth king of the Jewes,</hi> that thereon Ieſus had his ſide pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, rendred vp his ſpirit thereon, and when night came, that the bodie of Ieſus was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe from the croſſe: ouer and beſide theſe poynts, we read nothing whereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that God was willing to foreſtall idolatrie, which neuertheleſſe Sathan wold needes bring into the world. For as he had no will, that the Sepulchre of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> ſhould be knowne: ſo is there not any wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe recorded, that God was willing his ſonnes croſſe ſhuld haue any notice among men, for to ſay that it was kept, or enterred in the place where it had beene erected, which was, as oneſ aith, the place where <hi>Adam</hi> was buried, this hath no ſemblance of any certaintie, for if we ſhall beleeue our elders, <hi>Adam</hi> was buried in <hi>Hebron,</hi> &amp; not neere <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Likewiſe, ſeeing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples &amp; Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt, were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at his death, &amp; that after his aſcention they were prohibited to ſpeake of or name
<pb facs="tcp:3426:10"/>
Ieſus Chriſt, that they were made priſoners and ſcourged: that Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: that great perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in the church of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and ſoon after that, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was brought to totall extremitie and ruine; what apparance can there bee, that this croſſe was hidden and honoured by them that followed Chriſt Ieſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In like maner, we reade not any where that the Diſciples and Apoſtles of Ieſus, did euer recommend this croſſe: and yet they ſaid in the 13. of the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> verſe 13. <hi>Let vs go foorth after Jeſus out of the campe, bearing his reproach.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe ſaid: <hi>That whoſoeuer would be his Diſciple, muſt take vp his croſſe &amp; follow him.</hi> Math. 16. verſe 24. And as for that where he ſaith, the enemies of Chriſt haue gone about to aboliſh his croſſe, and yet they could not do it, ſuch would lighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> darkeneſſe by darkneſſe. For where one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that they endeuoured to burne the croſſe, it is altogither vncertaine: Another maintaines, they threw it into the ſea, how can that hold, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordering cittie? Perhappes then (ſaith he) they tooke paines to bring it to the porte of <hi>Japhet,</hi> which is diſtant from the ſaid Cittie

about two daies iourney: but heerein it is to be doubted likewiſe.</p>
            <p>And concerning what others haue ſaide, that the ſelfe ſame enemies of Chriſt, after al theſe other trials to deſtroy the croſſe, did laſtly (yet cunningly) burie it verie deep in the earth, and with it, the images of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Adonis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who would not vtterly reiect this fable, ifhe but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what hatred the Iewes bare to al kinde of Images? Can it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way ſeeme likely, that they which reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Romaine Gouernors, yea the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf, not permitting the Eagle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was the Romaines Enſigne, ſhould be receiued into the cittie of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> offering themſelues to all daungers whatſoeuer, ratherthen to ſuffer ſuch a banner be diſplaide among them: that they of ſo ſtearne nature, would make or ſearch for the images of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Adems,</hi> to make in ſerue them for ſuch a purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such reckonings do indeed ſeeme no otherwiſe, but onely to annihilate the vertue of the croſſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The holy Hiſtorie enſtructs vs in far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manner, what was to be vnderſtood by the enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, as their
<pb facs="tcp:3426:11"/>
reiecting the preaching of the Goſpell, and perſecuting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſaid they were Chriſts Diſciples, not ſuffering him to be named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, Acts. 4. and 5. And as for vs, we ſay, that the paſſion and vertue of Ieſus Chriſt, ought to be ſought for in himſelfe, and not in a tree of wood. If yee obiect the linnen cloaths and handkercheifes of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts. 19. verſe 12. the anſwere is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: that god was willing by thoſe miracles to honour the Apoſtleſhip of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to the end that ſuch as neuer ſawe his face, might yet be perſwaded of him, and that God had authorized ſuch miracles by him, as beeing the true ſeruaunt of Ieſus Chriſt. But heere is the poynt whereon wee ſtand, to wit, that thoſe miracles are teſtified by the word of God: which cannot ſo be ſaid of the woode of the croſſe of Chriſt, the ſcripture not making any mention thereof. For it is moſt certaine, that if God had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to work by ſuch an inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or means, the ſpirit of God would not haue beene ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent therein: the rather making mention of things concerning the ſeruant, doubtleſſe he would neuer haue forgotten the maiſter.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes moſt euident, if it were for no
<pb facs="tcp:3426:11"/>
other reaſon, but that God would not limit men to ſuch earthly thinges, as likewiſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught vs by his example, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. verſe 16. <hi>That we ought not to know Chriſt Jeſus after the fleſh.</hi> And to the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> 5. verſe 15. <hi>We ſerue God in ſpirit, glorifying vs in Chriſt Jeſus, not beleeuing at all in the fleſh.</hi> Now before wee paſſe any further, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to declare in this place, what is to be vnderſtood by the ſigne of the croſſe. If by the word croſſe, wee vnderſtande the ſufferings which the ſonne of God endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, both in ſoule and bodie, as <hi>Eſaye</hi> 55. verſe 3. <hi>Being filled with ſorrowes,</hi> and full of heauineſſe in ſoule, euen to the death, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing drunke the cup of Gods anger, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he cried, <hi>My God, my god, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> it is moſt certaine, that ſuch ſufferings exceede repreſentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For our ſence cannot comprehend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but by faith we vnderſtand, that they were infinite and vnſpeakable. Therfore we ſay in our Creed, that <hi>wee beleeue Chriſt Ieſus did ſuffer, that he was crucified, dead, and buired, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into hell:</hi> all theſe then beeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, muſt needes be likewiſe irrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3426:12"/>
But if by the worde Croſſe, wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the wood, wheron the ſonne of God oftered himſelfe a ſacrifice to his Father, for the propitiation of our ſinnes: it is caſie then to be painted or figured, yet ſuch a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure can be but the portraite of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, wherewith the hangmen were furniſhed to torment our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: if then thoſe inſtruments can haue no vertue in them, that which is but the image thereof muſt needes haue much leſſe. Nowe it is moſt apparent, that the wood had no vertue in it, but what was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, neither could the Iewes giue it any, for themſelues had none, but a readines to cuill dooing: why then it remaines, that if it can haue any at all, it muſt be by touching the body of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. But how ſuch touching could confer any grace to the wood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are not able to ſaye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as hath beene declared) it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the worde of God: why then we may likewiſe affirme, that thoſe lippes of <hi>Iudas</hi> which kiſſed Ieſus, the hands of them that layde holde on him, led, buffeted, nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and crucified him, receiued likewiſe ſome vertue from him. Which being moſt
<pb facs="tcp:3426:12"/>
abſurde, much more is it then to ſay: that wood hauing no life, by a meere touch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhould bee ſuſceptible of holineſſe and vertue: for if ſuch vertue had been giuen to the Croſſe of wood, becauſe Chriſt ſuffered thereon, like vertue would haue beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them, by whome he ſuffered. <hi>For they were thoſe, which ſhould performe what the defined Counſell of God had before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Actes</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. Nor are ſuch alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations worthy receiuing, in nothing ſome difference in diſſemblable inſtrumentes, to wit: that <hi>Iudas</hi> and the Iewes could be bad, and yet the Croſſe not. For euermore this is to be graunted, that if the touching drew vertue and ſanctity to it, cheefely becauſe it was as the Alter for ſacrifiſing the Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the worlde: it ſtandeth not with reaſon, that the Croſſe being a life-leſſe thing, could bee endued with vertue and ſanctity, ſooner then men liuing and moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Hence then eaſily may bee deriued, that if the Croſſe of wood could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any vertue or holineſſe: the ſigne or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage therof (doubtleſſe) was farre leſſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch grace. And this is the reaſon, why Saint <hi>Paule</hi> attributed all the power
<pb facs="tcp:3426:13"/>
of the Croſſe, to the word, and not vnto the ſigne thereof, when he ſaid, 1. Corinth. 1. ver 18. <hi>The preaching of the Croſse, is the power of God, to vs which are ſaued.</hi> For God enſtructed his Church by his worde, and the ſignes and Sacraments inſtituted by him, which Sacraments could not bee Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, except the worde of God were vnited with them: according as <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>The worde is conioyned to the Element, and then it is made a Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then the ſigne of the Croſſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was ordayned by God, and that neither the worde of God, nor the hiſtorie of the Paſſion &amp; Croſſe of Chriſt, haue made any mention of ſuch vertue in the ſigne: wee ought not ſtretch our wit beyond the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: for to outſtep the limittes preſcribed by God, is to eate the fruite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God, and to tempt God by bold preſumption.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe it is infallible, that God neuer workes by ſole figures or carracters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for in things naturall, the vertue proceedeth from the eſſence and qualitie of themſelues: in things ſupernaturall, God helpes him-ſelfe by miraculous vertue, not faſtened to the
<pb facs="tcp:3426:13"/>
ſigne or figure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor do we read, that when Ieſus Chriſt wrought his miracles, he did them by Carracters, but that he ſpake, and impoſed his hands theron, and his Apoſtles did the ſame. When our Sauiour raiſed <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus:</hi> he cryed with a lowde voice. <hi>Come foorth Lazarus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Iohn 11. ver. 45. When S. <hi>Peter</hi> healed the lame Cripple, he ſaid. <hi>In the name of Ieſus Chriſt of Nazareth, riſe vp and walke.</hi> Actes 3. ver. 6. When he raiſed <hi>Tabitha,</hi> he ſaid: <hi>Daughter, I ſay to thee ariſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but we read not that hee vſed any ſigne of carracter. We are not ignorant, that diuers of olde haue ſpoken of the ſigne of the Croſſe, and of the vertue thereof: but it was not with any ſuch intention, or to the end which at this day is pretended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they vſed it as a publique profeſſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Chriſtianitie, whether it were in priuate or publique. For becauſe the perſecutions were great and greeuous, the Chriſtians would not diſcouer themſelues but to their Chriſtian bretheren: &amp; ſo they knew each other by that ſigne, and would to one another make the croſſe, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared them to be of one and the ſame reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in Chriſtianitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3426:14"/>
On the other ſide, although the <hi>Pagans</hi> made a mocke of the croſſe of Chriſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was fooliſhneſſe to beleeue and hope in one who was crucified &amp; dead: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Chriſtians (knowing that all our glorie conſiſteth but in the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, wherein is the great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſedome of God, with aſſurance of health to all beleeuers) would ſhew that they were not aſhamed thereof, but made openly the ſigne, to witneſſe, that they were the croſſed Knights, that is to ſay, the diſciples and followers of Ieſus Chriſt. Heereto may bee attributed that which Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſpake, in his ſecond Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie on the Epiſtle to the Romaines. <hi>If thou heareſt any one ſay: Woorſhippeſt thou one crucified? neuer bee aſhamed there of, nor eaſt downe thy lookes to the ground: but glorie and reioyce in thy ſelfe, anouching confeſsion thereof, with free lookes and bolde counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saint</hi> Auguſtine <hi>in his eight Sermon on the Apoſtles words, Chap. 3.</hi> The wiſe of this worlde, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> aſſaile vs concerning the croſſe of Chriſt, and ſay: what vnderſtanding haue you, to worſhip a crucified God? we will
<pb facs="tcp:3426:14"/>
thus anſwere them. We haue no parte of your vnderſtanding, wee are not aſhamed of Chriſt Ieſus nor his Croſſe: we fixe it on our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, which is the ſeate of ſhamfaſtneſſe, where doe we place it, euen there, to giue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that in the place where ſhame appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, it being there fixed, we ſhall never thereof be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>But the ſame Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> handleth another cauſe, in the booke hee made as a Catechiſme for the vnlearned, Chap. 20. namely, that the Chriſtians deſired in ſo dooing, to imitate the action of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> before theyr departure out of <hi>Aegipt:</hi> for as they ſigned their doore poſtes with the blood of the Paſchall Lambe, euen ſo the Chriſtians would bee ſigned on their foreheads; the wordes of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> are theſe. <hi>The paſsion of Chriſt was moſt plainelie ſigured by this people, when they were commaunded to kill a ſheepe, and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> eate it, and to marke with the bloud thereof the doores of their habitations.</hi> Now the Prophet manifeſtlye ſpeaketh of our LORDE IESVS CHRIST, that hee was ladde as a Sheepe to the ſlaughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thou oughteſt at this day to be ſigned
<pb facs="tcp:3426:15"/>
in the forehead, as the doore of thy hearts moſt noted dwelling, with the ſigne of his croſſe and paſſion. Which is confirmed by the ſaying of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> in his 4. booke of true wiſdome, at the end of the 26. chap. <hi>The forehead</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the doore of a mans vnderſtanding, and the ouerthwart ariſing there of the blood, hath ſome ſignification of the Croſſe.</hi> How euer it be, this was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brought in by imitation and example of the Iewes, and not by commaundement: neuer then ſhould any foundation be made on mens examples, but on generall rules drawne from the commandement of God. The <hi>Jſraelites</hi> had commaundement from God, to do what they did vpon their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: but the Chriſtians were neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to ſigne themſelues on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. In like manner, it hath proceeded from a moſt pernitious errour, firſt borne by ſimplicitie, encreaſed afterwarde by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and at this preſent debated by ſelfe-wilde obftinacie: to attribute to the Croſſe of wood, what onely is proper to him crucified thereon. In breefe, ſeeing God onely is the authour of all goodneſſe, to him onely ought be aſcribed all the good
<pb facs="tcp:3426:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and welfare that can be recoiued: for albeic he conferreth his giftes and graces in this manner, and by ſuch inſtruments as are beſt liking to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet is it but our dutie, to ſeeke after his will in his inſtitution, and not elſe where: otherwiſe, it is a fordging of a God and a religion to our ſelues, and that by very bolde preſumption.</p>
            <p>Now it cannot bee denyed, but many meruailous things haue beene doone vnder the name and ſigne of the Croſſe: although it be likewiſe as certaine, that the greater parte of them left to bee read, hath beene licentiouſlie maintayned and inuented. For who will not count this as a fable, when hee reades, that a Maiden eating a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and not making the ſigne of the Croſſe thereon, ſwallowed downe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill? That a conuerted brother, drinking a Cup of Wine, and not vſing the ſaid ſigne of the Croſſe, was likewiſe poſſeſſed with a Deuill? With infinite other ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That meates are ſanctified to vs by the worde of God and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> 1. Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. ver. 5. That is to ſay, we may vſe them with a good conſcience, when we
<pb facs="tcp:3426:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
receiue them with prayer and thankes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, not ſpeaking of the ſigne of the creſſe, or any elſe beſide; but howſoeuer it be, we muſt ſtill come to this pointe, if that which is doone, hath approbation and warrant from God or no. For God hath permitted diuers times, himſelfe to bee feigned in things, which yet he gaue no warrant to: as infinite effects long ſince happened by the Oracles, which are ſo aunciently recorded of. <hi>But when ſuch things happen,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Deut. 13. ver. 3. (ſpeaking of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious effects of the falſe Prophets) <hi>the Lord your God prooueth you, to knowe whether yee loue the Lord your God, with all your heart, and with all your ſoule.</hi> For it ſuffiſeth not to ſay, ſuch things ſhall happen: but it muſt be knowen, whether God be the Authour of them, and whether they tend to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of men, and glorie of God or no. For if it be any thing, how little ſoeuer, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlie or indirectlie, abating the glorie due onelie to God: the rule is giuen vs, that we muſt flie all things which haue appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of euill. Wee muſt likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Sathans ſleights, who dooth like to them (as one ſaith) which teache the way
<pb facs="tcp:3426:16"/>
onward, by going backward. For he durſt neuer bee ſo bolde, to thruſt himſelfe into the Chriſtian Church, by the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt crucified onely: but publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the praiſes of the Croſſe, hee hath made woode, ſtones, and paintings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with Chriſt Ieſus, defacing quite the ſpirituall ſeruice of God, introducing carnall faſhions, ſauouring rather of Paganiſme then Chriſtianitie. Seeing therefore all power, vertue and dominion, appertaines onely to him that ſits vpon the throne, we ought to ſee him not injuried in the leaſt part of his right: but likewiſe, if it may be, to engraue in mens harts, a more deepe conſideration of the death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the Goſpels prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, GOD ſometimes would haue it knowne by extraordinarie meanes: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if then it pleaſed him to expreſſe his goodneſſe in ſuch ſorte to his choſen, it ought to bee acknowledged, and his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſupport to bee thankefully remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
            <p>But if it hath pleaſed him, that ſuch as yet ſee ſlenderlie, ſhall become more blinde, or
<pb facs="tcp:3426:17"/>
               <hi>indeed altogether ſtarke blinde: it ought to be reckoned as his iudgement, and ſo to bee obſerued for a trueth, for trueth is not trueth, except it bee ſo quite through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. And to ſpeake with</hi> Nazianzen. If a precious ſtone looſe his value, by reaſon of ſome crack or vnſightlie flawe: it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that the puritie of Chriſtian doctrine, will be much impaired by the mingling or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of erronious teaching, attributing to the ſigne or figure, the vertue of him, who would haue his Croſſe fixed in our bearts, and not tyed to our habits, or planted either in fieldes or Citties.</p>
            <p>Theſe matters firſt heere noted, haue vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vs to reſolue ſuch allegations, as are contayned in the firſt placard, the Title whereof is: <hi>Of the vertue of the Croſſe.</hi> The intent whereof is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſhew that the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſigne of the Croſſe, hath many great and goodly vertues: where contrarywiſe, all true Chriſtians doo maintayne, that all vertue and power ought to bee attributed to him crucified thereon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is vnderpropped with a place out of <hi>Ezechsel</hi> the 9. v. 4. and by ſome other aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient paſſages: but when the weakeneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:3426:17"/>
of ſuch a building ſhall be diſcouered, it wil preſently appeare howe eaſie it is to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw what ſoeuer is founded thereon.</p>
            <p>Now, to iudge rightly on this place, wee cannot doo beter then to ſet downe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of the Prophet, to the end we may thereby be ledde to the true ſence. In our language we deliuer it thus, word for word with the Hebrew text. <hi>Goe through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Cittie, euen through the middeſt of Ieruſalem, and ſet a marke vpon the fore-heads of them that mourne and ſigh, for all the abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations that be done in the middeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſence, and in the ſelfe ſame words, hath the Greeke tranſlation yeelded them: as likewiſe S. <hi>Hierome</hi> noteth, that the ſeuentie Enterpreters, and <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Symmachus</hi> haue done the ſelfe ſame. For as <hi>Thau</hi> in Hebrewe ſignifieth a marke or ſigne, and is taken from the word <hi>Thauah,</hi> that is to ſay, to ſignifie or deſigne: ſo true it is, that <hi>Theodotion</hi> and the vulgar enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, haue held the word <hi>Thau,</hi> taking it materially, as it is ſpoken in the Schooles; yet hereon many haue played at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For as the ſame Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
<pb facs="tcp:3426:18"/>
               <hi>Some haue ſaide, that by the letter</hi> Thau, <hi>which is the laſt of the Hebrew Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet, is ſignified ſuch as haue perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Others ſay, that by the ſame letter, the law is vnderſtood, which in Hebrew is called</hi> Thorah, <hi>of which word the firſt letter is Thau,</hi> And finally, the ſame Saint <hi>Hiereme,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Carracter vſed by the Propher, ſearched the Samaritaine Carracters, and ſaith, that <hi>Thau</hi> among the Samaritaines, hath the reſemblance of a croſſe, but yet he ſets not down at all the figure of this <hi>Thau</hi> of the Samaritaines. Wherefore, he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that this ſaying of his wold be further ſerched into, addes imediately aftewards an other expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wit: <hi>As the letter Thau is the laſt in the Alphabet, ſuen ſo sherby is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thoſe good people, beeing the remnant of the multitude of the euilliuers.</hi> But admit the letter <hi>Thau<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to be figured after the Hebrew Carracter, or the Samaritaine Carracter by one onely figure: yet is it eaſie to be ſeene, that it hath a verie ſlender reſemblance to an entire croſſe.</p>
            <p>For the Hebrew Carracter is made thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the Samaritaine after this manner, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is not the true figure of a croſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:3426:18"/>
for it wantes that part aboue, where the writing was faſtened, or title of the croſſe, as <hi>Lypſius</hi> hath well noted, in the tenth Chapter of his firſt booke of the croſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if the worde</hi> Thau had beene writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his Conſonantes and one vowell, as at this day it is read in the Hebre we text, in this manner, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> then it would haue much leſſe reſemblance. <hi>But after the word, let vs now come to the ſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt of all, it appeareth by that which is recited in the eight &amp; ninth chapters of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiell,</hi> that all there ſpoken of, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in a mentall viſion, ſo that the things were not really done indeed, In the ſecond place, it is a matter moſt euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that this Prophet was properly and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly prepared or furniſhed, againſt the Cittie of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the execution ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be diſcerned, when the Babylonians had taken and raſed the Citie of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> leading ſome remainder of the people into captiuitie.</p>
            <p>It is then beyonde reaſon, that this which was ſpoken for a certaine time and place, and for certaine perſons:
<pb facs="tcp:3426:19"/>
ſhould be turned and aſſigned elſe where, which neuer was the intention of the ſpirit of God, that then ſpake by the mouth of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiell.</hi> Moreouer it is no where to bee found, that euer the Iewes were marked with any marke in the fore-head whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and much leſſe by the croſſe, which was a thing odious and ignominious then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all nations of the world: that death beeing curſed amongſt the Iewes, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is written in <hi>Deuter.</hi> 21. verſe 23. <hi>That he was accurſed, who ſhould bee hanged on a treee,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, the true ſence of this paſſage in <hi>Ezechiell,</hi> is, that God declared, howe when this great iudgement ſhould be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on the cittie of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they onely were to bee exempted, who ſhould bee marked by the ſpirit of God. After this manner is vnderſtoode what is read in the 12. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where the deſtroying Angel paſſed through the middeſt of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſlewe all the firſt borne of the Egyptians: but hee commaunded the Iſraelites to put the blood of the vnblemiſhed Lambe for the Paſſeouer, on the poſts of their habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the end whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Angel ſhould paſſe
<pb facs="tcp:3426:19"/>
by, hee might ſee the marke of the blood, and ſo paſſe on without offending the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites. Likewiſe in the 7. of the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> is mention made of thoſe that were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, who elſewhere are called the elect of God, or thoſe whom the Lord knowes and graunts to be his, becauſe hee hath ſigned them with his ſeale, and, as the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>Written their names in the booke of life.</hi> For as ſaith S, <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. verſe 21. 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Jt is he that hath annoynted vs, ſealed vs, and hath giuen the earneſt of his holyſpirit in our hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God then declared to <hi>Ezechiell,</hi> that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed by the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians: but yet notwithſtanding, that hee would ſpare ſome ſmall number of them which feared him, and mourned for the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of their fellow Cittizens. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie ſence is that ſpoken in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> 16. verſe 2. <hi>The Angell powred foorth his vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and there f<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>liagreeuous and noyſome ſoare vppon the mer, which had the marke of the beaſt,</hi> as much to ſay, as the ſeruants of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techriſte. Such in the liuely ſence of this place, as it is moſt manifeſt to them who read it with iudgement, and without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie:
<pb facs="tcp:3426:20"/>
yet is it badly wreſted, and ſo phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically applied by theſe fellowes, who would hereon build the ſigne of the croſſe, whereof the Prophet neuer thought in all the paſſage.</p>
            <p>The ſecond foundation is a gathering of places from ſome of olde times, confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recited, and (for the moſt part) chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and altered, as it may appeare by that allcaged of Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> for Saint <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> magnifying the vertue of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſaid. <hi>Jt appeared heerem, That although the Pagans mocked at his death and paſſion: yet the ſigne of the croſſe; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation on the name of Chriſt, ſhould chaſe away deuils, and make their diuinations to ceaſe.</hi> But that which the placarde auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, neuer was ſpoken by Saint <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſus,</hi> to wit, <hi>that God made great account of this Signe, and he cauſed it to be forctold by the Prophet Ezechiell.</hi> Notwithſtanding we denie not, that to authorize the preaching of the Goſpell, reiected as then by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, who ſtretched then almoſt through the world: that God did many miracles by the name of Chirſt Ieſus crucified. And that is it which the ſame <hi>Athanaſius</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the beginning of his booke againſt
<pb facs="tcp:3426:20"/>
Idols. <hi>After the comming of the Croſſe, all adoration to Images was to be taken away, and by that marke, all deuilliſh deceites ſhould be shaſed away, and the only Chriſt worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and his Father knowns, and thoſe which blaſphemed him, dayly eonfounded.</hi> By which woordes is witneſſed the vertue of Chriſt, acknowledged in his croſſe, and not any naked ſigne: it is then Sophiſtrie to take ſeperately, that which was ſpoken ioyntlytogither. The ſecond teſtimonie is of <hi>Epipbanius,</hi> who ſpeaking of one <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> ſaith, he was made a Chriſtian in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> vncharmed from the furnace and chopping of chalke, to build a Chriſtian temple in the Cittie of <hi>Tiberias.</hi> Now we muſt not ſo ſlightly part from this teſtimonie, becauſe the placarde intends to proue hereby, and in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Joſeph:</hi> that the Chriſtians enemies haue themſelues ſubmitted to the ſigne of the croſſe. As for this <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of whome hee ſpeaketh, he was not an enemie to the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, becauſe he was a Chriſtian, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a temple vnto Chriſt: now then it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely, that whatſoeuer was done here in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt needs be for the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before named, to wit, if the charme were diſcharged by the
<pb facs="tcp:3426:21"/>
power of Chriſt Ieſus, it was then through inuocation vpon his mightie name, and not by any ſillie naked ſigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it happened by bad meanes, one charme to be expelled by a counter charme, as one venom or poyſon is expulſed by another, then God gaue effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie to error, to the end ſuch as would bee deceiued ſo, might be, through their owne wilfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>The third is of Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> in the third booke of his Dialogues, and ſeuenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, concerning a Iewe, who beeing one night in the temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> (where faith hee, many deuils held their counſell) hee made but the ſigne of the croſſe, and ſo was warranted from any harme. Hee that in one word would vnwinde himſelfe out of this place, will ſay that ſuch Dialogues are but filled with verie friuolous toyes. But we e muſt bring in a more ſound anſwere, which is, as hath been lately ſaid, that God did giue the ſtrength of errour to Sathan, whereby to deceiue men, and Sathan ſeeing himſelfe driuen from his Forte by Ieſus Chriſt: erected another Forte againſt the ſame Ieſus Chriſt, employing to ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſimplicitie of Chriſtians in thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:3426:21"/>
times, whoſe eyes he beganne in ſuch ſort to hood-winke, that they might no more clearly ſee into the pure ſeruice of God.</p>
            <p>Then afterward, when Pagan-idolatrie began to decline day by day, by the bright ſplendoure of true chriſtian doctrine, then the deuill ſteps in with idolatrie, as greate or more daungerous in the midſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie: ſo that the auncient Idols names were changed, but the things themſelues ſtill continued, and in flying before from the croſſe, hee hath done like them that draw backe, to get more ground. For if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he inuented a ſtrange kind of idolatry, it was this which he brought in about the croſſe. Sathan finding an inſtrument in Chriſts owne houſe, wherewith to chaſe the ſame Chriſt out of it, if it were poſſible for him.</p>
            <p>The fourth is of <hi>Nazeanzen,</hi> who reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſta<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Since <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtaſta</hi> and ſuch like, made the ſigue of the croſſe, &amp; therby was ſuccored, as is ſaid: it is apparant, that this proceeded not of god, but only came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sathan, who

would more &amp; more fold him into ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, as eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo appointed by the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of god.

               </hi> But in the ſame place it is likewiſe ſaide: <hi>that ſhe before prepared her ſelfe for god one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in deuoute prayer to him: to whom ſhee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed her healing, &amp; not vnto the ſigne the woman had made.</hi> For it appeareth by the demaund made, how ſhee was cured, and the aunſwere is returned by the heathen Phiſition in theſe tearmes. <hi>What a great matter hath Chriſt done, in healing a cankre, when he could raiſe vp</hi> Lazarus, <hi>who had lien dead foure daies before?</hi> It is then to God onely, and not to the ſigne of the croſſe, that this healing is to be reputed.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth is out of the expoſition of 36. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> in theſe words. <hi>In olde time of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendours were crucified, now no more is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: the croſse was in honour, and to his ende, it was at his end, inreſpect of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but now it remaineth with him in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> The aunſwere is, that hee ſpeakes not of the ſigne of the croſſe, but ſhewes how Princes and Monarches, hauing embraced Chriſt crucified, did him honor, in ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him their ſeepters &amp; crowns, which
<pb facs="tcp:3426:27"/>
they had eſpecially prepared, in honour of his croſſe and paſsion, wherof hereafter more ſhall be ſpoken.</p>
            <p>The foureteenth is taken from the third treatiſe on S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in theſe words. <hi>If we be Chriſtians, wee will haue ſome feeling of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. We will beare in our foreheads the marke of him, whereof wee will not bluſh a iote, if we beare it likewiſe in our hearts: the marke of him is the humilitie of him.</hi> With this teſtimonie wee wil ioyne, becauſe of the breuitie, al the other following, which are about ten in number, and becauſe they very necrely iumpe all with this heere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that chriſtians ſigned themſelues on the forcheads, we will then acknowledge, that in times paſt, this cuſtome of ſigneing on the forchead hath bin brought in. By whom, or how, it matters not, for in things doubtful, as this is, it is beſt to followe the rule of Saint <hi>Athanaſius. If wee bee reſolued</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>let vs make our recourſe to the Saints, that is, to the Apoſtles writings, who had more exact knowledge of Euangelicall matters, then we can haue.</hi> Beſide, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that neither Ieſus Chriſt, nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, haue made any mention at al therof:
<pb facs="tcp:3426:27"/>
if it had beene a thing, either neceſſarie or expedient, there is no doubt but they would haue done it. Wherefore wee will ſay with S. <hi>Hierome: That it is nothing elſe but prating, when the woord of God marcheth not before vs.</hi> Nor need we demaund, who hath done or ſaid this, heere or there: but what hath Chriſt Ieſus inſtituted, what hath his Apoſtles ſaide and doone? nor ought we ſo much ſeeke what is done, as what is to be done. Againe, it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that our elders ſpeaking of the death and paſſion of our redeemer, haue moſt ſpoken of his Croſſe, and of the ſigne ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of together, neuer meaning what at this day is vnderſtood by the woord ſigne: but they likewiſe called it the Standard or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of the great King and Captaine, who ouercame the deuill and hell, in bringing thence the ſpoiles, drinking of the torrent by the way, and lifting vp his head, as is ſaid in the 110. Pſalme. So did <hi>Fortunatus</hi> take it in his Himne beginning thus.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Pange lingua glorioſi</l>
               <l>Praelium certaminis,</l>
               <l>Et ſuper Crucis trophaeum,</l>
               <l>Dic triumphum nobilem.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3426:28"/>
That is to ſay.</l>
               <l>Tongue declare the combate of a glorious fight,</l>
               <l>And tell the noble tryumphes on the Croſſe.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Theodulphus:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Vexilla Regis prodeunt,</l>
               <l>Fulget Crucis miſterium.</l>
               <l>That is.</l>
               <l>The Standards of the King march foorth,</l>
               <l>Shining with the miſteries of the Croſſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>So that the Croſſe then vſed, was made in forme of a Standard or Banner. By the ſigne then, thoſe reuerend predeceſſours of ours, vnderſtood the Croſſe and paſſion it ſelfe: but ſince, ignoraunce hath deuiſed, that that ſhould be ſeperate, which ought to bee conioyned, ſetting the paſſion of Chriſt apart, and the ſigne of the Croſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, making ſmall account of the one, ſpeaking the litle of the paſſion, but enough of the ſigne: witneſſe the paſſion, death and woundes of Chriſt, which are dayly and hourely in the mouthes of blaſphemers, who thinke neuertheleſſe to be warranted from all euill, when they doe but make the ſigne of the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3426:28"/>
Thus hath bin declared, what our elders vnderſtood by the ſigne of the Croſſe, to wit: the exteriour teſtimony of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith: which euidently appeared in them, who were conuerted from dumbe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, to true ſeruice of the liuing God. This may be diſcerned more clearely, by the ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of S. <hi>Cirill,</hi> anſwerering the obiections of the Emperour <hi>Iulian,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tata,</hi> in his ſixt booke. For <hi>Iulian</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the antiquity of the Pagane religion, ſaid, that the Oracles were giuen by <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as the eſcutchions or bucklers fell from heauen, and <hi>Jupiters</hi> ſaddle, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or ſent to <hi>Numa:</hi> and made this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, that the Pagans kept the Armour which great <hi>Iupiter</hi> the Father of <hi>Mars</hi> had giuen them as a warranted gaege, that he would alwaies haue a care of the Citty of <hi>Roome.</hi> All this notwithſtanding the Chriſtians deſiſted from honouring and worſhipping theſe thinges: whereupon <hi>Iulian</hi> ſaid, that they honoured the wood of the Croſſe, and painted the Croſſe on their foreheades, and before their houſes. Whereto <hi>Cirill</hi> anſwered thus.</p>
            <p>Albeit the Lord and Sauiour of all, was not
<pb facs="tcp:3426:29"/>
in ſhewe, yet equall in all with his father, and ſeated on the throne of his diuinitie: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he was abaſed, and tooke on himſelfe the ſhape of a ſeruant, &amp; deſpiſing allignomie, bare the croſſe, to aboliſh the power of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and one onely dyed for all, to the end, that being raiſed againe from the dead, he might deliuer all mankinde from the ſnares of death, deſtroye the tyrannie of ſinne ruling in vs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the lawe, which exerciſed his tyrannie in our members, making vs ſpirituall woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, killing in vs the feelings of the fleſhe: that they might be made the ſonnes of God, which beleeued in him, and were ſanctified by his ſpirit, ſo to deſpoile Sathan of his tyrannie, the author of euils, the mort all beast, &amp; thoſe wicked powers, which our calumniator called the Prince of nations and Gods defenders. The wholſome wood made vs remember all theſe things, and aduiſed vs to thinke, that as <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith: Euen as one is dead for all, ſo ought they to knowe, that the liuing could liue no more by them ſelues, but by him who dyed and roſe againe. <hi>Which anſwer ſhewes, that the Chriſtians painted the croſſe, not as attributing any vertue to the viſible ſigne: but to let the Pagans ſee, how they (hauing</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3426:29"/>
               <hi>forſaken theyr Idolatries, wherewith they hadbin before enchaunted) imbraced Ieſus Chriſt, of whome, the croſſe which they placed before their houſes, was the true marke and publique enſigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſame <hi>Cyrill</hi> expoundeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in his third booke of adoration made in ſpirit and trueth, manifeſting the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecuers by this marke, that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receiue the croſſe, that is to ſaye, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>They</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that haue no will to receiue the Croſſe, are vanquiſhed and ouercome by the deuill, and they are ſuch as Chriſt ſpake to ſaying: Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, verily J ſay vnto you, if you will not beleeue that I am he, you ſhall dye in your ſinnes.</hi> So that to receiue the Croſſe, is nothing elſe, but to beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt. For ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Saint <hi>Cyril,</hi> ſpeaking of the comming of Chriſt, ſhewes it by theſe wordes, <hi>the comming of the Croſſe:</hi> vnderſtanding by the word Croſſe, all that which the ſonne of God did and ſuffered in the worlde for our ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus breefely touched, may ſuffice to anſwer the allegations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the firſt placard. Come we now
<pb facs="tcp:3426:30"/>
to the ſecond, which is entituled: <hi>How the Croſſe ought to be honoured:</hi> which likewiſe at this preſent wee muſt conſider on.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt of al, it is a matter moſt manifeſt, that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Croſſe, was not onely one of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elleſt: but likewiſe the moſt ignominious of all them which was practiſed by any nation. For it was called a death moſt infamous and accurſed, and for this reaſon, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was put to the Croſſe, that he being made accurſed, we might bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the curſſe of the law. Yet for all this, it was not without great reaſon, that himſelfe, ſpeaking of this kinde of death, calleth it <hi>his exaltation.</hi> Iohn 8. verſe 28. and 12. ver. 32. for his Croſſe is the great victory, the trophee and glory which hee obtained againſt Sathan, &amp; againſt death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3426:31"/>
See now, why we can neuer ſufficiently honor the croſſe, death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For it is the meanes, whereby the Sonne of God <hi>drawes all men to him,</hi> as himſelfe ſaith in Saint Iohn 12. verſe 32. But the manner how to honor it, ought likwiſe to be learned from our Lord and maiſter himſelfe.</p>
            <p>He plainly expreſſed it, when he taught vs, <hi>that whoſoeuer would be his diſciple, ought to take vp his croſse &amp; follow him:</hi> for by this means being conformed to his ſufferings, we ſhall likewiſe be ſemblable to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. When he inſtituted his holye Supper, ſaying: <hi>Doe theſe things in remembrance of me, how often ſo euer you doo them, you ſhall ſhew the death of the Lorde, euen vntill his comming.</hi> This S. Paule ſawe, when hee writ to <hi>Timothe,</hi> his 2. Epiſtle. Chapter 2. ver. 8. 12. <hi>Remember that Ieſus Chriſt was raiſed from the dead: And that if wee dye with him, we ſhall liue with him, if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall reigne with him.</hi> So that the Sonne of God is highly honored, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is acknowledged to be the ſole Sauiour and redeemer of men loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> and who beeing ſinners, and deſtitute of the
<pb facs="tcp:3426:31"/>
glory of God, are reconciled in him, and reeſtabliſhed in farre greater glory, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they had or could haue before. But on the contrary part, the great glory of Gods elect ſhineth, in this, that as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, 3. ver. 16. <hi>So God loued vs, that he gaue his onely Sonne for vs, to the end, that whoſoeuer beleeued in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould not periſh, but haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life.</hi> And the ſame S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, in his firſt Epiſtle 3. ver. 1. <hi>Beholde this loue hath the Father beſtowed on vs, that we are called the Sonnes of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that each of vs may ſay this of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the life which I haue at this preſent, is by the faith I haue in the Sonne of God, that he hath loued me, and gaue himſelfe for me: adding withall, that by the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings which my Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath endured, all miſery and afflictions which can happen to mee, are ſanctified. For whereas in their owne nature, they were puniſhments: by the death of Ieſus Chriſt, they are become viſitations and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Gods fauour, that hee looueth and enſtructeth ſuch as he correcteth. We likewiſe honour the Croſſe in this, <hi>that we are crucified to the world, and the world to</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3426:32"/>
               <hi>vs, ſo that dying with Chriſt Ieſus, we are rayſed vp againe with him,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paule,</hi> Rom. 6. ver. 8. <hi>For he hath giuen vs an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to follow his ſteps, that being dead to ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we might liue againe to righteouſnes, being healed by his wounds,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. v. 21 &amp; 24. And again. <hi>The grace of God, that bringeth ſaluation vnto all men hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. And teacheth vs, that we ſhould deny all vngodlynes and worldly luſtes: and that we ſhould liue ſoberly and righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent world. Looking for the bleſsed hope, and appearing of the glory of the mighty God, and of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Titus</hi> 2. ver. 11. 12. 13.</p>
            <p>Beholde heere the true manner, how to honor the croſſe and death of Ieſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtles S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and S. <hi>Paule</hi> hath raught vs in their writinges, &amp; which themſelues practiſed, when they were in this world, &amp; ſuch hath bin the reuerence, which the Primatiue Church made to the croſſe. For thoſe ſigns which were made at the beginning, were nothing but with the moouing of the hand, applyed to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or caſt vp into the ayre, hauing no ſubſiſtance in bodily matter of wood,
<pb facs="tcp:3426:32"/>
ſtone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſiluer, golde or other ſuch like.</p>
            <p>The firſt that made any of ſome matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who hauing obtained a notable victory againſt <hi>Maxentius,</hi> made his Enſigne in forme of the croſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enriched with golde and precious ſtones. Yet was it not after the faſhion of the Croſſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued now-adaies, for the Hiſtorians haue thus deſcribed it.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>At the end of a high ſtaffe, the Greeke letter P, was repreſented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; vnder it the let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter X, which are the two firſt letters of chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes name in Greeke. Soone after, a ſayle was hanged ouerth wart this ſtaffe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:3426:33"/>
any figure in the ſaile, and was in all reſpects as is here ſet downe.</p>
            <p>And becauſe hee was newely exalted to the imperiall dignitie, by the conſent of his warriours, who preferred him after the declining of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> his predeceſſour: hee conſidered, that the meanes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him in this dignitie, againſt all competitours and contenders, was to make himſelfe a friend: with thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which <hi>Diocleſian</hi> had perſecuted euen to his vttermoſt.</p>
            <p>And for this cauſe hee made the croſſe to be erected, before himſelfe became a Chriſtian: for hee was not Baptiſed, till the ſeuenth yeere of his Empire, and the victory before named, hapned in the firſt yeere. Now becauſe the Chriſtian hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſpeake of an apparition of the Croſſe in the ayre, with theſe words. <hi>Thou ſhalt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come by this:</hi> it is ſo, that <hi>Zoſimus</hi> a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane hiſtorian, who liued at that time there, and was a moſt exact ſearcher after the deedes of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> hath made no mention at all thereof. Alſo it appeareth, that the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtories ſpeake di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly thereof. For <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, that this
<pb facs="tcp:3426:33"/>
viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chanced at noone time of the day: &amp; <hi>Sozomenus</hi> writes, that it appeared in the night to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſleeping. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, God might permit this miracle, as a helpe to the conuerſion of this Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as then a Pagane, and that it might ſerue afterwardes for the further auaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtes glory, whatſoeuer affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion himſelfe ſhould beare therto: for ſome Authors haue noted great defectes and faultes in him. He then made the enſignes and Armes of his ſouldiers to bee marked with the Croſſe, he cauſed it to be ſet vp in publique places: as is to be read, that hee made to bee erected his owne ſtatue in braſſe at <hi>Roome,</hi> holding a Croſſe of the ſame mettal in his hand. Notwithſtanding, he neuer appointed it in any Temple, but in a publique place, for then the Romaine Temples had as yet the Paganes Idols in them.</p>
            <p>But afterward, when it was ſaid, that the true Croſſe indeed was found by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,</hi> mother to <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> then a great number of Croſſes were erected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor ſhall we need in this ſearch to enter ſo far, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this were a contriued inuention, or a
<pb facs="tcp:3426:34"/>

            <p>For if we ſhall credite ſome hiſtorians, <hi>Helena</hi> was yet at that time an Infidell, and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelfe not become a firme Chriſtian, not hauing then done any thing in <hi>Siria.</hi> And ſome ſay, that it was not found in the time of great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> but in his Sonne <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time: heereto may we adde <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who writ the life of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and ſpeakes of all which <hi>Helena</hi> did in <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> yet ſpeakes not one word of this inuention of the Croſſe. Neyther doth Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> agree heerein with other writers, for hee faith, this Croſſe was knowen by the tytle thereon: and others ſay, that it was by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous healing of a woman, which the very touching of this Croſſe brought to perfect health againe. But howſoever it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no man (I thinke) but will
<pb facs="tcp:3426:34"/>
holde for fabulous, when hee reades, that <hi>Adam</hi> being ſicke, ſent his Sonne <hi>Seth</hi> to the gate of Paradiſe, to haue ſome of the oyle of mercy, wherewith hee might be annoynted and healed: and how the Angell gaue him a bough of the tree, whereof <hi>Adam</hi> had before eaten the fruite, and ſo tranſgreſſed Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But being returned, he found his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead, and therefore planted this bough on <hi>Adams</hi> graue, which afterward grew to a goodly tree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that when <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> cauſed the temple to be built, he made the tree to be cut downe, but it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be made to ſerue to any vſe, wherefore it was reiected, and made a Bridge of, ouer a certaine Lake. When the Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> came to ſee <hi>Salomon:</hi> ſhee would not goe ouer the Bridge, became ſhee had been before aduertiſed in a viſion, that on that wood ſhould one bee hanged, who ſhould deſtroy the Kingdome of the Iewes.</p>
            <p>Which when <hi>Salomon</hi> heard of, hee cauſed it to be buried very deepe in the earth, in the place where a Poole was afterwarde made, which Poole
<pb facs="tcp:3426:35"/>
had the vertue of healing ſickeneſſe, by reaſon of the wood, for it came foorth of the earth, and floated aboue vpon the water, at the houre when Ieſus Chriſt, was to bee crucified, and therefore the Iewes made the croſſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Beholde what hath beene inuented and preached to poore people: onely to make the croſſe bee honoured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is to be read in the 21. Sermon, of the booke called, The Sermons of the Diſciple.</p>
            <p>But let ſuch conſider, that the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians vſing of the croſſe, in whatſoeuer matters by them mannaged: was but the ſimple practiſe of Saint <hi>Paules</hi> meaning, when he ſaid: <hi>J am not aſhamed of the Goſpell of Chriſt.</hi> For becauſe euery one, as well Iewes as Paganes, mocked at Chriſt, and his Croſſe was become a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to ſome, and folly to others: the more they ſtroue to defame it, the more the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians endeuoured to adorne it. Heereup on, they oppoſed the Croſſe to all thinges, and in all places, as a moſte honourable marke whereby they ſufficiently declared, that they would haue part of Chriſtes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probry, to the ende hee might impart to
<pb facs="tcp:3426:35"/>
them ſome of his glory. And therefore ſaid <hi>Chriſoſtome.

And <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> in the third booke of his hiſtorie, chap. 27. writeth, <hi>That by all, the croſſe ſhould bee borne, to teſtifie the triumph of Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>But all this while, they attributed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the croſſe onely, or the bare fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure therof: for <hi>Conſtantine</hi> gaue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, that the victoric which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb facs="tcp:3426:36"/>
to him, was through Chriſt, and not the croſſe, and ſo he cauſed to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the croſſes by him erected, theſe three words: <hi>Ieſus Chriſt ouercame,</hi> &amp; (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner) made his prayers of the croſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Helena</hi> likewiſe worſhipped the king, and not the croſſe: <hi>For elſe it had bin a Pagan errour, &amp; vilde vanitie,</hi> faith Saint <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this forte may chriſtians honour the croſſe: for who makes any queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in our wars againſt the Iews or <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> we may beare our Enſignes orarmes croſſed, for publicke teſtifying to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, that wee are Chriſtians, and our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries are miſcreants andvoyd of faith. So may the croſſe be engraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on money to ſhew, that it is the coyne or ſtampe of a chriſtian Prince. So may the croſſe be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the gates of Citties, Caſtles, or hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to deliuer apparantly, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in ſuch places, do make profeſsion of chriſtianitie. So was it long ſince ordained, that the inſtruments of contractes or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining, made by publike notaries, ſhould be ſealed and ſigned with the croſse, as it is read in lib. <hi>de Cod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3426:36"/>
And in ſuch like polliticke conſiderations, we reiect not the vſe of the material croſſe. As <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in the very ſame reſpect, forbad to puniſh malefactours any more with the death of the croſſe: <hi>To the ende</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 36. Treatiſe on Saint <hi>Iohn) They ſhould not be honoured by ſuch a puniſhment.</hi> For the ſame reaſon, was it forbidden by the Emperor <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuts,</hi> to engraue the croſſe in earth: and a paine decreed, againſt all ſuch as deſpiſed or caſt the croſſe at their heeles.</p>
            <p>Now withall is to be remembred, that then the croſſe was but two peeces of woode thwarte one another, hauing no ſhape of a crucifixe, much leſſe of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> as ſince then, in diuers croſſes the image of the crucifixe is on one ſide, and that of the mother on the other, as if ſhe had borne companie with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in his ſufferings, and ſhe in ſome ſort had wrought the redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
            <p>Then they had not read the goodly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, betweene the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> and the <hi>Jacobines,</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22. of that name: the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> maintaining,
<pb facs="tcp:3426:37"/>
that the crucifixe ought to be naked, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a crowne of thornes: the <hi>Jacobines</hi> iuſtified, that hee was to weare a crowne on his head, and a royall robe with all. As for the honour done by ſome in this caſe, they of olde crowned him ſimplye with flowers, but it was for ſpeciall inſtruction to the beholders; for thus they intended, that whoſoeuer would haue the crowne, and pertake in the reward: he muſt firſt of all beare his croſſe, for ſo hath the Poet <hi>Prudentius</hi> written.
<q>
                  <l>To beare the croſse muſt be thy paine,</l>
                  <l>If thou deſire the crowne to gaine.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But in the end, theſe matters grew ſo for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward, that the croſſe was broght into the temples, and ſaluted in theſe woordes, <hi>O Crux, aue, Al haile, O croſſe,</hi> which are but fond ſpeeches. Then inuocation was made to it, ſaying.

            <p>For to Ieſus Chriſt onely ſhuld ſuch a prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be made, <hi>It is Ieſus Chriſt who is the ſon, he ought to be kiſſed,</hi> and not the croſſe of wood. So that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> albeit wee may honour one another ciuilly, following no more then is commaunded, the inferiour to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor their ſuperiours: yet when queſtion is made, of religious or deuoute honor, they are matters not according, to giue all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to one onely God and his ſonne, and yet to diuide a portion thereof to any man, or a materiall croſſe, or any creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet are not theſe queſtionaries them ſelues fully agreed hereabout: for one hath demaunded, with what kinde of honour it is to be worſhiped.</p>
            <p>Some ſay, that the verie croſſe, which touched the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, oght to be honored with <hi>Latria,</hi> ſeruice: or by the means of <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> humble dutie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beleue, that it ſhuld be ſerucd with the honour of <hi>Dulia,</hi> bond-ſeruice: as much to ſay, that the true croſſe ought to bee reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced with the honour due to Chriſt:
<pb facs="tcp:3426:38"/>
and other Croſſes ſhould bee reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with ſuch honour, as ſeruants owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their maiſters. And this is the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſecond placarde, which like wiſe it becomes vs to conſider of, and briefly ſearch into the bottome of it.</p>
            <p>There are diuers places of our elders al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, but without ſence, and quite from the Authors meaning that writ them. For when they of olde time ſpeake of the croſſe, they did not vnderſtand thereby two pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of wood th wart one another: but the miſterie of our redemption: the true ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie &amp; accompliſhment wherof, was by the croſse, death and paſsion of Ieſus Chriſt. And this equiuocall or double ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the croſse, beeing not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by theſe Sophiſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to erre, and they cauſe other to do the like. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it was that <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The croſse is the cauſe of al our bleſsedneſse, it is the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hope, reſurection of the dead, and a guid to the blinde,</hi> &amp;c. And as for the materiall croſse, behold what one hath written ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <hi>We honour not, neither deſire to haue ſuch a croſse,</hi> as the expreſſe wordes are to bee read in the 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> booke of <hi>Arnobius,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:3426:38"/>
to the Pagans obiections, which bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the chriſtians, as if they had honoured the croſſe of wood. For the ſame reaſon, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> ſaith in his 16. queſtion, thoſe which he writ vnto <hi>Antiochus. That the Chriſtians declared, how they honoured not the croſſe, when they laid togither two peeces in ſuch ſort: they acknowledged it to bee no more then wood, and woulde not proſtrate themſelues before it, as now they do, ſetting vp croſſes onely to be honored.</hi> And heerevppon ſaith <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that paſsing by a village named <hi>Anablaiha,</hi> and entring into a Temple, where hung a painted cloath, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an image thereon of Ieſus Chriſt, or ſome other Sainte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee rent the cloath in peeces, becauſe they kept it there contrary to the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is at large to be read, in his Epiſtle tranſlated by Saint <hi>Hierome.</hi> Wherevpon the ſame Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>that no other image of God is to be honoured, but that which is God, &amp; with God;</hi> as much to ſay, as the ſonne of GOD, <hi>Which is the engrauen forme of the eſſence of God,</hi> Hebr. 1. verſe 3. and in this ſence we holde with the teſtimonies alleaged in the placard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3426:39"/>
But becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines not it ſelfe within theſe limits, but aymeth at a materiall croſſe: it is apparant, that it maintaineth vnſufferable idolatrie. And to the end it may appeare, that wee wrong them not in ſaying ſo: marke heere the verie words they vſe, when they hallow the wood of the croſſe.</p>

Nor is it onely called the adorned croſſe, but likewiſe the adored croſſe: as on the holy Friday it is termed worſhipped, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the adoration of the croſſe as that day there.

            <p>Let then theſe Sophiſters bite their nailes as long as they pleaſe, to ouerthrowe this ſhamefull taxation: yet ſhall they neuer make of wood, more then wood. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bleſſe themſelues with this
<pb facs="tcp:3426:41"/>
wood, bowing downe their heades before it, and calling it the health &amp; remedie for mankinde: wee ſay, that they are more blockiſh then wood, if they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the great fault they commit, in honouring the wood, in ſtead of applying ſuch dutie to him, who bare our ſinnes in his bodie on the croſſe of wood.</p>
            <p>We are not likewiſe ignorant of their goodly verſes, <hi>Effigiem Chriſt:</hi> &amp;c.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we ſay, it is alſo a drugge anſwerable to that which we call to bring one a ſleepe. For certainly, this is to make the ignorant ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie: wheras ſuch as receiue inſtruction out of Gods ſchoole, do hold, that ſeeing god in no caſe will be honoured by images, it is a matter altogither intollerable, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould haue any images to worſhip. For I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie is committed when we honour I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doles, or honour God otherwiſe then hee would be honoured: as appeareth by the Prophets ſpeeches of them that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in high places. They are reprooued not for that they worſhipped God: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they worſhipped him otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee had allowed in his ordenance. For hee woulde haue but one place onely, to
<pb facs="tcp:3426:42"/>
wit, the temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where hee would be ſerued, and they honoured him in woods and on mountaines. This is the reaſon why the Samaritaines, who called themſelues the children of <hi>Iacob,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued, becauſe they worſhipped in the mount <hi>Gartzin,</hi> albeit they yet prepared themſelues to God.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon, in the <hi>Elibertine</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, held in the time of the firſt Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> the 36. Canon, were ſet downe theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is ordained, that in the Church ſhall bee no kinde of paintings, to the ende, that that which is honoured and worſhipped, ſhould not be figured in any reſemblance.</hi> Their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere hereto is friuolous, for they ſay. <hi>They worſhip them not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they put no truſt in them.</hi> To worſhip, is to encline ones ſelfe thereto, to make ſignes of humiliation, and bowing the knees: as may be ſeene by the ſcriptures manner of ſpeaking, which by bowing of the knee, noteth idolatrie, as appeares by the anſwere made to <hi>Elias,</hi> 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 19. verſe 18. Where the true ſeruants of God oppoſed to idolatours, are marked out by this: <hi>That haue not bowed their knees</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3426:42"/>
               <hi>before Baal, nor kiſſed him with their mouths.</hi> Theſe kinde of words vſeth the ſcripture, for deſcribing of idolatours: that they bend themſelues, burne incenſe and kiſſe the hand or the lippes, all which the church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth to images, reliques, &amp; croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: the concluſion then is manifeſt, they are idolatours, becauſe they do the deeds of idolatours.</p>
            <p>But that which is alleadged out of the 21. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> maye not bee let paſſe lightly: for if there be an example, which formally and firmly plucketh downe the abuſe committed about the croſſe, it is that of the brazen Serpent. <hi>That was made by Gods commandement, therefore it was no Jdol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, albeit that by the lawe general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God forbad to make the image of any thing in heauen, the earth, or waters vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth: ſo it is, that not being bound to his law (becauſe he is aboue it) it pleaſed him to diſpence therwith, euen as himſelfe diſpenſed with the law, &amp; gaue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make this ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the figure of the exaltation of Ieſus Chriſt, lifted upon the croſſe, as himſelf witneſſeth in the third of
<pb facs="tcp:3426:43"/>
               <hi>John,</hi> verſe 14. Not that it was eleuated on wood made croſſe-wiſe, as they vſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to picture it, (for it was lifted vp on a ſtandard or poſte, as the text ſaith) but becauſe it was to bee lifted vp, and they which by Gods commaundement looked thereon, ſhould be healed: Now let vs ſee what enſues heereon. From that inſtant, till the time of the good king <hi>Ezechias,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſpace of ſeuen hundreth thirtie &amp; fiue yeares, there was no ſpeech at all of this brazen Serpent. It happening then, the people making obeyſance therto, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping it, becauſe it had been made by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and was ſo kept for the ſpace of 735. yeares; <hi>Ezechias</hi> brake it, and cauſed it to be burned. From hence we gather, if images in generall, and eſpecially that of the croſſe, were neuer made by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, but by the diffidence and preſumption of men (who thought God did neither ſee nor heare them, except they had ſuch images before their eyes) eſpeciallye ſuch as haue beene brought in wee knowe not ſince when: howe farre off ought they to bee from vs? When it ſhall come to this point, that they
<pb facs="tcp:3426:43"/>
were not begun to any ſuch purpoſe: it is then euident, that they ought to be taken away, as <hi>Ezechias</hi> did the Serpent, becauſe at firſt it was not framed to bee worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
            <p>And becauſe of the abuſe which hath riſen heereabout, it were very neceſſary to be generally abandoned. For Idolatry is no part of thoſe things, whereof one will ſay: <hi>Correct the abuſe, yet holde the vſe:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in whatſoeuer ſort the I doll is taken, yet it is as nothing.</p>
            <p>And when queſtion is made, for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſuch diſorders, wee ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſaying of Ieſus Chriſt, in <hi>Math.</hi> 19 verſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. <hi>Jt was not ſo from the beginning.</hi> If then at the beginning, when the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church was pure, and truth ſincere, the ſigne or forme of the Croſſe was not made, it was no where appointed, ſaluted nor worſhipped: it was very ill done, to bring in this corruption, (which can no way well be called a cuſtome,) and much worſſe is it to retaine it ſtill.</p>
            <p>There remaines one teſtimony, out of the firſt book of <hi>Sozomenus,</hi> Chap. 4. where it is ſaid: <hi>That the ſouldiers of</hi> Conſtiantne,
<pb facs="tcp:3426:44"/>
               <hi>did highly honor his Standard, made in forme of the Croſſe, and that many miracles were done among them:</hi> which being conſeſſed, concludeth not, that therefore wee ought to honour the material Croſſe. For ſay that they did honour it, or did ſuch things as ought not to be done: it is reſoluedly to be held, that in ſuch actions they are not to be imitated. Conſidering the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerues to the contrary, to wit: if the Croſſe ought to be honored, becauſe it did a miracle: It followes then, that the Croſſe which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did miracle, ought not to be honoured. Now it is moſt certaine, that of an hundred thouſand croſſes, 3. cannot be found that did any miracle: no though wee ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge their own accounts, &amp; the effectes ſhewed by them, with the hiſtories which theſe exorciſtes doe confirme. Witnes the example, of that ſo holy &amp; renowned doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <hi>Picard,</hi> &amp; other <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> who in the yeere 1552. could not by their exorciſmes, Croſſe &amp; holy water, chaſe a ſpirit out of a maidens body in <hi>Paris.</hi> No more could the Munke of St. <hi>Benet,</hi> brought to <hi>Roome</hi> by the Cardinall <hi>Gondy,</hi> in the yeere 1554. driue forth the cuill ſpirits cut of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb facs="tcp:3426:44"/>
of 82. maidens, notwithſtanding all his coniurations, for the ſpace of ſixe monethes together, as <hi>Bodinus</hi> ſaith in in the 3. booke, Chap. 6, of his Demono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, So then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all thoſe Croſſes of <hi>Roome</hi> (which ſurpaſſe other in holineſſe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous vertue, by reaſon of the ſanctity which is there obtained) hauing no more power then thoſe of the Munkes: haue little duety to be honoured, for the cauſe being taken away, there remaines no more of the effect.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, becauſe it ſeemes, that wee would haue no Images of the crucifixe, nor the Croſſ: we declare, that we deſire all our dayes, Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before oureyes, in the ſame manner as S. <hi>Paule,</hi> Gal. 3. ver. 1. painted Ieſus Chriſt before their eyes: for the penſill wherwith God ought to be pai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>red, is his word, which himſelf calleth the <hi>word of truth,</hi> where co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, all the doctrine of Images, is but the doctrine of lying and vanity. So then, the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt is as the chaire, wherout we purpoſe to preach on the one ſide, the multitude and ennormity of our ſinnes, on the other, the ſeuerity of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:3426:45"/>
iuſtice and depth of his mercy. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes is ſhewen vs, in that they could not be borne nor aboliſhed by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then he who was very God and very man. His iuſtice, in that God, who hateth iniquity, did puniſh it with all extreamity. His mercy, in that himſelfe gaue vs the price to acquit vs withall, euen vs that were his vtter enemies: for this is to vs a moſt certaine gaege, of the merciful affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our God, diſcerned thorow the woundes of his onely Sonne. And the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemplating of thoſe wounds, is the balme to heale the hurts of our ſoules. His feete and handes were pierced, his ſide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and thence iſſued the price of our redemption, as alſo the waſhing away of our filthyneſſe: bloud (I ſay) and water al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſtreaming, to deface our ſinnes paſt, preſent, and to come, to the ende, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our harts waſhed from an euil conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wee ſhould goe by the freſh and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pathes, towardesour God with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of faith, and keep ing the confeſſion of our hope. Heb. 10. ver. 22. 23. that is to ſay, in following after Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Which is nothing elſe,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Carill, but renouncing
<pb facs="tcp:3426:45"/>
the world for the loue of Chriſt, &amp; preferring the goodes which we hope for by faith, before all other in this bodily life.</hi> In like manner, ſaith S. <hi>Bernard. The ioyfull hope and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, is that which is affirmed by applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the death and paſſion of Chriſt.</hi> For ſince the Father hath giuen vs his Sonne: <hi>how ſhall he not with him giue vs all thinges alſo?</hi> Rom. 8. ver. 32. <hi>And bee is giu en vs of the Father, to be our iuſtice, wiſedome, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and ſanctification.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 1. v. 30. It is Ieſus that iuſtifies the faulty, it is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus that paies for the indepted, that ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the weake, illuminates the blinde, bindes vp the hurtes of the wounded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calles home by-wanderers, giues life to the dead: &amp; in a word, it is Ieſus that deſtroies the workes of the deuill, &amp; beateth downe Sathan vnder our feete.</p>
            <p>Such is the memory which wee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually obſerue, of the perfect obedience, which the Sonne of GOD deliuered vpon the Croſſe, to God his Father for vs poore miſerable wretches: and not the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and I dolatrous deuotion, which the ignoraunt ſo gladly would make vs beleeue, that they honour the death and
