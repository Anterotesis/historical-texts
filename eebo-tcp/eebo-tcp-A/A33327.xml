            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Normans</hi> issued out of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</note> and <hi>Norway,</hi> the Inhabitants of which Countries in those times were so fruitful in the Procreation of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they were forced oft-times to send multitudes abroad to seek new habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Amongst whom there was one <note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Rolls.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Roul,</hi> a great Commander, attended with many lusty lads, who in the dayes of King <hi>Alfrid,</hi> first landed in <hi>England;</hi> where finding no room empty, nor any imployment, was content (upon some relief received) to seek im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment else-where; which he did against <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balt</hi> Duke of <hi>Frize,</hi> and <hi>Reiver</hi> Duke of <hi>Chaumont,</hi> and <hi>Henalt,</hi> with whom he often encountred, and made great spoiles in their Countries. Then pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing along the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> he entred the mouth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56383:3"/>
of the River <hi>Seine,</hi> and sackt all the Country up to <hi>Roan:</hi> where the People having been a little before miserably spoiled by an other Invader, were so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the coming of these new Forces, that the Archbishop of <hi>Roan,</hi> by the peoples consent, offered him the obedience of that City and Country upon condition that he would protect them, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them according to the Laws of Christ, and the customes of their Countrey. For <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Simple,</hi> the present King of <hi>France,</hi> being otherwise em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled about the right of his Crown, neglected to defend them: So that <hi>Roul</hi> shortly after attempted the Conquest of <hi>Paris</hi> itself, and therein gave some notable overthrowes to some of the <hi>French</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders: So that King <hi>Charles</hi> was forced to buy his Peace by entering into alliance with, and giving over to <hi>Roul,</hi> his right to <hi>Normandy,</hi> (formerly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Nuestria</hi>). And hereupon <hi>Roul</hi> turned Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and was baptized by the name of <hi>Robert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he came to his Estate, which he governed with such Judgment and equity, that he left his Name honourable, and his successours a firme foundation to build upon. From him in a direct line descended six Dukes of <hi>Normandy</hi> that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Dukedome, the last of which, was also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Robert,</hi> who (out of blind devotion) resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to visit Christ's Sepulchre, acquainted his Nobles therewith: They disswaded him all they could, because he had no issue, and <hi>Allaire</hi> Earl of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Burgundy</hi> were already contending which of them should succeed him, whereby their Country was like to become a Prey to the Souldiers, from which he in conscience was bound to secure it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56383:3"/>The Duke told them, that he had a little Bastard,<note place="margin">His Birth and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage.</note> of whom he had great hopes, whom he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest with that Dutchy as his Heir, and therefore he prayed them thenceforth to take him for their Lord. And (said he) <hi>To shew my trust in him, I will make the Earl of</hi> Britaine <hi>his Governour, and Seneschal of</hi> Normandy; <hi>and the King of</hi> France <hi>shall be his Guardian, and so I will leave him to God and your Loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after the Bishops and Barons did their homage to this base Son, named <hi>William,</hi> whom<note place="margin">He is made Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi>
               </note> his Father begat on one <hi>Arlet,</hi> a mean woman of <hi>Falaise.</hi> And Duke <hi>Robert</hi> delivered the Child with his own hand to <hi>Henry</hi> first King of <hi>France,</hi> whom he had greatly assisted in keeping his Crown against an other Competitor: and therefore he might the more presume (if good-turns done to Princes could weigh down self-respects) to have<note place="margin">and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to the <hi>French</hi> King.</note> found a faithful discharge of his trust. He caused also young <hi>William</hi> to doe his homage for the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy</hi> to the King, and so commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to his Royal Faith: and going his joruney, he dyed in <hi>Asia, William</hi> being then but nine years old.</p>
            <p>Soon after the news of his Father's death, the Nobles of <hi>Normandy,</hi> by much intreaty gat him out<note place="margin">He comes into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</hi>
               </note> of the <hi>French</hi> King's hand, knowing that they having him amongst them, would countenance his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers, and such as were in Office. But they soon found that his Person without power did but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease<note place="margin">His trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles by Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors.</note> their discord, and factions. For presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his right was questioned by Competitors And first <hi>Robert de Tresny,</hi> an experienced Souldier,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56383:4"/>
bringing a fair line from <hi>Roul,</hi> intertained, and feasted the chiefest men amongst them, urging to them what a wrong it was to him, that a Bastard, and a Child should be preferred before him in the Dutchy, which his Ancestors had gotten by their Valour, and what a shame it was for the <hi>Normans</hi> to be governed by such an one. And when words prevailed not, he brought it to the tryal of the Sword in a great Battel, in which (by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Roger de Beaumont</hi>) he was defeated and himself and his two Brethren slain.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the King of <hi>France,</hi> (violating the trust that was reposed in him) assisted in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">The King of <hi>France</hi> against<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him.</note> 
               <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Arques,</hi> another pretender to the Dutchy, descended also from <hi>Roul,</hi> and brought to his aid a mighty Army, yet Count <hi>Guifford,</hi> Duke <hi>William's</hi> General, by a stratagem training the <hi>French</hi> into an Ambush, overthrew them, and caused the King to return to <hi>Paris</hi> with great loss and dishonour, and forced <hi>Arques</hi> to seek relief from the Earl of <hi>Bologne,</hi> where yet he found little favour, few regarding men that are overthrown, and low.</p>
            <p>This storm past, a worse succeeds. There lived<note place="margin">New troubles.</note> with Duke <hi>William,</hi> a young Lord of the like years, called <hi>Guy,</hi> descended also from <hi>Roul,</hi> who, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be sensible of his Interest, was advised by some stirring spirits to put in for the Dutchy, which (they said) was his right, and but usurped by the Bastard. And to promote his affairs there fell out a deadly feud between two of the greatest Lords, Vicount <hi>Neel,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Bessin,</hi> whose quarrel Duke <hi>William</hi> either did not, or could
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56383:4"/>
not pacifie, whereupon this <hi>Guy,</hi> who was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made Earl of <hi>Briorn</hi> and <hi>Vernon,</hi> interposed to end this discord; and by the advice of <hi>Grimolt de Plessis,</hi> brought it to pass that both these great men turned the point of their malice against Duke <hi>William,</hi> for not ending the difference, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conspired with <hi>Guy</hi> to murther him at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares; which also they had effected, had not a Fool, whom they suspected not, noting their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, got away in the night to <hi>Valogne,</hi> knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and crying at the Gates, till he was admitted to the Dukes presence (who was now about seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen<note place="margin">Treason against<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him.</note> years old) whom he willed presently to flee or he would be murthered.</p>
            <p>The Duke seeing the Fool so affrighted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns not the information, but presently takes Horse, and all alone posts towards <hi>Falaise,</hi> his strongest place. By the way his Horse was tired, and at break a day coming to a Village called <hi>Rie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A special<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> it fell out that a Gentlemen was standing at his door, ready to ride abroad: of him the Duke enquired the next way to <hi>Falaise;</hi> the Gentleman knowing him humbly craved the cause of his so strange and untimely riding alone? The Duke told it him, and this Gentleman, called <hi>Robert de Rie,</hi> lent him a fresh Horse, and sent his two sons with him to conduct him the next way to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No sooner were they got out of sight, but the Conspirators came posting after, and enqured of the same Gentleman whether he saw the Duke: He answered, that he was gone a little before such away (shewing them another path) and offering
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56383:5"/>
his service to Count <hi>Bessin,</hi> rode on with them, but led them so about, that the Duke had gotten into <hi>Falaise,</hi> whereupon, being disappointed, they returned to their homes; so strengthening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that the Duke thought fit to retreat into <hi>Roan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He retires to the <hi>French</hi> King.</note> and from thence to the King of <hi>France</hi> to crave his aid, putting him in mind what faithfull service his Father had done for him: That he was his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mager; under his Protection; and that he had no other sanctuary to flee unto for succour against his mutinous and unruly Nobility. And he was so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate that the King aided him in Person with a Royal Army against his Competitors, whom they met in the Vale of <hi>Dunes,</hi> as ready to resist them, with as great a power and resolution, as the other were to assault them.</p>
            <p>The Battel was very fierce and bloody, wherein<note place="margin">His Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Victory.</note> the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Duke <hi>William</hi> bestirred themselves lustily; yet had not <hi>Ralfe de Tesson</hi> been false to his fellows, to recover the favour of the Duke, they had hardly carried the victory. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, diverse of the Conspirators (who had too great hearts to submit) passed over the <hi>Alps</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> where they grew very famous for their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. But here ended not the Dukes troubles. For <hi>Guy de Burgagne</hi> escaping by flight, fortified the Castles of <hi>Briorne</hi> and <hi>Verneil;</hi> yet in the end was forced to submit both them, and himself to the Dukes mercy, and now became his Pensioner, who<note place="margin">His meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> before was his Competitor. This gentle act of the Dukes brought in many others to yield up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and had their Signiories redelivered to them, but their Castles were demolished.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56383:5"/>Shortly after, our Duke was called into action<note place="margin">His new troubles.</note> again, by <hi>Geffry Martel</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who usurped <hi>Alanson, Damfront</hi> and <hi>Passais,</hi> members of the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to recover which, the Duke raised an Army, and first got <hi>Alanson,</hi> where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was opprobriously scorned by them, and called the son of an Harlot, he used extream cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Then laid he siege to <hi>Damfront,</hi> to relieve which, Count <hi>Martel</hi> came with a great Army; and our Duke to discover his strength, sent <hi>Roger de Montgomery,</hi> and two other Knights to deliver this message to the Earl, <hi>That if he came to victual</hi>
               <note place="margin">He reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his Towns.</note> Damfront, <hi>he should there find him the Porter to keep him out.</hi> Whereunto the Earl answered: <hi>Tell your Duke that to morrow at break a day he shall have me there on a white Horse ready to give him the Combate, and I will enter</hi> Damfront, <hi>if I can: And that he may know me I will wear a shield</hi> d'Or, <hi>without any devise.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Roger</hi> replyed, <hi>Sir, You shall not need to take that paines: for to morrow morning you shall have the Duke in this place, mounted on a bay Horse: and that you may know him he shall wear upon the point of his Launce a Streamer of Taffaty to wipe your face.</hi> So returning, each side prepared for the morning. But the Earl, busied in ordering his Battels, was informed by two Horsmen, that came crossing the field, that <hi>Damfront</hi> was for certain surrendred to the Duke, whereupon in a great rage, he presently departed with his Army: part whereof, as they passed a streight, were cut off by Vicount <hi>Neel,</hi> who by that service redeemed his former offence, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56383:6"/>
to the Dukes favour, whom ever after he served faithfully.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Damfront</hi> the Duke with his Engines<note place="margin">His Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> removed to <hi>Hambrieres,</hi> a Frontier Town of Count <hi>Martels:</hi> But by the way (had he not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it himself) he had been entrapped in an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush and overthrown: yet before he could clear himself he lost many brave men; wherewith he was so enraged, that pressing into the midst of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he made at Count <hi>Martel,</hi> strake him down with his Sword, clave his helmet, and cut off an eare, yet he escaped out of the press, though diverse of his men were taken, and the rest routed.</p>
            <p>But whilst he was thus contending with outward Enemies, two of his own conspired against him,<note place="margin">A new Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</note> 
               <hi>William Guelan,</hi> Earl of <hi>Mortagne,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Eu,</hi> both pretenders to the Dutchy of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy:</hi> But the first, upon suspicion, the second upon proof of intention, were both banished. And the Earldomes of <hi>Mortagne</hi> he gave to <hi>Robert,</hi> and that of <hi>Eu</hi> to <hi>Odo,</hi> both his Brethren by the Mothers side. And all these difficulties he encountred withall before he was full twenty two years old.</p>
            <p>Now the more to confirm and strengthen his Estate against future practices, he assembled a Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">He calls a Parlament</note> of his Bishops, Barons, and Gentlemen, causing them to take their Oath of Allegiance, and to raze their Castles. After which he married <hi>Matilda,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Baldwin</hi> the fifth, Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> but not without some opposition. For his Uncle <hi>Mauger,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Roan,</hi> excommunicated him

            </p>
            <p>These his successes made him the object of envy<note place="margin">He is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied by the <hi>French</hi> King,</note> to the <hi>French</hi> Court, who incensed the King against him, to abate his power, and to find a quarrel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which borderers easily may do) to set upon him. The King who was forward enough of himself, to make his cause the fairer, pretends to correct the insolencies of the <hi>Normans</hi> committed in his Territories, and to relieve Count <hi>Martel,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the Duke. He alleadged also, that it concerned him in honour and justice, to have that Province which held of his Crown, to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a Prince of lawfull blood; wherefore he resolved utterly to extirpate Duke <hi>William,</hi> and to settle a legitimate Prince in that Dutchy. For which end, he raised two Armies through all his Dominions, whereof one he sent along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades his Country.</note> 
               <hi>Seine,</hi> the other into the Countrey of <hi>Bessin,</hi> meaning to encompass him.</p>
            <p>The Duke hereupon divided his Forces also into two parts; and sent the one under his Brother <hi>Odo,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eu, Walter Guiffard</hi> Earl of <hi>Longevil,</hi> and others, into the Countrey of <hi>Caux,</hi> Himself with the other advanced toward <hi>Eureux,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the King who was at <hi>Mentz.</hi> He also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew all the Cattel and Provisions out of the Countrey, into Cities and Fortresses. The Kings Army marching to <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and finding the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56383:7"/>
Countrey to abound with all plenty, fell to make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good cheer; thinking that Duke <hi>William</hi> with his men, was yet at <hi>Eureux;</hi> which the Army of <hi>Odo</hi> understanding, marched all night, and at break of day gave them so hot an Alarm, that he<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> beaten.</note> put them all into a rout, leaving their Horses and Armour to the <hi>Normans,</hi> who in the pursuit of fourty thousand left not a fourth part of them alive.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> thus defeated, returned home with disgrace; and our Duke with the price of the Prisoners, recovered his Peace, and the Castle of <hi>Thuilliers,</hi> which had been taken from him in his minority. Cout <hi>Martel</hi> though much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with the Kings overthrow, yet made some attempts for the recovery of his Towns, but without success. Wherefore the next spring he went again to sollicit the <hi>French</hi> King to aid him against the Duke, who (said he) is now grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent upon the victory he stole last year, so that there is no living by him. Besides, he suggested that the <hi>Normans</hi> extreamly derided the <hi>French,</hi> and had a base esteem of them, making their last overthrow the subject of their sport, and Rhimes, as if the King of <hi>France,</hi> upon such an inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable loss, durst not break a dishonourable Peace.</p>
            <p>The King being stung with this reproach, raised a mighty Army, far greater than the former, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<note place="margin">The King of <hi>France</hi> invades his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try again,</note> were three Dukes, and twelve Earls, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the solemne peace made, and so lately sworn with the Duke, he entered <hi>Normandy</hi> in the Harvest time, spoiling all before him along
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56383:7"/>
the Countrey of <hi>Bessin.</hi> From thence he passed to <hi>Bayeux,</hi> and <hi>Caen,</hi> purposing to pass the River <hi>Dine</hi> at <hi>Verruil,</hi> and to destroy all as far as to <hi>Roan:</hi> Coming thither he found the Causeway long, and Bridge narrow, wherefore he caused his Van to pass over first, and to secure his Rere, lead by the Duke of <hi>Berry,</hi> himself staid behind in <hi>Caen,</hi> till his men and Carriages were passed. Duke <hi>William</hi> all this while was storing his Fortresses with men and victuals: strengthening himself and <hi>Falaise,</hi> as much as he could: yet had no Army in the Field, but only a running Camp, ready to take all advantages; and so lets the fury of this storm spend itself, till being informed of their passage over the<note place="margin">and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> Bridge, and then marching all night with ten thousand men, in the morning early he set upon the Rereward, with so dreadfull a cry, and fury, that such as were upon the Causeway being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, thrust forward such as were before them, hasting to get over the Bridge, which, by reason of the great press, brake, so that many were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and such as were got over could not return to aid the rest. Nor the King (by reason of the marishes on both sides) could not yield any succor to his people; but stood a spectator of their slaughter; there were very many slain, and six of the Kings Earls taken Prisoners.</p>
            <p>This shameful overthrow was so laid to heart by<note place="margin">The King of <hi>France</hi> dies.</note> the King of <hi>France,</hi> that he died shortly after, and the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> enjoyed peace, which he imployed nobly in ordering and beautifying his State; building and endowing Churches, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastries: He erected also a Tomb for himself and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56383:8"/>
his wife at <hi>Caen;</hi> Feasting and rewarding his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and other men of worth; whereby he so engaged their hearts to him, that they were wholly his to do what he pleased.</p>
            <p>In the time of this calm he sailed over into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> pretending a visit to King <hi>Edward,</hi> his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, because he had been protected, and bred in <hi>Normandy</hi> by Duke <hi>Richard</hi> the second (Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to them both) gave him most Royal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Probably he came to see, and to be seen, to make way for his future designs. And not long after <hi>Herald,</hi> whether on purpose, or by some casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of weather was driven into <hi>France,</hi> is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but he was gallantly entertained in <hi>Normandy</hi> by Duke <hi>William,</hi> and at <hi>Roan</hi> something was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt them; whether to divide the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi> between them; or that <hi>Herald,</hi> being a coast-dweller, should let in Duke <hi>William</hi> after the decease of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessour,</hi> and do his best to help him to his Kingdom, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but whatever it was, it was solemnly sworn to upon the holy Evangelists, and all the Reliques in <hi>Roan.</hi> And for more assurance <hi>Herald</hi> was betrothed to <hi>Adeliza,</hi> the Dukes Daughter, and his Brother <hi>Wolnot</hi> was lest as a pledge for the performance. Sure it is, that so much was done, either by our King <hi>Edward,</hi> who by Will left the Crown to him, or by <hi>Herald,</hi> or both, as gave him ground to challenge the Crown of <hi>England</hi> and to pursue the getting of it. Though indeed it was not in either of their powers to prejudice our State, or to alter the conse of a right succession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56383:8"/>As soon as Duke <hi>William</hi> heard of the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and of the Election and Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Herald,</hi> he assembled the States of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> and acquainted them with the right he had to <hi>England,</hi> intreating their utmost assistance for the recovery of it, and to avenge him on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd. Usurper <hi>Herald;</hi> shewing them what a strong party he had in <hi>England,</hi> and the distractions of the people, which made his attempt very probable. He told them what Glory, Wealth, and greatness the obtaining of such a Kingdom would add to them. Yet notwithstanding all he could say, there were but few that liked of this attempt, and they which did, were such as had long followed him in the wars, and thereby had exhausted their estates, and were content to run any adventure that might promise hope of advantage. Of the rest, some thought it best to hold and defend their own Countrey, without adventuring to conquer an other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this was the richer sort: Others were<note place="margin">His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.</note> willing to contribute, but did it so sparingly that it little advanced the design; and the rest were so tyred with former Wars, and so willing to enjoy the blessing of Peace, that they were unwilling to forgoe a certain, for an uncertain good.</p>
            <p>The Duke meeting with these discouragements,<note place="margin">His Policy</note> was much perplexed, which made him to deal more particularly with his best Friends, whom he knew to affect Honour, and that they would adventure their whole estates with him. These were <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Fitz-Auber,</hi> Earl of <hi>Brettevil; Gualter Guifford,</hi> Earl of <hi>Longevil; Roger,</hi> Lord <hi>de Beaumont,</hi> &amp;c. especially his own brothers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Odo,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56383:9"/>
and <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Mortagne.</hi> These he procured in a full Assembly to make their offers, which they did so liberally (<hi>Fitz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Auber</hi> promising to furnish fourty ships with men and Amunition, the Bishop of <hi>Bayeux</hi> fourty, the Bishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> thirty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that the rest of the assembly doubting, that if without their help the Duke should carry on his design, he would not forget their backwardness, they came off more liberally.</p>
            <p>The Duke finding them yielding, yet not so forward as was requisite for such an undertaking, dealt with the Bishops and great men apart, getting that of them severally, which of all together he could not attain, and causing every mans contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution to be recorded, kindled such an emulation amongst them, that they which before would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now strove who should do most. By his fair perswasions also he drew in most of the Princes and Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> to adventure their Persons, and much of their estates with him. As <hi>Robert Fitz Harvay,</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Britaine, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieu, Bulloigne., Poyctou, Maine, Nevers, Hiesms, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>umarl,</hi> Signior <hi>de Tours,</hi> yea and <hi>Martel</hi> his enemy, Earl of <hi>Anjou.</hi> Indeed it was strange that these great men of <hi>France,</hi> should adventure their lives and Fortunes to add <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Normandy,</hi> and so great a Crown to a Duke who was too great for them already. But where God hath determined alterations in Kingdoms and States all things shall concurr to promote the same.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> who should have most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed was now a Child, and under the Tutorship of <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> Duke <hi>William</hi>'s Father in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56383:9"/>
Law, and therefore from thence he was sure of furtherance, rather than hinderance. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the young King he promised faithfully, if he conquered <hi>England,</hi> to hold it of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> as he did his Dutchy of <hi>Normandy.</hi> And to<note place="margin">His subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> make the Pope his friend, he promised him to hold it of the <hi>Apostolick See:</hi> Whereupon the Pope sent him a consecrated Banner, an <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and one of Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s haires. The Emperour also sent him some Forces under the command of one of the Princes of the Empire. And being thus encouraged and furnished, within eight months he was ready with a powerful Army, at Saint <hi>Valery</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> to transport himself into <hi>England</hi> in 896 Ships.</p>
            <p>But now let us see how affairs stood in <hi>England:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> being himself without issue, had in his lifetime sent into <hi>Hungary</hi> for his Nephew <hi>Edward,</hi> called the <hi>Outlaw,</hi> the Son of <hi>Edmund Ironside,</hi> intending to make him his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour to the Crown; but he dying soon after his arrival in <hi>England,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> then gave his Son <hi>Edgar</hi> the name of <hi>Etheling,</hi> or <hi>Prince Edgar,</hi> meaning to design him for his successour; but was prevented by death before he had fully establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and <hi>Edgar Etheling,</hi> though he had right, yet being young, and a stranger here, and so wanting power to make good his right, <hi>Herald,</hi> the Son of<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herald</hi> made King, <hi>An.</hi> 1066.</note> Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> stept into the Throne, and though hereby (violating of holy Rights) he offended the Clergy, yet not any, either of the Clergy, or Laity durst oppose him; as being the most Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall man in the Kingdom, and such an one as the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56383:10"/>
state of the Realm then stood in need of. And besides his own worth he had the assistance of <hi>Edwin,</hi> and <hi>Marchar,</hi> the two great Earls of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> and <hi>Chester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed King <hi>Edward</hi> had appointed the Crown sometimes to <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> sometimes to <hi>Edgar Etheling,</hi> and sometimes to this <hi>Herald,</hi> who was now Crowned by <hi>Aldred,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York:</hi> And being possessed of the Throne, he was able to make good his Title: yet to make Prince <hi>Edgar</hi> some part of amends he created him Earl of<note place="margin">His pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and policy.</note> 
               <hi>Oxford.</hi> And <hi>Herald</hi> being thus setled, carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with great valour, and Justice for the time he enjoyed it, which was but nine months. He made all provisions for defence that a politick and active Prince could do.</p>
            <p>The first man that begun to disturb his new Government was his younger Brother <hi>Toustaine,</hi> who in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign being made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> for his pride and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous cruelty, was banished the Kingdom;<note place="margin">His oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and successe.</note> and now by reason of his former hatred against his Brother, was easily set on by the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> (who had married his two Daughters to Duke <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>Toustaine,</hi>) to assail <hi>Herald.</hi> He first assailed the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and then set upon the coast of <hi>Kent,</hi> from whence he was chased by <hi>Herald,</hi> and forced to withdraw into the North, where seeking to land, he was thence repulsed by the Earls <hi>Marchar,</hi> and <hi>Edwin,</hi> (whose Sister <hi>Herald</hi> had married.) Then he craved aid of the <hi>Scots;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of <hi>Harald Harfager,</hi> King of <hi>Norwey,</hi> who
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56383:10"/>
was excercising Piracy about the <hi>Orchades;</hi> with him he prevailed, and so uniting their Forces, they landed about <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> and from thence marched into the heart of the kingdom. But near <hi>Stamford</hi> King <hi>Herald</hi> of <hi>England</hi> met them with a strong<note place="margin">His victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> Army, and after a long and cruel fight, ended the day with victory, and the death both of <hi>Toustaine,</hi> and the King of <hi>Norway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No sooner was this Battel over, but with his wearied and broken Forces he was called to a<note place="margin">Duke <hi>William</hi> comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> more fatal business in the South. For now Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> pretending a right to the <hi>English</hi> Crown, by the Testament of the late King <hi>Edward</hi> his kinsman, upon the advantage of King <hi>Herald</hi>'s being so far off with his Army, landed at <hi>Pemsey,</hi> near to <hi>Hastings</hi> in <hi>Sussex;</hi> and <hi>Herald</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of it, gathering together his broken Forces, increasing them as much as he could by the way, with all possible speed he hasted to give the Duke Battel.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>William</hi> as soon as he had landed his men,<note place="margin">His poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> sent his ships away, that so they might think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but either Victory or Death. Then going himself on land his foot slipt, and he fell down, which some of his company took for an ill signe; <hi>No</hi> (said he) <hi>I have by this taken possession of this Land.</hi> Many attempts were made to compound the difference between <hi>Herald,</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> but <hi>Herald</hi> would hearken to none, presuming of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and judging it a disgrace to capitulate for that which was his own. And when one of his Brothers called <hi>Gyrth</hi> intreated him to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a fearful thing it was to break an Oath,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56383:11"/>
which he had so solemnly sworn. <hi>Herald</hi> judged, that nothing which he had done being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man could be of force to him, being now a Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1066. <hi>October</hi> the fourteenth (being also <hi>Herald</hi>'s Birthday) and his Soldiers (thinking<note place="margin">The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Herald.</hi>

For the Duke had with him all the flower of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> whereas King <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi> had lost his best men in the late fight, and for weapons, the <hi>Normans</hi> had long Bowes, which then were not in use among the <hi>English,</hi> it's no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel then though the <hi>Normans</hi> got the Victory. And though <hi>Herald</hi> lost his life, yet he lost not his<note place="margin">Their mutual valour.</note> credit: and the <hi>English</hi> shewed no less valour though they were Conquered, than the other did in Conquering. For King <hi>Herald</hi> (like an expert General) had ordered his men in so firme a Body, that no power of the <hi>Normans</hi> could disorder their ranks, till Duke <hi>Wìlliam</hi> used this Stratagem: He made his men to retire, and to counterfeit flight, by which meanes he drew the <hi>English</hi> on upon an hollow ground covered over with earth, wherein many of them fell and perished, as also into an
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56383:11"/>
Ambush of his Horsemen, which unexpectedly fell upon them and cut them in peices,</p>
            <p>Indeed Duke <hi>William</hi> fought that day so vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly that he had three Horses slain under him: But King <hi>Herald</hi> shewed no less valour in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling many of the <hi>Normans</hi> with his own hands. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as the fight continued doubtfull for a long time, till at last King <hi>Herald</hi> being struck into the braines with an Arrow, fell down dead, upon<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herald</hi> slain.</note> whose fall a base <hi>Norman,</hi> cut off one of his thighs, for which Duke <hi>William</hi> was so offended, that he disarmed the Souldier, and cashier'd him. <hi>Thyra</hi> King <hi>Herald</hi>'s Mother, proffered a great some of money for his Body, which the Duke nobly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and gave it her freely, who buried it in <hi>Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> Abby. And no marvel if the <hi>English</hi> had such ill success. For the People being secure from their former enemies the <hi>Danes</hi> (which peace had continued now about the space of fifty years) had discontinued the use of Armes, and were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally<note place="margin">

            <p>Duke <hi>William,</hi> as his Valour won him the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">Duke <hi>Williams</hi> victory.</note> so his Victory won him a Crown; and suddenly of an old Duke he became a young King.

               <hi>Edwin,</hi> and <hi>Morchar,</hi> the greatest men in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yea and <hi>Edgar Etheling</hi> himself, came and yielded their Allegiance to him, the Pope having cursed all such as would not accept of him.</p>
            <p>From hence as <hi>William</hi> passed towards <hi>London,</hi> he found his way stopt up with multitudes of great Trees, which by <hi>Frederick</hi> Abbot of Saint <hi>Albans,</hi> a man of Noble blood, were caused to be felled to secure his Monastery from being spoiled by the <hi>Normans;</hi> whereat <hi>William</hi> both wondering and<note place="margin">A stout Abbot.</note> fret ting, sent for the Abbot under assurance of his safe return, and asked him why he did it? <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> stoutly replied: <hi>I have done the Duty both of my Birth and Profession, and if others of my rank had done the like (as they might, and ought to have done) it had not been in thy power to have pierced the Land so far.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence <hi>William</hi> marched to <hi>London,</hi> where the Gates were set open, and the Bishops, Lords, and People entertained him with great signes of joy, though with small gladness; and though he had not<note place="margin">He comes to <hi>London;</hi> Is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Joy.

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56383:12"/>
was not held Canonically invested in his See.</p>
            <p>Here, according to the accustomed form, the Bishops and Nobles took their oaths to be his true and faithful subjects: and he (being required by the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi>) takes his Oath before the Altar of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to defend the Right of the Church, to establish good Laws, and to see Justice uprightly and impartially administred as became a<note place="margin">No Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.</note> good King. Nor did he ever claim any power by Conquest, but as a Regular Prince, submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the orders and customs of the Kingdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring rather to hold the Scepter by his Testamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Title than to claim it by the sword. So that though the name of <hi>Conquerour,</hi> by the flattery of the times, was given to him; yet he shewed by all the course of his Government that he assumed it not.</p>
            <p>Being thus setled, he chose for his Counsel such<note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> men as he knew to be of greatest Wisdom, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; then he applied his thoughts to secure his new-gotten Empire. For which end he fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such places as lay open to danger; placed strong Garrisons upon the Coasts; and provided Ships to ride in those Harbors which lay most open to Invasions. he marched also towards <hi>Dover,</hi> (the Lock and Key of the Kingdom) to secure that place, and to overaw that <hi>Kentish,</hi> a most strong and populous Province.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Stigand,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:56383:13"/>
laying before them the dangers of their Province, the miseries of their Neighbours, the Pride of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and the wrongs of the Church. All which (say they) are too apparent. The English till now were ever free, and the name of Bondmen not heard among them.

            </p>
            <p>Accordingly there they met at the day, and kept themselves secret in the woods, waiting the coming of the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> agreeing to carry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them great branches of Trees, whereby they might conceal themselves, and if need were, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the march of the <hi>Normans.</hi> Which device daunted King <hi>William</hi> at his approach, who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself secure, was thus before he was aware, suddenly beset on every side with enemies. For now the <hi>Kentish</hi> men, having environed his Army round, threw down their Boughs, and with bent Bowes prepared for Battel: So that he which even now thought himself secure of the Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dispair of his Life, in which amazement, <hi>Stigand,</hi> and <hi>Eglesine</hi> pesented themselves before him, and said,</p>

               <hi>Most Noble Duke, behold here the Commons of</hi> Kent <hi>are come forth to meet and receive you as their Sovereigne, requiring your Peace, and their own Freedom, and the enjoyment of their ancient Lawes. If these be denied they are resolved to submit their</hi>

               <hi>William</hi> being brought into this strait, and loath to hazard all upon so nice a point, more wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than willingly granted their desires, and Pledges being given on both sides for performance, <hi>Kent</hi> yielded to him her Earldom, and <hi>Dover</hi> her Castle.</p>
            <p>When King <hi>William</hi> had established all things for <hi>Englands</hi> security, he committed the Government of it to <hi>Odo,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> his brother by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers side, and to his Cousin <note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Fitz-Osburne.</hi>

The people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by whom he must now subsist, wherein he had more to doe than in his Battel at <hi>Hastings,</hi> seeing that all rewards with money must be raised out of the stock of the Kingdom, which must needs be distastfull to the State in general; and if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred any of his to dignities by displacing others, it must needs bring very feeling grievances to the persons displaced. But he thrust no great men out of their room, but such as put themselves out by revolting after they had given their Fealty to him. So that it seems he contented himself, and his for the present, only with what he found rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, filling up their places who were slain in the Battel, or fled away, as many were with <hi>Herald</hi>'s Sons, out of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Such of desert as he could not presently prefer, he sent abroad into the Abbeys, there to live till places fell void for them, whereof twenty four he sent to the Abbey of <hi>Ely,</hi> by which policy he not only lessened his Suitors at Court, and eased the<note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> eye sore of the <hi>English,</hi> but had a watch over the Clergy, who were then of the greatest power in

            <p>But the <hi>English</hi> Nobility thinking that their splendor was darkned by the interposition of so many strangers, and fearing that yet it would be<note place="margin">The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> rebel.</note> further eclypsed, Conspired together, and fled, some into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and others into <hi>Denmark,</hi> to try if by forraign aid they could recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

               <hi>Malcolin</hi> the third, whose former sufferings in exile had taught him to pity others in the like distress: and whom also it concerned to look to his own, now his neighbours House was on fire. This induced him also to make a League with <hi>Edgar,</hi> and to tie it the stronger, he took to wife <hi>Margret,</hi> the sister of <hi>Edgar</hi> (a very virtuous Lady) by whom the blood of our antient Kings was preserved and conjoyned with the <hi>Normans</hi> in King <hi>Henry,</hi> the second, and so became <hi>English</hi> again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edgar</hi> being thus in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there repared to him the Earls <hi>Edwin,</hi> and <hi>Morchar, Hereward, Gospatrice, Siward</hi> and others, and shortly after <hi>Stigand</hi> and <hi>Aldrid</hi> the two Archbishops: with diverse of the Clergy, who in that third year of King <hi>William</hi>'s Reign, raised great commotions in the North, and sought most eagerly to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their lost Country.

            <p>King <hi>William,</hi> foreseeing new stirs from <hi>Scotland,</hi> sent to <hi>Malcolme</hi> to deliver up to him his enemy <hi>Etheling,</hi> which if he refused he threatned him with Wars. <hi>Malcolme</hi> returned answer: That it was unjust and wicked, especially in a Prince, to betray to his enemy, one that came to his Court for protection, especially being now so nearly allied to him. <hi>William,</hi> thus disappointed, feared a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rebellion in his Kingdom, to prevent which he built four strong Castles.

But his Son perceiving by his voice that it was his Father, suddenly leaped off his<note place="margin">Is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Horse, took him up in his armes, fell down at his feet, and humbly intreated his pardon, which his Father easily granted, embraced his Son, and ever after they lived in mutual love.</p>
            <p>After this King <hi>William</hi> sent this his Son <hi>Robert,</hi> with an Army against <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who had invaded <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who at the coming of Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> retired. At which time Duke <hi>Robert</hi> began to found a Castle upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Tine,</hi> whereof the Town of <hi>Newcastle</hi> did take its beginning, and Name, which formerly was<note place="margin">
                  <hi>New-Castle</hi> built.</note> called <hi>Moncaster.</hi> These frequent Wars put the State to an infinite charge, the King entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this while, besides <hi>Normans,</hi> very many <hi>French.</hi> Finding the <hi>English</hi> (in respect of many great Families that were allied to the <hi>Danes</hi>) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to incline to that Nation than to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fifteenth year of his Reign he subdued <hi>Wales,</hi> and brought the King thereof to do him Homage. And presently after quarrels arose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King <hi>William,</hi> and the King of <hi>France.</hi>

invades <hi>France,</hi> and subdued the Country of <hi>Xantoigne,</hi> and <hi>Poicton,</hi> and so returned to <hi>Roan.</hi> Then did the King of <hi>France</hi> summon our King to do him Homage for <hi>England,</hi> which he refused, saying he held it of none but God, and his sword: But for the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> he offered him Homage, which yet would not satisfie the King of <hi>France.</hi> Whereupon he made a new invasion but with more loss than profit. In the end they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a crazy Peace, which held only till King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> had recovered a sickness, whereinto (through his travel, age, and corpulency) he was faln; which occasioned the young and lusty King of <hi>France</hi> jeeringly to say, <hi>that he lay in of his great</hi>

This so irritated King <hi>William</hi> that so soon as he was recovered, he gathered a very strong Army with which he entered <hi>France</hi> in the chiefest time of their Fruits, spoiling all before him till he came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where the King of <hi>France</hi> then<note place="margin">His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng.</note> was, to whom he sent to shew him of his upsiting.

How many yoak of Oxen and plough-lands were in the Realm: and what services they owed that held of him in Fee: All which was certified by Oaths of the Commissioners.</p>
            <p>This done, he caused six shillings to be paid him for every Hide of Land. The Book that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained this Survey, was called the <hi>Roule of Winchester,</hi> as being kept there at first. But ever since it hath been called <hi>Doomsday Book,</hi> because of the General and inevitable censure thereof; and since it hath<note place="margin">Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Book.</note> been kept in the Kings Exchequer at <hi>Westminster,</hi> This grievous exaction made the <hi>English</hi> miserably groan under their present State, whereby the King and his <hi>Normans</hi> were daily more hated: and he on the contrary loved them so little that he fought by all means to bring the <hi>English</hi> Name, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ruine. He gave also further offence both to God and Man, by depopulating the fruitful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, lying South from <hi>Salisbury</hi> to the Sea: pulling down Towns, and Villages, with thirty six Parish

            <p>Although King <hi>William</hi> at his Coronation had taken an oath to observe the Laws of King <hi>Edward,</hi> then in use: which oath he renewed at <hi>Barkhamsted,</hi> yet did he abbrogate many of them, and brought in the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Laws, written in <hi>French,</hi> commanding that all Causes should be pleaded, and all matters<note place="margin">The Laws in <hi>French</hi>

Forms of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Fire, and Water, called <hi>Ordeal,</hi> formerly much used, were now antiquated and shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quite abolished by the Pope, as savouring too much of Paganism.

by the verdict of twelve men, called by the name of <hi>Enquest.</hi> And whereas the Bishops for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly dealt in Secular Causes, and shared with the King in many Mulcts imposed on Delinquents, now the King confined all the Clergy within the<note place="margin">Bishops Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.</note> compass of their own Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, to meddle only in matters concerning mens Souls. He set up Sheriffs in every Shire, and Justices of Peace to punish Malefactors.

            </p>
            <p>As for his Provisionary Revenues, his Tenants who held Lands of the Crown, paid him no mony<note place="margin">His hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision.</note> but only Corn, and Victuals; and a just note of the quality, and quantity of everyman's ratement was taken through all the Shires of the Kingdom, and leavied constantly for the maintenance of the Kings House. One Law he made which was extreamly distastfull to the Gentry. That whereas they might at their pleasure, hunt &amp; take Deer which they found abroad in the woods, now it was ordained that upon penalty of putting out their eyes, none should presume to take or kill any of them, the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving them for his own Game.</p>
            <p>In the first year of his Reign he granted to the<note place="margin">The Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>London</hi> renewed.</note> City of <hi>London,</hi> their first Charter and Liberties in as Large a manner as they enjoyed them under King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor;</hi> which he did at the request of <hi>William</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London;</hi> in grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

In his time the use of long Bows came first into <hi>England,</hi> which, as they were the weapons wherewith under this King <hi>France</hi> Conquered <hi>England,</hi> so they were the weapons with which <hi>England</hi> under succeeding Kings conquered <hi>France.</hi> This King also appointed a Constable at <hi>Dover</hi> Castle, and a Lord Warden of the Cinque-Ports. In short, He ordained such good Laws, and had them so well executed, that a Girle might carry a bag of money all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try over without danger of being rob'd. And in his time the setting of Seals to Bonds and writings was first used.</p>
            <p>In King <hi>William</hi>'s time <hi>Stigand</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was removed from his See and kept Prisoner during his Life in the Castle of <hi>Winchester;</hi>

But as he was about to begin his journey, he was seized upon by the King, and imprisoned, and his House being searched, there were found such heaps of Gold as caused ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in all that saw it, and many of his Bags were drawn out of Rivers, where they were laid, full of Gold beaten to Powder.</p>

               <hi>Margeret,</hi> his youngest Daughter, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to <hi>Alphonso</hi> King of <hi>Galicia</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> but dyed before the marriage was consummated.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Randolph Peverel,</hi> to whom <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi> was very bountifull, because he had married his kinswoman, the Daughter of <hi>Ingelrick,</hi> a man of great Nobility among the <hi>English Saxons.</hi> A Lady of that admirable beauty, that with her looks she conquered the Conquerour <hi>William,</hi> who desired nothing more than to be her Prisoner in Armes, which to effect, he begins to express a kind of love to the remembrance of her deceased Father <hi>Ingelrick,</hi> enriching the Colledge of <hi>Martins Le Grand,</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> first founded by

him, and her Uncle <hi>Edward.</hi> Then he honours and advances her two Brethren, <hi>William Peverel,</hi> Castellane, or keeper of <hi>Dover</hi> Castle, and <hi>Payne Peverel,</hi> Baron of <hi>Bourn,</hi> in <hi>Cambridgshire,</hi> the Founder of <hi>Barnwell</hi> Abbey, and Standard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer to <hi>Robert,</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> in the Holy War against the Infidels.</p>
            <p>He prefers her kindred and Friends: He sollicites her by the Messengers of the Devils Bedcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, his fly Enchanting Bawdes, and comes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times himself (like <hi>Jupiter</hi>) in a Golden shower. Thus by these forcible demonstrations of his love, and unavoidable allurements (especially from a King) she was brought at length to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Bed, unto whom she bare a Son nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>William,</hi> who was Lord of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and Founder of <hi>Lenton</hi> Abby. The Lady his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (touched with remorse of Conscience for her sin) to expiate her guilt (for such was the Doctrine taught in those dayes) founded a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in <hi>Hatfield Peverel,</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> wherein, setting apart all worldly imployments, she spent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her dayes.</p>
            <p>King <hi>William,</hi> having once setled himself in the Kingdom, divided a great part of it among his followers: To <hi>Allen,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Red,</hi> Earl of <hi>Britain,</hi> who came into <hi>England</hi> with him and was his Son in Law, he gave the Honour, and County of <hi>Edwin,</hi> within the Province of <hi>York</hi> by his Charter in these words.</p>
