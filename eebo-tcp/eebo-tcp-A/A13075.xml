         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wee can not fore-see his comming, but

When hee lurketh, what confusions in

Gods appointment, not to let our

                     <p>Fixed endes make an well ordered

the good of our callings, and then to set

Without them other blessinges

is Gods free loue; the price of it, Christs
satisfaction; the worker of it, Gods
owne Spirit, the mettell vpon which he
stampeth it, is a good Conscience; the
fruite of it, the joye of the holie Ghost.
It cannot bee keeped, but by great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectnesse:

<hi>It is vineger to his teeth, and smoak

vnder their Kinges wrath may lurke in

Wee cannot heere possesse all thinges,

when wee choose one of them, it is not
the best, but the worst of all, in so farre
as wee make it our best. God is to bee
sought aboue all, hee may bee seene
and found of all, yet the most part kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
him not, and seeketh him not.
They professe wisedome, but they prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
folie herein, they are not spiritually
daintie either in choose or their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
any thing contenteth them: The base
lump of the earth and vanities of it, are
felicitie to them: And though there be
some choyse blessings in the world, they
light rather on the trash, than on the
good substance: As they passe by God
himselfe to his gifts, so among his gifts,


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:26336:12"/>
they misse the corne, and choose the
chaffe: Neither doeth their folie stand
heere, it can imagine to it selfe an happi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse
in this miserable miscarrying.</p>
                     <p>This is indeede a fooles Paradise, a
conceate plat-formed by our selues: we
are delighted with these vanities, and
captiued by them, which proueth our
naughtinesse. Raw and racklesse choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
maketh faint pursuing. True Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
as all true good, hath an alluring
and drawing vertue, and the godly by
their inclining &amp; yeelding dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to it,
are made partakers of it to their happines:
Their care about it, is as far aboue other
cares, as it selfe excelleth other things.</p>
                     <p>If this rule bee applyed to mankinde,
how few shall bee found in the way of
true Happinesse: Professe with men, and
imagine with themselues as they will,
there is none appearance, that either
they haue found the alluring power of
it, or rendred themselues in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
desire and care, for the obtaining of
it. It deserueth the flower and prime of


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:26336:12"/>
all our labours, and their smallest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
may serue other trifles: But
when this order is inverted, such men
lye as fast in miserie, as they are blinde

                     <p>If true good haue drawen vs forceblie

world is worse and worse, and that
justlie how so bad a thing can grow in
euill: It lyeth all in euill, euen in Sathans

Diuine and humane Lawes, and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,

                     <p>The heart of man which is <hi>the heart of

yet they beget not renewed men, but
naturall: Euerie Age commeth in with
the owne guise to adde euill to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
Their corruption letteth them not
see the good of former or present times,
they take hold of euill, and thinke it a
proofe of their succession both to follow
that, and augment it. As a kinde Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesse
in a Citie loueth the increase of
common good, so euerie man the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the common euill of the world;
how can it bee good, since it hath no
good of it selfe, but resisteth the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that God offereth to it? all the sins
of former Ages remaine in it, &amp; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of mans great corruption, and Gods
just desertion increaseth wonderfullie:
And the Prince of it watchfull at all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions

and ends: And the threed of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in a wood, doe no more crosse and
woft through other, than mens wayes
to their endes. It is a wonder how man,
one in kinde, can be so contrare in their
ends and wayes: And it is a strong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the most part misse the right
end, and runne the wrong way. The
chiefe good is one, and the right way to
it, is onely one, but man missing the
right, falleth in innumerable errors:
And it is yet more wonderfull, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
man resteth on a double perswasion,
both that his end is good, and that his
wayes will bring him to it. Neither is
this all, but euery man setteth himselfe
as a pettie god, both for worth to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:26336:19"/>
and for wisedome to compasse
them.</p>
                     <p>As it is Gods priuiledge to know the
heart immediately, so is it his wisedome
to hide it from men: If all the thoughts
of it were seene of other, there could be
nothing, but a perpetuall striuing in
mankynd, and euerie one abhorred of
other for their monstruous thoughtes,
neither the Seas, nor Africke can bring
foorth such monsters as mans heart in
one houre. It is best to cast off all wrong
ends, and eschew all by-wayes, to set
true Happinesse before vs as our end,
and walke toward it in Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
Other ends will proue no more
fixed, than fleeing moates in the aire:
And other wayes, haue no more force
to fitch these ends, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Speeders threeds
haue to draw a great weight.</p>
                     <p>Our heart is euer ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God, let vs ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

they be possessed of Satan, they cannot
but loue that heart, that is ful of the loue


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:26336:20"/>
of God: The wicked labour to hyde his
thoughts, but the godly affect to haue
them knowne: Hee is as the man, who
craued not his house to bee so built,
that he might see all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; none see him:
But rather that all men might see him
in the most retired corners of his house:
Hee assureth himselfe to bee acceptable
to man, if the honestie of his heart were
seene.</p>
                     <p>Why may he not byde the tryall of man,
who hath already sustained the sight, &amp;
findeth the approbation of God, to the
honesty of his heart? Both the vprightnes
of the hart, &amp; testimony of that vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
are knowne of God alone, and the
vpright heart that hath them. The world
will not see that vprightnesse, and they
cannot heare the testimonie of it, but
God approueth that vprightnesse, and
confirmeth that testimonie, and the
Soule that is sensible of all these, resteth

Youth: Though in Youth wee escape

Omissions: None seemeth to bee more

are soone called effectually to Grace, yet
haue they their owne neglects: While
they are keeped by GODS Spirit from
fleshly pollutions, they are caried often
by fleshly presumption. Sathan is so
craftie, that when hee cannot set our
corruption to worke on the owne taske
of sinne, he can abuse the beginnings of
Grace: And so many vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science
of Grace, soone receiued, fall either
to neglect of their particular Calling, or
conceating of a perfection, are carelesse
of Grace it selfe; their strong and short

                     <p>These are indeede two Blessings in

and before our calling, to bee free of
grosse sinnes. Againe, these are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
euils, to bee long of calling, and
monstruous in sinne before our calling:
but Sathan abuseth the first two Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
in making vs carelesse after our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as though wee needed not to bee
zealous, because our former life was not
slandrous. And God turneth the other
two to good, in making them more
zealous, who were long of calling, and
grieuous sinners before it. S. Paul did
more euill before his conuersion, than
all the Apostles, and answerablie more
good after it. In euerie one there is
matter eneugh for mourning to old age.</p>
                     <p>It is great cruelty in Youth, to make

the tyme wherein wee looke for joy and

at the best hath sufficient griefes: It is of

it selfe a sicknesse, and a neighbour to
Death and needeth not so bad prouision
of Youthlie folies. But since the first can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee auoyded, it is better to mourne
in olde Age, than in Hell fire for euer. If
the Experience of Age cannot be found
in Youth, let not the rashnesse of Youth
rule in olde Age also.</p>
                     <p>It is better so to diuide our life, that
there bee some mourning for euill, than
to turne it all both Youth and Age in
a seede time to Hell: But it is best of all
to haue a seede time of Grace in our
Youth for a joyfull olde Age, and to
turne both Youth and Age in a seede
time for Glory in Heauen. The godly
in the midst of their corruptions sow
this seed, a care to please God in a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
discharge of their Calling, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of joy for their olde Age. Foolish
Youth shareth vnequally with old Age:
It taketh libertie to it selfe, and reserueth
nothing but bitter pennance to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
If they fell not both in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
it were hard that Age should smart


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:26336:22"/>
for Youths follies. It is lamentable that
our first and strongest time hath least
wit, &amp; our wisest age hath least strength:
Wee haue wounded our selues deadlie
before wee know our estate, and all our
after-time is to cure these wounds.</p>
                     <p>O how happie is hee, whom Gods
effectuall Grace saluteth at the Cradle!
And with his first discerning, indueth
him with the loue of God, his word and
worshippe, and by the exercise of his
mind, soweth such a seed of Grace, that
old Age hath not a beedrole of folies to
repent. <hi>If wee learne the wayes of God in
our Youth, when wee are olde, wee will
not depart from them. If hee fill vs with

That is a commendable Youth, which

There is no lawfull Calling without the

<hi>Equitie, Honestie, Humanitie, Vprightnes,</hi>

The worke of the Soule, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tietie

Scarcelie can the minde strengthen it

They are the two wings of <hi>Calumnie,</hi>
without which it cannot flee abroad:

But it is winglesse, till it be vented:
For this end, hee putteth Confidence
and Credulitie to it, that it may flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
which was brought foorth in

<hi>A babling tongue</hi> to speake, and <hi>a

                     <p>It is a weake Soule, that hath two

than hee who must heare their raw and
vnconsiderate reportes. Hee needeth
no more, but vent his tales, he is trusted
at once by them, but their hearers must
either beleeue them, &amp; that in their own
degree of perswasion, or else suffer for it:

It is easier to bee their informers, than

                     <p>It is our best, to try reportes, and

                     <p>Who can see him, but hee must loue

This is a compleate Furniture for our

All these are obtained by setting God
before vs.</p>
                     <p>Neither is hee a beholder of his gifts,
but an effectuall mouer of them, setting
vs and his Grace in vs to worke, by a
powerfull working. If his pure light
fill the minde, his effectuall power will
fill the heart, and that light and power
can lead vs no wher-else, but to himself:
They put vs to a restlesnesse, but when
wee are pleasing him, and that rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnes
is a most sweete rest. The goodnes
of promised blessings, the weight of thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atned
curses, and the equitie of dueties
commanded, are all in their vigour when
we see God, so that faith and obedience
doe follow: Other considerations haue
their owne force, but this is so imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
and strong, that there is neither
place for delay, nor hypocrisie. He who
seeth God alway, dare neither neglect
his duetie, nor doe it deceitfully.</p>

Where this care is, Sinne findeth a

no tentation ouercome vs, so long as

it selfe before the clearenes of that light.</p>
                     <p>Our walking in Christianity, is but a

saue those that goe in it: But Pelagius
brittle, and rent shalloppe of naturall
power, and selfe-sufficiencie, drowneth

and for this life, Nature can doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;

as farre excell the Soule, as the Soule
doeth the body: But the multitude
chooseth a worse and a baser life to their

by their fame, others by their pleasures,
and others by their conceates. This is
not an exalting, but a debasing of their

When hee dwelleth in the Soule, hee
maketh both Soule &amp; body liue in him,
and exciteth them to an higher degree
than they had before. There is no food
so sweete to the mouth, as the sense of

while they are Gods instruments to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

filling vp the cup of their owne sinnes,
that full vengeance may ouertake them.</p>
                     <p>It is our best not to fight against God

Hee knoweth his Heart thinketh not

taketh the floorish of faire speech to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
the want of trueth: His heart must
fetch the reasons of his owne perswasion

                     <p>They are no more vexed to coyne
their wordes, than I am to keepe my

                     <p>Ingenuitie of affection goeth plainly


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:26336:115"/>
to worke: The more care to fill mine
eares with officious offers, the lesse cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
they finde in mine heart: I thinke
their Spirit is so spent in that vapour,
that there is left neither spirit nor life in
their affection.</p>
                     <p>This sort of lying is not vulgare, but
with a singular mode: Poets haue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to lie, and for keeping their <hi>Rythme,</hi>
they are licenced to quite <hi>Reason</hi> oft-times.
There is none odde veine of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
without some degree of abstractnes
of Spirit, the strictnesse of meeter loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them from the strictnesse of veritie,
and secureth them from rigorous cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for that slippe: And their hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolees
doe passe for good coyne. But
the Complementer doe lie without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

are none other thing in broad

                     <p>Their speaches run vsuallie on three
thinges, 1. large praises of some excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
worth in them whom they idole: 2.
Officious offers of seruice as due to it. 3.


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:26336:115"/>
And large wishes of all happinesse to
them. In the first, their idoles know
they are speaking false, except they be as
sensles of flatteries, as there flatterers are
shamelesse. In the second, their owne
heart giueth them the lie: For they think
themselues more worthie of seruice,
than hee to whom they offer it. In the
third, their Conscience checketh them
for mocking of God: For they pray for
that which they desire not to bee gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Yea, they would bee grieued if it
were granted.</p>
                     <p>They are equivocaters, minding one
thing, and speaking another: Many doe
practise the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> mentall Reseruation,
who know not their doctrine: (It must
bee a cousening Religion that teacheth,
practiseth, &amp; alloweth such cousening.)
I neuer suspect them more, than when

speach. I shall trow the heart and

more weight, than all these buskinges
and fairdings.</p>
                     <p>The heart that God made (but they
abuse) hath the owne meaning: I trust
that, but not the person which they
assume, and laye downe, as soone as
they haue spent their borrowed breath.
The next mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and the first man they
meete with, findeth them in another, if
not in a contrare minde; it cannot byde
in their heart, which bred not in it, nor
was neuer in it: Their wordes are but
carcases of language, and let the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

their words either not to bee idle, or that

If there be any fault in such moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

But beeing joyntlie considered as they

So he is assaulted of both, &amp; yet keepeth
his moderate temper. Both extreames
take him for their contrare extreame:
Fyrie men call him sottish, and soft men

                     <p>IT is good to professe true <hi>Religion,</hi> and
to practise the exercise of it, but the
most part goe no further, and so are voide
of Religion it selfe; and the fruits of it:
To stand on the outward worke of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
preaching, praising, &amp;c. is to offer
the carcase of our seruice to God. To
worshippe God onely with our body, is
an irreligious worship; our bodie may
bee busie, but they will neuer fasten v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
God in such a superficiall worke:
Hee is a Spirit, and will bee worshipped
in Spirit, else none union with him.</p>
                     <p>When hee sendeth out his Vertue to
our Soules, and our Soules doe meete
him answerablie, that is inward Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and our binding to him; hee is
most true, wee trust in him; Hee is most
gracious, good and mercifull, wee loue
him withall our heart: Hee is moste po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull,
wee feare to offend him, and


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:26336:133"/>
confide in his protection: Hee is most
wise, wee quite our owne will, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
him: Hee is most holy, wee
adore, admire, and imitate his holinesse.</p>
                     <p>It is a mocking of God (if hee could
bee mocked) to professe an union with
him, and yet bee loose from him. This
Union is the end, and Religion the way
to it: The end of Gods infusing of sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace in vs, is to bring vs to him,
and bind vs to him.</p>
                     <p>But he is pitifully selfe-deceiued, who
contenteth himselfe with a profession of
Religion, and neither knoweth nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for this Union: Hee who is not
fastened to God in this life, shall haue
no fellowshippe with him heereafter.
It is a <hi>religious Religion,</hi> when wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one <hi>Spirit with God in Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These and other points make vp our
inward Religion: God reuealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in his diuine properties, our Soules
affecting and adhering to him in their
answerable powers; this tyeth vs not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
for the space wee are in the worke of


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:26336:133"/>
his worshippe, but by deth constantlie
in vs: The worke of Preaching, or Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Praising, doe end in their time,
but these inward ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds are neuer loosed:
This inward Religion doeth both set vs
on worke, and quickneth in vs the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
exercise of it.</p>
                     <p>There is more fruite of one houres
seruice in such a disposition, than in
yeares businesse without it. Hee who
keepeth his heart vnder this religious
disposition, lacketh neuer a manifest
object to worshippe, nor a sacrifice to
offer. He is sensible of God, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
mouing of his Soule in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and sense of these bands, is a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
most acceptable to God, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to himselfe.</p>
                     <p>The fleshlie minded doe wonder at
the constant labour of the godly in Gods
worshippe, but if they knew these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
bands, they would not wonder.
Naturall actions oft repeated bring ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
and these become another Nature:
Shall not the work of Grace, which hath


<pb n="258" facs="tcp:26336:134"/>
both infused and acquired habits, turne
in a constant disposition.</p>
                     <p>This is not obtained in our beginning
of Christianitie, but after long labours in
the Lord. The daylie tasting of his good
nesse, bringeth our heartes to such a
temper, that religious disposition tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to bee our element for place, and
our dyet for refreshment: It is our meat
and drinke to conuerse with God, and
doe his will. When God bringeth vs to
this degree of continuall minding, lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and delighting in him, and to the
sense of these religious bonds with him,
then our diuorce with the world, and
marriage with God, are neere their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

It is foolishnesse to guard them,
and leaue the heart guardlesse, if it bee
chocked with feares, what comfort
haue wee in the saftie of these thinges?
Wee will haue no comfort, but rather
griefe of them vnder such astonishment:
The more the heart goe out to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

from it selfe, and from God, and more
guardlesse, than if it had no guard at all.</p>
                     <p>As necessities try our disposition, so
danger discouereth our refuge, because
we are readie to deceiue our selues with
conceate of confidence in God alone,
Therefore, GOD sendeth oft-times
trouble to try our heartes. Rumours of
trouble are as the Hunters horne, and
the trouble it selfe as the noise of Dogs
in the Forrest. What euer wee runne
to in our danger, that is our refuge: The
Soule that hath God for a refuge, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the first way to him, and abideth in
him.</p>

in God and finde him dwelling in vs:</hi> If we

hee shall deliuer vs from outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:26336:140"/>
them with three considerable degrees,
The first in <hi>naturall</hi> gifts and abilities,
and so euerie man hath his owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and humane priuiledges; as gifts of
bodie, of mind, and of estate. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is <hi>ciuill,</hi> and so euery man hath his
particular calling: Some are as the
Head in this Body, as Kings: And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as the Breast; some as the Hand
and Feete of this great Bodie. The
third is <hi>spirituall,</hi> whereby man is the
mysticall Body of Christ, wherein some
are as the eyes directing, as Pastours:
Some the other parts of this Bodie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their spirituall gifts.</p>
                     <p>It is both profitable and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to take vp this triple respect: Euerie
man hath some place in euery of them:
God hath so disposed, that diuersities
of gifts, callings, and graces, serue all to
make vp a comelie proportion, and so
a beautie in mankind in euerie respect,
all naturall gifts, though diuerse in kinds
and degree make vp a comelie beautie
in the first respect: All callings from the


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:26336:141"/>
King to the grinder at the Mill, haue in
their varietie and diuersitie, a comelie
ciuill beautie, euery one filling his own
place, and looking to other with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
both of <hi>necessitie</hi> and <hi>helpe:</hi> As the
meanest calling hath neede of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so it helpeth it againe in some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie:
And all spirituall gifts in Christ
make vp the heauenly proportion of
Christs mysticall Body.</p>
                     <p>Though mankind bee the subject of
this wise ranking, yet the most part of
men consider it not: They see no more
in man, than Soule and a Body, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
respects in prosperitie or aduersity.
Their sight is so short, that they neither
see these diuerse degrees, nor the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
which is among them all: Euery
one answering another, and all making
vp that beautie: Their thoughts heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are grosse and confused, and their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is all for confusion: They disturbe
the order established of God, and deface
the beautie that commeth of it: And so
defraude other and themselues of that


<pb n="273" facs="tcp:26336:141"/>
fruite that God offereth in the wise ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of mankind.</p>
                     <p>But there is some in-equalitie in them,
for naturall giftes are sufficient Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for the ciuill callinges, but both the
naturall and ciuill giftes doe not so rule
the spirituall calling: God in things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
hath a more presse course, to lay
callinges on men, as they are naturally
gifted: But in Christianitie his worke
is more free, therein both the gift and
their place in Christ goe together, and
they haue no ground nor reason from
man, but onelie Gods most free dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
<hi>Consider your calling, not manie
mightie, not many noble according to the
flesh are called. 1. Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>The beste fruite of this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, to know our place in all these
three respects, and to vse it to the
good of mankinde: To bee thankfull
to God, who hath so many wayes bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vs, and so wee shall bee most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue
to our selfe, and others in all
these respects. As this third is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:26336:142"/>
than the other two, so is it the
right disposer of them, God craueth of
these lower respects, that all returne to
him, but the most part sticke on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and forget God: But this is the
blessing of <hi>Christianitie,</hi> that it maketh

and that is the <hi>Grace of Christ,</hi> and

true sanctification, the perfection of

                     <p>Reason is a sort of ground to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two; a solide wit is a good substance
both for Learning and Grace: Reason

it <hi>accessorielie</hi> and <hi>artificiallie;</hi> what
euer bee our naturall gifts, or ciuill cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
wee are the more enabled for them
by Learning, so a King gouerneth more
wisely, the Pastour teacheth the word
of God more skilfullie, the Lawer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
more pertinently: And the meanest
Callings are done more dexterouslie
by Learning.</p>
                     <p>But Grace enableth vs in both, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a <hi>transcendent</hi> perfection; the
former two may bee in Reprobates, and
though good in themselues yet hurtfull
to the possessour, &amp; his neighbour: Great
wit without Learning, is a good knife,
without a whetstone, &amp; learning without
solide judgement, is as the edge of glasse,
it is sharpe but in brittle mettell; &amp; wit,


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:26336:143"/>
and Learning without Grace, are a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
without a Soule, a carcase of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and a sharpe sword in the hand
of a mad ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They serue to deuise &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
euil, &amp; so to destroy the possessors.</p>
                     <p>Grace is merelie transcendent among
the blessings of God, it translateth from
Nature, and maketh <hi>vs partakers of the
Diuine Nature. 2. Pet. 1.</hi> Reason doth not
so farre exalt man aboue beasts, or letters
the learned aboue the vnlearned, as
Grace doeth the sanctified man aboue
them both: These other differences may
bee counted, but this of Grace is as farre
aboue them, as heauen aboue the earth.</p>
                     <p>Happie is the man whom God hath
blessed with sound <hi>Vnderstanding, light
of Learning; and life of Grace:</hi> All these
three Perfections doe meete together,
and rest in him, to his compleete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                     <p>All these deserue great respect, but
not all alike: And there is a great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of many heerein, Grace is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparablie
the most excellent, and


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:26336:143"/>
most to bee sought, yet least respected
of many. It is counted a common and
base thing, but the other are admired for
their supposed excellencie, yea, riches,
honour and the baggage of the world,
are counted more excellent, and sought
more than they all: The world euer
loueth that which is like it selfe, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liketh
true Grace.</p>
                     <p>But hee who hath the Grace of GOD,
surpasseth the Wretch, the Ambitious,
and the accomplished man in Nature

                     <p>The particular respect of Prouidence

rent: All beeing and businesse out of
him, is a vexation, and our greatest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is sweete by this onelie, that it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to him, and is acceptable to him.</p>
                     <p>God dwelleth in that Soule that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rest but in him; hee hath loued it
from eternall, and called it in time to
himselfe, that is so taken with him and
his delights: No rendeuous is so known
to any Creature, and vsed of it, as God
is to that Soule that resteth in him.</p>
                     <p>A proofe of this rest, is God resting
in vs: In all the world he found not rest
but in man: When he created the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and the Earth, all Beasts and Fowles,
he rested not til he created man, his <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi>


                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:26336:148"/>
his last Creature in worke, but
his first in affection, there hee rested as
in the end of his Creation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His delight is to dwell with men,</hi> and
among men with the godlie, for them
onely of all mankinde hath hee assumed
to union in Christ. If we find him dwell
in vs, then surely we dwell in him, &amp; we
may easilie know <hi>if Christ dwell in vs,
except we bee Reprobats. 2. Cor. 5.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is great wisdome in choosing the
best Lodging: We lodge now conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie
in our Bodie, but at Death it will
cast vs out, and the worlde our pleasant
House will decay: Wee rest now in our
contentmentes, but must flitte from
them.</p>
                     <p>But God can neither decay nor cast
vs out, and at Death wee shall still abide
in him: We neede not then flitte from
him, but ascend, and bee more joyned
to him: Wee cannot haue Tabernacles
heere, nor abide, no, not in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and growth of Grace, which is
now our contentment, but shall bee


<pb n="288" facs="tcp:26336:149"/>
receiued, and bide in euerlasting Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that are in him.</p>
                     <p>Man naturallie inclineth to two
things, his <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>end:</hi> His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
recalleth him by right of his <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall:</hi>
The fishes will visite the place
of their spawning yeerelie: And men
of an hurte health, returne to their
natiue soyle; as the aire which they took
in at their birth, gaue them the first out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
matter of their naturall Spirits, so
the vse of it may bring them backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to their first integritie: The end
calleth vs to it, by right of <hi>perfection:</hi>
the pryse of the runner, &amp; the house of
the Traueller are earnestlie desired. So is
it to the godly: Our beginning in Grace,
is in God: <hi>The Riuer of liuing waters
flowe out from the Sanctuarie, from vnder
the Throne of GOD, and the Lambe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Grace of election hath no latter
beginning than eternitie, nor lower dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
than heauen, and turneth vs vp to it
againe: The waters of life which Christ
giueth vs, shall bee <hi>a fountaine in our


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:26336:149"/>
bellie springing vp to life eternall.</hi> How
can it in our bellie spring vp to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall?
but because it lifteth our heartes
to GOD in Heauen.</p>
                     <p>The Soule which so adhereth to God,
is more in him, than in the body, which
it quickneth: both because it goeth glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
out of it selfe, to bee all in him; and
next, because it cannot dwell in it selfe,
but because of him; it can better dwell
among Monsters in the desert, that in it
selfe without him: And thirdlie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when it is lost in sinne and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
it seeketh and findeth it selfe more
in him, than in it selfe: When we may
say to him, <hi>O thou whom my Soule lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth!</hi>
All these sorts and degrees of
union with him are found.</p>
                     <p>The bosome of the mother is a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
rest to the Babe, both for sleepe in
health, &amp; recouerie in sweruing; that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
heate wherein it was formed, doth
kindlie cherish that life, that proceedeth
of it: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we lye alwayes in the bosome
of God, and are warmed by the sense


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:26336:150"/>
of that sauing loue in Christ, wee are
both sensible of the vertue of our begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and of the first fruites of our end.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Needle</hi> of the <hi>Dyall</hi> standeth
not but towards the <hi>Pole,</hi> so doeth the
godlie Soule to God. If the secret ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a small stone can so moue yron,
shall not the Rocke of Syon, Christ
Iesus, the <hi>Miracle of loue,</hi> drawe our
tender louing hearts vnto him. How se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curlie
shall wee contemne all other
things, and rest sweetlie content in him,
vnder the sense of this his drawing and
vniting vertue, expecting that happines,
which his sauing Loue procureth to his
Beloued: <hi>Returne now, O my Soule to
thy Rest, and abyde in it, for GOD hath
beene, and will bee for euer beneficiall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee. Psal. 116. 7. AMEN.</hi>

necessitie of so fraile things, and the
necessitie so great, that the paine of it is

vnpleasant to the integritie of it; yet
when I render my selfe to it, I embrace a

One dolour is a remeede to another do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
And all is but an off-putting for
a time. Mortalitie is so seased in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

in end a yeelding to Death. This is
the <hi>miserie of a mortall bodie</hi> in the circle
