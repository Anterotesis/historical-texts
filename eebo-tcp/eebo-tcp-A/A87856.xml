            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Many there be of deep Judgment, and ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that might have added luſtre to this action, and

            <p>Yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I may, and in the loweſt poſture of humility. I humbly beſeech your Sacred Majeſty to interpoſe your Royall Authority, to command a review of the houſe, for there were never more than now fitted for ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>

            <p>It pleaſeth not your Sacred Majeſty to vouchſafe a change.</p>
            <p>Actions of Kings are not to be by me reaſoned.</p>
            <p>Therefore being imboldened by this Gracious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, give me leave a little, Dread Soveraigne, to expreſſe my own thoughts unto our gracious Lord the King.</p>
            <p>I ſee before my eyes with admiration the Majeſty of great Brittaine, the Glory of times, the hiſtory of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt, in his forefront placed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of antiquity (Kings) ſetled by a long ſucceſſion, and continued to us by a pious and peacefull govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

            <p>On the other ſide, the hopes of poſterity, and joy of this Nation, thoſe Olive branches ſet round your tables, Emblems of peace to poſterity.</p>
            <p>Here ſhine thoſe Lights and Lamps placed in a Mount, which attend your ſacred Majeſty as ſupreme head, and borrow from you the Splendor of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>There the true ſtate of Nobility, figures of Proweſſe and Magnanimity, fitted by their long contracted ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in their blood, for the Councell of Princes.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of thoſe the Reverend Judges, whither both parts (as to the Oracles of Judgment and Juſtice) may reſort, Ciſterns that hold fair waters, wherein each deviation; each wrinckle is diſcernable, and from thence (as from the Center) each crooked line ought to be levelled; The footſtoole of your Throne is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, which renders you glorious to all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Here we the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes of the Commons houſe, at your royall feet, contracted from all parts of your Kingdom, Enſignes of obedience and humility, all theſe united by the law equally diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which cements this great body to the obedience of your Sacred Majeſty;</p>
            <p>And compells as well the hearts as the hands to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute for the preſervation of your Majeſty, and the Common intereſt,</p>

            <p>Amongſt theſe this great Councell is moſt Soveraign againſt the diſtempers of this Nation.</p>
            <p>Were they infeſted at Sea, troubled at home, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded from abroad, here was the Sanctuary of refuge, hither was the reſort, and no other way found for a foundation of peace.</p>
            <p>It is reported of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, that he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Subjects purſe his Exchequer, and ſo it is.</p>
            <p>Subtile inventions may pick the purſe, but nothing can open it but a free Parliament; which lets in the eye of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty upon the publique maladies of the state, and vigilancy for the preſervation of our ancient liberties; for this we need not ſearch into antiquity, look but a little back, there we ſhall ſee our juſt liberties gratiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed by your moſt ſacred Majeſty,</p>

            <p>Thoſe gratious expreſſions lately fal'n from your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred lips, as hony from the combe, make glad the hearts of your people.</p>
            <p>So that now we do more then promiſe to our ſelves a large and free conſideration of the wayes to compoſe the diſtempers of theſe Kingdomes, and then preſent them to your royall hand for perfection.</p>
            <p>And ſuch ſhall be our deportment, that as we ſhall labour the continuance of our liberties, ſo ſhall we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a high regard to preſerve that Soveraigne power wherewith your Majeſty is inveſted for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Kingdome, and to render your ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

            </p>
            <p>Are theſe the fruits we have enjoyed by Parliaments? we cannot then but wonder at that horrid invention in this place projected, <hi>Monſtrum horrendum, informe, ingens</hi> but the Lord be thanked, <hi>Cui lumen ademptum eſt.</hi> Can this receive a <hi>Palliation?</hi> Men, Fathers, and Brethren, and all at one blaſt; no reverence to ſacred Bones of Princes? were we not all in a lump by them intended to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to <hi>Moloch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us never forget this days ſolemnization (But whither?) It is too much boldneſs to preſume longer on your Majeſties grace and goodneſſe; and therefore for the better expedition of this ſervice; We humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;</p>
