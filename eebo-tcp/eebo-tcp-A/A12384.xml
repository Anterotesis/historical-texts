            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my beloved brethren in the faith and fellowship of the Gospell in all places specially those my native countrymen resident in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam, grace and peace from our God in Christ.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloved the Scripture tells us that while the Ark of God taryed in Kiriath-jearim, the time being long (for it was twenty years) all Jsraell lamented after the Lord <hi>1. Sam. 7. 2.</hi> The same affections me thinks I perceive in manie of you, even for the sundry years absence of the Lords ministers, wherby our comfortable portion in the Lords house is greatly lessened, for being left now as sheep upon the bare commons, I fear we may truely cry with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>My leannes, my leannes,</hi> and with all being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times hurryed and torn with the loud out cryes, and hard handling of furious and unmercifull spirits, who under pretence of godly zeal and hatred against sin, ungodlily massacre the true &amp; living members of Christs body, and by pulling out the squared living stones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
<pb facs="tcp:16423:3"/>
the fall of the house. And herewith consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what reproach not onely our selves, but also the truth it self sustains by reason of such courses, for now the wayes of Syon mourn, in that few or none come to her solemnityes so that we may truely take up that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Prophet <hi>Lament. 1. 8. Ierusalem hath greivously sinned, therefore shee is in derision: all that honoured her, despise her, because they have seene her filthines: yea, she sigheth and turneth backeward.</hi> And besides all this, the vigilant adversary is as forward to discourage and dishearten us by slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our holy practise with scisme and profanesse. Who duely weighing these things brethren ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> refraine pitying us as our saviour Christ did <hi>the multitude, because they were dispersed, and scattered abroad, as sheepe having no shepheard.</hi> But this being now toward the end or last dayes, love in men towards others is growen cold, every man seeking his own and not that that is Christs, Therefore brethren let us at last learn to be wise for our selves, in weighing the daunger of biting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring one another which tends to the consuming one of another <hi>Gallat. 5. 15.</hi> Let us hereafter study to be quiet. <hi>1. Thess. 4. 11.</hi> and if any yet lust to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, we must answere with the same Apostle, We have no such custom. <hi>1. Cor. 11. 16.</hi> And touching those that seeme to be possessed with Diotrephes spirit, who are unwearyed to prate against us with malicious words, &amp; not therwith content thrust them out of the Church that
<pb facs="tcp:16423:3"/>
witnes for us, and testify against their iniquitye, what shall I say of them (since they reject the word of God, and all wholsom counsell for their amendement, contrary to the very letter of the <hi>38.</hi> Article of our published confession of faith) but onely leave them to the Lord who onely hath power to change them or cutt them of. In the mean time read &amp; consider that affectionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of the Apostle <hi>Rom. 16. 17.</hi> Now I beseech you brethren mark them diligently which cause division and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoyd them, for they that are such serve not the Lord Jesus Christ but themselves. Yet least they should take themselves hereby to be wronged if nothing be said farther, amongst the manie evills done us, I have thought fitting to give the Christian reader a tast of some, to will them in the fear of God to consider their waies in their hearts, and judge without partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity their courses by the law of God, so may they soone see, how injuriously and irregularly they have walked ever since the death of our wise, faithfull, and honoured guides, who spake enough to declare our daunger, and the means (through Gods blessing) to avoid it, for who can forget those oft pressed speaches of our Teacher upon his death bed when he earnestly exhorted even to his last breath, to Christian moderation in the affaires of the Church, as the main thing wherein our tranquilly would consist, and he had greate reason to urge it upon some, because manie yeares experience bad taught him
<pb facs="tcp:16423:4"/>
how feirce, unadvised, &amp; preposterous he had found some (to be left now in main trust as the principall) from time to time, in kindling fire that their wisedom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing found work enough to quench. And the last deceassed Elder that best knew him that was principally aymed at, said in direct words, that it would never be well with the Church while it was guided by a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers head, &amp; who can deny his words to be true hitherto, nay let even himself and his privy counsellours speak, whether in their firey zeale they did not instantly so far forget our Teachers counsell for moderation, that they sought up and forced into the Church new causlesse trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles contrary to the Law &amp; Gospell, as the Church of Leyden plainly proved to them, &amp; contrary to the very letter of the <hi>8.</hi> Position of our Apologie.</p>
            <p>For when even in a meere matter of advise (desired of us by another Church) the Church here had come to a peacable conclusion to the content of ech part that differed in matter of judgment, and that the Elder had solemnly promised to write a letter accordingly, certain discontented brethren made a meeting to change that solemn agreement of the Church, the Elder consenting &amp; acting with them, which he bringing and reading to the Church, it was instantly blamed in the Elder, for writing contrary to the Churches joynt agreement, and his own promise, and so he was turned back (after much striving by him &amp; his confederats, who were afterwards discovered as guitly of that they unjustly had censured
<pb facs="tcp:16423:4"/>
others for) &amp; willed to write the first peacable agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the church might not be farther troubled, but in soms absence (minded chief) the next Lords day, there was advantage taken of the time, &amp; the letter brought again unaltered in the least, and by a strong and violent hand those manie masters then so far prevailed against those that pressed the former conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the letter was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to by the Church to be sent away as it was, onely crossing out my name, because I could be no testimonie, in that my name was produced for, and now the Church was so transported, that they refused so much as to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy under their letter, either that some brethren were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering minded thereto, or to take the advise of the Church of Leyden that were joyntly interessed with them.</p>
            <p>But farther here was another thing yet worse, for either the Elder alone, or these privy counsellers with him, stood not to this second agreement the Church made, but wrote another with alterations, additions, and diminishings besides the Churches knowledge or consent, &amp; sent it for the Churches minde and acte; yet behold the other brethren that never saw or heard this newe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged letter, till near two years after they were cast out of the Church (which was dispatched in hast, even in <hi>14.</hi> dayes time least they should bee prevented) upon the very suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that a few of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> met to write to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradict the Churches action, in hir letter of advise, by the sole, yet false, information of the Elder, two of them were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled out, and selected from the rest, and produced to the
<pb facs="tcp:16423:5"/>
Church for evill, which yet the informer professed, that the thing informed and accused, might be holy just, and good, for ought he knew, yet being desirous to get matter, the matter was prosecuted in the Church by interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toryes to finde out sin, which the brethren testifyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, as contrary to the law of love which thinks no evill, &amp; rule of Christ <hi>Matth. 18.</hi> Yet offred they the suspected act to sight &amp; correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherin soever it should be found amisse, and with all protesting solemnly they had neither done the thing so suspected, nor intended it; &amp; yet behold the brethren were cast out without the knowledge of sin or due dealing for sin, save that for refusing to answere intrapping demaunds, which they urged submission unto as Gods word &amp; Christs govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were Consured as contemners of both, and the maintenance of this both Elders &amp; Church are now so wedded to, that the chief of them blush not to affirm, that rather then they will goe back from what they have done herein, they will goe on in it, yea though two of them doe not remain together. And yet who sees not their palpable grosse partiallity in sparing their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding favourites in matters of scandalous and evill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, least their evill combination be weakened, discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or broken. Oh how much better were it they would ceasse to abound in their own sence, and take counsell from such as in the fear of God are both able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to direct them better. O that they would learn to be wise at the last, so through the good hand of our God
<pb facs="tcp:16423:5"/>
there might be some recovery of what is lost. Whereas now their irregular proceedings have made our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in all places to hang down their heads, as they have been plainly certifyed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sundry Churches. Now from these and the like offences divers that were of us turn their backs upon us, and betake themselves to live at large, as if now the doore of indifferency or liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme were sett open, that it matters not whom they hear, or where they walk, anie where or no where, and measuring these mens sins with others they think they can hardly goe to worse: And whence riseth all this, &amp; much more of the like, but even for the want of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pastors and Teachers, and godly discreet and able guides or Rulers in the Church? but what hope of ever such worthyes coming in, when there is such an hideous noyse in the house, by such unruly masters which cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly smite some, wound others, &amp; cast their dear brethren out at the windowes. Hence come familyes to be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the loving husband from his beloved wife, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate parents from their dear Children, hence come familyes to be spoyled by remissnes in neglect, nay, in utter laying aside of joynt family dutyes; the new vessels want their seasoning, the tender plants their due wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and so become barren before their full growth. So that we may justly take up the complaint of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakuk 1. 2. 3. 4. Oh Lord how long shall I cry and thou will not heare! even cry out to thee for violence and thou will not help! Why dost thou</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16423:6"/>
               <hi>shew me iniquity, &amp; cause me to behold sorrow? for spoyling and violence are before mee: and there are that raise up strife and contention,</hi> &amp;c. Oh consider this ye that are so bent to spoyling, repent and turn in time, least the <hi>living stones</hi> crying in the wall of the spirituall house, the <hi>corner stone</hi> be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and fall upon you and grind you to peeces. But I desire your conversion and not subversion, if the will of the Lord so be, though ye have been bold to vent your worst you can imagine against me upon all occasions, and for your presumptuous determining my eternall estate, the Lord forgive you. If you please to read what is here writt, I hope through the Lord it may turn your courses, that ye may see your duty is to build and not to destroy. They were the instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s our late faithfull Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher M. Aynsworth, delivered to us all, the last time he ever executed his ministery with us, which was at such a time as his bodye &amp; naturall strength were so decayed, that he wanted (as ye know) ability to come up again, even that very Lords day in the afternoone as his usuall manner was, wherein his faithfullnes may be seen even to his last gasp, in striving to feed the flocke even when the hand of God was heavy upon him in that sore perplexing and tedious disease of the stone, of which in a few dayes after he dyed, yet since even in his strong paines (that sometime by reason of the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity caused a stay of speach, to the griefe of the hearers and beholders) he was delivered of this, as the last fruit
<pb facs="tcp:16423:6"/>
of his ministery, let the Israell of God love it as Iacob did Benjamin the dear sonne of his beloved wife, of whom she dyed. It is not for nothing that the Holy Ghost expressly tells us. These be the last words of David <hi>2. Sam. 23. 1.</hi> Give me leave therefore (though not to call you together as Iacob did his sons when he was to deliver his last words to them <hi>Gen. 49.)</hi> yet to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to read what our loving Teacher as a father spake in his charge last to us. And though some or the most of you heard them sett out in the lively voyce Gods solemn ordinance of preaching, yet let it not greive you, that I write to you some of the same things, so farr as my slow hand could extend to compasse, the fullnes of his words I professe not to report, no nor yet the summe or substance of every thing he hence delivered, no nor yet have I published things so well as J might have done, had I sett upon the work to write it out fair instantly, while things were green in my own &amp; others memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, but now these notes having layen by me near 8. years before I sett upon this resolution, it is more defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive then is requisite for the report of a work of so able and faithfull a man, yet I trust none will be offended at me for this my service of love, since if ought shall be found amisse, I am willing the blame lye upon my misunderstanding or forgetfullnes, and so let him be free, who ever approved himself in his ministery to every mans conscience. Besides, had I been exact in taking, yet considering his condition at the time of the delivery,
<pb facs="tcp:16423:7"/>
it is not probable to come so refined to satisfy this curious carping age, whom nothing almost pleaseth, but novelly garnished with humane art. But as the contents of the sermon tend not that way, so neither doe J passe to please the world herein. My chief drift is, to commend the remembrance both of the person and work, that ye may be affected with the dayes of old, when we went together to the house of God with joy, as those that keep a feast, that so we may resolve with the Prophet <hi>Esai. 62. 1. 6. 7.</hi> Not to hold our tongues for Ierusalems sake, nor give the Lord rest till he repaire and set it up, that so the righteousnes thereof may break forth as the light, and salvation thereof as a burning lamp. I end with the heavenly words uttered when our great and good shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd came into the world. <hi>Luk. 2. 14.</hi> Glory to God in the highest, &amp; on earth peace, good will toward men.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He purpose of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in these words and those following, is to exhort all Christians to the encrease of faith and holines of life. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before mentioned the bounty of our Lord Iesus Christ, who hath affoarded the sincere milk of his Word, that they might grow thereby: Now because Paul may plant, &amp; Appollos <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 5. 6</note> may water, but it is onely God that gives
<pb facs="tcp:16423:8"/>
the encrease, he doth therby lead them to the Lord Iesus Christ, who hath so provided for his newborn babes that they may have wherewith to grow up.</p>
            <p>First he speaks of coming to Christ, describing him <hi>a living stone</hi> as he is els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where called <hi>the chiefe corner stone</hi> in this building, upon whom all the people of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 22.</note> God ought to rely, he being then the chief corner stone, notwithstanding he be disalowed of men, yet to God he is <hi>elect and precious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first duty the Holy Ghost here teacheth us is, That we should be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to get faith and holines in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which we doe obtain by coming to Christ: secondly we are next to come to his house, that is, to become members of his visible Church. Now we come to Christ first by his call of us by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his word, as Christ saith <hi>Come</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28</note> 
               <hi>to mee, &amp;c.</hi> secondly by the drawing of the father. So that there are two waies or <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 44.</note> means to come to Christ, the one is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the other inward, the first is the Word, the second is the Spirit, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading our hearts and bringing us to the obedience of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16423:8"/>
Next we are to consider from what we are called, namely from that that is by nature sinfull, from our sinfull estate, secondly whereto we are called, that is, to Christ, that we may become living stones, to be built <hi>a spirituall house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ is called a living stone as having life in himself, and giving life to his <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. 26 &amp; 1. 4.</note> church, he is called the chief corne stone in way of similitude; for as the corner stone to the building, is to joyn the walls together, so Christ is to the whole Church, he joyns all his, both Iewes and Gentiles into one spirituall house. Again he is called a stone in respect of his firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of grace given of God by him; so that all that are built upon him, are as a <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 24. 25. &amp; 26.</note> house built upon a rock which stands sure against all assaults, opposed by our Saviour to an house built upon the sand which falls when tempestuous assaults come: so is it with us, we have a firm foundation which is Gods decree, his love stablished to us in Christ.</p>
            <p>Is Christ then such a firm and sure foundation, it is for the exceeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <note place="margin">Vse.</note> of all his people, that however they be opposed by the world and satan yet
<pb facs="tcp:16423:9"/>
they shall remain firm for ever, the gates of hell shall never prevaile against them. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again hath Christ life not onely for himself but for us, this is to shew us our <note place="margin">Vse.</note> dutyes that we carry our selves as living stones in his spirituall house which is his Church, he that is Christs must be a new creature, by faith he must put on Christ, for unlesse we come to Christ by faith, we shall depart from him without fruit: and by these severall comparisons laid down in scripture we are to know the grace of Christ is sett forth to us. He is a living stone and he makes us living stones, he gives life to the whole bodye.</p>
            <p>He is called also living bread, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever eate him (that is beleeve in him) shall live by him, if anie man eate of this bread he shall live for ever. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. 50. 51.</note>
            </p>
            <p>He is called the vine and we the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he that abides in him brings forth fruite, but without him we can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15. 5.</note> by him alone we bring forth fruit, and expect salvation in the day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Disalowed of men.)</hi> First this was in his own person when he was here, so also in his after. In himself, in that he had
<pb facs="tcp:16423:9"/>
neither house nor home; for he was a carpenter &amp; brought up without schoole learning, and because of his base and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 3.</note> lowe estate, he was despised and men regarded him not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Iewes were crossed in their errour, while they expected salvation by the works of the law, but he declares, if they will have salvation they must <note place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. Christ came preaching the death <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23.</note> of the crosse, which to the Gentiles is foolishnes, and in respect of his plain &amp; simple administration of the Gospell, for these causes he may be said to be disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of men.</p>
            <p>This is spoken to comfort us against <note place="margin">Vse.</note> the scandall of the crosse, when we see he is rejected of the world not onely in himself, but in his servants, Is Christ then not respected? let us not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for Christ was to enter into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26</note> by suffring, let us then willingly endure despising here, that we may have glory in the life to come, for this cause <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:16423:10"/>
are we to arm our selves against the temptations of this world, because if the maister of the house was thus entreated and disalowed of men, we his seruants <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 24. 25.</note> must not murmure if we drink also of the same cup, therefore we are not to think that the Kingdom of Christ here <note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 36.</note> is a pompous outward Kingdom, but it consists in righteousnes peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, and those that are his <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17</note> subjects must be meeke and humble; and therefore let all take heed that they be not offended at Christs meannesse, nor <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 29.</note> yet stumble at the afflictions that come for his sake.</p>
            <p>The 3. thing, <hi>(elect of God and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.)</hi> Whence we may observe, how opposite the actions of God and men are, men make no accompt of Christ, but count him vile, but God honours and preferres him, it is prophecyed of him that he should grow as a branch out of a dry ground, so saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Esaie of him, and David com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares him to a worme and no man, <note place="margin">

            <p>In that Christ is elect and we in him, <note place="margin">Vse.</note> it is to shew the assurance of salvation by Christ, as Christ dyed and went to glory, so shall we also, even as God did regard him as his onely begotten <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>(Ye also as livinge stones are builte up a Spirituall House.)</hi> As in the first place we said, it is not enough to come to Christ in our persons, but we must adjoyn to his Church, so now we must not content our selves with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall good, but we must seek farther
<pb facs="tcp:16423:11"/>
perfection to becom members of his visible Church, It is not lawfull for Christians to wander in the world or to live alone, nor to adjoyn themselves in communion with false Churches, but as it is in the Acts, <hi>The Lord added to the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Church such as should be saved,</hi> unto this estate all are bound to come, and so to be made pertakers of all Christs graces, who couples all the bodye together, for this cause are they called living stones in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude from the stones of the temple co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pacted into one bodye, but the stones of the Temple were liveles, these living, and herein they differ. As the first Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was a figure of Christ, so also it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed all the bodye of the faithfull, who <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 21.</note> make all one house, over which Christ is set. If we then be his house let us hold fast our rejoycing to the end.</p>
            <p>Moreover although those stones in that first Temple built by Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 8. 10.</note> life, yet God tooke possession of it; and dwelt in the middest of it, how much more with them that are a temple joyned together of living stones.</p>
            <p>Now as this is for incouragement to <note place="margin">Vse.</note> all to become members of his Church,
<pb facs="tcp:16423:11"/>
so also it sheweth who are the fit mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church, even those one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that are living stones.</p>
            <p>And in that the members of the Church ought to be living stones, it should teach us, not to be idle in good <note place="margin">Vse.</note> works, faith without works is dead, <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>We are therefore to bee carefull that <note place="margin">Vse.</note> the graces of God be not received in us
<pb facs="tcp:16423:12"/>
in vaine, but that we grow in grace in faith and holines, that we may be built up <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18.</note> an holy house &amp; habitation by his spirit.

            <p>There is all waies an end of building, as the Apostle saith <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. The whole church is built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Iesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone, in whom all the building is coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 1. groweth to be an holy temple in Lord, wherby the holy Ghost shews, the state of the Church figured by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

            <p>Thus being the temple of God, we may build upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Lords <note place="margin">Vse.</note> promise of dwelling amongst us, as it is <note place="margin">
