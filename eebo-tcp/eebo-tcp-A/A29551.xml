            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE laſt Seſſions of Parliament I preſented the Members of this Honourable Houſe with a Treatiſe, Intituled, <hi>A Diſcourſe on the late Funds;</hi> wherein were Propoſals for a <hi>National Land-Bank</hi> to be under the Government of 4 Commiſſioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the King, 6 Commiſſioners by the Lords, and 10 by the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and 25 Directors to be choſen by the Subſcribers to the Bank: A third Edition of which being reprinted, I do purpoſe to preſent ſuch of the Members of this Honourable Houſe therewith, who will be pleaſed to accept of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The main Objection I could hear that was made againſt my then Propoſals, was obliging Perſons to take Bills of Credit in Paiment, having double the Value in good Land-Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to indemnify the Perſon who ſhould receive the ſame; which Objection I notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding anſwered in ſeveral places of the ſaid Treatiſe. But finding it difficult to perſwade Gentlemen to cloſe therewith, I have ſince opened Books, and received Subſcriptions of Land and Money to a conſiderable Value, that there may not be Money wanting to circulate or pay ſuch Bills that ſhall be iſſued out upon the Security of ſuch Land: and the Committee of this Honourable Houſe being of opinion that a <hi>National Land-Bank</hi> ſhould be ſettled, I do here humbly preſent this Honourable Houſe with</p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſhort</hi> Scheme <hi>or</hi> Propoſals <hi>for a</hi> National Land-Bank.</p>
               <p>THat Books be laid open to receive Subſcriptions of the Owners or Proprietors of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Value of 4 Millions, one <hi>4th</hi> part of which Yearly Eſtates, together with 2 Millions in Money, to be the Fund of the Bank.</p>
               <p>That the bare Subſcriptions of ſuch Eſtates ſhall oblige ſuch one quarter part of the Value of every of thoſe Eſtates to be ſubject to a proportionable part of the Loſs, and intituled to a like Proportion of the Profits of the ſaid Bank, <hi>viz.</hi> every 100 <hi>l. per annum</hi> ſhall divide againſt 500 in Money. But that the ſaid Subſcriptions ſhall not prejudice any Perſons Right who ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have a better Title than the Subſcriber, but only ſubject ſuch Eſtates to the Bank; which will be for the Advantage of the rightful Owners or Proprietors.</p>
               <p>That every ſuch Subſcriber of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after their Eſtates ſhall have been ſubſcribed 6 Months, and their Titles ſhall be examined and approved by the Counſel of the Bank, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on the Bank, may have three fifth parts of the Value of ſuch Eſtate lent him, <hi>viz.</hi> upon 100 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> 1200 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, at 3 <hi>l.</hi> 00 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d. per cent. per annum</hi> Intereſt.</p>
               <p>And, that none may ſettle or take up Money upon any Eſtate who hath no Right ſo to do, every Eſtate is to be entered in a General Office in <hi>London,</hi> and in a particular Office to be kept in the County where ſuch Eſtate lies, where any Perſon may put in their Claim, or enter their Caveat (for the ſpace of 6 Months after ſuch Entry) againſt the Settlement thereof, and publick Notice ſhall be given of every intended Settlement, before the ſaid Eſtate ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be ſettled.</p>
               <p>That if any Subſcriber of Land ſhall deſire to withdraw his Eſtate after it is ſettled, he ſhall be permitted ſo to do, paying into the Stock of the Bank one fourth Part of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of ſuch his Eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> 500 <hi>l.</hi> for 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and from thenceforth he ſhall be eſteemed to be a Money-Subſcriber.</p>
               <p>That every ſubſcriber of Money ſhall have 4 <hi>l. per Cent. per Ann.</hi> for his Money, paid out of the Treaſury of the Bank, before any Dividend ſhall be made of the Profits in lieu of the Rent the landed Man receives of his Tenants; and after that, the Account of Profit and Loſs ſhall be ſtated, and the landed and monied Men ſhall divide accordingly.</p>
               <p>That any other landed Man, whoſe Eſtate ſhall not be ſettled in the Fund of the <hi>Bank,</hi> may have 1500 <hi>l.</hi> upon 100 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> Land, at 3 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per Cent. per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Means, Eſtates in Land may be preſently ſubjected to be a Fund of the <hi>Bank.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The monied Men ſhall have a Rent from the <hi>Bank,</hi> as the landed Man has from his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</p>
               <p>The landed and monied Men will both alike be concern'd in the management and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſaid <hi>Bank;</hi> and therefore it cannot be doubted but ſuch landed Men will take care of the Intereſt of the Freeholder.</p>
               <p>No Perſon's Right can be prejudiced hereby; nor his Eſtate be kept in the <hi>Bank</hi> longer than he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>The Propoſer has a much larger and perfecter Scheme ready, and is prepared to anſwer all Objections that can be made, whenſoever commanded by your Honours ſo to do.</p>
